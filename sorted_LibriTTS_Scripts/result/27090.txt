highest expression It is a sad but inevitable commentary on our civilization that so far as the sea is concerned it has developed from its infancy down to a century or so ago under one phase or another of piracy If men were savages on land they were doubly so at sea and all the years of maritime adventure years that added to the map of the world till there was little left to discover could not wholly eradicate the piratical germ It went out gradually with the settlement and ordering of the far flung British colonies Great Britain foremost of sea powers must be credited with doing more both directly and indirectly for the abolition of crime and disorder on the high seas than any other force But the conquest was not complete till the advent of steam which chased the sea rover into the farthest corners of his domain It is said that he survives even today in certain spots in the Chinese waters but he is certainly an innocuous relic A pirate of any sort would be as great a curiosity today if he could be caught and exhibited as a fabulous monster The fact remains and will always persist that in the lore of the sea he is far and away the most picturesque figure and the more genuine and gross his career the higher degree of interest does he inspire There may be a certain human perversity in this for the pirate was unquestionably a bad man at his best or worst considering his surroundings and conditions undoubtedly the worst man that ever lived There is little to soften the dark yet glowing picture of his exploits But again it must be remembered that not only does the note of distance subdue and even lend a certain enchantment to the scene but the effect of contrast between our peaceful times and his own contributes much to deepen our interest in him Perhaps it is this latter added to that deathless spark in the human breast that glows at the tale of adventure which makes him the kind of hero of romance that he is today He is undeniably a redoubtable historical figure It is a curious fact that the commerce of the seas was cradled in the lap of buccaneering The constant danger of the deeps in this form only made hardier mariners out of the merchant adventurers actually stimulating and strengthening maritime enterprise Buccaneering which is only a politer term for piracy thus became the high romance of the seas during the great centuries of maritime adventure It went hand in hand with discovery they were in fact almost inseparable Most of the mighty mariners from the days of Leif the Discoverer through those of the redoubtable Sir Francis Drake down to our own Paul Jones answer to the roll call It was a bold hardy world this of ours up to the advent of our giant servant Steam every foot of which was won by fierce conquest of one sort or another Out of this past the pirate emerges as a romantic even at times heroic figure This final niche despite his crimes cannot altogether be denied him A hero he is and will remain so long as tales of the sea are told So have at him in these pages JOSEPH LEWIS FRENCH CONTENTS PAGE The Piccaroon one From Tom Cringle s Log By MICHAEL SCOTT The Capture of Panama

and were lounging about one forenoon on the fortifications looking with sickening hearts out to seaward when a voice struck up the following negro ditty close to us Fader was a Corramantee Moder was a Mingo Black picaniny buccra wantee So dem sell a me Peter by jingo Jiggery jiggery jiggery Well sung Massa Bungo exclaimed mister Splinter where do you hail from my hearty Hillo Bungo indeed free and easy dat anyhow Who you yousef eh Why Peter continued the lieutenant don t you know me Cannot say dat I do rejoined the negro very gravely without lifting his head as he sat mending his jacket in one of the embrasures near the water gate of the arsenal Hab not de honour of your acquaintance sir He then resumed his scream for song it could not be called Mammy Sally s daughter Lose him shoe in an old canoe Dat lay half full of water And den she knew not what to do Jiggery jig Confound your jiggery jiggery sir But I know you well enough my man and you can scarcely have forgotten Lieutenant Splinter of the Torch one would think However it was clear that the poor fellow really had not known us for the name so startled him that in his hurry to unlace his legs from under him as he sat tailor fashion he fairly capsized out of his perch and toppled down on his nose a feature fortunately so flattened by the hand of nature that I question if it could have been rendered more obtuse had he fallen out of the maintop on a timber head or a marine officer s Eh no yes him sure enough and who is de picaniny hofficer Oh I see Massa Tom Cringle Garamighty gentlemen where have you drop from Where is de old Torch Many a time hab I Peter Mangrove pilot to Him Britannic Majesty squadron taken de old brig in and through amongst de keys at Port Royal Ay and how often did you scour her copper against the coral reefs Peter His Majesty s pilot gave a knowing look and laid his hand on his breast No more of dat if you love me massa Well well it don t signify now my boy she will never give you that trouble again foundered all hands lost Peter but the two you see before you Werry sorry Massa Plinter werry sorry What de black cook s mate and all But misfortune can t be help Stop till I put up my needle and I will take a turn wid you Here he drew himself up with a great deal of absurd gravity Proper dat British hofficer in distress should assist one anoder we shall consult togeder How can I serve you Why Peter if you could help us to a passage to Port Royal it would be serving us most essentially When we used to be lying there a week seldom passed without one of the squadron arriving from this but here have we been for more than a month without a single pennant belonging to the station having looked in our money is running short and if we are to hold on in Carthagena for another six weeks we shall not have a shot left in the locker not a copper to tinkle on a tombstone The negro looked steadfastly at us then carefully around There was no one near You see Massa Plinter I am desirable to serve you for one little reason of my own but beside dat it is good for me at present to make some friend wid de hofficer of de squadron being as how dat I am absent widout leave Oh I perceive a large R against your name in the master attendant s books eh You have hit it sir werry close besides I long mosh to return to my poor wife Nancy Cator dat I leave wagabone dat I is just about to be confine I could not resist putting in my oar I saw Nancy just before we sailed Peter fine child that not quite so black as you though Oh massa said Snowball grinning and showing his white teeth you know I am soch a terrible black fellow But you are a leetle out at present massa I meant about to be confine in de work house for stealing de admiral s Muscovy ducks and he laughed loud and long However if you will promise dat you will stand my friends I will put you in de way of getting a shove across to de east end of Jamaica and I will go wid you too for company Thank you rejoined mister Splinter but how do you mean to manage this There is no Kingston trader here at present and you don t mean to make a start of it in an open boat do you No sir I don t but in de first place as you are a gentleman will you try and get me off when we get to Jamaica Secondly will you promise dat you will not seek to know more of de vessel you may go in nor of her crew than dey are willing to tell you provided you are landed safe Why Peter I scarcely think you would deceive us for you know I saved your bacon in that awkward affair when through drunkenness you plumped the Torch ashore so Forget dat sir forget dat Never shall poor black pilot forget how you saved him from being seized up when de gratings boatswain s mates and all were ready at de gangway never shall poor black rascal forget dat Indeed I do not think you would wittingly betray us into trouble Peter and as I guess you mean one of the forced traders we will venture in her rather than kick about here any longer and pay a moderate sum for our passage Den wait here five minute and so saying he slipped down through the embrasure into a canoe that lay beneath and in a trice we saw him jump on board of a long low nondescript kind of craft that lay moored within pistol shot of the walls She was a large shallow vessel coppered to the bends of great breadth of beam with bright sides like an American so painted as to give her a clumsy mercantile sheen externally but there were many things that belied this to a nautical eye her copper for instance was bright as burnished gold on her very sharp bows and beautiful run and we could see from the bastion where we stood that her decks were flush and level She had no cannon mounted that were visible but we distinguished grooves on her well scrubbed decks as from the recent traversing of carronade slides while the bolts and rings in her high and solid bulwarks shone clear and bright in the ardent noontide There was a tarpaulin stretched over a quantity of rubbish old sails old junk and hencoops rather ostentatiously piled up forward which we conjectured might conceal a long gun She was a very taught rigged hermaphrodite or brig forward and schooner aft Her foremast and bowsprit were immensely strong and heavy and her mainmast was so long and tapering that the wonder was how the few shrouds and stays about it could support it it was the handsomest stick we had ever seen Her upper spars were on the same scale tapering away through topmast topgallant mast royal and skysail masts until they fined away into slender wands The sails that were loose to dry were old and patched and evidently displayed to cloak the character of the vessel by an ostentatious show of their unserviceable condition but her rigging was beautifully fitted every rope lying in the chafe of another being carefully served with hide There were several large bushy whiskered fellows lounging about the deck with their hair gathered into dirty net bags like the fishermen of Barcelona many had red silk sashes round their waists through which were stuck their long knives in shark skin sheaths Their numbers were not so great as to excite suspicion but a certain daring reckless manner would at once have distinguished them independently of anything else from the quiet hard worked red shirted merchant seaman That chap is not much to be trusted said the lieutenant his bunting would make a few jackets for Joseph I take it But we had little time to be critical before our friend Peter came paddling back with another blackamoor in the stern of as ungainly an exterior as could well be imagined He was a very large man whose weight every now and then as they breasted the short sea cocked up the snout of the canoe with Peter Mangrove in it as if he had been a cork leaving him to flourish his paddle in the air like the weather wheel of a steam boat in a sea way The new comer was strong and broad shouldered with long muscular arms and a chest like Hercules but his legs and thighs were for his bulk remarkably puny and misshapen A thick fell of black wool in close tufts as if his face had been stuck full of cloves covered his chin and upper lip and his hair if hair it could be called was twisted into a hundred short plaits that bristled out and gave his head when he took his hat off the appearance of a porcupine There was a large saber cut across his nose and down his cheek and he wore two immense gold earrings His dress consisted of short cotton drawers that did not reach within two inches of his knee leaving his thin cucumber shanks on which the small bullet like calf appeared to have been stuck before through mistake in place of abaft naked to the shoe a check shirt and an enormously large Panama hat made of a sort of cane split small and worn shovel fashion Notwithstanding he made his bow by no means ungracefully and offered his services in choice Spanish but spoke English as soon as he heard who we were Pray sir are you the master of that vessel said the lieutenant No sir I am the mate and I learn you are desirous of a passage to Jamaica This was spoken with a broad Scotch accent Yes we are said I in very great astonishment but we will not sail with the devil and who ever saw a negro Scotchman before the spirit of Nicol Jarvie conjured into a blackamoor s skin The fellow laughed I am black as you see so were my father and mother before me And he looked at me as much as to say I have read the book you quote from But I was born in the good town of Port Glasgow notwithstanding and many a voyage I have made as cabin boy and cook in the good ship the Peggy Bogle with worthy old Jock Hunter but that matters not I was told you wanted to go to Jamaica I dare say our captain will take you for a moderate passage money But here he comes to speak for himself Captain Vanderbosh here are two shipwrecked British officers who wish to be put on shore on the east end of Jamaica will you take them and what will you charge for their passage The man he spoke to was nearly as tall as himself he was a sunburnt angular raw boned iron visaged veteran with a nose in shape and color like the bowl of his own pipe but not at all according to the received idea like a Dutchman His dress was quizzical enough white trousers a long flapped embroidered waistcoat that might have belonged to a Spanish grandee with an old fashioned French cut coat showing the frayed marks where the lace had been stripped off voluminous in the skirts but very tight in the sleeves which were so short as to leave his large bony paws and six inches of his arm above the wrist exposed altogether it fitted him like a purser s shirt on a hand spike Vy for von hondred thaler I will land dem safe in Mancheoneal Bay but how shall ve manage Villiamson De cabin vas point yesterday The Scotch negro nodded Never mind I dare say the smell of the paint won t signify to the gentlemen The bargain was ratified we agreed to pay the stipulated sum and that same evening having dropped down with the last of the sea breeze we set sail from Bocca Chica and began working up under the lee of the headland of Punto Canoa When off the San Domingo Gate we burned a blue light which was immediately answered by another in shore of us In the glare we could perceive two boats full of men Any one who has ever played at snapdragon can imagine the unearthly appearance of objects when seen by this species of firework In the present instance it was held aloft on a boat hook and cast a strong spectral light on the band of lawless ruffians who were so crowded together that they entirely filled the boats no part of which could be seen It seemed as if two clusters of fiends suddenly vomited forth from hell were floating on the surface of the midnight sea in the midst of brimstone flames In a few moments our crew was strengthened by about forty as ugly Christians as I ever set eyes on They were of all ages countries complexions and tongues and looked as if they had been kidnapped by a pressgang as they had knocked off from the Tower of Babel From the moment they came on board Captain Vanderbosh was shorn of all his glory and sank into the petty officer while to our amazement the Scottish negro took the command evincing great coolness energy and skill He ordered the schooner to be wore as soon as we had shipped the men and laid her head off the land then set all hands to shift the old suit of sails and to bend new ones Why did you not shift your canvas before we started said I to the Dutch captain or mate or whatever he might be Vy vont you be content to take a quiet passage and hax no question was the uncivil rejoinder which I felt inclined to resent until I remembered that we were in the hands of the Philistines where a quarrel would have been worse than useless I was gulping down the insult as well as I could when the black captain came aft and with the air of an equal invited us into the cabin to take a glass of grog We had scarcely sat down before we heard a noise like the swaying up of guns or some other heavy articles from the hold I caught mister Splinter s eye he nodded but said nothing In half an hour afterwards when we went on deck we saw by the light of the moon twelve eighteen pound carronades mounted six of a side with their accompaniments of rammers and sponges water buckets boxes of round grape and canister and tubs of wadding while the coamings of the hatchways were thickly studded with round shot The tarpaulin and lumber forward had disappeared and there lay long Tom ready levelled grinning on his pivot The ropes were all coiled away and laid down in regular man of war fashion while an ugly gruff beast of a Spanish mulatto apparently the officer of the watch walked the weatherside of the quarterdeck in the true pendulum style Look outs were placed aft and at the gangways and bows who every now and then passed the word to keep a bright look out while the rest of the watch were stretched silent but evidently broad awake under the lee of the boat We noticed that each man had his cutlass buckled round his waist that the boarding pikes had been cut loose from the main boom round which they had been stopped and that about thirty muskets were ranged along a fixed rack that ran athwart ships near the main hatchway By the time we had reconnoitred thus far the night became overcast and a thick bank of clouds began to rise to windward some heavy drops of rain fell and the thunder grumbled at a distance The black veil crept gradually on until it shrouded the whole firmament and left us in as dark a night as ever poor devils were out in By and by a narrow streak of bright moonlight appeared under the lower edge of the bank defining the dark outlines of the tumbling multitudinous billows on the horizon as distinctly as if they had been pasteboard waves in a theater Is that a sail to windward in the clear think you said mister Splinter to me in a whisper At this moment it lightened vividly I am sure it is continued he I could see her white canvas glance just now I looked steadily and at last caught the small dark speck against the bright background rising and falling on the swell of the sea like a feather As we stood on she was seen more distinctly but to all appearance nobody was aware of her proximity We were mistaken in this however for the captain suddenly jumped on a gun and gave his orders with a fiery energy that startled us Leroux A small French boy was at his side in a moment Forward and call all hands to shorten sail but doucement you land crab Man the fore clew garnets Hands by the top gallant clew lines jib down haul rise tacks and sheets peak and throat haulyards let go clew up settle away the main gaff there In almost as short a space as I have taken to write it every inch of canvas was close furled every light except the one in the binnacle and that was cautiously masked carefully extinguished a hundred and twenty men at quarters and the ship under bare poles The head yards were then squared and we bore up before the wind The stratagem proved successful the strange sail could be seen through the night glasses cracking on close to the wind evidently under the impression that we had tacked Dere she goes chasing de Gobel said the Dutchman She now burned a blue light by which we saw she was a heavy cutter without doubt our old fellow cruiser the Spark The Dutchman had come to the same conclusion My eye captain no use to dodge from her it is only dat footy little King s cutter on de Jamaica station It is her true enough answered Williamson and she is from Santa Martha with a freight of specie I know I will try a brush with her by Splinter struck in before he could finish his irreverent exclamation If your conjecture be true I know the craft a heavy vessel of her class and you may depend on hard knocks and small profit if you do take her while if she takes you I ll be hanged if she does and he grinned at the conceit then setting his teeth hard or rather I will blow the schooner up with my own hand before I strike better that than have one s bones bleached in chains on a key at Port Royal But you see you cannot control us gentlemen so get down into the cable tier and take Peter Mangrove with you I would not willingly see those come to harm who have trusted me However there was no shot flying as yet we therefore stayed on deck All sail was once more made the carronades were cast loose on both sides and double shotted the long gun slewed round the tack of the fore and aft foresail hauled up and we kept by the wind and stood after the cutter whose white canvas we could still see through the gloom like a snow wreath As soon as she saw us she tacked and stood towards us and came bowling along gallantly with the water roaring and flashing at her bows As the vessels neared each other they both shortened sail and finding that we could not weather her we steered close under her lee As we crossed on opposite tacks her commander hailed Ho the brigantine ahoy Hillo sung out Blackie as he backed his main top sail What schooner is that The Spanish schooner Caridad Whence and whither bound Carthagena to Porto Rico Heave to and send your boat on board We have none that will swim sir Very well bring to and I will send mine Call away the boarders said our captain in a low stern tone let them crouch out of sight behind the boat The cutter wore and hove to under our lee quarter within pistol shot we heard the rattle of the ropes running through the davit blocks and the splash of the jolly boat touching the water then the measured stroke of the oars as they glanced like silver in the sparkling sea and a voice calling out Give way my lads The character of the vessel we were on board of was now evident and the bitter reflection that we were chained to the stake on board of a pirate on the eve of a fierce contest with one of our own cruisers was aggravated by the consideration that the cutter had fallen into a snare by which a whole boat s crew would be sacrificed before a shot was fired I watched my opportunity as she pulled up alongside and called out leaning well over the nettings Get back to your ship treachery get back to your ship The little French serpent was at my side with the speed of thought his long clear knife glancing in one hand while the fingers of the other were laid on his lips He could not have said more plainly Hold your tongue or I ll cut your throat but Sneezer now startled him by rushing between us and giving a short angry growl The officer in the boat had heard me imperfectly he rose up I won t go back my good man until I see what you are made of and as he spoke he sprang on board but the instant he got over the bulwarks he was caught by two strong hands gagged and thrown bodily down the main hatchway Heave cried a voice and with a will and four cold thirty two pound shot were hove at once into the boat alongside which crashing through her bottom swamped her in a moment precipitating the miserable crew into the boiling sea Their shrieks still ring in my ears as they clung to the oars and some loose planks of the boat Bring up the officer and take out the gag said Williamson Poor Walcolm who had been an old messmate of mine was now dragged to the gangway half naked his face bleeding and heavily ironed when the blackamoor clapping a pistol to his head bid him as he feared instant death hail that the boat had swamped under the counter and to send another The poor fellow who appeared stunned and confused did so but without seeming to know what he said Good God said mister Splinter don t you mean to pick up the boat s crew The blood curdled to my heart as the black savage answered in a voice of thunder Let them drown and be d d Fill and stand on But the clouds by this time broke away and the mild moon shone clear and bright once more upon this scene of most atrocious villainy By her light the cutter s people could see that there was no one struggling in the water now and that the people must either have been saved or were past all earthly aid but the infamous deception was not entirely at an end The captain of the cutter seeing we were making sail did the same and after having shot ahead of us hailed once more mister Walcolm why don t you run to leeward and heave to sir Answer him instantly and hail again for another boat said the sable fiend and cocked his pistol The click went to my heart The young midship man turned his pale mild countenance laced with his blood upwards towards the moon and stars as one who had looked his last look on earth the large tears were flowing down his cheeks and mingling with the crimson streaks and a flood of silver light fell on the fine features of the poor boy as he said firmly Never The miscreant fired and he fell dead Up with the helm and wear across her stern The order was obeyed Fire The whole broadside was poured in and we could hear the shot rattle and tear along the cutter s deck and the shrieks and groans of the wounded while the white splinters glanced away in all directions We now ranged alongside and close action commenced and never do I expect to see such an infernal scene again Up to this moment there had been neither confusion nor noise on board the pirate all had been coolness and order but when the yards locked the crew broke loose from all control they ceased to be men they were demons for they threw their own dead and wounded as they were mown down like grass by the cutter s grape indiscriminately down the hatchways to get clear of them They had stripped themselves almost naked and although they fought with the most desperate courage yelling and cursing each in his own tongue most hideously yet their very numbers pent up in a small vessel were against them At length amidst the fire and smoke and hellish uproar we could see that the deck had become a very shambles and unless they soon carried the cutter by boarding it was clear that the coolness and discipline of my own glorious service must prevail even against such fearful odds the superior size of the vessel greater number of guns and heavier metal The pirates seemed aware of this themselves for they now made a desperate attempt forward to carry their antagonist by boarding led on by the black captain Just at this moment the cutter s main boom fell across the schooner s deck close to where we were sheltering ourselves from the shot the best way we could and while the rush forward was being made by a sudden impulse Splinter and I followed by Peter and the dog who with wonderful sagacity seeing the uselessness of resistance had cowered quietly by my side during the whole row scrambled along it as the cutter s people were repelling the attack on her bow and all four of us in our haste jumped down on the poor Irishman at the wheel Murder fire rape and robbery it is capsized stove in sunk burned and destroyed I am Captain captain we are carried aft here Och hubbaboo for Patrick Donnally There was no time to be lost if any of the crew came aft we were dead men so we tumbled down through the cabin skylight men and beast the hatch having been knocked off by a shot and stowed ourselves away in the side berths The noise on deck soon ceased the cannon were again plied gradually the fire slackened and we could hear that the pirate had scraped clear and escaped Some time after this the lieutenant commanding the cutter came down Poor mister Douglas both mister Splinter and I knew him well He sat down and covered his face with his hands while the blood oozed down between his fingers He had received a cutlass wound on the head in the attack His right arm was bound up with his neckcloth and he was very pale Steward bring me a light Ask the doctor how many are killed and wounded and do you hear tell him to come to me when he is done forward but not a moment sooner To have been so mauled and duped by a buccaneer and my poor boat s crew Splinter groaned He started but at this moment the man returned again Thirteen killed your honor and fifteen wounded scarcely one of us untouched The poor fellow s own skull was bound round with a bloody cloth God help me Gold help me but they have died the death of men Who knows what death the poor fellows in the boat have died Here he was cut short by a tremendous scuffle on the ladder down which an old quartermaster was trundled neck and crop into the cabin How now Jones Please your honor said the man as soon as he had gathered himself up and had time to turn his quid and smooth down his hair but again the uproar was renewed and Donnally was lugged in scrambling and struggling between two seamen this here Irish chap your honor has lost his wits if so be he ever had any your honor He has gone mad through fright Fright be d d roared Donnally no man ever frightened me but as his honor was skewering them bloody thieves forward I was boarded and carried aft by the devil your honor pooped by Beelzebub by and he rapped his fist on the table until everything on it danced again There were four of them yeer honor a black one and two blue ones and a pie bald one with four legs and a bushy tail each with two horns on his head for all the world like those on Father M Cleary s red cow no she was humbled it is Father Clannachan s I mane no not his neither for his was the parish bull fait I don t know what I mane except that they had all horns on their heads and vomited fire and had each of them a tail at his stern twisting and twining like a conger eel with a blue light at the end on t And dat s a lie if ever dere was one exclaimed Peter Mangrove jumping from the berth Look at me you Irish tief and tell me if I have a blue light or a conger eel at my stern This was too much for poor Donnally He yelled out You ll believe your own eyes now yeer honor when you see one o dem bodily before you Let me go let me go and rushing up the ladder he would in all probability have ended his earthly career in the salt sea had his bullet head not encountered the broadest part of the purser who was in the act of descending with such violence that he shot him out of the companion several feet above the deck as if he had been discharged from a culverin but the recoil sent poor Donnally stunned and senseless to the bottom of the ladder There was no standing all this we laughed outright and made ourselves known to mister Douglas who received us cordially and in a week we were landed at Port Royal FOOTNOTES one From Tom Cringle s Log THE CAPTURE OF PANAMA sixteen seventy one two JOHN ESQUEMELING Captain Morgan set forth from the castle of Chagre towards Panama August eighteen sixteen seventy He had with him twelve hundred men five boats laden with artillery and thirty two canoes The first day they sailed only six leagues and came to a place called De los Bracos Here a party of his men went ashore only to sleep and stretch their limbs being almost crippled with lying too much crowded in the boats Having rested awhile they went abroad to seek victuals in the neighboring plantations but they could find none the Spaniards being fled and carrying with them all they had This day being the first of their journey they had such scarcity of victuals as the greatest part were forced to pass with only a pipe of tobacco without any other refreshment Next day about evening they came to a place called Cruz de Juan Gallego Here they were compelled to leave their boats and canoes the river being very dry for want of rain and many trees having fallen into it The guides told them that about two leagues farther the country would be very good to continue the journey by land Hereupon they left one hundred and sixty men on board the boats to defend them that they might serve for a refuge in necessity Next morning being the third day they all went ashore except those who were to keep the boats To these Captain Morgan gave order under great penalties that no man on any pretext whatever should dare to leave the boats and go ashore fearing lest they should be surprised by an ambuscade of Spaniards in the neighboring woods which appeared so thick as to seem almost impenetrable This morning beginning their march the ways proved so bad that Captain Morgan thought it more convenient to transport some of the men in canoes though with great labor to a place farther up the river called Cedro Bueno Thus they reembarked and the canoes returned for the rest so that about night they got altogether at the said place The pirates much desired to meet some Spaniards or Indians hoping to fill their bellies with their provisions being reduced to extremity and hunger The fourth day the greatest part of the pirates marched by land being led by one of the guides the rest went by water farther up being conducted by another guide who always went before them to discover on both sides of the river the ambuscades These had also spies who were very dextrous to give notice of all accidents or of the arrival of the pirates six hours at least before they came This day about noon they came near a post called Torna Cavallos here the guide of the canoes cried out that he perceived an ambuscade His voice caused infinite joy to all the pirates hoping to find some provisions to satiate their extreme hunger Being come to the place they found nobody in it the Spaniards being fled and leaving nothing behind but a few leathern bags all empty and a few crumbs of bread scattered on the ground where they had eaten Being angry at this they pulled down a few little huts which the Spaniards had made and fell to eating the leathern bags to allay the ferment of their stomachs which was now so sharp as to gnaw their very bowels Thus they made a huge banquet upon these bags of leather divers quarrels arising concerning the greatest shares By the bigness of the place they conjectured about five hundred Spaniards had been there whom finding no victuals they were now infinitely desirous to meet intending to devour some of them rather than perish Having feasted themselves with those pieces of leather they marched on till they came about night to another post called Torna Munni Here they found another ambuscade but as barren as the former They searched the neighboring woods but could not find anything to eat the Spaniards having been so provident as not to leave anywhere the least crumb of sustenance whereby the pirates were now brought to this extremity Here again he was happy that he had reserved since noon any bit of leather to make his supper of drinking after it a good draught of water for his comfort Some who never were out of their mothers kitchens may ask how these pirates could eat and digest those pieces of leather so hard and dry Whom I answer that could they once experiment what hunger or rather famine is they would find the way as the pirates did For these first sliced it in pieces then they beat it between two stones and rubbed it often dipping it in water to make it supple and tender Lastly they scraped off the hair and broiled it Being thus cooked they cut it into small morsels and ate it helping it down with frequent gulps of water which by good fortune they had at hand The fifth day about noon they came to a place called Barbacoa Here they found traces of another ambuscade but the place totally as unprovided as the former At a small distance were several plantations which they searched very narrowly but could not find any person animal or other thing to relieve their extreme hunger Finally having ranged about and searched a long time they found a grot which seemed to be but lately hewn out of a rock where were two sacks of meal wheat and like things with two great jars of wine and certain fruits called platanoes Captain Morgan knowing some of his men were now almost dead with hunger and fearing the same of the rest caused what was found to be distributed among them who were in greatest necessity Having refreshed themselves with these victuals they marched anew with greater courage then ever Such as were weak were put into the canoes and those commanded to land that were in them before Thus they prosecuted their journey till late at night when coming to a plantation they took up their rest but without eating anything for the Spaniards as before had swept away all manner of provisions The sixth day they continued their march part by land and part by water Howbeit they were constrained to rest very frequently both for the ruggedness of the way and their extreme weakness which they endeavored to relieve by eating leaves of trees and green herbs or grass such was their miserable condition This day at noon they arrived at a plantation where was a barn full of maize Immediately they beat down the doors and ate it dry as much as they could devour then they distributed a great quantity giving every man a good allowance Thus provided and prosecuting their journey for about an hour they came to another ambuscade This they no sooner discovered but they threw away their maize with the sudden hopes of finding all things in abundance But they were much deceived meeting neither Indians nor victuals nor anything else but they saw on the other side of the river about a hundred Indians who all fleeing escaped Some few pirates leaped into the river to cross it and try to take any of the Indians but in vain for being much more nimble than the pirates they not only baffled them but killed two or three with their arrows hooting at them and crying Ha perros a la savana a la savana Ha ye dogs go to the plain go to the plain This day they could advance no farther being necessitated to pass the river to continue their march on the other side Hereupon they reposed for that night though their sleep was not profound for great murmurings were made at Captain Morgan and his conduct some being desirous to return home while others would rather die there than go back a step from their undertaking others who had greater courage laughed and joked at their discourses Meanwhile they had a guide who much comforted them saying It would not now be long before they met with people from whom they should reap some considerable advantage The seventh day in the morning they made clean their arms and every one discharged his pistol or musket without bullet to try their firelocks This done they crossed the river leaving the post where they had rested called Santa Cruz and at noon they arrived at a village called Cruz Being yet far from the place they perceived much smoke from the chimneys the sight hereof gave them great joy and hopes of finding people and plenty of good cheer Thus they went on as fast as they could encouraging one another saying There is smoke comes out of every house they are making good fires to roast and boil what we are to eat and the like At length they arrived there all sweating and panting but found no person in the town nor anything eatable to refresh themselves except good fires which they wanted not for the Spaniards before their departure had every one set fire to his own house except the king s storehouses and stables They had not left behind them any beast alive or dead which much troubled their pursuers not finding anything but a few cats and dogs which they immediately killed and devoured At last in the king s stables they found by good fortune fifteen or sixteen jars of Peru wine and a leathern sack full of bread No sooner had they drank of this wine when they fell sick almost every man this made them think the wine was poisoned which caused a new consternation in the whole camp judging themselves now to be irrecoverably lost But the true reason was their want of sustenance and the manifold sorts of trash they had eaten Their sickness was so great as caused them to remain there till the next morning without being able to prosecute their journey in the afternoon This village is seated in nine deg two min north latitude distant from the river Chagre twenty six Spanish leagues and eight from Panama This is the last place to which boats or canoes can come for which reason they built here storehouses for all sorts of merchandise which to and from Panama are transported on the backs of mules Here Captain Morgan was forced to leave his canoes and land all his men though never so weak but lest the canoes should be surprised or take up too many men for their defense he sent them all back to the place where the boats were except one which he hid that it might serve to carry intelligence Many of the Spaniards and Indians of this village having fled to the near plantations Captain Morgan ordered that none should go out of the village except companies of one hundred together fearing lest the enemy should take an advantage upon his men Notwithstanding one party contravened these orders being tempted with the desire of victuals but they were soon glad to fly into the town again being assaulted with great fury by some Spaniards and Indians who carried one of them away prisoner Thus the vigilancy and care of Captain Morgan was not sufficient to prevent every accident The eighth day in the morning Captain Morgan sent two hundred men before the body of his army to discover the way to Panama and any ambuscades therein the path being so narrow that only ten or twelve persons could march abreast and often not so many After ten hours march they came to a place called Quebrada Obscura here all on a sudden three or four thousand arrows were shot at them they not perceiving whence they came or who shot them though they presumed it was from a high rocky mountain from one side to the other whereon was a grot capable of but one horse or other beast laded This multitude of arrows much alarmed the pirates especially because they could not discover whence they were discharged At last seeing no more arrows they marched a little farther and entered a wood here they perceived some Indians to fly as fast as they could to take the advantage of another post thence to observe their march yet there remained one troop of Indians on the place resolved to fight and defend themselves which they did with great courage till their captain fell down wounded who though he despaired of life yet his valor being greater than his strength would ask no quarter but endeavoring to raise himself with undaunted mind laid hold of his azagayo or javelin and struck at one of the pirates but before he could second the blow he was shot to death This was also the fate of many of his companions who like good soldiers lost their lives with their captain for the defense of their country The pirates endeavored to take some of the Indians prisoners but they being swifter than the pirates every one escaped leaving eight pirates dead and ten wounded yea had the Indians been more dextrous in military affairs they might have defended the passage and not let one man pass A little while after they came to a large champaign open and full of fine meadows hence they could perceive at a distance before them some Indians on the top of a mountain near the way by which they were to pass they sent fifty men the nimblest they had to try to catch any of them and force them to discover their companions but all in vain for they escaped by their nimbleness and presently showed themselves in another place hallooing to the English and crying A la savana a la savana perros Ingleses that is To the plain to the plain ye English dogs Meanwhile the ten pirates that were wounded were dressed and plastered up Here was a wood and on each side a mountain The Indians possessed themselves of one and the pirates of the other Captain Morgan was persuaded the Spaniards had placed an ambuscade there it lying so conveniently hereupon he sent two hundred men to search it The Spaniards and Indians perceiving the pirates descended the mountain did so too as if they designed to attack them but being got into the wood out of sight of the pirates they were seen no more leaving the passage open About night fell a great rain which caused the pirates to march the faster and seek for houses to preserve their arms from being wet but the Indians had set fire to every one and driven away all their cattle that the pirates finding neither houses nor victuals might be constrained to return but after diligent search they found a few shepherds huts but in them nothing to eat These not holding many men they placed in them out of every company a small number who kept the arms of the rest those who remained in the open field endured much hardship that night the rain not ceasing till morning Next morning about the break of day being the ninth of that tedious journey Captain Morgan marched on while the fresh air of the morning lasted for the clouds hanging yet over their heads were much more favorable than the scorching rays of the sun the way being now more difficult than before After two hours march they discovered about twenty Spaniards who observed their motions they endeavored to catch some of them but could not they suddenly disappearing and absconding themselves in caves among the rocks unknown to the pirates At last ascending a high mountain they discovered the South Sea This happy sight as if it were the end of their labors caused infinite joy among them hence they could descry also one ship and six boats which were set forth from Panama and sailed towards the islands of Tavoga and Tavogilla then they came to a vale where they found much cattle whereof they killed good store here while some killed and flayed cows horses bulls and chiefly asses of which there were most others kindled fires and got wood to roast them then cutting the flesh into convenient pieces or gobbets they threw them into the fire and half carbonadoed or roasted they devoured them with incredible haste and appetite Such was their hunger that they more resembled cannibals than Europeans the blood many times running down from their beards to their waists Having satisfied their hunger Captain Morgan ordered them to continue the march Here again he sent before the main body fifty men to take some prisoners if they could for he was much concerned that in nine days he could not meet one person to inform him of the condition and forces of the Spaniards About evening they discovered about two hundred Spaniards who hallooed to the pirates but they understood not what they said A little while after they came in sight of the highest steeple of Panama this they no sooner discovered but they showed signs of extreme joy casting up their hats into the air leaping and shouting just as if they had already obtained the victory and accomplished their designs All their trumpets sounded and drums beat in token of this alacrity of their minds Thus they pitched their camp for that night with general content of the whole army waiting with impatience for the morning when they intended to attack the city This evening appeared fifty horses who came out of the city on the noise of the drums and trumpets to observe as it was thought their motions they came almost within musket shot of the army with a trumpet that sounded marvelously well Those on horseback hallooed aloud to the pirates and threatened them saying Perros nos veremos that is Ye dogs we shall meet ye Having made this menace they returned to the city except only seven or eight horsemen who hovered thereabouts to watch their motions Immediately after the city fired and ceased not to play their biggest guns all night long against the camp but with little or no harm to the pirates whom they could not easily reach Now also the two hundred Spaniards whom the pirates had seen in the afternoon appeared again making a show of blocking up the passages that no pirates might escape their hands but the pirates though in a manner besieged instead of fearing their blockades as soon as they had placed sentinels about their camp opened their satchels and without any napkins or plates fell to eating very heartily the pieces of bulls and horses flesh which they had reserved since noon This done they laid themselves down to sleep on the grass with great repose and satisfaction expecting only with impatience the dawning of the next day The tenth day betimes in the morning they put all their men in order and with drums and trumpets sounding marched directly towards the city but one of the guides desired Captain Morgan not to take the common highway lest they should find in it many ambuscades He took his advice and chose another way through the wood though very irksome and difficult The Spaniards perceiving the pirates had taken another way they scarce had thought on were compelled to leave their stops and batteries and come out to meet them The governor of Panama put his forces in order consisting of two squadrons four regiments of foot and a huge number of wild bulls which were driven by a great number of Indians with some negroes and others to help them The pirates now upon their march came to the top of a little hill whence they had a large prospect of the city and champaign country underneath Here they discovered the forces of the people of Panama in battle array to be so numerous that they were surprised with fear much doubting the fortune of the day yea few or none there were but wished themselves at home or at least free from obligation of that engagement it so nearly concerning their lives Having been some time wavering in their minds they at last reflected on the straits they had brought themselves into and that now they must either fight resolutely or die for no quarter could be expected from an enemy on whom they had committed so many cruelties Hereupon they encouraged one another resolving to conquer or spend the last drop of blood Then they divided themselves into three battalions sending before two hundred buccaneers who were very dextrous at their guns Then descending the hill they marched directly towards the Spaniards who in a spacious field waited for their coming As soon as they drew nigh the Spaniards began to shout and cry Viva el rey God save the king and immediately their horse moved against the pirates but the fields being full of quags and soft under foot they could not wheel about as they desired The two hundred buccaneers who went before each putting one knee to the ground began to battle briskly with a full volley of shot the Spaniards defended themselves courageously doing all they could to disorder the pirates Their foot endeavored to second the horse but were forced by the fire of the pirates to retreat Finding themselves baffled they attempted to drive the bulls against them behind to put them into disorder but the wild cattle ran away frighted with the noise of the battle Only some few broke through the English companies and only tore the colors in pieces while the buccaneers shot every one of them dead The battle having continued two hours the greatest part of the Spanish horse was ruined and almost all killed the rest fled which the foot seeing and that they could not possibly prevail they discharged the shot they had in their muskets and throwing them down fled away every one as he could The pirates could not follow them being too much harassed and wearied with their long journey Many not being able to fly whither they desired hid themselves for that present among the shrubs of the sea side but very unfortunately for most of them being found by the pirates were instantly killed without any quarter Some religious men were brought prisoners before Captain Morgan but he being deaf to their cries commanded them all to be pistoled which was done Soon after they brought a captain to him whom he examined very strictly particularly wherein consisted the forces of those of Panama He answered their whole strength consisted in four hundred horse twenty four companies of foot each one hundred men complete sixty Indians and some negroes who were to drive two thousand wild bulls upon the English and thus by breaking their files put them into a total disorder beside that in the city they had made trenches and raised batteries in several places in all which they had placed many guns and that at the entry of the highway leading to the city they had built a fort mounted with eight great brass guns defended by fifty men Captain Morgan having heard this gave orders instantly to march another way but first he made a review of his men whereof he found both killed and wounded a considerable number and much greater than had been believed Of the Spaniards were found six hundred dead on the place besides the wounded and prisoners The pirates nothing discouraged seeing their number so diminished but rather filled with greater pride perceiving what huge advantage they had obtained against their enemies having rested some time prepared to march courageously towards the city plighting their oaths to one another that they would fight till not a man was left alive With this courage they recommenced their march either to conquer or be conquered carrying with them all the prisoners They found much difficulty in their approach to the city for within the town the Spaniards had placed many great guns at several quarters some charged with small pieces of iron and others with musket bullets With all these they saluted the pirates at their approaching and gave them full and frequent broadsides firing at them incessantly so that unavoidably they lost at every step great numbers of men But not these manifest dangers of their lives nor the sight of so many as dropped continually at their sides could deter them from advancing and gaining ground every moment on the enemy and though the Spaniards never ceased to fire and act the best they could for their defense yet they were forced to yield after three hours combat And the pirates having possessed themselves at last of the city killed all that attempted in the least to oppose them The inhabitants had transported the best of their goods to more remote and secret places howbeit they found in the city several warehouses well stocked with merchandise as well silks and cloths as linen and other things of value As soon as the first fury of their entrance was over Captain Morgan assembled his men and commanded them under great penalties not to drink or taste any wine and the reason he gave for it was because he had intelligence that it was all poisoned by the Spaniards Howbeit it was thought he gave these prudent orders to prevent the debauchery of his people which he foresaw would be very great at the first after so much hunger sustained by the way fearing withal lest the Spaniards seeing them in wine should rally and falling on the city use them as inhumanly as they had used the inhabitants before Captain Morgan as soon as he had placed necessary guards at several quarters within and without the city commanded twenty five men to seize a great boat which had stuck in the mud of the port for want of water at a low tide The same day about noon he caused fire privately to be set to several great edifices of the city nobody knowing who were the authors thereof much less on what motives Captain Morgan did it which are unknown to this day the fire increased so that before night the greatest part of the city was in a flame Captain Morgan pretended the Spaniards had done it perceiving that his own people reflected on him for that action Many of the Spaniards and some of the pirates did what they could either to quench the flames or by blowing up houses with gunpowder and pulling down others to stop it but in vain for in less than half an hour it consumed a whole street All the houses of the city were built with cedar very curious and magnificent and richly adorned especially with hangings and paintings whereof part were before removed but another great part were consumed by fire There were in this city which is the see of a bishop eight monasteries seven for men and one for women two stately churches and one hospital The churches and monasteries were all richly adorned with altar pieces and paintings much gold and silver and other precious things all which the ecclesiastics had hidden Besides which here were two thousand houses of magnificent building the greatest part inhabited by merchants vastly rich For the rest of less quality and tradesmen this city contained five thousand more Here were also many stables for the horses and mules that carry the plate of the king of Spain as well as private men towards the North Sea The neighboring fields were full of fertile plantations and pleasant gardens affording delicious prospects to the inhabitants all the year The Genoese had in this city a stately house for their trade of negroes This likewise was by Captain Morgan burnt to the very ground Besides which building there were consumed two hundred warehouses and many slaves who had hid themselves therein with innumerable sacks of meal the fire of which continued four weeks after it had begun The greatest part of the pirates still encamped without the city fearing and expecting the Spaniards would come and fight them anew it being known they much outnumbered the pirates This made them keep the field to preserve their forces united now much diminished by their losses Their wounded which were many they put into one church which remained standing the rest being consumed by the fire Besides these decreases of his men Captain Morgan had sent a convoy of one hundred and fifty men to the castle of Chagre to carry the news of his victory at Panama They saw often whole troops of Spaniards run to and fro in the fields which made them suspect their rallying which they never had the courage to do In the afternoon Captain Morgan reentered the city with his troops that every one might take up their lodgings which now they could hardly find few houses having escaped the fire Then they sought very carefully among the ruins and ashes for utensils of plate or gold that were not quite wasted by the flames and of such they found no small number especially in wells and cisterns where the Spaniards had hid them Next day Captain Morgan dispatched away two troops of one hundred and fifty men each stout and well armed to seek for the inhabitants who were escaped These having made several excursions up and down the fields woods and mountains adjacent returned after two days bringing above two hundred prisoners men women and slaves The same day returned also the boat which Captain Morgan had sent to the South Sea bringing three other boats which they had taken But all these prizes they could willingly have given and greater labor into the bargain for one galleon which miraculously escaped richly laden with all the king s plate jewels and other precious goods of the best and richest merchants of Panama on board which were also the religious women of the nunnery who had embarked with them all the ornaments of their church consisting in much gold plate and other things of great value The strength of this galleon was inconsiderable having only seven guns and ten or twelve muskets and very ill provided with victuals necessaries and fresh water having no more sails than the uppermost of the mainmast This account the pirates received from some one who had spoken with seven mariners belonging to the galleon who came ashore in the cockboat for fresh water Hence they concluded they might easily have taken it had they given her chase as they should have done but they were impeded from following this vastly rich prize by their gluttony and drunkenness having plentifully debauched themselves with several rich wines they found ready choosing rather to satiate their appetites than to lay hold on such huge advantage since this one prize would have been of far greater value than all they got at Panama and the places thereabout Next day repenting of their negligence being weary of their vices and debaucheries they set forth another boat well armed to pursue with all speed the said galleon but in vain the Spaniards who were on board having had intelligence of their own danger one or two days before while the pirates were cruising so near them whereupon they fled to places more remote and unknown The pirates found in the ports of the island of Tavoga and Tavogilla several boats laden with very good merchandise all which they took and brought to Panama where they made an exact relation of all that had passed to Captain Morgan The prisoners confirmed what the pirates said adding that they undoubtedly knew where the galleon might then be but that it was very probable they had been relieved before now from other places This stirred up Captain Morgan anew to send forth all the boats in the port of Panama to seek the said galleon till they could find her These boats being in all four after eight days cruising to and fro and searching several ports and creeks lost all hopes of finding her whereupon they returned to Tavoga and Tavogilla Here they found a reasonable good ship newly come from Payta laden with cloth soap sugar and biscuit with twenty thousand pieces of eight This they instantly seized without the least resistance as also a boat which was not far off on which they laded great part of the merchandises from the ship with some slaves With this spoil they returned to Panama somewhat better satisfied yet withal much discontented that they could not meet with the galleon The convoy which Captain Morgan had sent to the castle of Chagre returned much about the same time bringing with them very good news for while Captain Morgan was on his journey to Panama those he had left in the castle of Chagre had sent for two boats to cruise These met with a Spanish ship which they chased within sight of the castle This being perceived by the pirates in the castle they put forth Spanish colors to deceive the ship that fled before the boats and the poor Spaniards thinking to take refuge under the castle were caught in a snare and made prisoners The cargo on board the said vessel consisted in victuals and provisions than which nothing could be more opportune for the castle where they began already to want things of this kind This good luck of those of Chagre caused Captain Morgan to stay longer at Panama ordering several new excursions into the country round about and while the pirates at Panama were upon these expeditions those at Chagre were busy in piracies on the North Sea Captain Morgan sent forth daily parties of two hundred men to make inroads into all the country round about and when one party came back another went forth who soon gathered much riches and many prisoners These being brought into the city were put to the most exquisite tortures to make them confess both other people s goods and their own Here it happened that one poor wretch was found in the house of a person of quality who had put on amidst the confusion a pair of taffety breeches of his master s with a little silver key hanging out perceiving which they asked him for the cabinet of the said key His answer was he knew not what was become of it but that finding those breeches in his master s house he had made bold to wear them Not being able to get any other answer they put him on the rack and inhumanly disjointed his arms then they twisted a cord about his forehead which they wrung so hard that his eyes appeared as big as eggs and were ready to fall out But with these torments not obtaining any positive answer they hung him up by the wrists giving him many blows and stripes under that intolerable pain and posture of body Afterwards they cut off his nose and ears and singed his face with burning straw till he could not speak nor lament his misery any longer then losing all hopes of any confession they bade a negro to run him through which put an end to his life and to their inhuman tortures Thus did many others of those miserable prisoners finish their days the common sport and recreation of these pirates being such tragedies Captain Morgan having now been at Panama full three weeks commanded all things to be prepared for his departure He ordered every company of men to seek so many beasts of carriage as might convey the spoil to the river where his canoes lay About this time there was a great rumor that a considerable number of pirates intended to leave Captain Morgan and that taking a ship then in port they determined to go and rob on the South Sea till they had got as much as they thought fit and then return homewards by way of the East Indies For which purpose they had gathered much provisions which they had hid in private places with sufficient powder bullets and all other ammunition likewise some great guns belonging to the town muskets and other things wherewith they designed not only to equip their vessel but to fortify themselves in some island which might serve them for a place of refuge This design had certainly taken effect had not Captain Morgan had timely advice of it from one of their comrades hereupon he commanded the mainmast of the said ship to be cut down and burnt with all the other boats in the port hereby the intentions of all or most of his companions were totally frustrated Then Captain Morgan sent many of the Spaniards into the adjoining fields and country to seek for money to ransom not only themselves but the rest of the prisoners as likewise the ecclesiastics Moreover he commanded all the artillery of the town to be nailed and stopped up At the same time he sent out a strong company of men to seek for the governor of Panama of whom intelligence was brought that he had laid several ambuscades in the way by which he ought to return but they returned soon after saying they had not found any sign of any such ambuscades For confirmation whereof they brought some prisoners who declared that the said governor had had an intention of making some opposition by the way but that the men designed to effect it were unwilling to undertake it so that for want of means he could not put his design in execution February twenty four sixteen seventy one Captain Morgan departed from Panama or rather from the place where the city of Panama stood of the spoils whereof he carried with him one hundred and seventy five beasts of carriage laden with silver gold and other precious things beside about six hundred prisoners men women children and slaves That day they came to a river that passes through a delicious plain a league from Panama here Captain Morgan put all his forces into good order so as that the prisoners were in the middle surrounded on all sides with pirates where nothing else was to be heard but lamentations cries shrieks and doleful sighs of so many women and children who feared Captain Morgan designed to transport them all into his own country for slaves Besides all those miserable prisoners endured extreme hunger and thirst at that time which misery Captain Morgan designedly caused them to sustain to excite them to seek for money to ransom themselves according to the tax he had set upon every one Many of the women begged Captain Morgan on their knees with infinite sighs and tears to let them return to Panama there to live with their dear husbands and children in little huts of straw which they would erect seeing they had no houses till the rebuilding of the city But his answer was He came not thither to hear lamentations and cries but to seek money therefore they ought first to seek out that wherever it was to be had and bring it to him otherwise he would assuredly transport them all to such places whither they cared not to go Next day when the march began those lamentable cries and shrieks were renewed so as it would have caused compassion in the hardest heart but Captain Morgan as a man little given to mercy was not moved in the least They marched in the same order as before one party of the pirates in the van the prisoners in the middle and the rest of the pirates in the rear by whom the miserable Spaniards were at every step punched and thrust in their backs and sides with the blunt ends of their arms to make them march faster A beautiful lady wife to one of the richest merchants of Tavoga was led prisoner by herself between two pirates Her lamentations pierced the skies seeing herself carried away into captivity often crying to the pirates and telling them That she had given orders to two religious persons in whom she had relied to go to a certain place and fetch so much money as her ransom did amount to that they had promised faithfully to do it but having obtained the money instead of bringing it to her they had employed it another way to ransom some of their own and particular friends This ill action of theirs was discovered by a slave who brought a letter to the said lady Her complaints and the cause thereof being brought to Captain Morgan he thought fit to inquire thereinto Having found it to be true especially hearing it confirmed by the confession of the said religious men though under some frivolous excuses of having diverted the money but for a day or two in which time they expected more sums to repay it he gave liberty to the said lady whom otherwise he designed to transport to Jamaica But he detained the said religious men as prisoners in her place using them according to their desserts Captain Morgan arriving at the town called Cruz on the banks of the river Chagre he published an order among the prisoners that within three days every one should bring in their ransom under the penalty of being transported to Jamaica Meanwhile he gave orders for so much rice and maize to be collected thereabouts as was necessary for victualing his ships Here some of the prisoners were ransomed but many others could not bring in their money Hereupon he continued his voyage leaving the village on the fifth of March following carrying with him all the spoil he could Hence he likewise led away some new prisoners inhabitants there with those in Panama who had not paid their ransoms But the two religious men who had diverted the lady s money were ransomed three days after by other persons who had more compassion for them than they had showed for her About the middle of the way to Chagre Captain Morgan commanded them to be mustered and caused every one to be sworn that they had concealed nothing even not to the value of sixpence This done Captain Morgan knowing those lewd fellows would not stick to swear falsely for interest he commanded every one to be searched very strictly both in their clothes and satchels and elsewhere Yea that this order might not be ill taken by his companions he permitted himself to be searched even to his very shoes To this effect by common consent one was assigned out of every company to be searchers of the rest The French pirates that assisted on this expedition disliked this new practice of searching but being outnumbered by the English they were forced to submit as well as the rest The search being over they reembarked and arrived at the castle of Chagre on the ninth of March FOOTNOTES two From The Buccaneers of America THE MALAY PROAS three JAMES FENIMORE COOPER We had cleared the Straits of Sunda early in the morning and had made a pretty fair run in the course of the day though most of the time in thick weather Just as the sun set however the horizon became clear and we got a sight of two small sail seemingly heading in toward the coast of Sumatra proas by their rig and dimensions They were so distant and were so evidently steering for the land that no one gave them much thought or bestowed on them any particular attention Proas in that quarter were usually distrusted by ships it is true but the sea is full of them and far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence Then it became dark soon after these craft were seen and night shut them in An hour after the sun had set the wind fell to a light air that just kept steerage way on the ship Fortunately the John was not only fast but she minded her helm as a light footed girl turns in a lively dance I never was in a better steering ship most especially in moderate weather mister Marble had the middle watch that night and of course I was on deck from midnight until four in the morning It proved misty most of the watch and for quite an hour we had a light drizzling rain The ship the whole time was close hauled carrying royals As everybody seemed to have made up his mind to a quiet night one without any reefing or furling most of the watch were sleeping about the decks or wherever they could get good quarters and be least in the way I do not know what kept me awake for lads of my age are apt to get all the sleep they can but I believe I was thinking of Clawbonny and Grace and Lucy for the latter excellent girl as she was often crossed my mind in those days of youth and comparative innocence Awake I was and walking in the weather gangway in a sailor s trot mister Marble he I do believe was fairly snoozing on the hen coops being like the sails as one might say barely asleep At that moment I heard a noise one familiar to seamen that of an oar falling in a boat So completely was my mind bent on other and distant scenes that at first I felt no surprise as if we were in a harbor surrounded by craft of various sizes coming and going at all hours But a second thought destroyed this illusion and I looked eagerly about me Directly on our weather bow distant perhaps a cable s length I saw a small sail and I could distinguish it sufficiently well to perceive it was a proa I sang out Sail ho and close aboard mister Marble was on his feet in an instant He afterward told me that when he opened his eyes for he admitted this much to me in confidence they fell directly on the stranger He was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done Keep the ship away keep her broad off he called out to the man at the wheel Lay the yards square call all hands one of you Captain Robbins mister Kite bear a hand up the bloody proas are aboard us The last part of this call was uttered in a loud voice with the speaker s head down the companion way It was heard plainly enough below but scarcely at all on deck In the meantime everybody was in motion It is amazing how soon sailors are wide awake when there is really anything to do It appeared to me that all our people mustered on deck in less than a minute most of them with nothing on but their shirts and trousers The ship was nearly before the wind by the time I heard the captain s voice and then mister Kite came bustling in among us forward ordering most of the men to lay aft to the braces remaining himself on the forecastle and keeping me with him to let go the sheets On the forecastle the strange sail was no longer visible being now abaft the beam but I could hear mister Marble swearing there were two of them and that they must be the very chaps we had seen to leeward and standing in for the land at sunset I also heard the captain calling out to the steward to bring him a powder horn Immediately after orders were given to let fly all our sheets forward and then I perceived that they were wearing ship Nothing saved us but the prompt order of mister Marble to keep the ship away by which means instead of moving toward the proas we instantly began to move from them Although they went three feet to our two this gave us a moment of breathing time As our sheets were all flying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me leisure to look about I soon saw both proas and glad enough was I to perceive that they had not approached materially nearer mister Kite observed this also and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals aback He meant they did not exactly know what we were at and had not kept away with us At this instant the captain and five or six of the oldest seamen began to cast loose all our starboard or weather guns four in all and sixes We had loaded these guns in the Straits of Banca with grape and canister in readiness for just such pirates as were now coming down upon us and nothing was wanting but the priming and a hot loggerhead It seems two of the last had been ordered in the fire when we saw the proas at sunset and they were now in excellent condition for service live coals being kept around them all night by command I saw a cluster of men busy with the second gun from forward and could distinguish the captain pointing to it There cannot well be any mistake mister Marble the captain observed hesitating whether to fire or not Mistake sir Lord Captain Robbins you might cannonade any of the islands astern for a week and never hurt an honest man Let em have it sir I ll answer for it you do good This settled the matter The loggerhead was applied and one of our sixes spoke out in a smart report A breathless stillness succeeded The proas did not alter their course but neared us fast The captain levelled his night glass and I heard him tell Kite in a low voice that they were full of men The word was now passed to clear away all the guns and to open the arm chest to come at the muskets and pistols I heard the rattling of the boarding pikes too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks All this sounded very ominous and I began to think we should have a desperate engagement first and then have all our throats cut afterward I expected now to hear the guns discharged in quick succession but they were got ready only not fired Kite went aft and returned with three or four muskets and as many pikes He gave the latter to those of the people who had nothing to do with the guns By this time the ship was on a wind steering a good full while the two proas were just abeam and closing fast The stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death The proas however fell a little more astern the result of their own man oe uvering out of all doubt as they moved through the water much faster than the ship seeming desirous of dropping into our wake with a design of closing under our stern and avoiding our broadside As this would never do and the wind freshened so as to give us four or five knot way a most fortunate circumstance for us the captain determined to tack while he had room The John behaved beautifully and came round like a top The proas saw there was no time to lose and attempted to close before we could fill again and this they would have done with ninety nine ships in a hundred The captain knew his vessel however and did not let her lose her way making everything draw again as it might be by instinct The proas tacked too and laying up much nearer to the wind than we did appeared as if about to close on our lee bow The question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple If the pirates got on board us we were hopelessly gone and everything depended on coolness and judgment The captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders I was too much interested at this moment to feel the concern that I might otherwise have experienced On the forecastle it appeared to us all that we should be boarded in a minute for one of the proas was actually within a hundred feet though losing her advantage a little by getting under the lee of our sails Kite had ordered us to muster forward of the rigging to meet the expected leap with a discharge of muskets and then to present our pikes when I felt an arm thrown around my body and was turned inboard while another person assumed my place This was Neb who had thus coolly thrust himself before me in order to meet the danger first I felt vexed even while touched with the fellow s attachment and self devotion but had no time to betray either feeling before the crews of the proas gave a yell and discharged some fifty or sixty matchlocks at us The air was full of bullets but they all went over our heads Not a soul on board the John was hurt On our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the stern most proa which was still near a cable s length distant As often happens the one seemingly farthest from danger fared the worst Our grape and canister had room to scatter and I can at this distant day still hear the shrieks that arose from that craft They were like the yells of fiends in anguish The effect on that proa was instantaneous instead of keeping on after her consort she wore short round on her heel and stood away in our wake on the other tack apparently to get out of the range of our fire I doubt if we touched a man in the nearest proa At any rate no noise proceeded from her and she came up under our bows fast As every gun was discharged and there was not time to load them all now depended on repelling the boarders Part of our people mustered in the waist where it was expected the proa would fall alongside and part on the forecastle Just as this distribution was made the pirates cast their grapnel It was admirably thrown but caught only by a ratlin I saw this and was about to jump into the rigging to try what I could do to clear it when Neb again went ahead of me and cut the ratlin with his knife This was just as the pirates had abandoned sails and oars and had risen to haul up alongside So sudden was the release that twenty of them fell over by their own efforts In this state the ship passed ahead all her canvas being full leaving the proa motionless in her wake In passing however the two vessels were so near that those aft in the John distinctly saw the swarthy faces of their enemies We were no sooner clear of the proas than the order was given Ready about The helm was put down and the ship came into the wind in a minute As we came square with the two proas all our larboard guns were given to them and this ended the affair I think the nearest of the rascals got it this time for away she went after her consort both running off toward the islands We made a little show of chasing but it was only a feint for we were too glad to get away from them to be in earnest In ten minutes after we tacked the last time we ceased firing having thrown some eight or ten round shot after the proas and were close hauled again heading to the southwest FOOTNOTES three From Afloat and Ashore THE WONDERFUL FIGHT OF THE EXCHANGE OF BRISTOL WITH THE PIRATES OF ALGIERS four SAMUEL PURCHAS In the yeere sixteen twenty one the first of November there was one Iohn Rawlins borne in Rochester and dwelling three and twenty yeere in Plimmoth imployed to the Strait of Gibraltar by Master Richard and Steven Treviles Merchants of Plimmoth and fraighted in a Barke called the Nicholas of Plimmoth of the burden of forty Tun which had also in her company another ship of Plimmoth called the George Benaventure of seventy Tun burthen or thereabouts which by reason of her greatnesse beyond the other I will name the Admirall and Iohn Rawlins Barke shall if you please be the Vice admirall These two according to the time of the yeere had a faire passage and by the eighteenth of the same moneth came to a place at the entring of the straits named Trafflegar but the next morning being in the sight of Gibraltar at the very mouth of the straits the watch descried five saile of ships who as it seemed used all the means they could to come neere us and we as we had cause used the same means to go as farre from them yet did their Admirall take in both his top sailes that either we might not suspect them or that his owne company might come up the closer together At last perceiving us Christians they fell from devices to apparent discovery of hostility and making out against us we againe suspecting them Pirats tooke our course to escape from them and made all the sailes we possibly could for Tirriff or Gibraltar but all we could doe could not prevent their approach For suddenly one of them came right over against us to wind ward and so fell upon our quarter another came upon our luffe and so threatened us there and at last all five chased us making great speed to surprise us Their Admirall was called Callfater having upon her maine top saile two top gallant sailes one above another But whereas we thought them all five to be Turkish ships of war we afterwards understood that two of them were their prizes the one a smal ship of London the other of the West countrey that came out of the Quactath laden with figges and other Merchandise but now subiect to the fortune of the Sea and the captivity of Pirats But to our businesse Three of these ships got much upon us and so much that ere halfe the day was spent the Admirall who was the best sailer fetcht up the George Bonaventure and made booty of it The Vice Admirall againe being neerest unto the lesser Barke whereof Iohn Rawlins was Master shewed him the force of a stronger arme and by his Turkish name called Villa Rise commanded him in like sort to strike his sailes and submit to his mercy which not to be gaine saied nor prevented was quickly done and so Rawlins with his Barke was quickly taken although the Reare Admirall being the worst sayler of the three called Reggiprise came not in till all was done The same day before night the Admirall either loth to pester himselfe with too much company or ignorant of the commodity that was to be made by the sale of English prisoners or daring not to trust them in his company for feare of mutinies and exciting others to rebellion set twelve persons who were in the George Bonaventure on the land and divers other English whom he had taken before to trie their fortunes in an unknowne Countrey But Villa Rise the Vice Admirall that had taken Iohn Rawlins would not so dispence with his men but commanded him and five more of his company to be brought aboord his ship leaving in his Barke three men and his boy with thirteene Turkes and Moores who were questionlesse sufficient to over master the other and direct the Barke to Harbour Thus they sailed directly for Algier but the night following followed them with great tempest and foule weather which ended not without some effect of a storme for they lost the sight of Rawlins Barke called the Nicholas and in a manner lost themselves though they seemed safe a shipboord by fearefull coniecturing what should become of us at last by the two and twentieth of the same moneth they or we chuse you whether arrived at Algier and came in safety within the Mould but found not our other Barke there nay though we earnestly inquired after the same yet heard we nothing to our satisfaction but much matter was ministred to our discomfort and amazement For although the Captaine and our over seers were loth we should have any conference with our Country men yet did we adventure to informe ourselves of the present affaires both of the Towne and the shipping so that finding many English at worke in other ships they spared not to tell us the danger we were in and the mischiefes we must needs incurre as being sure if we were not used like slaves to be sold as slaves for there had beene five hundred brought into the market for the same purpose and above a hundred hansome youths compelled to turne Turkes or made subiect to more viler prostitution and all English yet like good Christians they bade us be of good cheere and comfort ourselves in this that Gods trials were gentle purgations and these crosses were but to cleanse the drosse from the gold and bring us out of the fire againe more cleare and lovely Yet I must needs confesse that they afforded us reason for this cruelty as if they determined to be revenged of our last attempt to fire their ships in the Mould and therefore protested to spare none whom they could surprise and take alive but either to sell them for money or torment them to serve their owne turnes Now their customes and usages in both these was in this manner First concerning the first The Bashaw had the over seeing of all prisoners who were presented unto him at their first comming into the harbour and to choose one out of every eight for a present or fee to himselfe the rest were rated by the Captaines and so sent to the Market to be sold whereat if either there were repining or any drawing backe then certaine Moores and Officers attended either to beate you forward or thrust you into the sides with Goades and this was the manner of the selling of Slaves Secondly concerning their enforcing them either to turne Turke or to attend their filthines and impieties although it would make a Christians heart bleed to heare of the same yet must the truth not be hid nor the terror left untold They commonly lay them on their naked backs or bellies beating them so long till they bleed at the nose and mouth and if yet they continue constant then they strike the teeth out of their heads pinch them by their tongues and use many other sorts of tortures to convert them nay many times they lay them their whole length in the ground like a grave and so cover them with boords threatening to starve them if they will not turne and so many even for feare of torment and death make their tongues betray their hearts to a most fearefull wickednesse and so are circumcised with new names and brought to confesse a new Religion Others againe I must confesse who never knew any God but their own sensuall lusts and pleasures thought that any religion would serve their turnes and so for preferment or wealth very voluntarily renounced their faith and became Renegadoes in despight of any counsell which seemed to intercept them and this was the first newes wee encountred with at our comming first to Algier The twenty six of the same moneth Iohn Rawlins his Barke with his other three men and a boy came safe into the Mould and so were put all together to be carried before the Bashaw but that they tooke the Owners servant and Rawlins Boy and by force and torment compelled them to turne Turkes then were they in all seven English besides Iohn Rawlins of whom the Bashaw tooke one and sent the rest to their Captaines who set a valuation upon them and so the Souldiers hurried us like dogs into the Market whereas men sell Hacknies in England We were tossed up and downe to see who would give most for us and although we had heavy hearts and looked with sad countenances yet many came to behold us sometimes taking us by the hand sometimes turning us round about sometimes feeling our brawnes and naked armes and so beholding our prices written on our breasts they bargained for us accordingly and at last we were all sold and the Souldiers returned with the money to their Captaines Iohn Rawlins was the last who was sold by reason of his lame hand and bought by the Captaine that tooke him even that dog Villa Rise who better informing himselfe of his skill fit to be a Pilot and his experience to bee an over seer bought him and his Carpenter at very easie rates For as we afterwards understood by divers English Renegadoes he paid for Rawlins but one hundred and fiftie Dooblets which make of English money seven pound ten shilling Thus was he and his Carpenter with divers other slaves sent into his ship to worke and imployed about such affaires as belonged to the well rigging and preparing the same But the villanous Turkes perceiving his lame hand and that he could not performe so much as other Slaves quickly complained to their Patron who as quickly apprehended the inconvenience whereupon hee sent for him the next day and told him he was unserviceable for his present purpose and therefore unlesse he could procure fifteene pound of the English there for his ransome he would send him up into the Countrey where he should never see Christendome againe and endure the extremity of a miserable banishment But see how God worketh all for the best for his servants and confounded the presumption of Tyrants frustrating their purposes to make his wonders knowne to the sonnes of men and releeves his people when they least thinke of succour and releasement Whilest Iohn Rawlins was thus terrified with the dogged answere of Villa Rise the Exchange of Bristow five a ship formerly surprised by the Pirats lay all unrigged in the Harbour till at last one Iohn Goodale an English Turke with his confederates understanding shee was a good sailer and might be made a proper Man of Warre bought her from the Turkes that tooke her and prepared her for their owne purpose Now the Captaine that set them at worke was also an English Renegado by the name of Rammetham Rise but by his Christian name Henrie Chandler who resolved to make Goodale Master over her and because they were both English Turkes having the command notwithstanding of many Turkes and Moores they concluded to have all English slaves to goe in her and for their Gunners English and Dutch Renegadoes and so they agreed with the Patrons of nine English and one French Slave for their ransoms who were presently imployed to rig and furnish the ship for a Man of Warre and while they were thus busied two of Iohn Rawlins men who were taken with him were also taken up to serve in this Man of Warre their names Iames Roe and Iohn Davies the one dwelling in Plimmoth and the other in Foy where the Commander of this ship was also borne by which occasion they came acquainted so that both the Captaine and the Master promised them good usage upon the good service they should performe in the voyage and withall demanded of them if they knew of any Englishman to be bought that could serve as a Pilot both to direct them out of Harbour and conduct them in their voyage For in truth neither was the Captaine a Mariner nor any Turke in her of sufficiency to dispose of her through the Straites in securitie nor oppose any enemie that should hold it out bravely against them Davies quickly replied that as farre as he understood Villa Rise would sell Iohn Rawlins his Master and Commander of the Barke which was taken a man every way sufficient for Sea affaires being of great resolution and good experience and for all he had a lame hand yet had he a sound heart and noble courage for any attempt or adventure When the Captaine understood thus much he imployed Davies to search for Rawlins who at last lighting upon him asked him if the Turke would sell him Rawlins suddenly answered that by reason of his lame hand he was willing to part with him but because he had disbursed money for him he would gaine something by him and so prized him at three hundred Dooblets which amounteth to fifteene pound English which he must procure or incurre sorer indurances When Davies had certified this much the Turkes a ship boord conferred about the matter and the Master whose Christen name was Iohn Goodale joyned with two Turkes who were consorted with him and disbursed one hundred Dooblets a piece and so bought him of Villa Rise sending him into the said ship called the Exchange of Bristow as well to supervise what had been done as to order what was left undone but especially to fit the sailes and to accommodate the ship all which Rawlins was very carefull and dilligent in not yet thinking of any peculiar plot of deliverance more than a generall desire to be freed from this Turkish slaverie and inhumane abuses By the seventh of Januarie the ship was prepared with twelve good cast Pieces and all manner of munition and provision which belonged to such a purpose and the same day haled out of the Mould of Algier with this company and in this manner There were in her sixtie three Turkes and Moores nine English slaves and one French foure Hollanders that were free men to whom the Turkes promised one prise or other and so to returne to Holland or if they were disposed to goe backe againe for Algier they should have great reward and no enforcement offered but continue as they would both their religion and their customes and for their Gunners they had two of our Souldiers one English and one Dutch Renegado and thus much for the companie For the manner of setting out it was as usuall as in other ships but that the Turkes delighted in the ostentous braverie of their Streamers Banners and Top sayles the ship being a handsome ship and well built for any purpose The Slaves and English were imployed under Hatches about the Ordnance and other workes of order and accommodating themselves all which Iohn Rawlins marked as supposing it an intolerable slaverie to take such paines and be subiect to such dangers and still to enrich other men and maintaine their voluptuous filthinesse and lives returning themselves as Slaves and living worse than their Dogs amongst them Whereupon hee burst out into these or the like abrupt speeches Oh Hellish slaverie to be thus subiect to Dogs Oh God strengthen my heart and hand that something shall be done to ease us of these mischiefs and deliver us from these cruell Mahumetan Dogs The other Slaves pittying his distraction as they thought bad him speake softly lest they should all fare the worse for his distemperature The worse quoth Rawlins what can be worse I will either attempt my deliverance at one time or another or perish in the enterprise but if you would be contented to hearken after a release and joyne with me in the action I would not doubt of facilitating the same and shew you a way to make your credits thrive by some worke of amazement and augment your glorie in purchasing your libertie I prethee be quiet said they againe and think not of impossibilities yet if you can but open such a doore of reason and probabilitie that we be not condemned for desperate and distracted persons in pulling the Sunne as it were out of the Firmament wee can but sacrifice our lives and you may be sure of secrecie and faithfulnesse The fifteenth of Januarie the morning water brought us neere Cape de Gatt hard by the shoare we having in our companie a smal Turkish ship of Warre that followed us out of Algier the next day and now ioyning with us gave us notice of seven small vessels sixe of them being Sallees and one Pollack who very quickly appeared in sight and so we made toward them but having more advantage of the Pollack then the rest and loth to lose all we both fetcht her up and brought her past hope of recoverie which when she perceived rather then she would voluntarily come into the slaverie of these Mahumetans she ran her selfe a shoare and so all the men forsooke her We still followed as neere as we durst and for feare of splitting let fall our anchors sending out both our boates wherein were many Musketeers and some English and Dutch Renegadoes who came aboord home at their Conge and found three pieces of Ordnance and foure Murtherers but they straightway threw them all over boord to lighten the ship and so they got her off being laden with Hides and Logwood for dying and presently sent her to Algier taking nine Turkes and one English Slave out of one ship and six out of the lesse which we thought sufficient to man her In the rifling of this Catelaynia our Turkes fell at variance one with another and in such a manner that we divided our selves the lesser ship returned to Algier and our Exchange tooke the opportunitie of the wind and plyed out of the Streights which reioyced Iohn Rawlins very much as resolving on some Stratageme when opportunities should serve In the meane while the Turkes began to murmurre and would not willingly goe into the Marr Granada as the phrase is amongst them notwithstanding the Moores being very superstitious were contented to be directed by their Hoshea who with us signifieth a Witch and is of great account and reputation amongst them as not going in any great Vessell to Sea without one and observing whatsoever he concludeth out of his Divination The Ceremonies they use are many and when they come into the Ocean every second or third night they make their Conjuration it beginneth and endeth with Prayer using many Characters and calling upon God by divers names yet at this time all that they did consisted in these particulars Upon the sight of two great ships and as wee were afraid of their chasing us they beeing supposed to bee Spanish men of Warre a great silence is commanded in the ship and when all is done the company giveth as great a skreech the Captaine comming to John Rawlins and sometimes making him take in all his sayles and sometimes causing him to hoyst them all out as the Witch findeth by his Booke and presages then have they two Arrowes and a Curtleaxe lying upon a Pillow naked the Arrowes are one for the Turkes and the other for the Christians then the Witch readeth and the Captaine or some other taketh the Arrowes in their hand by the heads and if the Arrow for the Christians commeth over the head of the Arrow for the Turkes then doe they advance their sayles and will not endure the fight whatsoever they see but if the Arrow of the Turkes is found in the opening of the hand upon the Arrow of the Christians then will they stay and encounter with any shippe whatsoever The Curtleaxe is taken up by some Childe that is innocent or rather ignorant of the Ceremonie and so layd downe againe then doe they observe whether the same side is uppermost which lay before and so proceed accordingly They also observe Lunatickes and Changelings and the Coniurer writeth downe their Sayings in a Booke groveling on the ground as if he whispered to the Devil to tell him the truth and so expoundeth the Letter as it were by inspiration Many other foolish Rites they have whereupon they doe dote as foolishly Whilest he was busied and made demonstration that all was finished the people in the ship gave a great shout and cryed out a sayle a sayle which at last was discovered to bee another man of Warre of Turkes For he made toward us and sent his Boat aboord us to whom our Captain complained that being becalmed by the Southerne Cape and having made no Voyage the Turkes denyed to goe any further Northward but the Captaine resolved not to returne to Algier except he could obtayne some Prize worthy his endurances but rather to goe to Salle and tell his Christians to victuall his ship which the other Captaine apprehended for his honour and so perswaded the Turkes to be obedient unto him whereupon followed a pacification amongst us and so that Turke tooke his course for the Streights and wee put up Northward expecting the good houre of some beneficiall bootie All this while our slavery continued and the Turkes with insulting tyrannie set us still on worke in all base and servile actions adding stripes and inhumane revilings even in our greatest labour whereupon Iohn Rawlins resolved to obtane his libertie and surprize the ship providing Ropes with broad spikes of Iron and all the Iron Crowes with which hee knew a way upon consent of the rest to ramme up or tye fast their Scuttels Gratings and Cabbins yea to shut up the Captaine himselfe with all his consorts and so to handle the matter that upon the watch word given the English being Masters of the Gunner roome Ordnance and Powder they would eyther blow them into the Ayre or kill them as they adventured to come downe one by one if they should by any chance open their Cabbins But because hee would proceed the better in his enterprise as he had somewhat abruptly discovered himselfe to the nine English slaves so he kept the same distance with the foure Hollanders that were free men till finding them comming somewhat toward them he acquainted them with the whole Conspiracie and they affecting the Plot offered the adventure of their lives in the businesse Then very warily he undermined the English Renegado which was the Gunner and three more his Associats who at first seemed to retract Last of all were brought in the Dutch Renegadoes who were also in the Gunner roome for alwayes there lay twelve there five Christians and seven English and Dutch Turkes so that when another motion had settled their resolutions and Iohn Rawlins his constancie had put new life as it were in the matter the foure Hollanders very honestly according to their promise sounded the Dutch Renegadoes who with easie perswasion gave their consent to so brave an Enterprize whereupon Iohn Rawlins not caring whether the English Gunners would yeeld or no resolved in the Captaines morning watch to make the attempt But you must understand that where the English slaves lay there hung up alwayes foure or five Crowes of Iron being still under the carriages of the Peeces and when the time approached being very darke because Iohn Rawlins would have his Crow of Iron ready as other things were and other men prepared in their severall places in taking it out of the carriage by chance it hit on the side of the Peece making such a noyse that the Souldiers hearing it awaked the Turkes and bade them come downe whereupon the Botesane of the Turkes descended with a Candle and presently searched all the slaves places making much adoe of the matter but finding neyther Hatchet nor Hammer nor any thing else to move suspicion of the Enterprize more then the Crow of Iron which lay slipped downe under the carriages of the Peeces they went quietly up againe and certified the Captaine what had chanced who satisfied himselfe that it was a common thing to have a Crow of Iron slip from its place But by this occasion wee made stay of our attempt yet were resolved to take another or a better oportunitie For we sayled still more North ward and Rawlins had more time to tamper with his Gunners and the rest of the English Renegadoes who very willingly when they considered the matter and perpended the reasons gave way unto the Proiect and with a kind of joy seemed to entertayne the motives only they made a stop at the first on set who should begin the enterprize which was no way fit for them to doe because they were no slaves but Renegadoes and so had always beneficiall entertaynment amongst them But when it is once put in practice they would be sure not to faile them but venture their lives for God and their Countrey But once againe he is disappointed and a suspitious accident brought him to recollect his spirits anew and studie on the danger of the enterprize and thus it was After the Renegado Gunner had protested secrecie by all that might induce a man to bestow some beliefe upon him he presently went up the Scottle but stayed not aloft a quarter of an houre nay he came sooner down in the Gunner roome sate by Rawlins who tarryed for him where he left him he was no sooner placed and entred into some conference but there entred into the place a furious Turke with his Knife drawne and presented it to Rawlins his body who verily supposed he intended to kill him as suspitious that the Gunner had discovered something whereat Rawlins was much moved and hastily asked what the matter meant and whether he would kill him observing his companion s countenance to change colour whereby his suspitious heart condemned him for a Traytor but at more leisure he sware the contrary and afterward proved faithfull and industrious in the enterprize For the present he answered Rawlins in this manner no Master be not afraid I thinke hee doth but iest With that John Rawlins gave backe a little and drew out his Knife stepping also to the Gunners sheath and taking out his whereby he had two Knives to one which when the Turke perceived he threw downe his Knife saying hee did but iest with him But when the Gunner perceived Rawlins tooke it so ill hee whispered something in his eare that at last satisfied him calling Heaven to witnesse that he never spake word of the Enterprize nor ever would either to the preiudice of the businesse or danger of his person Notwithstanding Rawlins kept the Knives in his sleeve all night and was somewhat troubled for that hee had made so many acquainted with an action of such importance but the next day when hee perceived the Coast cleere and that there was no cause of further feare hee somewhat comforted himselfe All this while Rawlins drew the Captaine to lye for the Northerne Cape assuring him that thereby he should not misse a prize which accordingly fell out as a wish would have it but his drift was in truth to draw him from any supply or help of Turkes if God should give way to their Enterprize or successe to the victorie yet for the present the sixth of February being twelve leagues from the Cape wee descryed a sayle and presently took the advantage of the wind in chasing her and at last fetched her up making her strike all her sayles whereby wee knew her to be a Barke belonging to Tor Bay neere Dartmouth that came from Auerure laden with Salt Ere we had fully dispatched it chanced to be foule weather so that we could not or at least would not make out our Boat but caused the Master of the Barke to let downe his and come aboord with his Company being in the Barke but nine men and one Boy and so the Master leaving his Mate with two men in the ship came himselfe with five men and the boy unto us whereupon our Turkish Captain sent ten Turkes to man her amongst whom were two Dutch and one English Renegado who were of our confederacie and acquainted with the businesse But when Rawlins saw this partition of his friends before they could hoyst out their Boat for the Barke he made meanes to speake with them and told them plainly that he would prosecute the matter eyther that night or the next and therefore whatsoever came of it they should acquaint the English with his resolution and make toward England bearing up the helme whiles the Turkes slept and suspected no such matter for by Gods grace in his first watch about mid night he would shew them a light by which they might understand that the Enterprize was begunne or at least in a good forwardnesse for the execution and so the Boat was let downe and they came to the Barke of Tor Bay where the Masters Mate beeing left as before you have heard apprehended quickly the matter and heard the Discourse with amazement But time was precious and not to be spent in disputing or casting of doubts whether the Turkes that were with them were able to master them or no beeing seven to sixe considering they had the helme of the ship and the Turkes being Souldiers and ignorant of Sea Affaires could not discover whether they went to Algier or no or if they did they resolved by Rawlins example to cut their throats or cast them over boord and so I leave them to make use of the Renegadoes instructions and returne to Rawlins againe The Master of the Barke of Tor Bay and his Company were quickly searched and as quickly pillaged and dismissed to the libertie of the shippe whereby Rawlins had leisure to entertayne him with the lamentable newes of their extremities and in a word of every particular which was befitting to the purpose yea he told him that that night he should lose the sight of them for they would make the helme for England and hee would that night and evermore pray for their good successe and safe deliverance When the Master of the Barke of Tor Bay had heard him out and that his company were partakers of his Storie they became all silent not eyther diffident of his Discourse or afraid of the attempt but resolved to assist him Yet to shew himselfe an understanding man hee demanded of Rawlins what weapons he had and in what manner he would execute the businesse to which he answered that he had Ropes and Iron Hookes to make fast the Scottels Gratings and Cabbines he had also in the Gunner roome two Curtleaxes and the slaves had five Crowes of Iron before them Besides in the scuffling they made no question of some of the Souldiers weapons Then for the manner hee told them they were sure of the Ordnance the Gunner roome and the Powder and so blocking them up would eyther kill them as they came downe or turne the Ordnance against their Cabbins or blow them into the Ayre by one Strategeme or other and thus were they contented on all sides and resolved to the Enterprize The next morning being the seventh of February the Prize of Tor Bay was not to bee seene or found whereat the Captaine began to storme and sweare commanding Rawlins to search the Seas up and downe for her who bestowed all that day in the businesse but to little purpose whereupon when the humour was spent the Captaine pacified himselfe as conceiting he should sure find her at Algier but by the permission of the Ruler of all actions that Algier was England and all his wickednesse frustrated for Rawlins beeing now startled lest hee should returne in this humour for the Streights on the eight of February went downe into the hold and finding a great deale of water below told the Captaine of the same adding that it did not come to the Pumpe which he said very politickly that he might remove the Ordnance For when the Captaine askt him the reason he told him the ship was too farre after the head then hee commanded to use the best meanes he could to bring her in order sure then quoth Rawlins wee must quit our Cables and bring foure Peeces of Ordnance after and that would bring the water to the Pumpe which was presently put in practice so the Peeces beeing usually made fast thwart the ship we brought two of them with their mouthes right before the Binnacle and because the Renegadoe Flemmings would not begin it was thus concluded that the ship having three Deckes wee that did belong to the Gunner roome should bee all there and breake up the lower Decke The English slaves who always lay in the middle Decks should doe the like and watch the Scuttels Rawlins himselfe prevayled with the Gunner for so much Powder as should prime the Peeces and so told them all there was no better watch word nor meanes to begin then upon the report of the Peece to make a cry and shout for God and King Iames and Saint George for England When all things were prepared and every man resolved as knowing what hee had to doe and the houre when it should happen to be two in the afternoone Rawlins advised the Master Gunner to speake to the Captaine that the Souldiers might attend on the Poope which would bring the ship after to which the Captaine was very willing and upon the Gunners information the Souldiers gat themselves to the Poope to the number of twentie and five or sixe went into the Captaines Cabbin where always lay divers Curtleaxes and some Targets and so wee fell to worke to pumpe the water and carryed the matter fairely till the next day which was spent as the former being the ninth of February and as God must have the prayse the triumph of our victorie For by that time all things were prepared and the Souldiers got upon the Poope as the day before to avoid suspition all that did belong to the Gunner roome went downe and the slaves in the middle decke attended their business so that we could cast up our account in this manner First nine English slaves besides Iohn Rawlins five of the Tor Bay men and one boy foure English Renegadoes and two French foure Hollanders in all four and twenty and a boy so that lifting up our hearts and hands to God for the successe of the businesse we were wonderfully incouraged and setled our selves till the report of the peece gave us warning of the enterprise Now you must consider that in this company were two of Rawlins men Iames Roe and Iohn Davies whom he brought out of England and whom the fortune of the Sea brought into the same predicament with their Master These were imployed about noone being as I said the ninth of February to prepare their matches while all the Turkes or at least most of them stood on the Poope to weigh down the ship as it were to bring the water forward to the Pumpe the one brought his match lighted betweene two spoons the other brought his in a little peece of a Can and so in the name of God the Turkes and Moores being placed as you have heard and five and forty in number and Rawlins having proined the Tuch holes Iames Roe gave fire to one of the peeces about two of the clocke in the afternoone and the confederates upon the warning shouted most cheerefully the report of the peece did teare and breake down all the Binnacle and compasses and the noise of the slaves made all the Souldiers amased at the matter till seeing the quarter of the ship rent and feeling the whole body to shake under them understanding the ship was surprised and the attempt tended to their utter destruction never Beare robbed of her whelpes was so fell and mad For they not onely cald us dogs and cried out Usance de Lamair which is as much to say the Fortune of the wars but attempted to teare up the planckes setting a worke hammers hatchets knives the oares of the Boate the Boat hooke their curtleaxes and what else came to hand besides stones and brickes in the Cooke roome all which they threw amongst us attempting still and still to breake and rip up the hatches and boords of the steering not desisting from their former execrations and horrible blasphemies and revilings When Iohn Rawlins perceived them so violent and understood how the slaves had cleared the deckes of all the Turkes and Moores beneath he set a guard upon the Powder and charged their owne Muskets against them killing them from divers scout holes both before and behind and so lessened their number to the ioy of all our hearts whereupon they cried out and called for the Pilot and so Rawlins with some to guard him went to them and understood them by their kneeling that they cried for mercy and to have their lives saved and they would come downe which he bade them doe and so they were taken one by one and bound yea killed with their owne Curtleaxes which when the rest perceived they called us English dogs and reviled us with many opprobrious termes some leaping over boord crying it was the chance of war some were manacled and so throwne over boord and some were slaine and mangled with the Curtleaxes till the ship was well cleared and our selves assured of the victory At the first report of our Peece and hurliburly in the decks the Captaine was a writing in his Cabbin and hearing the noyse thought it some strange accident and so came out with his Curtleaxe in his hand presuming by his authority to pacifie the mischiefe But when hee cast his eyes upon us and saw that we were like to surprise the ship he threw downe his Curtleaxe and begged us to save his life intimating unto Rawlins how he had redeemed him from Villa Rise and ever since admitted him to place of command in the ship besides honest usage in the whole course of the Voyage All which Rawlins confessed and at last condescended to mercy and brought the Captaine and five more into England The Captain was called Ramtham Rise but his Christen name Henry Chandler and as they say was a Chandler s sonne in Southwarke Iohn Goodale was also an English Turke Richard Clarke in Turkish Iafar George Cooke Ramdam Iohn Browne Mamme William Winter Mustapha besides all the slaves and Hollanders with other Renegadoes who were willing to be reconciled to their true Saviour as being formerly seduced with the hopes of riches honour preferment and such like devillish baits to catch the soules of mortall men and entangle frailty in the fetters of horrible abuses and imposturing deceit When all was done and the ship cleared of the dead bodies Iohn Rawlins assembled his men together and with one consent gave the praise unto God using the accustomed service on ship boord and for want of bookes lifted up their voyces to God as he put into their hearts or renewed their memories then did they sing a Psalme and last of all embraced one another for playing the men in such a Deliverance whereby our feare was turned into joy and trembling hearts exhillirated that we had escaped such inevitable dangers and especially the slavery and terror of bondage worse than death it selfe The same night we washed our ship put every thing in as good order as we could repaired the broken quarter set up the Binnacle and bore up the Helme for England where by Gods grace and good guiding we arrived at Plimmoth the thirteenth of February and were welcommed like the recovery of the lost sheepe or as you read of a loving mother that runneth with embraces to entertaine her sonne from a long Voyage and escape of many dangers Not long after we understood of our confederats that returned home in the Barke of Torbay that they arrived in Pensance in Corne wall the eleventh of February and if any aske after their deliverance considering there were ten Turkes sent to man her I will tell you that too the next day after they lost us as you have heard and that the three Renegadoes had acquainted the Masters Mate and the two English in her with Rawlins determination and that they themselves would be true to them and assist them in any enterprise then if the worst came there were but seven to sixe but as it fell out they had a more easie passage then turmoile or man slaughter For they made the Turkes beleeve the wind was come faire and that they were sayling to Algier till they came within sight of England which one of them amongst the rest discovered saying plainely that that land was not like Cape Vincent yes faith said he that was at the Helme and you will be contented and goe downe into the hold and trim the salt over to wind ward whereby the ship may beare full saile you shall know and see more to morrow Whereupon five of them went downe very orderly the Renegadoes faining themselves asleep who presently start up and with the helpe of the two English nailed downe the hatches whereat the principall amongst them much repined and began to grow into choller and rage had it not quickly beene suppressed For one of them stepped to him and dasht out his braines and threw him over boord the rest were brought to Excester and either to be arraigned according to the punishment of delinquents in such a kind or disposed of as the King and Counsell shall thinke meet and this is the story of this deliverance and end of Iohn Rawlins Voyage The Actors in this Comick Tragedie are most of them alive The Turkes are in prison the ship is to be seene and Rawlins himselfe dare justifie

3245-169642-0001	train-other-500	In this time I pursued my voyage coasted the whole Malabar shore and met with no purchase but a great Portugal East India ship which I chased into Goa where she got out of my reach
3245-169642-0002	train-other-500	I took several small vessels and barks but little of value in them till I entered the great Bay of Bengal when I began to look about me with more expectation of success
3245-169642-0003	train-other-500	though without prospect of what happened I cruised here about two months finding nothing worth while so I stood away to a port on the north point of the isle of Sumatra where I made no stay
none	none	 for here I got news that two large ships belonging to the Great Mogul were expected to cross the bay from Hoogly in the Ganges 
3245-169642-0004	train-other-500	to the country of the King of Pegu being to carry the granddaughter of the Great Mogul to Pegu who was to be married to the king of that country
none	none	 with all her retinue 
3245-169642-0005	train-other-500	jewels and wealth This was a booty worth watching for though it had been some months longer so I resolved that we would go and cruise off Point Negaris on the east side of the bay near Diamond Isle
3245-169642-0006	train-other-500	and here we plied off and on for three weeks and began to despair of success but the knowledge of the booty we expected spurred us on and we waited with great patience for we knew the prize would be immensely rich
3245-169642-0007	train-other-500	At length we spied three ships coming right up to us with the wind We could easily see they were not Europeans by their sails and began to prepare ourselves for a prize not for a fight
none	none	 but were a little disappointed when we found the first ship full of guns and full of soldiers and in condition had she been managed by English sailors to have fought two such ships as ours were 
3245-169642-0008	train-other-500	However we resolved to attack her if she had been full of devils as she was full of men Accordingly when we came near them we fired a gun with shot as a challenge
none	none	 They fired again immediately three or four guns but fired them so confusedly that we could easily see they did not understand their business when we considered how to lay them on board 
3245-169642-0009	train-other-500	and so to come thwart them if we could but falling for want of wind open to them we gave them a fair broadside We could easily see by the confusion that was on board that they were frightened out of their wits
3245-169642-0010	train-other-500	they fired here a gun and there a gun and some on that side that was from us as well as those that were next to us The next thing we did was to lay them on board which we did presently and then gave them a volley of our small shot which
3245-169642-0011	train-other-500	as they stood so thick killed a great many of them and made all the rest run down under their hatches crying out like creatures bewitched In a word we presently took the ship and having secured her men we chased the other two
3245-169642-0012	train-other-500	One was chiefly filled with women and the other with lumber Upon the whole as the granddaughter of the Great Mogul was our prize in the first ship so in the second was her women or in a word her household
3245-169642-0013	train-other-500	her eunuchs all the necessaries of her wardrobe of her stables and of her kitchen and in the last great quantities of household stuff and things less costly though not less useful But the first was the main prize
none	none	 When my men had entered and mastered the ship one of our lieutenants called for me 
3245-169642-0014	train-other-500	and accordingly I jumped on board He told me he thought nobody but I ought to go into the great cabin or at least nobody should go there before me for that the lady herself and all her attendance was there
3245-169642-0015	train-other-500	and he feared the men were so heated they would murder them all or do worse I immediately went to the great cabin door taking the lieutenant that called me along with me
none	none	 and caused the cabin door to be opened 
3245-169642-0016	train-other-500	But such a sight of glory and misery was never seen by buccaneer before The queen for such she was to have been was all in gold and silver but frightened and crying
3245-169642-0017	train-other-500	and at the sight of me she appeared trembling and just as if she was going to die She sat on the side of a kind of a bed like a couch with no canopy over it or any covering only made to lie down upon
none	none	 She was in a manner covered with diamonds and I like a true pirate soon let her see that I had more mind to the jewels than to the lady However before I touched her I ordered the lieutenant to place a guard at the cabin door and fastening the door shut us both in 
3245-169642-0018	train-other-500	which he did The lady was young and I suppose in their country esteem very handsome but she was not very much so in my thoughts At first her fright
3245-169642-0019	train-other-500	and the danger she thought she was in of being killed taught her to do everything that she thought might interpose between her and danger and that was to take off her jewels as fast as she could and give them to me and I
3245-169642-0020	train-other-500	without any great compliment took them as fast as she gave them me and put them into my pocket taking no great notice of them or of her which frighted her worse than all the rest and she said something which I could not understand
3245-169642-0021	train-other-500	However two of the other ladies came all crying and kneeled down to me with their hands lifted up What they meant I knew not at first
3245-169642-0022	train-other-500	but by their gestures and pointings I found at last it was to beg the young queen s life and that I would not kill her When the three ladies kneeled down to me
none	none	 and as soon as I understood what it was for 
3245-169642-0023	train-other-500	I let them know I would not hurt the queen nor let any one else hurt her but that she must give me all her jewels and money Upon this they acquainted her that I would save her life and no sooner had they assured her of that
3245-169642-0024	train-other-500	but she got up smiling and went to a fine Indian cabinet and opened a private drawer from whence she took another little thing full of little square drawers and holes
3245-169642-0025	train-other-500	This she brings to me in her hand and offered to kneel down to give it me This innocent usage began to rouse some good nature in me though I never had much and I would not let her kneel
3245-169642-0026	train-other-500	but sitting down myself on the side of her couch or bed made a motion to her to sit down too But here she was frightened again it seems
none	none	 at what I had no thought of 
3245-169642-0027	train-other-500	But as I did not offer anything of that kind only made her sit down by me they began all to be easier after some time and she gave me the little box or casket I know not what to call it but it was full of invaluable jewels
3245-169642-0028	train-other-500	I have them still in my keeping and wish they were safe in England for I doubt not but some of them are fit to be placed on the king s crown Being master of this treasure I was very willing to be good humored to the persons
none	none	 so I went out of the cabin and caused the women to be left alone 
3245-169642-0029	train-other-500	causing the guard to be kept still that they might receive no more injury than I would do them myself After I had been out of the cabin some time a slave of the women s came to me and made sign to me that the queen would speak with me again
3245-169642-0030	train-other-500	I made signs back that I would come and dine with her majesty and accordingly I ordered that her servants should prepare her dinner and carry it in and then call me They provided her repast after the usual manner
3245-169642-0031	train-other-500	and when she saw it brought in she appeared pleased and more when she saw me come in after it for she was exceedingly pleased that I had caused a guard to keep the rest of my men from her
none	none	 and she had it seems been told how rude they had been to some of the women that belonged to her When I came in she rose up and paid me such respect as I did not well know how to receive and not in the least how to return 
3245-169642-0032	train-other-500	If she had understood English I could have said plainly and in good rough words Madam be easy we are rude rough hewn fellows but none of our men should hurt you or touch you
none	none	 I will be your guard and protection 
3245-169642-0033	train-other-500	we are for money indeed and we shall take what you have but we will do you no other harm But as I could not talk thus to her I scarce knew what to say
3245-169642-0034	train-other-500	but I sat down and made signs to have her sit down and eat which she did but with so much ceremony that I did not know well what to do with it
none	none	 After we had eaten she rose up again 
3245-169642-0035	train-other-500	and drinking some water out of a china cup sat her down on the side of the couch as before When she saw I had done eating she went then to another cabinet and pulling out a drawer she brought it to me
none	none	 it was full of small pieces of gold coin of Pegu about as big as an English half guinea and I think there were three thousand of them She opened several other drawers and showed me the wealth that was in them and then gave me the key of the whole We had revelled thus all day and part of the next day in a bottomless sea of riches when my lieutenant began to tell me we must consider what to do with our prisoners and the ships 
3245-169642-0036	train-other-500	for that there was no subsisting in that manner Upon this we called a short council and concluded to carry the great ship away with us but to put all the prisoners queen ladies and all the rest into the lesser vessels and let them go
3245-169642-0037	train-other-500	and so far was I from ravishing this lady as I hear is reported of me that though I might rifle her of everything else yet I assure you I let her go untouched for me or as I am satisfied for any one of my men
none	none	 nay when we dismissed them we gave her leave to take a great many things of value with her which she would have been plundered of if I had not been so careful of her We had now wealth enough not only to make us rich 
3245-169642-0038	train-other-500	but almost to have made a nation rich and to tell you the truth considering the costly things we took here which we did not know the value of and besides gold and silver and jewels I say we never knew how rich we were
none	none	 besides which we had a great quantity of bales of goods as well calicoes as wrought silks 
3245-169642-0039	train-other-500	which being for sale were perhaps as a cargo of goods to answer the bills which might be drawn upon them for the account of the bride s portion all which fell into our hands with a great sum in silver coin
3245-169642-0040	train-other-500	too big to talk of among Englishmen especially while I am living
none	none	 for reasons which I may give you hereafter FOOTNOTES six From The King of the Pirates BARBAROSSA KING OF THE CORSAIRS seven E HAMILTON CURREY R N At the coming of spring Barbarossa was at sea again with thirty two ships ready for any eventuality his crews aflame with ardor for revenge against those by whom they had been so roughly handled He chose for the scene of operations a place on the coast of Majorca some fifteen miles from Palma from here he commanded the route of the Spaniards from their country to the African coast and it was against this nation that he felt a great bitterness owing to recent events Eagerly did the corsair and his men watch for the Spanish ships the heavier vessels lying at anchor but the light swift galleys ranging and questing afar so that none might be missed Very soon the vigilance of the Moslems was rewarded by the capture of a number of vessels sent by Bernard de Mendoza laden with Turkish and Moorish slaves destined to be utilized as rowers in the Spanish galleys These men were hailed as a welcome reinforcement and joyfully joined the forces of Kheyr ed Din when he moved on Minorca captured the castle by a surprise assault raided the surrounding country and captured five thousand seven hundred Christians amongst whom were eight hundred men who had been wounded in the attack on Tunis all these unfortunates were sent to refill the bagnio of Algiers This private war of revenge was however destined soon to come to an end as Soliman the Magnificent in this year became involved in disputes with the Venetian Republic and recalled that veritable man of the sea as Barbarossa had been described by Ibrahim to Constantinople In this city by the sea there had taken place a tragedy which although it only involved the death of a single man was nevertheless far reaching in its consequences for the man was none other than that great statesman Ibrahim Grand Vizier and the only trusted counsellor of the Padishah He who had been originally a slave had risen step by step in the favor of his master until he arrived at the giddy eminence which he occupied at the time of his death It is a somewhat curious commentary on the essentially democratic status of an autocracy that a man could thus rise to a position second only to that of the autocrat himself and in all probability wielding quite as much power Ibrahim had for years been treated by Soliman more as a brother than as a dependent which in spite of his Grand Viziership he was in fact They lived in the very closest communion taking their meals together and even sleeping in the same room Soliman a man of high intelligence himself and a ruler who kept in touch with all the happenings which arose in his immense dominions desiring always to have at hand the man whom he loved from whom with his amazing grip of political problems and endless fertility of resource he was certain of sympathy and sound advice But in an oriental despotism there are other forces at work besides those of la haute politique and Ibrahim had one deadly enemy who was sworn to compass his destruction The Sultana Roxalana was the light of the harem of the Grand Turk This supremely beautiful woman originally a Russian slave was the object of the most passionate devotion on the part of Soliman but she was as ambitious as she was lovely and brooked no rival in the affections of Soliman be that person man woman or child In her hands the master of millions the despot whose nod was death became a submissive slave the undisciplined passions of this headstrong woman swept aside from her path all those whom she suspected of sharing her influence in no matter how remote a fashion At her dictation had Soliman caused to be murdered his son Mustafa a youth of the brightest promise because in his intelligence and his winning ways he threatened to eclipse Selim the son of Roxalana herself This woman possessed a strong natural intelligence albeit she was totally uneducated she saw and knew that Ibrahim was all powerful with her lover and this roused her jealousy to fever heat She was not possessed of a cool judgment which would have told her that Ibrahim was a statesman dealing with the external affairs of the Sublime Porte and that with her and with her affairs he neither desired nor had he the power to interfere What however the Sultana did know was that in these same affairs of State her opinion was dust in the balance when weighed against that of the Grand Vizier Soliman had that true attribute of supreme greatness the unerring aptitude for the choice of the right man He had picked out Ibrahim from among his immense entourage and never once had he regretted his choice As time went on and the intellect and power of the man became more and more revealed to his master that sovereign left in his hands even such matters as despots are apt to guard most jealously We have seen how in spite of the murmurings of the whole of his capital and the almost insubordinate attitude of his navy he had persevered in the appointment of Kheyr ed Din Barbarossa because the judgment of Ibrahim was in favor of its being carried out This to Roxalana was gall and wormwood well she knew that as long as the Grand Vizier lived her sovereignty was at best but a divided one There was a point at which her blandishments stopped short this was when she found that her opinion did not coincide with that of the minister She was as we have seen in the instance of her son not a woman to stick at trifles and she decided that Ibrahim must die There could be no hole and corner business about this he must die and when his murder had been accomplished she would boldly avow to her lover what she had done and take the consequences believing in her power over him to come scatheless out of the adventure In those days when human life was so cheap she might have asked for the death of almost any one and her whim would have been gratified by a lover who had not hesitated to put to death his own son at her dictation But with Ibrahim it was another matter he was the familiar of the Sultan his alter ego in fact It says much for the nerve of the Sultana that she dared so greatly on this memorable and lamentable occasion On March fifth fifteen thirty six Ibrahim went to the royal seraglio and following his ancient custom was admitted to the table of his master sleeping after the meal at his side At least so it was supposed but none knew save those engaged in the murder what passed on that fatal night the next day his dead body lay in the house of the Sultan Across the floor of jasper in that palace which was a fitting residence for one rightly known as The Magnificent the blood of Ibrahim flowed to the feet of Roxalana The disordered clothing the terrible expression of the face of the dead man the gaping wounds which he had received bore witness that there had taken place a grim struggle before that iron frame and splendid intellect had been leveled with the dust This much leaked out afterwards as such things will leak out and then the Sultana took Soliman into her chamber and gazed up into his eyes The man was stunned by the immensity of the calamity which had befallen him and his kingdom but his manhood availed him not against the wiles of this Circe Ibrahim had been foully done to death in his own palace and this woman clinging so lovingly round his neck now was the murderess The heart s blood of his best friend was coagulating on the threshold of his own apartment when he forgave her by whom his murder had been accomplished This was the vengeance of Roxalana and who shall say that it was not complete The Ottoman Empire was the poorer by the loss of its greatest man the jealousy of the Sultana was assuaged the despot who had permitted this unavenged murder was still on the throne thrall to the woman who had first murdered his son and then his friend and minister But the deed carried with it the evil consequences which were only too likely to occur when so capable a head of the State was removed at so critical a time Renewed strife was in the air and endless squabbles between Venice and the Porte were taking place With these we have no concern but in addition to other complaints there were loud and continuous ones concerning the corsairs Venice The Bride of the Sea had neither rest nor peace the pirates swarmed in Corfu in Zante in Candia in Cephalonia and the plunder and murder of the subjects of the Republic was the theme of the perpetual representations to the Sultan The balance of advantage in this guerilla warfare was with the corsairs until Girolame Canale a Venetian captain seized one of the Moslem leaders known as The Young Moor of Alexandria The victory of Canale was somewhat an important one as he captured the galley of The Young Moor and four others two more were sunk and three hundred Janissaries and one thousand slaves fell into the hands of the Venetian commander There being an absence of nice feeling on the part of the Venetians the Janissaries were at once beheaded to a man The whole story is an illustration of the extraordinary relations existing among the Mediterranean States at this time Soliman the Magnificent Sultan of Turkey had lent three hundred of his Janissaries his own picked troops to assist the corsairs in their depredations on Venetian commerce Having done this and the Janissaries having been caught and summarily and rightly put to death as pirates the Sultan as soon as he heard of what had occurred sent an ambassador one Yonis Bey to Venice to demand satisfaction for the insult passed upon him by the beheading of his own soldiers turned pirates The conclusion of the affair was that the Venetians released The Young Moor of Alexandria as soon as he was cured of the eight wounds which he had received in the conflict and sent him back to Africa with such of his galleys as were left There was one rather comical incident in connection with this affair which was that when Yonis Bey was on his way from Constantinople to Venice he was chased by a Venetian fleet under the command of the Count Grandenico and driven ashore The Count was profuse in his apologies when he discovered that he had been chasing a live ambassador but the occurrence so exasperated Soliman that he increased his demands in consequence Barbarossa who had spent his time harrying the Spaniards at sea ever since the fall of Tunis was shortly to appear on the scene again He received orders from the Sultan and came as fast as a favoring wind would bring him Kheyr ed Din had been doing well in the matter of slaves and plunder but he knew that with the backing of the Grand Turk he would once again be in command of a fleet in which he might repeat his triumph of past years and prove himself once more the indispensable man of the sea Soon after his arrival his ambitions were gratified and he found himself with a fleet of one hundred ships Since the death of Ibrahim and the incident which terminated with the dispatch of Yonis Bey to Venice the relations between the Grand Turk and the Venetian Republic had become steadily worse and at last the Sultan declared war On May seventeenth fifteen thirty seven Soliman accompanied by his two sons Selim and Mohammed left Constantinople With the campaign conducted by the Sultan we are not concerned here it was directed against the Ionian Islands which had been in the possession of Venice since fourteen oh one On August eighteenth Soliman laid siege to Corfu and was disastrously beaten re embarking his men on September seventh after losing thousands in a fruitless attack on the fortress He returned to Constantinople utterly discomfited It was the seventh campaign which the Sultan had conducted in person but the first in which the ever faithful Ibrahim had not been by his side This defeat at the hands of the Venetians was not however the only humiliation which he was destined to experience in this disastrous year for once again Doria that scourge of the Moslem was loose upon the seas and was making his presence felt in the immediate neighborhood of Corfu where the Turks had been defeated On July seventeenth Andrea had left the port of Messina with twenty five galleys had captured ten richly laden Turkish ships gutted and burned them Kheyr ed Din was at sea at the time but the great rivals were not destined to meet on this occasion Instead of Barbarossa Andrea fell in with Ali Chabelli the lieutenant of Sandjak Bey of Gallipoli On July twenty second the Genoese admiral and the Turkish commander from the Dardanelles met to the southward of Corfu off the small island of Paxo and a smart action ensued It ended in the defeat of Ali Chabelli whose galleys were captured and towed by Doria into Paxo That veteran fighter was himself in the thickest of the fray and conspicuous in his crimson doublet had been an object of attention to the marksmen of Chabelli during the entire action In spite of the receipt of a severe wound in the knee the admiral refused to go below until victory was assured He was surrounded at this time by a devoted band of nobles sworn to defend the person of their admiral or to die in his defense His portrait has been sketched for us at this time by the Dominican Friar Padre Alberto Guglielmotto author of La guerra dei Pirati e la marina Pontifica dal fifteen hundred al fifteen sixty The description runs thus Andrea Doria was of lofty stature his face oval in shape forehead broad and commanding his neck was powerful his hair short his beard long and fan shaped his lips were thin his eyes bright and piercing Once again had he defeated an officer of the Grand Turk and it may be remarked that Ibrahim was probably quite right in the estimation or rather in the lack of estimation in which he held the sea officers of his master as they seem to have been deficient in every quality save that of personal valor and in their encounters with Doria and the knights were almost invariably worsted For the sake of Islam for the prestige of the Moslem arms at sea it was time that Barbarossa should take matters in hand once more The autumn of this year fifteen thirty seven proved that the old Sea wolf had lost none of his cunning that his followers were as terrible as ever What did it seem to matter that Venetian and Catalan Genoese and Frenchman Andalusian and the dwellers in the Archipelago were all banded together in league against this common foe Did not the redoubtable Andrea range the seas in vain and were not all the efforts of the Knights of Saint John futile when the son of the renegado from Mitylene and his Christian wife put forth from the Golden Horn What was the magic of this man it was asked despairingly that none seemed able to prevail against him Had it not been currently reported that Carlos Quinto the great Emperor had driven him forth from Tunis a hunted fugitive broken and penniless with never a galley left without one ducat in his pocket Was he so different then from all the rest of mankind that his followers would stick to him in evil report as well as in the height of his prosperity Men swore and women crossed themselves at the mention of his name Terrible as an army with banners indeed was Kheyr ed Din in this eventful summer things had gone badly with the crescent flag the Padishah was unapproachable in his palace brooding perchance on that might have been had he not sold his honor and the life of his only friend to gratify the malice of a she devil those in attendance on the Sultan trembled for the humor of the despot was black indeed But the veritable man of the sea was in some sort to console him for that which he had lost as never in his own history and there was none else with which it could be compared had the Corsair King made so fruitful a raid He ravaged the coasts of the Adriatic and the islands of the Archipelago sweeping in slaves by the thousand and by the end of the year he had collected eighteen thousand in the arsenal at Stamboul Great was the jubilation in Constantinople when the Admiralissimo himself returned from his last expedition against the infidel stilled were the voices which hinted disaffection who among them all could bring back four hundred thousand pieces of gold What mariner could offer to the Grand Turk such varied and magnificent presents Upon his arrival Barbarossa asked permission to kiss the threshold of the palace of the Sultan which boon being graciously accorded to him he made his triumphal entry Two hundred captives clad in scarlet robes carried cups of gold and flasks of silver behind them came thirty others each staggering under an enormous purse of sequins yet another two hundred brought collars of precious stones or bales of the choicest goods and a further two hundred were laden with sacks of small coin Certainly if Soliman the Magnificent had lost a Grand Vizier he had succeeded in finding an admiral All through the earlier months of fifteen thirty eight the dockyards of Constantinople hummed with a furious activity for Soliman had decreed that the maritime campaign of this year was to begin with no less than one hundred and fifty ships His admiral however did not agree with this decision to the Viziers he raged and stormed Listen he said O men of the land who understand naught of the happenings of the sea By this time Saleh Reis must have quitted Alexandria convoying to the Bosphorus twenty sail filled with the richest merchandise should he fall in with the accursed Genoese Doria where then will be Saleh Reis and his galleys and his convoy I will tell you the ships in Genoa the galleys burned Saleh Reis and all his mariners chained to the rowers bench The Viziers trembled as men did when Barbarossa stormed and turned upon them those terrible eyes which knew neither fear nor pity We be but men they answered and our lord the Sultan has so ordained it I have forty galleys replied the corsair you have forty more With these I will take the sea but mark you he continued softening somewhat you do right to fear the displeasure of the Sultan and I also have no wish to encounter it but vessels raised and equipped in a hurry will be of small use to me In the name of Allah the compassionate and his holy Prophet give me my eighty galleys and let me go In Kheyr ed Din Barbarossa sound strategical instinct went hand in hand with the desperate valor of the corsair To dally in the Golden Horn while so rich a prey was at sea to be picked up by his Christian foes was altogether opposed to his instincts never to throw away a chance in the game of life had ever been his guiding principle Soliman great man as he undoubtedly was had not the adamantine hardness of character which enabled his admiral to risk all on the hazards of the moment or possibly the Grand Turk was deficient in that clearness of strategical instinct which never in any circumstances foregoes a present advantage for something which may turn out well in a problematical future Soliman sore sullen and unapproachable dwelt in his palace brooding over the misfortunes which had been his lot since the death of Ibrahim Barbarossa who so recently had lost practically all that he possessed and who had reached an age at which most men have no hopes for the future was as clear in intellect as undaunted in spirit as if he had been half a century younger to be even once more with those by whom he had been defeated and dispossessed was the only thing now in his mind The capture of Saleh Reis and his convoy would be a triumph of which he could not bear to think Further it would add to the demoralization of the sea forces of the Sultan which were sadly in need of some striking success after the defeats which had so recently been their portion The Sultan had decided that one hundred and fifty ships were necessary his admiral thought otherwise There was too much at stake for him to dally at Constantinople his fiery energy swept all before it and in the end he had his way On June seventh fifteen thirty eight he finally triumphed over the hesitations of the Viziers and put to sea with eighty sail The Sultan from his kiosk the windows of which opened on the Bosphorus counted the ships Only eighty sail is that all he asked The trembling Viziers prostrated themselves before him O our Lord the Padishah they cried Saleh Reis comes from Alexandria with a rich convoy somewhere lurking is Andrea Doria the accursed it was necessary O Magnificent to send succor There was a pause in which the hearts of men beat as do those who know not but that the next moment may be their last on earth The Sultan stared from his window at the retreating ships in a silence like the silence of the grave At last he turned So be it he answered briefly but see to it that reinforcements do not lag upon the road If there had been activity in the dockyards before it was as nothing to the strenuous work that was to be done henceforward Before starting on this expedition Kheyr ed Din had made an innovation in the manning of some of the most powerful of his galleys which was of the utmost importance and which was to add enormously to the success of his future maritime enterprises The custom had always been that the Ottoman galleys had been rowed by Christians captured and enslaved of course the converse was true in the galleys of their foes There were for the size of the vessels an enormous number of men carried in the galleys of the sixteenth century and an average craft of this description would have on board some four hundred men of these however the proportion would be two hundred and fifty slaves to one hundred and fifty fighting men That which Kheyr ed Din now insisted upon was that a certain proportion of his most powerful units should be rowed by Moslem fighting men so that on the day of battle the oarsmen could join in the fray instead of remaining chained to their benches as was the custom with the slaves It is however an extraordinary testimony to the influence which the corsair had attained in Constantinople that he had been able to effect this change in the composition of some of his crews it must have been done with the active cooeperation of the Sultan as no authority less potent than that of the sovereign himself could have induced free men to undertake the terrible toil of rower in a galley This was reserved for the unfortunate slave on either side owing to the intolerable hardship of the life and results in the pace at which a galley proceeded through the water were usually obtained by an unsparing use of the lash on the naked bodies of the rowers This human material was used up in the most prodigal manner possible as those in command had not the inducement of treating the rowers well from that economic standpoint which causes a man to so use his beast of burden as to get the best work from him In the galley when a slave would row no more he was flung overboard and another was put in his place The admiral however even when backed by the Padishah could not man a large fleet of galleys with Moslem rowers and as there was a shortage in the matter of propelling power his first business was to collect slaves and for this purpose he visited the islands of the Archipelago The lot of the unhappy inhabitants of these was indeed a hard one They were nearer to the seat of the Moslem power than any other Christians they were in those days totally unable to resist an attack in force and in consequence were swept off in their thousands Seven islands cover the entrance to the Gulf of Volo The nearest to the coast is Skiathos which is also the most important it was defended by a castle built upon a rock This castle was attacked by Barbarossa who bombarded it for six days carried it by assault and massacred the garrison He spared the lives of the inhabitants of the island and by this means secured three thousand four hundred rowers for his galleys He had to provide motor power for the reinforcements which he expected In July he was reinforced from Constantinople by ninety galleys while from Egypt came Saleh Reis who had succeeded in avoiding the terrible Doria with twenty more the fleet was thus complete FOOTNOTES seven From Sea Wolves of the Mediterranean MORGAN AT PUERTO BELLO eight JOHN ESQUEMELING Some may think that the French having deserted Captain Morgan the English alone could not have sufficient courage to attempt such great actions as before But Captain Morgan who always communicated vigor with his words infused such spirit into his men as put them instantly upon new designs He inspired them with the belief that the sole execution of his orders would be a certain means of obtaining great riches which so influenced their minds that with inimitable courage they all resolved to follow him as did also a certain pirate of Campechy on this occasion joined with Captain Morgan to seek new fortunes under his conduct Thus Captain Morgan in a few days gathered a fleet of nine sail either ships or great boats wherein he had four hundred and sixty military men All things being ready they put forth to sea Captain Morgan imparting his design to nobody at present he only told them on several occasions that he doubted not to make a good fortune by that voyage if strange occurrences happened not They steered towards the continent where they arrived in a few days near Costa Rica all their fleet safe No sooner had they discovered land but Captain Morgan declared his intentions to the captains and presently after to the company He told them he intended to plunder Puerto Bello by night being resolved to put the whole city to the sack and to encourage them he added this enterprise could not fail seeing he had kept it secret without revealing it to anybody whereby they could not have notice of his coming To this proposition some answered they had not a sufficient number of men to assault so strong and great a city But Captain Morgan replied If our number is small our hearts are great and the fewer persons we are the more union and better shares we shall have in the spoil Hereupon being stimulated with the hope of those vast riches they promised themselves from their success they unanimously agreed to that design Now that my reader may better comprehend the boldness of this exploit it may be necessary to say something beforehand of the city of Puerto Bello This city is in the province of Costa Rica ten deg north latitude fourteen leagues from the gulf of Darien and eight westwards from the port called Nombre de Dios It is judged the strongest place the king of Spain possesses in all the West Indies except Havanna and Carthagena Here are two castles almost impregnable that defend the city situate at the entry of the port so that no ship or boat can pass without permission The garrison consists of three hundred soldiers and the town is inhabited by four hundred families The merchants dwell not here but only reside a while when the galleons come from or go for Spain by reason of the unhealthiness of the air occasioned by vapors from the mountains so that though their chief warehouses are at Puerto Bello their habitations are at Panama whence they bring the plate upon mules when the fair begins and when the ships belonging to the company of negroes arrive to sell slaves Captain Morgan who knew very well all the avenues of this city and the neighboring coasts arrived in the evening with his men at Puerto de Naos ten leagues to the west of Puerto Bello Being come hither they sailed up the river to another harbor called Puerto Pontin where they anchored here they put themselves into boats and canoes leaving in the ships only a few men to bring them next day to the port About midnight they came to a place called Estera longa Lemos where they all went on shore and marched by land to the first posts of the city They had in their company an Englishman formerly a prisoner in those parts who now served them for a guide To him and three or four more they gave commission to take the sentinel if possible or kill him on the place but they seized him so cunningly as he had no time to give warning with his musket or make any noise and brought him with his hands bound to Captain Morgan who asked him how things went in the city and what forces they had with other circumstances he desired to know After every question they made him a thousand menaces to kill him if he declared not the truth Then they advanced to the city carrying the said sentinel bound before them having marched about a quarter of a league they came to the castle near the city which presently they closely surrounded so that no person could get either in or out Being posted under the walls of the castle Captain Morgan commanded the sentinel whom they had taken prisoner to speak to those within charging them to surrender to his discretion otherwise they should all be cut in pieces without quarter But disregarding these threats they began instantly to fire which alarmed the city yet notwithstanding though the governor and soldiers of the said castle made as great resistance as could be they were forced to surrender Having taken the castle Morgan resolved to be as good as his word putting the Spaniards to the sword thereby to strike a terror into the rest of the city Whereupon having shut up all the soldiers and officers as prisoners into one room they set fire to the powder whereof they found great quantity and blew up the castle into the air with all the Spaniards that were within This done they pursued the course of their victory falling upon the city which as yet was not ready to receive them Many of the inhabitants cast their precious jewels and money into wells and cisterns or hid them in places underground to avoid as much as possible being totally robbed One of the party of pirates assigned to this purpose ran immediately to the cloisters and took as many religious men and women as they could find The governor of the city not being able to rally the citizens through their great confusion retired to one of the castles remaining and thence fired incessantly at the pirates but these were not in the least negligent either to assault him or defend themselves so that amidst the horror of the assault they made very few shots in vain for aiming with great dexterity at the mouths of the guns the Spaniards were certain to lose one or two men every time they charged each gun anew The fight continued very furious from break of day till noon indeed about this time of the day the case was very dubious which party should conquer or be conquered At last the pirates perceiving they had lost many men and yet advanced but little towards gaining either this or the other castles made use of fire balls which they threw with their hands designing to burn the doors of the castles But the Spaniards from the walls let fall great quantities of stones and earthen pots full of powder and other combustible matter which forced them to desist Captain Morgan seeing this desperate defence made by the Spaniards began to despair of success Hereupon many faint and calm meditations came into his mind neither could he determine which way to turn himself in that strait Being thus puzzled he was suddenly animated to continue the assault by seeing the English colors put forth at one of the lesser castles then entered by his men of whom he presently after spied a troop coming to meet him proclaiming victory with loud shouts of joy This instantly put him on new resolutions of taking the rest of the castles especially seeing the chiefest citizens were fled to them and had conveyed thither great part of their riches with all the plate belonging to the churches and divine service To this effect he ordered ten or twelve ladders to be made in all haste so broad that three or four men at once might ascend them these being finished he commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle This he had before threatened the governor to do if he delivered not the castle but his answer was he would never surrender himself alive Captain Morgan was persuaded the governor would not employ his utmost force on seeing the religious women and ecclesiastical persons exposed in the front of the soldiers to the greatest danger Thus the ladders as I have said were at once put into the hands of religious persons of both sexes and these were forced at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls But Captain Morgan was fully deceived in his judgment of this design for the governor who acted like a brave soldier in performance of his duty used his utmost endeavor to destroy whomsoever came near the walls The religious men and women ceased not to cry to him and beg of him by all the saints of heaven to deliver the castle and spare both his and their own lives but nothing could prevail with his obstinacy and fierceness Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed before they could fix the ladders which at last being done though with great loss of their number the pirates mounted them in great numbers and with reckless valor having fire balls in their hands and earthen pots full of powder which being now at the top of the walls they kindled and cast down among the Spaniards This effort of the pirates was very great insomuch that the Spaniards could not longer resist nor defend the castle which was now entered Hereupon they all threw down their arms and craved quarter for their lives only the governor of the city would crave no mercy but killed many of the pirates with his own hands and not a few of his own soldiers because they did not stand to their arms And though the pirates asked him if he would have quarter yet he constantly answered By no means I had rather die as a valiant soldier than be hanged as a coward They endeavored as much as they could to take him prisoner but he defended himself so obstinately that they were forced to kill him notwithstanding all the cries and tears of his own wife and daughter who begged him on their knees to demand quarter and save his life When the pirates had possessed themselves of the castle which was about nightfall they enclosed therein all the prisoners placing the women and men by themselves with some guards The wounded were put in an apartment by themselves that their own complaints might be the cure of their diseases for no other was afforded them This done they fell to eating and drinking and as usual to committing all manner of debauchery and excess so that fifty courageous men might easily have retaken the city and killed all the pirates Next day having plundered all they could find they examined some of the prisoners who had been persuaded by their companions to say they were the richest of the town charging them severely to discover where they had hid their riches and goods Not being able to extort anything from them they not being the right persons it was resolved to torture them this they did so cruelly that many of them died on the rack or presently after Now the president of Panama being advertised of the pillage and ruin of Puerto Bello he employed all his care and industry to raise forces to pursue and cast out the pirates thence but these cared little for his preparations having their ships at hand and determining to fire the city and retreat They had now been at Puerto Bello fifteen days in which time they had lost many of their men both by the unhealthiness of the country and their extravagant debaucheries Hereupon they prepared to depart carrying on board all the pillage they had got having first provided the fleet with sufficient victuals for the voyage While these things were doing Captain Morgan demanded of the prisoners a ransom for the city or else he would burn it down and blow up all the castles withal he commanded them to send speedily two persons to procure the sum which was one hundred thousand pieces of eight To this effect two men were sent to the president of Panama who gave him an account of all The president having now a body of men ready set forth towards Puerto Bello to encounter the pirates before their retreat but they hearing of his coming instead of flying away went out to meet him at a narrow passage which he must pass here they placed a hundred men very well armed which at the first encounter put to flight a good party of those of Panama This obliged the president to retire for that time not being yet in a posture of strength to proceed farther Presently after he sent a message to Captain Morgan to tell him that if he departed not suddenly with all his forces from Puerto Bello he ought to expect no quarter for himself nor his companions when he should take them as he hoped soon to do Captain Morgan who feared not his threats knowing he had a secure retreat in his ships which were at hand answered he would not deliver the castles before he had received the contribution money he had demanded which if it were not paid down he would certainly burn the whole city and then leave it demolishing beforehand the castles and killing the prisoners The governor of Panama perceived by this answer that no means would serve to mollify the hearts of the pirates nor reduce them to reason whereupon he determined to leave the inhabitants of the city to make the best agreement they could In a few days more the miserable citizens gathered the contributions required and brought one hundred thousand pieces of eight to the pirates for their ransom The president of Panama was much amazed that four hundred men could take such a great city with so many strong castles especially having no ordnance wherewith to raise batteries and knowing the citizens of Puerto Bello had always great repute of being good soldiers themselves who never wanted courage in their own defence His astonishment was so great that he sent to Captain Morgan desiring some small pattern of those arms wherewith he had taken with such vigor so great a city Captain Morgan received this messenger very kindly and with great civility and gave him a pistol and a few small bullets to carry back to the president his master telling him withal he desired him to accept that slender pattern of the arms wherewith he had taken Puerto Bello and keep them for a twelvemonth after which time he promised to come to Panama and fetch them away nine The governor returned the present very soon to Captain Morgan giving him thanks for the favor of lending him such weapons as he needed not and withal sent him a ring of gold with this message that he desired him not to give himself the labor of coming to Panama as he had done to Puerto Bello for he did assure him he should not speed so well here as he had done there After this Captain Morgan having provided his fleet with all necessaries and taken with him the best guns of the castles nailing up the rest set sail from Puerto Bello with all his ships and arriving in a few days at Cuba he sought out a place wherein he might quickly make the dividend of their spoil They found in ready money two hundred fifty thousand pieces of eight besides other merchandise as cloth linen silks et cetera With this rich purchase they sailed thence to their common place of rendezvous Jamaica Being arrived they passed here some time in all sorts of vices and debaucheries according to their custom spending very prodigally what others had gained with no small labor and toil FOOTNOTES eight From The Buccaneers of America nine This promise was kept See The Capture of Panama footnote THE WAYS OF THE BUCCANEERS ten JOHN MASEFIELD after JOHN ESQUEMELING Throughout the years of buccaneering the buccaneers often put to sea in canoas and periaguas just as Drake put to sea in his three pinnaces Life in an open boat is far from pleasant but men who passed their leisure cutting logwood at Campeachy or hoeing tobacco in Jamaica or toiling over gramma grass under a hot sun after cattle were not disposed to make the worst of things They would sit contentedly upon the oar bench rowing with a long slow stroke for hours together without showing signs of fatigue Nearly all of them were men of more than ordinary strength and all of them were well accustomed to the climate When they had rowed their canoa to the Main they were able to take it easy till a ship came by from one of the Spanish ports If she seemed a reasonable prey without too many guns and not too high charged or high built the privateers would load their muskets and row down to engage her The best shots were sent into the bows and excused from rowing lest the exercise should cause their hands to tremble A clever man was put to the steering oar and the musketeers were bidden to sing out whenever the enemy yawed so as to fire her guns It was in action and in action only that the captain had command over his men The steersman endeavored to keep the masts of the quarry in a line and to approach her from astern The marksmen from the bows kept up a continual fire at the vessel s helmsmen if they could be seen and at any gun ports which happened to be open If the helmsmen could not be seen from the sea the canoas aimed to row in upon the vessel s quarters where they could wedge up the rudder with wooden chocks or wedges They then laid her aboard over the quarter or by the after chains and carried her with their knives and pistols The first man to get aboard received some gift of money at the division of the spoil When the prize was taken the prisoners were questioned and despoiled Often indeed they were stripped stark naked and granted the privilege of seeing their finery on a pirate s back Each buccaneer had the right to take a shift of clothes out of each prize captured The cargo was then rummaged and the state of the ship looked to with an eye to using her as a cruiser As a rule the prisoners were put ashore on the first opportunity but some buccaneers had a way of selling their captives into slavery If the ship were old leaky valueless in ballast or with a cargo useless to the rovers she was either robbed of her guns and turned adrift with her crew or run ashore in some snug cove where she could be burnt for the sake of the iron work If the cargo were of value and as a rule the ships they took had some rich thing aboard them they sailed her to one of the Dutch French or English settlements where they sold her freight for what they could get some tenth or twentieth of its value If the ship were a good one in good condition well found swift and not of too great draught for they preferred to sail in small ships they took her for their cruiser as soon as they had emptied out her freight They sponged and loaded her guns brought their stores aboard her laid their mats upon her deck secured the boats astern and sailed away in search of other plunder They kept little discipline aboard their ships What work had to be done they did but works of supererogation they despised and rejected as a shade unholy The night watches were partly orgies While some slept the others fired guns and drank to the health of their fellows By the light of the binnacle or by the light of the slush lamps in the cabin the rovers played a hand at cards or diced each other at seven and eleven using a pannikin as dice box While the gamblers cut and shuffled and the dice rattled in the tin the musical sang songs the fiddlers set their music chuckling and the seaboots stamped approval The cunning dancers showed their science in the moonlight avoiding the sleepers if they could In this jolly fashion were the nights made short In the daytime the gambling continued with little intermission nor had the captain any authority to stop it One captain in the histories was so bold as to throw the dice and cards overboard but as a rule the captain of a buccaneer cruiser was chosen as an artist or navigator or as a lucky fighter He was not expected to spoil sport The continual gambling nearly always led to fights and quarrels The lucky dicers often won so much that the unlucky had to part with all their booty Sometimes a few men would win all the plunder of the cruise much to the disgust of the majority who clamored for a redivision of the spoil If two buccaneers got into a quarrel they fought it out on shore at the first opportunity using knives swords or pistols according to taste The usual way of fighting was with pistols the combatants standing back to back at a distance of ten or twelve paces and turning round to fire at the word of command If both shots missed the question was decided with cutlasses the man who drew first blood being declared the winner If a man were proved to be a coward he was either tied to the mast and shot or mutilated and sent ashore No cruise came to an end until the company declared themselves satisfied with the amount of plunder taken The question like all other important questions was debated round the mast and decided by vote At the conclusion of a successful cruise they sailed for Port Royal with the ship full of treasure such as vicuna wool packets of pearls from the Hatch jars of civet or of ambergris boxes of marmalett and spices casks of strong drink bales of silk sacks of chocolate and vanilla and rolls of green cloth and pale blue cotton which the Indians had woven in Peru in some sandy village near the sea in sight of the pelicans and the penguins In addition to all these things they usually had a number of the personal possessions of those they had taken on the seas Lying in the chests for subsequent division were swords silver mounted pistols daggers chased and inlaid watches from Spain necklaces of uncut jewels rings and bangles heavy carved furniture cases of bottles of delicately cut green glass containing cordials distilled of precious mints with packets of emeralds from Brazil bezoar stones from Patagonia paintings from Spain and medicinal gums from Nicaragua All these things were divided by lot at the main mast as soon as the anchor held As the ship or ships neared port her men hung colors out any colors they could find to make their vessel gay A cup of drink was taken as they sailed slowly home to moorings and as they drank they fired off the cannon bullets and all again and yet again rejoicing as the bullets struck the water Up in the bay the ships in the harbor answered with salutes of cannon flags were dipped and hoisted in salute and so the anchor dropped in some safe reach and the division of the spoil began After the division of the spoil in the beautiful Port Royal harbor in sight of the palm trees and the fort with the colors flying the buccaneers packed their gear and dropped over the side into a boat They were pulled ashore by some grinning black man with a scarlet scarf about his head and the brand of a hot iron on his shoulders At the jetty end where the Indians lounged at their tobacco and the fishermen s canoas rocked the sunburnt pirates put ashore Among the noisy company which always gathers on a pier they met with their companions A sort of Roman triumph followed as the happily returned lounged swaggeringly towards the taverns Eager hands helped them to carry in their plunder In a few minutes the gang was entering the tavern the long cool room with barrels round the walls where there were benches and a table and an old blind fiddler jerking his elbow at a jig Noisily the party ranged about the table and sat themselves upon the benches while the drawers or potboys in their shirts drew near to take the orders I wonder if the reader has ever heard a sailor in the like circumstance five minutes after he has touched his pay address a company of parasites in an inn with the question What s it going to be FOOTNOTES ten From Buccaneer Customs on the Spanish Main A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THREE NOTORIOUS PIRATES eleven HOWARD PYLE ED I CAPTAIN TEACH alias BLACK BEARD Edward Teach was a Bristol man born but had sailed some time out of Jamaica in privateers in the late French war yet though he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage he was never raised to any command till he went a pirating which I think was at the latter end of the year seventeen sixteen when Captain Benjamin Hornygold put him into a sloop that he had made prize of and with whom he continued in consortship till a little while before Hornygold surrendered In the spring of the year seventeen seventeen Teach and Hornygold sailed from Providence for the main of America and took in their way a billop from the Havana with one hundred twenty barrels of flour as also a sloop from Bermuda Thurbar master from whom they took only some gallons of wine and then let him go and a ship from Madeira to South Carolina out of which they got plunder to a considerable value After cleaning on the coast of Virginia they returned to the West Indies and in the latitude of twenty four made prize of a large French Guineaman bound to Martinico which by Hornygold s consent Teach went aboard of as captain and took a cruise in her Hornygold returned with his sloop to Providence where at the arrival of Captain Rogers the governor he surrendered to mercy pursuant to the king s proclamation Aboard of this Guineaman Teach mounted forty guns and named her the Queen Ann s Revenge and cruising near the island of saint Vincent took a large ship called the Great Allen Christopher Taylor commander the pirates plundered her of what they thought fit put all the men ashore upon the island above mentioned and set fire to the ship A few days after Teach fell in with the Scarborough man of war of thirty guns who engaged him for some hours but she finding the pirate well manned and having tried her strength gave over the engagement and returned to Barbadoes the place of her station and Teach sailed towards the Spanish America In this way he met with a pirate sloop of ten guns commanded by one Major Bonnet lately a gentleman of good reputation and estate in the island of Barbadoes whom he joined but in a few days after Teach finding that Bonnet knew nothing of a maritime life with the consent of his own men put in another captain one Richards to command Bonnet s sloop and took the Major on board his own ship telling him that as he had not been used to the fatigues and care of such a post it would be better for him to decline it and live easy at his pleasure in such a ship as his where he would not be obliged to perform the necessary duties of a sea voyage At Turniff ten leagues short of the Bay of Honduras the pirates took in fresh water and while they were at anchor there they saw a sloop coming in whereupon Richards in the sloop called the Revenge slipped his cable and run out to meet her who upon seeing the black flag hoisted struck his sail and came to under the stern of Teach the commodore She was called the Adventure from Jamaica David Harriot master They took him and his men aboard the great ship and sent a number of other hands with Israel Hands master of Teach s ship to man the sloop for the piratical account The ninth of April they weighed from Turniff having lain there about a week and sailed to the bay where they found a ship and four sloops three of the latter belonged to Jonathan Bernard of Jamaica and the other to Captain James The ship was of Boston called the Protestant Caesar Captain Wyar commander Teach hoisted his black colors and fired a gun upon which Captain Wyar and all his men left their ship and got ashore in their boat Teach s quartermaster and eight of his crew took possession of Wyar s ship and Richards secured all the sloops one of which they burnt out of spite to the owner The Protestant Caesar they also burnt after they had plundered her because she belonged to Boston where some men had been hanged for piracy and the three sloops belonging to Bernard they let go From hence the rovers sailed to Turkill and then to the Grand Caimanes a small island about thirty leagues to the westward of Jamaica where they took a small turtler and so to the Havana and from thence to the Bahama Wrecks and from the Bahama Wrecks they sailed to Carolina taking a brigantine and two sloops in their way where they lay off the bar of Charles Town for five or six days They took here a ship as she was coming out bound for London commanded by Robert Clark with some passengers on board for England The next day they took another vessel coming out of Charles Town and also two pinks coming into Charles Town likewise a brigantine with fourteen negroes aboard all of which being done in the face of the town struck so great a terror to the whole province of Carolina having just before been visited by Vane another notorious pirate that they abandoned themselves to despair being in no condition to resist their force There were eight sail in the harbor ready for the sea but none dared to venture out it being almost impossible to escape their hands The inward bound vessels were under the same unhappy dilemma so that the trade of this place was totally interrupted What made these misfortunes heavier to them was a long expensive war the colony had had with the natives which was but just ended when these robbers infested them Teach detained all the ships and prisoners and being in want of medicines resolved to demand a chest from the government of the province Accordingly Richards the captain of the Revenge sloop with two or three more pirates were sent up along with mister Marks one of the prisoners whom they had taken in Clark s ship and very insolently made their demands threatening that if they did not send immediately the chest of medicines and let the pirate ambassadors return without offering any violence to their persons they would murder all their prisoners send up their heads to the governor and set the ships they had taken on fire Whilst mister Marks was making application to the council Richards and the rest of the pirates walked the streets publicly in the sight of all people who were fired with the utmost indignation looking upon them as robbers and murderers and particularly the authors of their wrongs and oppressions but durst not so much as think of executing their revenge for fear of bringing more calamities upon themselves and so they were forced to let the villains pass with impunity The government was not long in deliberating upon the message though it was the greatest affront that could have been put upon them yet for the saving so many men s lives among them mister Samuel Wragg one of the council they complied with the necessity and sent aboard a chest valued at between three and four hundred pounds and the pirates went back safe to their ships Black beard for so Teach was generally called as we shall hereafter show as soon as he had received the medicines and his brother rogues let go the ships and the prisoners having first taken out of them in gold and silver about Lfifteen hundred sterling besides provisions and other matters From the bar of Charles Town they sailed to North Carolina Captain Teach in the ship which they called the man of war Captain Richards and Captain Hands in the sloops which they termed privateers and another sloop serving them as a tender Teach began now to think of breaking up the company and securing the money and the best of the effects for himself and some others of his companions he had most friendship for and to cheat the rest Accordingly on pretense of running into Topsail inlet to clean he grounded his ship and then as if it had been done undesignedly and by accident he orders Hands sloop to come to his assistance and get him off again which he endeavoring to do ran the sloop on shore near the other and so were both lost This done Teach goes into the tender sloop with forty hands and leaves the Revenge there then takes seventeen others and maroons them upon a small sandy island about a league from the main where there was neither bird beast or herb for their subsistence and where they must have perished if Major Bonnet had not two days after taken them off Teach goes up to the governor of North Carolina with about twenty of his men and they surrender to his Majesty s proclamation and receive certificates thereof from his Excellency but it did not appear that their submitting to this pardon was from any reformation of manners but only to await a more favorable opportunity to play the same game over again which he soon after effected with greater security to himself and with much better prospect of success having in this time cultivated a very good understanding with Charles Eden esquire the governor above mentioned The first piece of service this kind governor did to Black beard was to give him a right to the vessel which he had taken when he was a pirating in the great ship called the Queen Ann s Revenge for which purpose a court of vice admiralty was held at Bath Town and though Teach had never any commission in his life and the sloop belonging to the English merchants and taken in time of peace yet was she condemned as a prize taken from the Spaniards by the said Teach These proceedings show that governors are but men Before he sailed upon his adventures he married a young creature of about sixteen years of age the governor performing the ceremony As it is a custom to marry here by a priest so it is there by a magistrate and this I have been informed made Teach s fourteenth wife whereof about a dozen might be still living In June seventeen eighteen he went to sea upon another expedition and steered his course towards Bermudas He met with two or three English vessels in his way but robbed them only of provisions stores and other necessaries for his present expense but near the island before mentioned he fell in with two French ships one of them was laden with sugar and cocoa and the other light both bound to Martinico The ship that had no lading he let go and putting all the men of the loaded ship aboard her he brought home the other with her cargo to North Carolina where the governor and the pirates shared the plunder When Teach and his prize arrived he and four of his crew went to his Excellency and made affidavit that they found the French ship at sea without a soul on board her and then a court was called and the ship condemned The governor had sixty hogsheads of sugar for his dividend and one mister Knight who was his secretary and collector for the province twenty and the rest was shared among the other pirates The business was not yet done the ship remained and it was possible one or other might come into the river that might be acquainted with her and so discover the roguery But Teach thought of a contrivance to prevent this for upon a pretence that she was leaky and that she might sink and so stop up the mouth of the inlet or cove where she lay he obtained an order from the governor to bring her out into the river and set her on fire which was accordingly executed and she was burnt down to the water s edge her bottom sunk and with it their fears of her ever rising in judgment against them Captain Teach alias Black beard passed three or four months in the river sometimes lying at anchor in the coves at other times sailing from one inlet to another trading with such sloops as he met for the plunder he had taken and would often give them presents for stores and provisions he took from them that is when he happened to be in a giving humor at other times he made bold with them and took what he liked without saying By your leave knowing well they dared not send him a bill for the payment He often diverted himself with going ashore among the planters where he revelled night and day By these he was well received but whether out of love or fear I cannot say Sometimes he used them courteously enough and made them presents of rum and sugar in recompense of what he took from them but as for liberties which it is said he and his companions often took with the wives and daughters of the planters I cannot take upon me to say whether he paid them ad valorem or no At other times he carried it in a lordly manner towards them and would lay some of them under contribution nay he often proceeded to bully the governor not that I can discover the least cause of quarrel between them but it seemed only to be done to show he dared do it The sloops trading up and down this river being so frequently pillaged by Black beard consulted with the traders and some of the best planters what course to take They saw plainly it would be in vain to make an application to the governor of North Carolina to whom it properly belonged to find some redress so that if they could not be relieved from some other quarter Black beard would be like to reign with impunity therefore with as much secrecy as possible they sent a deputation to Virginia to lay the affair before the governor of that colony and to solicit an armed force from the men of war lying there to take or destroy this pirate This governor consulted with the captains of the two men of war viz the Pearl and Lime who had lain in saint James s river about ten months It was agreed that the governor should hire a couple of small sloops and the men of war should man them This was accordingly done and the command of them given to mister Robert Maynard first lieutenant of the Pearl an experienced officer and a gentleman of great bravery and resolution as will appear by his gallant behavior in this expedition The sloops were well manned and furnished with ammunition and small arms but had no guns mounted About the time of their going out the governor called an assembly in which it was resolved to publish a proclamation offering certain rewards to any person or persons who within a year after that time should take or destroy any pirate The original proclamation being in our hands is as follows By his Majesty s Lieutenant Governor and Commander in Chief of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia A PROCLAMATION Publishing the Rewards given for apprehending or killing Pirates WHEREAS by an Act of Assembly made at a Session of Assembly begun at the capital in Williamsburg the eleventh day of November in the fifth year of his Majesty s reign entitled An Act to Encourage the Apprehending and Destroying of Pirates It is amongst other things enacted that all and every person or persons who from and after the fourteenth day of November in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen and before the fourteenth day of November which shall be in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nineteen shall take any pirate or pirates on the sea or land or in case of resistance shall kill any such pirate or pirates between the degrees of thirty four and thirty nine of northern latitude and within one hundred leagues of the continent of Virginia or within the provinces of Virginia or North Carolina upon the conviction or making due proof of the killing of all and every such pirate and pirates before the Governor and Council shall be entitled to have and receive out of the public money in the hands of the Treasurer of this Colony the several rewards following that is to say for Edward Teach commonly called Captain Teach or Black beard one hundred pounds for every other commander of a pirate ship sloop or vessel forty pounds for every lieutenant master or quartermaster boatswain or carpenter twenty pounds for every other inferior officer fifteen pounds and for every private man taken on board such ship sloop or vessel ten pounds and that for every pirate which shall be taken by any ship sloop or vessel belonging to this colony or North Carolina within the time aforesaid in any place whatsoever the like rewards shall be paid according to the quality and condition of such pirates Wherefore for the encouragement of all such persons as shall be willing to serve his Majesty and their country in so just and honourable an undertaking as the suppressing a sort of people who may be truly called enemies to mankind I have thought fit with the advice and consent of his Majesty s Council to issue this Proclamation hereby declaring the said rewards shall be punctually and justly paid in current money of Virginia according to the directions of the said Act And I do order and appoint this proclamation to be published by the sheriffs at their respective country houses and by all ministers and readers in the several churches and chapels throughout this colony Given at our Council Chamber at Williamsburgh this twenty fourth day of November seventeen eighteen in the fifth year of his Majesty s reign GOD SAVE THE KING A SPOTSWOOD The seventeenth of November seventeen eighteen the lieutenant sailed from Kicquetan in James river in Virginia and the thirty first in the evening came to the mouth of Okerecock inlet where he got sight of the pirate This expedition was made with all imaginable secrecy and the officer managed with all the prudence that was necessary stopping all boats and vessels he met with in the river from going up and thereby preventing any intelligence from reaching Black beard and receiving at the same time an account from them all of the place where the pirate was lurking But notwithstanding this caution Black beard had information of the design from his Excellency of the province and his secretary mister Knight wrote him a letter particularly concerning it intimating that he had sent him four of his men which were all he could meet with in or about town and so bid him be upon his guard These men belonged to Black beard and were sent from Bath Town to Okerecock inlet where the sloop lay which is about twenty leagues Black beard had heard several reports which happened not to be true and so gave the less credit to this advice nor was he convinced till he saw the sloops Then it was time to put his vessel in a posture of defense He had no more than twenty five men on board though he gave out to all the vessels he spoke with that he had forty When he had prepared for battle he sat down and spent the night in drinking with the master of a trading sloop who it was thought had more business with Teach than he should have had Lieutenant Maynard came to an anchor for the place being shoal and the channel intricate there was no getting in where Teach lay that night but in the morning he weighed and sent his boat ahead of the sloops to sound and coming within gun shot of the pirate received his fire whereupon Maynard hoisted the king s colors and stood directly towards him with the best way that his sails and oars could make Black beard cut his cable and endeavored to make a running fight keeping a continual fire at his enemies with his guns mister Maynard not having any kept a constant fire with small arms while some of his men labored at their oars In a little time Teach s sloop ran aground and mister Maynard s drawing more water than that of the pirate he could not come near him so he anchored within half gun shot of the enemy and in order to lighten his vessel that he might run him aboard the lieutenant ordered all his ballast to be thrown overboard and all the water to be staved and then weighed and stood for him upon which Black beard hailed him in this rude manner Damn you for villains who are you and from whence came you The lieutenant made him answer You may see by our colors we are no pirates Black beard bid him send his boat on board that he might see who he was but mister Maynard replied thus I cannot spare my boat but I will come aboard of you as soon as I can with my sloop Upon this Black beard took a glass of liquor and drank to him with these words Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarter or take any from you In answer to which mister Maynard told him that he expected no quarter from him nor should he give him any By this time Black beard s sloop fleeted as mister Maynard s sloops were rowing towards him which being not above a foot high in the waist and consequently the men all exposed as they came near together there being hitherto little or no execution done on either side the pirate fired a broadside charged with all manner of small shot A fatal stroke to them the sloop the lieutenant was in having twenty men killed and wounded and the other sloop nine This could not be helped for there being no wind they were obliged to keep to their oars otherwise the pirate would have got away from him which it seems the lieutenant was resolute to prevent After this unlucky blow Black beard s sloop fell broadside to the shore mister Maynard s other sloop which was called the Ranger fell astern being for the present disabled So the lieutenant finding his own sloop had way and would soon be on board of Teach he ordered all his men down for fear of another broadside which must have been their destruction and the loss of their expedition mister Maynard was the only person that kept the deck except the man at the helm whom he directed to lie down snug and the men in the hold were ordered to get their pistols and their swords ready for close fighting and to come up at his command in order to which two ladders were placed in the hatchway for the more expedition When the lieutenant s sloop boarded the other Captain Teach s men threw in several new fashioned sort of grenades viz case bottles filled with powder and small shot slugs and pieces of lead or iron with a quick match in the mouth of it which being lighted without side presently runs into the bottle to the powder and as it is instantly thrown on board generally does great execution besides putting all the crew into a confusion But by good Providence they had not that effect here the men being in the hold Black beard seeing few or no hands aboard told his men that they were all knocked to head except three or four and therefore says he let s jump on board and cut them to pieces Whereupon under the smoke of one of the bottles just mentioned Black beard enters with fourteen men over the bows of Maynard s sloop and were not seen by him until the air cleared However he just then gave a signal to his men who all rose in an instant and attacked the pirates with as much bravery as ever was done upon such an occasion Black beard and the lieutenant fired the first shots at each other by which the pirate received a wound and then engaged with swords till the lieutenant s unluckily broke and stepping back to cock a pistol Black beard with his cutlass was striking at that instant that one of Maynard s men gave him a terrible wound in the neck and throat by which the lieutenant came off with only a small cut over his fingers They were now closely and warmly engaged the lieutenant and twelve men against Black beard and fourteen till the sea was tinctured with blood round the vessel Black beard received a shot into his body from the pistol that Lieutenant Maynard discharged yet he stood his ground and fought with great fury till he received five and twenty wounds and five of them by shot At length as he was cocking another pistol having fired several before he fell down dead by which time eight more out of the fourteen dropped and all the rest much wounded jumped overboard and called out for quarter which was granted though it was only prolonging their lives a few days The sloop Ranger came up and attacked the men that remained in Black beard s sloop with equal bravery till they likewise cried for quarter Here was an end of that courageous brute who might have passed in the world for a hero had he been employed in a good cause The lieutenant caused Black beard s head to be severed from his body and hung up at the boltsprit end then he sailed to Bath Town to get relief for his wounded men In rummaging the pirate s sloop they found several letters and written papers which discovered the correspondence between Governor Eden the secretary and collector and also some traders at New York and Black beard It is likely he had regard enough for his friends to have destroyed these papers before action in order to hinder them from falling into such hands where the discovery would be of no use either to the interest or reputation of these fine gentlemen if it had not been his fixed resolution to have blown up together when he found no possibility of escaping When the lieutenant came to Bath Town he made bold to seize from the governor s storehouse the sixty hogsheads of sugar and from honest mister Knight twenty which it seems was their dividend of the plunder taken in the French ship The latter did not survive this shameful discovery for being apprehensive that he might be called to an account for these trifles fell sick it is thought with the fright and died in a few days After the wounded men were pretty well recovered the lieutenant sailed back to the men of war in James River in Virginia with Black beard s head still hanging at the boltsprit end and fifteen prisoners thirteen of whom were hanged it appearing upon trial that one of them viz Samuel Odell was taken out of the trading sloop but the night before the engagement This poor fellow was a little unlucky at his first entering upon his new trade there appearing no less than seventy wounds upon him after the action notwithstanding which he lived and was cured of them all The other person that escaped the gallows was one Israel Hands the master of Black beard s sloop and formerly captain of the same before the Queen Ann s Revenge was lost in Topsail inlet The aforesaid Hands happened not to be in the fight but was taken afterwards ashore at Bath Town having been sometime before disabled by Black beard in one of his savage humors after the following manner One night drinking in his cabin with Hands the pilot and another man Black beard without any provocation privately draws out a small pair of pistols and cocks them under the table which being perceived by the man he withdrew and went upon deck leaving Hands the pilot and the captain together When the pistols were ready he blew out the candle and crossing his hands discharged them at his company Hands the master was shot through the knee and lamed for life the other pistol did no execution Being asked the meaning of this he only answered by damning them that if he did not now and then kill one of them they would forget who he was Hands being taken was tried and condemned but just as he was about to be executed a ship arrived at Virginia with a proclamation for prolonging the time of his Majesty s pardon to such of the pirates as should surrender by a limited time therein expressed Notwithstanding the sentence Hands pleaded the pardon and was allowed the benefit of it and was alive some time ago in London begging his bread Now that we have given some account of Teach s life and actions it will not be amiss that we speak of his beard since it did not a little contribute towards making his name so terrible in those parts Plutarch and other grave historians have taken notice that several great men amongst the Romans took their surnames from certain odd marks in their countenances as Cicero from a mark or vetch on his nose so our hero Captain Teach assumed the cognomen of Black beard from that large quantity of hair which like a frightful meteor covered his whole face and frightened America more than any comet that has appeared there a long time This beard was black which he suffered to grow of an extravagant length as to breadth it came up to his eyes He was accustomed to twist it with ribbons in small tails after the manner of our Ramilie wigs and turn them about his ears In time of action he wore a sling over his shoulders with three brace of pistols hanging in holsters like bandoliers and stuck lighted matches under his hat which appearing on each side of his face his eyes naturally looking fierce and wild made him altogether such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful If he had the look of a fury his humors and passions were suitable to it In the commonwealth of pirates he who goes the greatest length of wickedness is looked upon with a kind of envy amongst them as a person of a more extraordinary gallantry and is thereby entitled to be distinguished by some post and if such a one has but courage he must certainly be a great man The hero of whom we are writing was thoroughly accomplished this way and some of his frolics of wickedness were so extravagant as if he aimed at making his men believe he was a devil incarnate for being one day at sea and a little flushed with drink Come says he let us make a hell of our own and try how long we can bear it Accordingly he with two or three others went down into the hold and closing up all the hatches filled several pots full of brimstone and other combustible matter and set it on fire and so continued till they were almost suffocated when some of the men cried out for air At length he opened the hatches not a little pleased that he held out the longest The night before he was killed he sat up and drank till the morning with some of his own men and the master of a merchantman and having had intelligence of the two sloops coming to attack him as has been before observed one of his men asked him in case anything should happen to him in the engagement with the sloops whether his wife knew where he had buried his money He answered That nobody but himself and the devil knew where it was and the longest liver should take all Those of his crew who were taken alive told a story which may appear a little incredible however we think it will not be fair to omit it since we had it from their own mouths That once upon a cruise they found out that they had a man on board more than their crew such a one was seen several days amongst them sometimes below and sometimes upon deck yet no man in the ship could give an account who he was or from whence he came but that he disappeared a little before they were cast away in their great ship but it seems they verily believed it was the devil One would think these things should induce them to reform their lives but so many reprobates together encouraged and spirited one another up in their wickedness to which a continual course of drinking did not a little contribute for in Black beard s journal which was taken there were several memorandums of the following nature found writ with his own hand Such a day rum all out our company somewhat sober a damned confusion amongst us rouges a plotting great talk of separation so I looked sharp for a prize such a day took one with a great deal of liquor on board so kept the company hot damned hot then all things went well again Thus it was these wretches passed their lives with very little pleasure or satisfaction in the possession of what they violently take away from others and sure to pay for it at last by an ignominious death The names of the pirates killed in the engagement are as follows Edward Teach commander Philip Morton gunner Garret Gibbens boatswain Owen Roberts carpenter Thomas Miller quartermaster John Husk Joseph Curtice Joseph Brooks one Nath Jackson All the rest except the two last were wounded and afterwards hanged in Virginia John Carnes Joseph Brooks two James Blake John Gills Thomas Gates James White Richard Stiles Caesar Joseph Philips James Robbins John Martin Edward Salter Stephen Daniel Richard Greensail Israel Hands pardoned Samuel Odel acquitted There were in the pirate sloops and ashore in a tent near where the sloops lay twenty five hogsheads of sugar eleven tierces and one hundred and forty five bags of cocoa a barrel of indigo and a bale of cotton which with what was taken from the governor and secretary and the sale of the sloop came to Ltwenty five hundred besides the rewards paid by the governor of Virginia pursuant to his proclamation all which was divided among the companies of the two ships Lime and Pearl that lay in James River the brave fellows that took them coming in for no more than their dividend amongst the rest and were paid it not till four years afterwards II CAPTAIN WILLIAM KID We are now going to give an account of one whose name is better known in England than most of those whose histories we have already related the person we mean is Captain Kid whose public trial and execution here rendered him the subject of all conversation so that his actions have been chanted about in ballads however it is now a considerable time since these things passed and though the people knew in general that Captain Kid was hanged and that his crime was piracy yet there were scarce any even at that time who were acquainted with his life or actions or could account for his turning pirate In the beginning of King William s war Captain Kid commanded a privateer in the West Indies and by several adventurous actions acquired the reputation of a brave man as well as an experienced seaman About this time the pirates were very troublesome in those parts wherefore Captain Kid was recommended by the Lord Bellamont then governor of Barbadoes as well as by several other persons to the Government here as a person very fit to be entrusted with the command of a Government ship and to be employed in cruising upon the pirates as knowing those seas perfectly well and being acquainted with all their lurking places but what reasons governed the politics of those times I cannot tell but this proposal met with no encouragement here though it is certain it would have been of great consequence to the subject our merchants suffering incredible damages by those robbers Upon this neglect the Lord Bellamont and some others who knew what great captures had been made by the pirates and what a prodigious wealth must be in their possession were tempted to fit out a ship at their own private charge and to give the command of it to Captain Kid and to give the thing a great reputation as well as to keep their seamen under the better command they procured the King s Commission for the said Captain Kid of which the following is an exact copy WILLIAM REX William the Third by the grace of God King of England Scotland France and Ireland Defender of the Faith c To our trusty and well beloved Captain William Kid Commander of the ship the Adventure galley or to any other the commander of the same for the time being greeting Whereas we are informed that Captain Thomas Too John Ireland Captain Thomas Wake and Captain William Maze or Mace and other subjects natives or inhabitants of New York and elsewhere in our plantations in America have associated themselves with divers others wicked and ill disposed persons and do against the law of nations commit many and great piracies robberies and depredations on the seas upon the parts of America and in other parts to the great hindrance and discouragement of trade and navigation and to the great danger and hurt of our loving subjects our allies and all others navigating the seas upon their lawful occasions Now know ye that we being desirous to prevent the aforesaid mischiefs and as much as in us lies to bring the said pirates freebooters and sea rovers to justice have thought fit and do hereby give and grant to the said William Kid to whom our Commissioners for exercising the office of Lord High Admiral of England have granted a commission as a private man of war bearing date December eleven sixteen ninety five and unto the commander of the said ship for the time being and unto the officers mariners and others which shall be under your command full power and authority to apprehend seize and take into your custody as well the said Captain Thomas Too John Ireland Captain Thomas Wake and Captain William Maze or Mace as all such pirates freebooters and sea rovers being either our subjects or of other nations associated with them which you shall meet with upon the seas or coasts of America or upon any other seas or coasts with all their ships and vessels and all such merchandises money goods and wares as shall be found on board or with them in case they shall willingly yield themselves but if they will not yield without fighting then you are by force to compel them to yield And we do also require you to bring or cause to be brought such pirates freebooters or sea rovers as you shall seize to a legal trial to the end they may be proceeded against according to the law in such cases And we do hereby command all our officers ministers and other our loving subjects whatsoever to be aiding and assisting to you in the premisses And we do hereby enjoin you to keep an exact journal of your proceedings in the execution of the premisses and set down the names of such pirates and of their officers and company and the names of such ships and vessels as you shall by virtue of these presents take and seize and the quantities of arms ammunition provision and lading of such ships and the true value of the same as near as you judge And we do hereby strictly charge and command you as you will answer the contrary at your peril that you do not in any manner offend or molest our friends or allies their ships or subjects by colour or pretence of these presents or the authority thereby granted In witness whereof we have caused our Great Seal of England to be affixed to these presents Given at our Court of Kensington the twenty sixth day of January sixteen ninety five in the seventh year of our reign Captain Kid had also another commission which was called a Commission of Reprisals for it being then war time this commission was to justify him in the taking of French merchant ships in case he should meet with any With these two commissions he sailed out of Plymouth in May sixteen ninety six in the Adventure galley of thirty guns and eighty men The place he first designed for was New York in his voyage thither he took a French banker but this was no act of piracy he having a commission for that purpose as we have just observed When he arrived at New York he put up articles for engaging more hands it being necessary to his ship s crew since he proposed to deal with a desperate enemy The terms he offered were that every man should have a share of what was taken reserving for himself and owners forty shares Upon which encouragement he soon increased his company to a hundred and fifty five men With this company he sailed first for Madeira where he took in wine and some other necessaries from thence he proceeded to Bonavist one of the Cape de Verde islands to furnish the ship with salt and from thence went immediately to saint Jago another of the Cape de Verde islands in order to stock himself with provisions When all this was done he bent his course to Madagascar the known rendezvous of pirates In his way he fell in with Captain Warren commodore of three men of war he acquainted them with his design kept them company two or three days and then leaving them made the best way for Madagascar where he arrived in February sixteen ninety six just nine months from his departure from Plymouth It happened that at this time the pirate ships were most of them out in search of prey so that according to the best intelligence Captain Kid could get there was not one of them at this time about the island wherefore having spent some time in watering his ship and taking in more provisions he thought of trying his fortune on the coast of Malabar where he arrived in the month of June following four months from his reaching Madagascar Hereabouts he made an unsuccessful cruise touching sometimes at the island of Mahala sometimes at that of Joanna between Malabar and Madagascar His provisions were every day wasting and his ship began to want repair wherefore when he was at Joanna he found means of borrowing a sum of money from some Frenchmen who had lost their ship but saved their effects and with this he purchased materials for putting his ship in good repair It does not appear all this while that he had the least design of turning pirate for near Mahala and Joanna both he met with several Indian ships richly laden to which he did not offer the least violence though he was strong enough to have done what he pleased with them and the first outrage or depredation I find he committed upon mankind was after his repairing his ship and leaving Joanna He touched at a place called Mabbee upon the Red Sea where he took some Guinea corn from the natives by force After this he sailed to Bab s Key a place upon a little island at the entrance of the Red Sea Here it was that he first began to open himself to his ship s company and let them understand that he intended to change his measures for happening to talk of the Moca fleet which was to sail that way he said We have been unsuccessful hitherto but courage my boys we ll make our fortunes out of this fleet And finding that none of them appeared averse to it he ordered a boat out well manned to go upon the coast to make discoveries commanding them to take a prisoner and bring to him or get intelligence any way they could The boat returned in a few days bringing him word that they saw fourteen or fifteen ships ready to sail some with English some with Dutch and some with Moorish colors We cannot account for this sudden change in his conduct otherwise than by supposing that he first meant well while he had hopes of making his fortune by taking of pirates but now weary of ill success and fearing lest his owners out of humor at their great expenses should dismiss him and he should want employment and be marked out for an unlucky man rather I say than run the hazard of poverty he resolved to do his business one way since he could not do it another He therefore ordered a man continually to watch at the mast head lest this fleet should go by them and about four days after towards evening it appeared in sight being convoyed by one English and one Dutch man of war Kid soon fell in with them and getting into the midst of them fired at a Moorish ship which was next him but the men of war taking the alarm bore down upon Kid and firing upon him obliged him to sheer off he not being strong enough to contend with them Now he had begun hostilities he resolved to go on and therefore he went and cruised along the coast of Malabar The first prize he met was a small vessel belonging to Aden the vessel was Moorish and the owners were Moorish merchants but the master was an Englishman his name was Parker Kid forced him and a Portuguese that was called Don Antonio which were all the Europeans on board to take on with them the first he designed as a pilot and the last as an interpreter He also used the men very cruelly causing them to be hoisted up by the arms and drubbed with a naked cutlass to force them to discover whether they had money on board and where it lay but as they had neither gold nor silver on board he got nothing by his cruelty however he took from them a bale of pepper and a bale of coffee and so let them go A little time after he touched at Carawar a place upon the same coast where before he arrived the news of what he had done to the Moorish ship had reached them for some of the English merchants there had received an account of it from the owners who corresponded with them wherefore as soon as Kid came in he was suspected to be the person who committed this piracy and one mister Harvey and mister Mason two of the English factory came on board and asked for Parker and Antonio the Portuguese but Kid denied that he knew any such persons having secured them both in a private place in the hold where they were kept for seven or eight days that is till Kid sailed from thence However the coast was alarmed and a Portuguese man of war was sent out to cruise Kid met with her and fought her about six hours gallantly enough but finding her too strong to be taken he quitted her for he was able to run away from her when he would Then he went to a place called Porco where he watered the ship and bought a number of hogs of the natives to victual his company Soon after this he came up with a Moorish ship the master whereof was a Dutchman called Schipper Mitchel and chased her under French colors which they observing hoisted French colors too When he came up with her he hailed her in French and they having a Frenchman on board answered him in the same language upon which he ordered them to send their boat on board They were obliged to do so and having examined who they were and from whence they came he asked the Frenchman who was a passenger if he had a French pass for himself The Frenchman gave him to understand that he had Then he told the Frenchman he must pass for captain and by G d says he you are the captain The Frenchman durst not refuse doing as he would have him The meaning of this was that he would seize the ship as fair prize and as if she had belonged to French subjects according to a commission he had for that purpose though one would think after what he had already done that he need not have recourse to a quibble to give his actions a color In short he took the cargo and sold it some time after yet still he seemed to have some fears upon him lest these proceedings should have a bad end for coming up with a Dutch ship some time when his men thought of nothing but attacking her Kid opposed it upon which a mutiny arose and the majority being for taking the said ship and arming themselves to man the boat to go and seize her he told them such as did never should come on board him again which put an end to the design so that he kept company with the said ship some time without offering her any violence However this dispute was the occasion of an accident upon which an indictment was afterwards grounded against Kid for Moor the gunner being one day upon deck and talking with Kid about the said Dutch ship some words arose between them and Moor told Kid that he had ruined them all upon which Kid calling him dog took up a bucket and struck him with it which breaking his skull he died the next day But Kid s penitential fit did not last long for coasting along Malabar he met with a great number of boats all which he plundered Upon the same coast he also lighted upon a Portuguese ship which he kept possession of a week and then having taken out of her some chests of Indian goods thirty jars of butter with some wax iron and a hundred bags of rice he let her go Much about the same time he went to one of the Malabar islands for wood and water and his cooper being ashore was murdered by the natives upon which Kid himself landed and burnt and pillaged several of their houses the people running away but having taken one he caused him to be tied to a tree and commanded one of his men to shoot him then putting to sea again he took the greatest prize which fell into his hands while he followed his trade This was a Moorish ship of four hundred tons richly laden named the Queda merchant the master whereof was an Englishman he was called Wright for the Indians often make use of English or Dutch men to command their ships their own mariners not being so good artists in navigation Kid chased her under French colors and having come up with her he ordered her to hoist out her boat and to send on board of him which being done he told Wright he was his prisoner and informing himself concerning the said ship he understood there were no Europeans on board except two Dutch and one Frenchman all the rest being Indians or Armenians and that the Armenians were part owners of the cargo Kid gave the Armenians to understand that if they would offer anything that was worth his taking for their ransom he would hearken to it upon which they proposed to pay him twenty thousand rupees not quite three thousand pounds sterling but Kid judged this would be making a bad bargain wherefore he rejected it and setting the crew on shore at different places on the coast he soon sold as much of the cargo as came to near ten thousand pounds With part of it he also trafficked receiving in exchange provisions or such other goods as he wanted By degrees he disposed of the whole cargo and when the division was made it came to about two hundred pounds a man and having reserved forty shares to himself his dividend amounted to about eight thousand pounds sterling The Indians along the coast came on board and trafficked with all freedom and he punctually performed his bargains till about the time he was ready to sail and then thinking he should have no further occasion for them he made no scruple of taking their goods and setting them on shore without any payment in money or goods which they little expected for as they had been used to deal with pirates they always found them men of honor in the way of trade a people enemies to deceit and that scorned to rob but in their own way Kid put some of his men on board the Queda merchant and with this ship and his own sailed for Madagascar As soon as he was arrived and had cast anchor there came on board of him a canoe in which were several Englishmen who had formerly been well acquainted with Kid As soon as they saw him they saluted him and told him they were informed he was come to take them and hang them which would be a little unkind in such an old acquaintance Kid soon dissipated their doubts by swearing he had no such design and that he was now in every respect their brother and just as bad as they and calling for a cup of bomboo drank their captain s health These men belonged to a pirate ship called the Resolution formerly the Mocco merchant whereof one Captain Culliford was commander and which lay at an anchor not far from them Kid went on board with them promising them his friendship and assistance and Culliford in his turn came on board of Kid and Kid to testify his sincerity in iniquity finding Culliford in want of some necessaries made him a present of an anchor and some guns to fit him out for the sea again The Adventure galley was now so old and leaky that they were forced to keep two pumps continually going wherefore Kid shifted all the guns and tackle out of her into the Queda merchant intending her for his man of war and as he had divided the money before he now made a division of the remainder of the cargo Soon after which the greatest part of the company left him some going on board Captain Culliford and others absconding in the country so that he had not above forty men left He put to sea and happened to touch at Amboyna one of the Dutch spice islands where he was told that the news of his actions had reached England and that he was there declared a pirate The truth of it is his piracies so alarmed our merchants that some motions were made in Parliament to inquire into the commission that was given him and the persons who fitted him out These proceedings seemed to lean a little hard upon the Lord Bellamont who thought himself so much touched thereby that he published a justification of himself in a pamphlet after Kid s execution In the meantime it was thought advisable in order to stop the course of these piracies to publish a proclamation offering the king s free pardon to all such pirates as should voluntarily surrender themselves whatever piracies they had been guilty of at any time before the last day of April sixteen ninety nine That is to say for all piracies committed eastward of the Cape of Good Hope to the longitude and meridian of Socatora and Cape Camorin In which proclamation Avery twelve and Kid were excepted by name When Kid left Amboyna he knew nothing of this proclamation for certainly had he had notice of his being excepted in it he would not have been so infatuated to run himself into the very jaws of danger but relying upon his interest with the Lord Bellamont and fancying that a French pass or two he found on board some of the ships he took would serve to countenance the matter and that part of the booty he got would gain him new friends I say all these things made him flatter himself that all would be hushed and that justice would but wink at him Wherefore he sailed directly for New York where he was no sooner arrived but by the Lord Bellamont s orders he was secured with all his papers and effects Many of his fellow adventurers who had forsook him at Madagascar came over from thence passengers some to New England and some to Jersey where hearing of the king s proclamation for pardoning of pirates they surrendered themselves to the governor of those places At first they were admitted to bail but soon after were laid in strict confinement where they were kept for some time till an opportunity happened of sending them with their captain over to England to be tried Accordingly a Sessions of Admiralty being held at the Old Bailey in May seventeen oh one Captain Kid Nicholas Churchill James How Robert Lumley William Jenkins Gabriel Loff Hugh Parrot Richard Barlicorn Abel Owens and Darby Mullins were arraigned for piracy and robbery on the high seas and all found guilty except three these were Robert Lumley William Jenkins and Richard Barlicorn who proving themselves to be apprentices to some of the officers of the ship and producing their indentures in court were acquitted The three above mentioned though they were proved to be concerned in taking and sharing the ship and goods mentioned in the indictment yet as the gentlemen of the long robe rightly distinguished there was a great difference between their circumstances and the rest for there must go an intention of the mind and a freedom of the will to the committing an act of felony or piracy A pirate is not to be understood to be under constraint but a free agent for in this case the bare act will not make a man guilty unless the will make it so Kid was tried upon an indictment of murder also viz for killing Moor the gunner and found guilty of the same As to Captain Kid s defense he insisted much upon his own innocence and the villainy of his men He said he went out in a laudable employment and had no occasion being then in good circumstances to go a pirating that the men often mutinied against him and did as they pleased that he was threatened to be shot in his cabin and that ninety five left him at one time and set fire to his boat so that he was disabled from bringing his ship home or the prizes he took to have them regularly condemned which he said were taken by virtue of a commission under the broad seal they having French passes The captain called one Colonel Hewson to his reputation who gave him an extraordinary character and declared to the court that he had served under his command and been in two engagements with him against the French in which he fought as well as any man he ever saw that there were only Kid s ship and his own against Monsieur du Cass who commanded a squadron of six sail and they got the better of him But this being several years before the facts mentioned in the indictment were committed proved of no manner of service to the prisoner on his trial As to the friendship shown to Culliford a notorious pirate Kid denied and said he intended to have taken him but his men being a parcel of rogues and villains refused to stand by him and several of them ran away from his ship to the said pirate But the evidence being full and particular against him he was found guilty as before mentioned When Kid was asked what he had to say why sentence should not pass against him he answered that he had nothing to say but that he had been sworn against by perjured wicked people And when sentence was pronounced he said My lord it is a very hard sentence For my part I am the innocentest person of them all only I have been sworn against by perjured persons Wherefore about a week after Captain Kid Nicholas Churchill James How Gabriel Loff Hugh Parrot Abel Owen and Darby Mullins were executed at Execution Dock and afterwards hung up in chains at some distance from each other down the river where their bodies hung exposed for many years III CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS AND HIS CREW Bartholomew Roberts sailed in an honest employ from London aboard of the Princess Captain Plumb commander of which ship he was second mate He left England November seventeen nineteen and arrived at Guinea about February following and being at Anamaboe taking in slaves for the West Indies was taken in the said ship by Captain Howel Davis In the beginning he was very averse to this sort of life and would certainly have escaped from them had a fair opportunity presented itself yet afterwards he changed his principles as many besides him have done upon another element and perhaps for the same reason too viz preferment and what he did not like as a private man he could reconcile to his conscience as a commander Davis having been killed in the Island of Princes whilst planning to capture it with all its inhabitants the company found themselves under the necessity of filling up his post for which there appeared two or three candidates among the select part of them that were distinguished by the title of Lords such were Sympson Ashplant Anstis c and on canvassing this matter how shattered and weak a condition their government must be without a head since Davis had been removed in the manner before mentioned my Lord Dennis proposed it is said over a bowl to this purpose That it was not of any great signification who was dignified with title for really and in good truth all good governments had like theirs the supreme power lodged with the community who might doubtless depute and revoke as suited interest or humor We are the original of this claim says he and should a captain be so saucy as to exceed prescription at any time why down with him It will be a caution after he is dead to his successors of what fatal consequence any sort of assuming may be However it is my advice that while we are sober we pitch upon a man of courage and skilled in navigation one who by his council and bravery seems best able to defend this commonwealth and ward us from the dangers and tempests of an unstable element and the fatal consequences of anarchy and such a one I take Roberts to be a fellow I think in all respects worthy your esteem and favor This speech was loudly applauded by all but Lord Sympson who had secret expectations himself but on this disappointment grew sullen and left them swearing he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist for against them he had conceived an irreconcilable hatred for that his father had been a sufferer in Monmouth s rebellion Roberts was accordingly elected though he had not been above six weeks among them The choice was confirmed both by the Lords and Commoners and he accepted of the honor saying that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water and must be a pirate it was better being a commander than a common man As soon as the government was settled by promoting other officers in the room of those that were killed by the Portuguese the company resolved to avenge Captain Davis s death he being more than ordinarily respected by the crew for his affability and good nature as well as his conduct and bravery upon all occasions and pursuant to this resolution about thirty men were landed in order to make an attack upon the fort which must be ascended to by a steep hill against the mouth of the cannon These men were headed by one Kennedy a bold daring fellow but very wicked and profligate they marched directly up under the fire of their ship guns and as soon as they were discovered the Portuguese quitted their post and fled to the town and the pirates marched in without opposition set fire to the fort and threw all the guns off the hill into the sea which after they had done they retreated quietly to their ship But this was not looked upon as a sufficient satisfaction for the injury they received therefore most of the company were for burning the town which Roberts said he would yield to if any means could be proposed of doing it without their own destruction for the town had a securer situation than the fort a thick wood coming almost close to it affording cover to the defendants who under such an advantage he told them it was to be feared would fire and stand better to their arms beside that bare houses would be but a slender reward for their trouble and loss This prudent advice prevailed however they mounted the French ship they seized at this place with twelve guns and lightened her in order to come up to the town the water being shoal and battered down several houses after which they all returned on board gave back the French ship to those that had most right to her and sailed out of the harbor by the light of two Portuguese ships which they were pleased to set on fire there Roberts stood away to the southward and met with a Dutch Guineaman which he made prize of but after having plundered her the skipper had his ship again Two days after he took an English ship called the Experiment Captain Cornet at Cape Lopez the men went all into the pirate service and having no occasion for the ship they burnt her and then steered for saint Thome but meeting with nothing in their way they sailed for Annabona and there watered took in provisions and put it to a vote of the company whether their next voyage should be to the East Indies or to Brazil The latter being resolved on they sailed accordingly and in twenty eight days arrived at Ferdinando an uninhabited island on that coast Here they watered boot topped their ship and made ready for the designed cruise Upon this coast our rovers cruised for about nine weeks keeping generally out of sight of land but without seeing a sail which discouraged them so that they determined to leave the station and steer for the West Indies and in order thereto stood in to make the land for the taking of their departure and thereby they fell in unexpectedly with a fleet of forty two sail of Portuguese ships off the bay of Los Todos Santos with all their lading in for Lisbon several of them of good force who lay to waiting for two men of war of seventy guns each their convoy However Roberts thought it should go hard with him but he would make up his market among them and thereupon mixed with the fleet and kept his men hid till proper resolutions could be formed That done they came close up to one of the deepest and ordered her to send the master on board quietly threatening to give them no quarter if any resistance or signal of distress was made The Portuguese being surprised at these threats and the sudden flourish of cutlasses from the pirates submitted without a word and the captain came on board Roberts saluted him after a friendly manner telling him that they were gentlemen of fortune but that their business with him was only to be informed which was the richest ship in that fleet and if he directed them right he should be restored to his ship without molestation otherwise he must expect immediate death Whereupon this Portuguese master pointed to one of forty guns and a hundred and fifty men a ship of greater force than the Rover but this no ways dismayed them they were Portuguese they said and so immediately steered away for him When they came within hail the master whom they had prisoner was ordered to ask how Seignior Captain did and to invite him on board for that he had a matter of consequence to impart to him which being done he returned for answer that he would wait upon him presently but by the bustle that immediately followed the pirates perceived that they were discovered and that this was only a deceitful answer to gain time to put their ship in a posture of defense so without further delay they poured in a broadside boarded and grappled her The dispute was short and warm wherein many of the Portuguese fell and two only of the pirates By this time the fleet was alarmed signals of top gallant sheets flying and guns fired to give notice to the men of war who rid still at an anchor and made but scurvy haste out to their assistance and if what the pirates themselves related to be true the commanders of those ships were blameable to the highest degree and unworthy the title or so much as the name of men For Roberts finding the prize to sail heavy and yet resolving not to lose her lay by for the headmost of them which much outsailed the other and prepared for battle which was ignominiously declined though of such superior force for not daring to venture on the pirate alone he tarried so long for his consort as gave them both time leisurely to make off They found this ship exceedingly rich being laden chiefly with sugar skins and tobacco and in gold forty thousand moidores besides chains and trinkets of considerable value particularly a cross set with diamonds designed for the king of Portugal which they afterwards presented to the governor of Caiana by whom they were obliged Elated with this booty they had nothing now to think of but some safe retreat where they might give themselves up to all the pleasures that luxury and wantonness could bestow and for the present pitched upon a place called the Devil s Islands in the river of Surinam on the coast of Caiana where they arrived and found the civilest reception imaginable not only from the governor and factory but their wives who exchanged wares and drove a considerable trade with them They seized in this river a sloop and by her gained intelligence that a brigantine had also sailed in company with her from Rhode Island laden with provisions for the coast a welcome cargo They growing short in the sea store and as Sancho says No adventures to be made without belly timber One evening as they were rummaging their mine of treasure the Portuguese prize this expected vessel was descried at the masthead and Roberts imagining nobody could do the business so well as himself takes forty men in the sloop and goes in pursuit of her but a fatal accident followed this rash though inconsiderable adventure for Roberts thinking of nothing less than bringing in the brigantine that afternoon never troubled his head about the sloop s provision nor inquired what there was on board to subsist such a number of men but out he sails after his expected prize which he not only lost further sight of but after eight days contending with contrary winds and currents found themselves thirty leagues to leeward The current still opposing their endeavors and perceiving no hopes of beating up to their ship they came to an anchor and inconsiderately sent away the boat to give the rest of the company notice of their condition and to order the ship to them but too soon even the next day their wants made them sensible of their infatuation for their water was all expended and they had taken no thought how they should be supplied till either the ship came or the boat returned which was not likely to be under five or six days Here like Tantalus they almost famished in sight of the fresh streams and lakes being drove to such extremity at last that they were forced to tear up the floor of the cabin and patch up a sort of tub or tray with rope yarns to paddle ashore and fetch off immediate supplies of water to preserve life After some days the long wished for boat came back but with the most unwelcome news in the world for Kennedy who was lieutenant and left in absence of Roberts to command the privateer and prize was gone off with both This was mortification with a vengeance and you may imagine they did not depart without some hard speeches from those that were left and had suffered by their treachery And that there need be no further mention of this Kennedy I shall leave Captain Roberts to vent his wrath in a few oaths and execrations and follow the other whom we may reckon from that time as steering his course towards Execution Dock Kennedy was now chosen captain of the revolted crew but could not bring his company to any determined resolution Some of them were for pursuing the old game but the greater part of them seemed to have inclinations to turn from those evil courses and get home privately for there was no act of pardon in force therefore they agreed to break up and every man to shift for himself as he should see occasion The first thing they did was to part with the great Portuguese prize and having the master of the sloop whose name I think was Cane aboard who they said was a very honest fellow for he had humored them upon every occasion told them of the brigantine that Roberts went after and when the pirates first took him he complimented them at any odd rate telling them they were welcome to his sloop and cargo and wished that the vessel had been larger and the loading richer for their sakes To this good natured man they gave the Portuguese ship which was then above half loaded three or four negroes and all his own men who returned thanks to his kind benefactors and departed Captain Kennedy in the Rover sailed to Barbadoes near which island they took a very peaceable ship belonging to Virginia The commander was a Quaker whose name was Knot he had neither pistol sword nor cutlass on board and mister Knot appearing so very passive to all they said to him some of them thought this a good opportunity to go off and accordingly eight of the pirates went aboard and he carried them safe to Virginia They made the Quaker a present of ten chests of sugar ten rolls of Brazil tobacco thirty moidores and some gold dust in all to the value of about Ltwo hundred fifty They also made presents to the sailors some more some less and lived a jovial life all the while they were upon their voyage Captain Knot giving them their way nor indeed could he help himself unless he had taken an opportunity to surprise them when they were either drunk or asleep for awake they wore arms aboard the ship and put him in a continual terror it not being his principle or the sect s to fight unless with art and collusion He managed these weapons well till he arrived at the Capes and afterwards four of the pirates went off in a boat which they had taken with them for the more easily making their escapes and made up the bay towards Maryland but were forced back by a storm into an obscure place of the country where meeting with good entertainment among the planters they continued several days without being discovered to be pirates In the meantime Captain Knot leaving four others on board his ship who intended to go to North Carolina made what haste he could to discover to mister Spotswood the governor what sort of passengers he had been forced to bring with him who by good fortune got them seized and search being made after the others who were revelling about the country they were also taken and all tried convicted and hanged two Portuguese Jews who were taken on the coast of Brazil and whom they brought with them to Virginia being the principal evidences The latter had found means to lodge part of their wealth with the planters who never brought it to account But Captain Knot surrendered up everything that belonged to them that were taken aboard even what they presented to him in lieu of such things as they had plundered him of in their passage and obliged his men to do the like Some days after the taking of the Virginiaman last mentioned in cruising in the latitude of Jamaica Kennedy took a sloop bound thither from Boston loaded with bread and flour aboard of this sloop went all the hands who were for breaking the gang and left those behind that had a mind to pursue further adventures Among the former was Kennedy their captain of whose honor they had such a despicable notion that they were about to throw him overboard when they found him in the sloop as fearing he might betray them all at their return to England he having in his childhood been bred a pick pocket and before he became a pirate a house breaker both professions that these gentlemen have a very mean opinion of However Captain Kennedy by taking solemn oaths of fidelity to his companions was suffered to proceed with them In this company there was but one that pretended to any skill in navigation for Kennedy could neither write nor read he being preferred to the command merely for his courage which indeed he had often signalized particularly in taking the Portuguese ship and he proved to be a pretender only for shaping their course to Ireland where they agreed to land they ran away to the north west coast of Scotland and there were tossed about by hard storms of wind for several days without knowing where they were and in great danger of perishing At length they pushed the vessel into a little creek and went all ashore leaving the sloop at an anchor for the next comers The whole company refreshed themselves at a little village about five miles from the place where they left the sloop and passed there for shipwrecked sailors and no doubt might have travelled on without suspicion but the mad and riotous manner of their living on the road occasioned their journey to be cut short as we shall observe presently Kennedy and another left them here and travelling to one of the seaports shipped themselves for Ireland and arrived there in safety Six or seven wisely withdrew from the rest travelled at their leisure and got to their much desired port of London without being disturbed or suspected but the main gang alarmed the country wherever they came drinking and roaring at such a rate that the people shut themselves up in their houses in some places not daring to venture out among so many mad fellows In other villages they treated the whole town squandering their money away as if like AEsop they wanted to lighten their burthens This expensive manner of living procured two of their drunken stragglers to be knocked on the head they being found murdered in the road and their money taken from them All the rest to the number of seventeen as they drew nigh to Edinburgh were arrested and thrown into gaol upon suspicion of they knew not what however the magistrates were not long at a loss for proper accusations for two of the gang offering themselves for evidences were accepted of and the others were brought to a speedy trial whereof nine were convicted and executed Kennedy having spent all his money came over from Ireland and kept a public house on Deptford Road and now and then it was thought made an excursion abroad in the way of his former profession till one of his household gave information against him for a robbery for which he was committed to Bridewell but because she would not do the business by halves she found out a mate of a ship that Kennedy had committed piracy upon as he foolishly confessed to her This mate whose name was Grant paid Kennedy a visit in Bridewell and knowing him to be the man procured a warrant and had him committed to the Marshalsea prison The game that Kennedy had now to play was to turn evidence himself accordingly he gave a list of eight or ten of his comrades but not being acquainted with their habitations one only was taken who though condemned appeared to be a man of a fair character was forced into their service and took the first opportunity to get from them and therefore received a pardon but Walter Kennedy being a notorious offender was executed July nineteen seventeen twenty one at Execution Dock The rest of the pirates who were left in the ship Rover stayed not long behind for they went ashore to one of the West India islands What became of them afterwards I cannot tell but the ship was found at sea by a sloop belonging to St Christophers and carried into that island with only nine negroes aboard Thus we see what a disastrous fate ever attends the wicked and how rarely they escape the punishment due to their crimes who abandoned to such a profligate life rob spoil and prey upon mankind contrary to the light and law of nature as well as the law of God It might have been hoped that the examples of these deaths would have been as marks to the remainder of this gang how to shun the rocks their companions had split on that they would have surrendered to mercy or divided themselves for ever from such pursuits as in the end they might be sure would subject them to the same law and punishment which they must be conscious they now equally deserved impending law which never let them sleep well unless when drunk But all the use that was made of it here was to commend the justice of the court that condemned Kennedy for he was a sad dog they said and deserved the fate he met with But to go back to Roberts whom we left on the coast of Caiana in a grievous passion at what Kennedy and the crew had done and who was now projecting new adventures with his small company in the sloop but finding hitherto they had been but as a rope of sand they formed a set of articles to be signed and sworn to for the better conservation of their society and doing justice to one another excluding all Irishmen from the benefit of it to whom they had an implacable aversion upon the account of Kennedy How indeed Roberts could think that an oath would be obligatory where defiance had been given to the laws of God and man I cannot tell but he thought their greatest security lay in this that it was every one s interest to observe them if they minded to keep up so abominable a combination The following is the substance of articles as taken from the pirates own informations I Every man has a vote in affairs of moment has equal title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized and may use them at pleasure unless a scarcity no uncommon thing among them make it necessary for the good of all to vote a retrenchment II Every man to be called fairly in turn by list on board of prizes because over and above their proper share they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes But if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate jewels or money marooning was their punishment This was a barbarous custom of putting the offender on shore on some desolate or uninhabited cape or island with a gun a few shot a bottle of water a bottle of powder to subsist with or starve If the robbery was only between one another they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty and set him on shore not in an uninhabited place but somewhere where he was sure to encounter hardships III No person to game at cards or dice for money IV The lights and candles to be put out at eight o clock at night If any of the crew after that hour still remained inclined for drinking they were to do it on the open deck Which Roberts believed would give a check to their debauches for he was a sober man himself but found at length that all his endeavors to put an end to this debauch proved ineffectual V To keep their piece pistols and cutlass clean and fit for service In this they were extravagantly nice endeavoring to outdo one another in the beauty and richness of their arms giving sometimes at an auction at the mast Lthirty or Lforty a pair for pistols These were slung in time of service with different colored ribbons over their shoulders in a way peculiar to these fellows in which they took great delight VI No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them If any man were found seducing any of the latter sex and carried her to sea disguised he was to suffer death So that when any fell into their hands as it chanced in the Onslow they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel but then here lies the roguery they contend who shall be sentinel which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies VII To desert the ship or their quarters in battle was punished with death or marooning VIII No striking one another on board but every man s quarrel to be ended on shore at sword and pistol Thus the quartermaster of the ship when the parties will not come to any reconciliation accompanies them on shore with what assistance he thinks proper and turns the disputants back to back at so many paces distance At the word of command they turn and fire immediately or else the piece is knocked out of their hands If both miss they come to their cutlasses and then he is declared victor who draws the first blood IX No man to talk of breaking up their way of living till each had shared Lone thousand If in order to this any man should lose a limb or become a cripple in their service he was to have eight hundred dollars out of the public stock and for lesser hurts proportionably X The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize the master boatswain and gunner one share and a half the other officers one and a quarter XI The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath day but the other six days and nights none without special favor These we are assured were some of Roberts s articles but as they had taken care to throw overboard the original they had signed and sworn to there is a great deal of room to suspect the remainder contained something too horrid to be disclosed to any except such as were willing to be sharers in the iniquity of them Let them be what they will they were together the test of all newcomers who were initiated by an oath taken on a Bible reserved for that purpose only and were subscribed to in presence of the worshipful mister Roberts And in case any doubt should arise concerning the construction of these laws and it should remain a dispute whether the party had infringed them or no a jury was appointed to explain them and bring in a verdict upon the case in doubt Since we are now speaking of the laws of this company I shall go on and in as brief a manner as I can relate the principal customs and government of this roguish commonwealth which are pretty near the same with all pirates For the punishment of small offences which are not provided for by the articles and which are not of consequence enough to be left to a jury there is a principal officer among the pirates called the quartermaster of the men s own choosing who claims all authority this way excepting in time of battle If they disobey his command are quarrelsome and mutinous with one another misuse prisoners plunder beyond his order and in particular if they be negligent of their arms which he musters at discretion he punishes at his own arbitrament with drubbing or whipping which no one else dare do without incurring the lash from all the ship s company In short this officer is trustee for the whole is the first on board any prize separating for the company s use what he pleases and returning what he thinks fit to the owners excepting gold and silver which they have voted not returnable After a description of the quartermaster and his duty who acts as a sort of civil magistrate on board a pirate ship I shall consider their military officer the captain what privileges he exerts in such anarchy and unruliness of the members Why truly very little they only permit him to be captain on condition that they may be captain over him they separate to his use the great cabin and sometimes vote him small parcels of plate and china for it may be noted that Roberts drank his tea constantly but then every man as the humor takes him will use the plate and china intrude into his apartment swear at him seize a part of his victuals and drink if they like it without his offering to find fault or contest it Yet Roberts by a better management than usual became the chief director in everything of moment and it happened thus The rank of captain being obtained by the suffrage of the majority it falls on one superior for knowledge and boldness pistol proof as they call it who can make those fear who do not love him Roberts is said to have exceeded his fellows in these respects and when advanced enlarged the respect that followed it by making a sort of privy council of half a dozen of the greatest bullies such as were his competitors and had interest enough to make his government easy yet even those in the latter part of his reign he had run counter to in every project that opposed his own opinion for which and because he grew reserved and would not drink and roar at their rate a cabal was formed to take away his captainship which death did more effectually The captain s power is uncontrollable in chase or in battle drubbing cutting or even shooting any one who dares deny his command The same privilege he takes over prisoners who receive good or ill usage mostly as he approves of their behavior for though the meanest would take upon them to misuse a master of a ship yet he would control herein when he sees it and merrily over a bottle give his prisoners this double reason for it first that it preserved his precedence and secondly that it took the punishment out of the hands of a much more rash and mad set of fellows than himself When he found that rigor was not expected from his people for he often practiced it to appease them then he would give strangers to understand that it was pure inclination that induced him to a good treatment of them and not any love or partiality to their persons for says he there is none of you but will hang me I know whenever you can clinch me within your power And now seeing the disadvantages they were under for pursuing their plans viz a small vessel ill repaired and without provisions or stores they resolved one and all with the little supplies they could get to proceed for the West Indies not doubting to find a remedy for all these evils and to retrieve their loss In the latitude of Deseada one of the islands they took two sloops which supplied them with provisions and other necessaries and a few days afterwards took a brigantine belonging to Rhode Island and then proceeded to Barbadoes off of which island they fell in with a Bristol ship of ten guns in her voyage out from whom they took abundance of clothes some money twenty five bales of goods five barrels of powder a cable hawser ten casks of oatmeal six casks of beef and several other goods besides five of their men and after they had detained her three days let her go who being bound for the aforesaid island she acquainted the governor with what had happened as soon as she arrived Whereupon a Bristol galley that lay in the harbor was ordered to be fitted out with all imaginable expedition of twenty guns and eighty men there being then no man of war upon that station and also a sloop with ten guns and forty men The galley was commanded by one Captain Rogers of Bristol and the sloop by Captain Graves of that island and Captain Rogers by a commission from the governor was appointed commodore The second day after Rogers sailed out of the harbor he was discovered by Roberts who knowing nothing of their design gave them chase The Barbadoes ships kept an easy sail till the pirates came up with them and then Roberts gave them a gun expecting they would have immediately struck to his piratical flag but instead thereof he was forced to receive the fire of a broadside with three huzzas at the same time so that an engagement ensued but Roberts being hardly put to it was obliged to crowd all the sail the sloop would bear to get off The galley sailing pretty well kept company for a long while keeping a constant fire which galled the pirate however at length by throwing over their guns and other heavy goods and thereby lightening the vessel they with much ado got clear but Roberts could never endure a Barbadoes man afterwards and when any ships belonging to that island fell in his way he was more particularly severe to them than others Captain Roberts sailed in the sloop to the island of Dominico where he watered and got provisions of the inhabitants to whom he gave goods in exchange At this place he met with thirteen Englishmen who had been set ashore by a French Guard de la Coste belonging to Martinico taken out of two New England ships that had been seized as prizes by the said French sloop The men willingly entered with the pirates and it proved a seasonable recruiting They stayed not long here though they had immediate occasion for cleaning their sloop but did not think this a proper place and herein they judged right for the touching at this island had like to have been their destruction because they having resolved to go away to the Granada Islands for the aforesaid purpose by some accident it came to be known to the French colony who sending word to the governor of Martinico he equipped and manned two sloops to go in quest of them The pirates sailed directly for the Granadilloes and hall d into a lagoon at Corvocoo where they cleaned with unusual dispatch staying but a little above a week by which expedition they missed of the Martinico sloops only a few hours Roberts sailing overnight and the French arriving the next morning This was a fortunate escape especially considering that it was not from any fears of their being discovered that they made so much haste from the island but as they had the impudence themselves to own for the want of wine and women Thus narrowly escaped they sailed for Newfoundland and arrived upon the banks the latter end of June seventeen twenty They entered the harbor of Trepassi with their black colors flying drums beating and trumpets sounding There were two and twenty vessels in the harbor which the men all quitted upon the sight of the pirate and fled ashore It is impossible particularly to recount the destruction and havoc they made here burning and sinking all the shipping except a Bristol galley and destroying the fisheries and stages of the poor planters without remorse or compunction for nothing is so deplorable as power in mean and ignorant hands it makes men wanton and giddy unconcerned at the misfortunes they are imposing on their fellow creatures and keeps them smiling at the mischiefs that bring themselves no advantage They are like madmen that cast fire brands arrows and death and say Are not we in sport FOOTNOTES eleven A contemporary narrative From The

the Land of Madagascar the Latitude of about twenty four Degrees thirteen Minutes North And some time before I had made it I met with nothing but light Airs of Winds and Calms and continued so long My People dropping down with the Scurvy I took a small Still that I had and distill d Salt Water into Fresh I allow d them as much Pease and Flower as they could eat that they might not eat any Salt Provision tho I boil d it in fresh Water I had been very liberal with my fresh Provision in my Passage to my People and the Passage so long that I had hardly any left and that only a few Fowls and myself and Officers too had been much out of Order At last being got to the Northward of Augustin Bay seeing my poor People fall down so very fast it gave me very great Concern for them but still was willing in Hopes of Change of Wind for Johanna But the small Airs trifled with me and what there were Northerly a Current setting to the Southward that what to do I could not well tell To go into Augustin Bay I was very unwilling I had two Boats came off to me the People talking tolerable good English At last my Doctor Sharp told me there were above Thirty People down with the Scurvy and all the rest even some of the Petty Officers were touch d with the same If I did not soon put into Port I plainly found I should have been in a bad Condition for Men I consulted with my Officers to go into Augustin Bay and we agreed and bore away for it Soon after the Wind came Southerly and I bore away for Johanna A fine Passage I had and anchor d the next Day about Four in the Afternoon being Sept thirteen I thank God I brought all my People in alive and that is as much I can say of a good many of them I had a Tent made ashore for them and supplied them all that ever I could and the Doctors assisting with every thing in their Way for their speedy Recovery After I had been here a Fortnight the Winds in the Day time set in very fresh from the N N W to the N N E Finding the People recover so very slowly what to do I could not tell To go out with my People as bad as when they came in I was not willing but resolv d to have Patience one Week more I consulted with mister Rogers my Chief Mate and told him that we must consider the Condition of the People and how we met the Winds and Currents before we came in The People of the Island told me that this was about the time of Year for the Northerly Winds and Southerly Currents and I told him I thought it better to trim all our Casks and fill what Water we could fearing of a long Passage if our Stay was a little longer mister Rogers was of my Opinion This I must say I found the Cask not so well used in the Hold as they ought to have been which caus d the Coopers more Work neither did I make a little Noise about it because I had more Words with my Chief and Second Mate about my Third and Fourth Mate than any thing else Having all my Water aboard about eighty Tun twenty five Head of Oxen c I sail d the thirteenth of October with several of my Men not recover d some I buried at Johanna and some after to the Number of Ten or thereabouts Having a fine Gale I made all the Sail I could except Studding sails which I thought needless The Wind veer d to the Northward and I was resolved to make the Mallabar Course as soon as possible for the Advantage of the Land and Sea Winds I had one Passenger aboard a sad troublesome wicked Fellow whose Behaviour was so bad that I could hardly forbear using him ill I forbid my Officers keeping Company with him but mister B s would do it at all Events I turn d him once off the Quarter Deck for being with him there yet that did not avail I came out one Night about half an Hour past Ten my second Mate s Watch and this B s s Turn to sleep and seeing a Light in his Cabin I sent mister Cuddon the second Mate to him to know how he would be able to sit up one Watch and keep his own Upon this B s came up half way the Steerage Ladder with his Pipe in his Hand and talk d to me very pertly and that was not the first time This put me into a Passion to be so talk d to by a Boy that I did dismiss him for two or three Days and then re stated him which was more than he deserv d for keeping Company with him for whom the worst of Names is good enough and those who recommended him to his Commission B s was told of this by mister Rogers by my Orders and I told him of it on the Quarter Deck and told him at the same time I was resolv d to tell the Gentlemen at Home of and ask d him what he imagin d they would think of him for keeping such swearing drunken Company This was before I dismiss d him Before I came in with the Land hearing much talk of Angria thirteen by captain Scarlet and mister Rogers and of his great Force for I had very little Notion of him before I took care to put the Ship in a proper Posture of Defence Powder Chests on the Quarter Deck Poop and Forecastle a Puncheon fill d with Water in the Main top a Hogshead in the Fore top and a Barrel in the Mizen top all fill d with Water Chests with good Coverings in the Tops for Grenado Shells all the small Arms with fifty new ones in Readiness My Ship being too deep to get the Gun room Ports open as the Gunner inform d me the Ship sending and the Sea washing above the Tops of the Ports I got those Guns into the Great Cabin Quarter Bills over the Guns the Rewards and Close quarters c at the Mizen mast Shot lockers and Shot in their proper Station Pluggs for Shot holes and every thing that I could think of and gave particular Orders to my Gunner Carpenter and Boatswain to have every thing in their way in Readiness the two lower Yards flung with the Top chains Not being easy in my Mind about these Gun room Stern Ports I sent mister Rogers it being smooth Water to open one of the Gun room Stern Ports to see if we could on Occasion get Guns out there but he brought me Word it could not be done with Safety the Ship being so deep A few Days before I made the Land the Winds used to vere and haul that Offing in an Hour I could hardly up from E N E to S E but the Winds chiefly kept to the Northward I was very desirous to make the Land not knowing how far the Southwest Currents might set me to the Westward At noon being Dec twelve I made the Land of Goa in the Latitude of fifteen Degrees North My Chief Mate wanted me to go into Goa but I was resolved not but to make the best of my Way for Bombay The next Morning having a fine Six Knot Gale about Nine o Clock mister Rogers told me he saw Gereah and desired me to haul further off Shore and said if Angria and his Grabbs should see us in his River he would send them out after us I asked him if his Grabbs came out of Sight of Land He told me they were afraid to do that fearing the Bombay Vessels should get between them and the Shore and keep them out of their Ports To prevent running into Danger I kept out of Sight of Land I thought it better to do so since it would make but a few Days Difference in getting at Bombay making no Doubt I should get there the last of the Month as doubtless we should if we had not met with our sad Misfortune When it was too late I was acquainted by those taken in the Severn that mister Rogers inform d me wrong for Angria sometimes keeps the Shore aboard and sometimes goes directly out to Sea sixty Leagues off It was too late to reflect neither could I blame myself knowing I had done every thing to the best of my Judgment But had I been better inform d it is my Opinion we might have escaped those cursed Dogs by keeping in Shore and taken the Advantage of the Land and Sea Winds I have since repented that we did not go into Goa but God knows whether a Man goes too fast or too slow for I had certainly a very suitable Cargo for that Place But my earnest Desire was to get to Bombay the Season of the Year being far advanc d December twenty six being my second Mate s Morning Watch about Five o Clock he came to me and told me he saw Nine Sail of Gallivats I got up and found them to be Five Top mast Vessels and Four Gallivats not above two Miles from us I order d all Hands to be call d and down with the Cabins in the Steerage which was done in an Instant and every body to their respective Quarters They came up with us apace having but light Airs of Winds and found them to be Angria s Fleet I had the Transome in the great Cabin and the Balcony in the Round house cut away for traversing the Stern Chase Guns They came up with me very boldly within Pistol shot Before Six they began firing upon us throwing their Shot in at our Stern raking us afore and aft I order d everything to be got ready for going about to give them my Broad side when my Chief Mate mister Rogers and my Third Mate mister Burroughs came to me and begg d that I would not put about for if I did they would certainly board us As to my Part being a Stranger to this Coast and Angria knowing my Chief Mate had been often this Way and my Third Mate had sail d in the Gallies I was over prevail d upon not to tack about As the Enemy kept under my Stern playing their Shot in very hot upon us and destroying my Rigging so fast I soon after endeavour d to wear the Ship upon the Enemy but the Wind dying away to a Calm she would not regard her Helm but lay like a Log in the Water By Eight o Clock most of my Rigging was destroy d and the Long boat taking Fire a stern was forc d to cut her away The Yaul being stove by their shot we launch d her overboard By Nine the Top chain that flung the Main yard was shot away with Geer and Geer Blocks The Main yard came next down with the Sails almost torn to Pieces with the Shot As fast as our People knotted and spliced the Rigging it was shot away in their Hands The Water Tubs in the Tops were shot to pieces and the Boatswain s Mate s Leg shot off in the Main top One of the Foremast Men s Leg was shot off in the Fore top and one wounded By Ten the Mizen mast was shot by the Board Wanting People to cut the Mast Rigging c from her Side found them appear very thin upon Deck and desired my younger Mates to drive them out of their Holes Word was then brought me that my Chief Mate s Leg was shot off but that he was in good Heart All this time it was a Calm and our Guns of the Broad side of no Service not being able during the Engagement to bring one Gun to bear upon them They kept throwing their shot so thick in at our Stern with a continual Fire and we return d it as fast as we could load and fire About One my Main mast was shot by the Board and the Fall of that stove the Pinnace on the Booms The Loss of my Main mast gave me a very great Concern and seeing the Condition of the Fore mast the Fore yard half way down and the Top sail Yard arm sprung in several Places the Head of the Top gallant Mast shot away render d that Mast quite useless I could not see which way it was in the Power of Men to save us from these Dogs However I made myself as easy as could be expected and kept my Thoughts to myself Tho the Shot were like Hail about my Ears I thank God I escaped them neither did they give me much Uneasiness as to my Person The Grabbs perceiving their great Advantage by the Fall of our Main mast c tho all the time before within Musket Shot come up boldly within Call throwing in at our Stern Double round and Partridge as fast as they could load and fire we doing the same with Bolts c We saw a great many Holes in their Sails Soon after this they lodg d two Double head Shot and a large Stone in the Fore mast the Shrowds of which were mostly gone I often sent captain Scarlet to mister Cudden to encourage the People and to take care to cool his Guns and not fire in Haste but take good Aim We received two Double headed Shot in the Bread room which were soon plugg d up and one Shot under the Larboard Chesstree but so low in the Water that could not get at it and the Ship prov d leaky I had a Pack of sad cowardly ignorant Dogs as ever came into a Ship As to my common Sailors who were not above Twelve Seamen with the Officers they stood by me It was all owing to my Misfortune on the Mouse that I was so poorly Mann d As to my Third Mate B s he did not seem to stomach what he was about he was sometimes on the Quarter Deck not being able to use any Guns but the Stern Chase and every Shot the Enemy fir d he cowardly trembled with his Head almost down to the Deck This Captain Scarlet has often declared to the Gentlemen at Bombay and before those that are now coming Home I had six Men kill d and six their Legs shot off with several others wounded by their Partridge Shot c Had our People kept the Deck like Men there must have been several more kill d and wounded About Three I heard a great Call for Shot and desired captain Scarlet to go to mister Cuddon and tell him not to fire in Waste We lay now just like a Wreck in the Sea and at our Wits Ends Our Shot being almost spent we had a Hole cut in the Well to try to come at the Company s We continued on with Double round and Partridge and Bolts c with a Double Allowance of Powder to each Gun doing the utmost we could to save the Ship The Tiller rope was now shot away tho of no Service before The Carpenter told me the Ship made a great deal of Water and had above two Foot in her Hold The Caulker afterwards told me she had three Foot I saw nothing we could do more than firing our Stern Chase There was a sad Complaint for Shot however we fir d Bolts I call d out to the People to have good Hearts and went into the Round house to encourage them there It was very hard we could stand no Chance for a Mast of theirs nor no lucky Shot to disable some of them in all the Number that we fir d As to our small Arms they were of little Service they keeping their Men so close The Rigging of the Foremast being gone and that fetching so much way I expected it to go every Minute and about Seven in the Evening the Ship falling off into the Trough of the Sea the Foremast came by the Board It was now about Four o Clock when mister Thomas Rogers my Chief Mate sent my Steward to desire to speak with me When I went to him he spoke to me to this Purpose Sir says he I am inform d what Condition the Ship is in as her Masts are gone you had better not be obstinate in standing out longer it will only be the Means of making more Objects of murdering more Men and all to no Purpose but to be used worse by the Enemy for it is impossible to get away Therefore you had better surrender To the best of my Knowledge I hardly made him any Answer nor had I before he sent to me the least Thoughts of surrendering which I declare before God and Man tho I was well convinc d within myself that it was impossible to save the Ship I went up to my old Station the Quarter Deck and took several Turns as usual and proceeded in the Engagement I begun to consider what mister Rogers told me and the Condition of the Ship and argue within myself the Impossibility of doing any more for if a Gale had sprung up it could be of no Service and all the time from the Fall of our Main mast the Enemy were got so near that I could hear them talk and my Second Mate did the same As to our Masts they had gain d their Ends and their only Business now was to fire at the Hull There was no Hopes of their leaving us considering the condition they had brought us to and it could not be long before we sunk for as they lay so near us and so low in Water our Shot must doubtless fly over them At last I was of mister Rogers s Opinion that it was only sacrificing the Men to no Purpose for they had so large a Mark of us they could not miss us and during all the Engagement as they play d their Shot so hot at our Stern it is surprizing there were not many more Men Kill d I then sent for my Second and Third Mate and told them mister Rogers s Opinion and my own They both agreed to it and consented to the surrendering of the Ship So we submitted to the Enemy finding it in vain to proceed By my Watch it was Five o Clock My Second and Third Mate went in to the Steerage to forbid firing and myself in the Round House did the same Every Body seem d to be very well satisfied as to the surrendering Part and no Objection was made Colours we had none to strike those and the Ensign Staff were shot to Pieces and what was left of the Ensign being made fast to the Main Shrowds went with the Mast captain Scarlet went into the Round House and call d the Enemy on board and told them we had no Boats They sent their Dingey aboard with Four Men for me and my chief Officers They left Two of the Four aboard the Derby Myself and my Second Mate went in the Dingey aboard the Grabb We were gone an Hour and a half good if not more then we return d in a Gallivat with fifty or sixty Men but not a Soul went aboard the Derby till we return d Then came aboard more Gallivats and more Men and secured the Arms c and drove our People up some to the Pumps and some to clear the Rigging off the Ship s Side They transkipt to their Grabbs what Treasure could be got at and the next Day turn d out the Remainder with myself Scarlet Cuddon the two Ladies and my Servants into one of the Grabbs FOOTNOTES thirteen A noted pirate FRANCIS LOLONOIS THE SLAVE WHO BECAME A PIRATE KING fourteen JOHN ESQUEMELING Francis Lolonois was a native of that territory in France which is called Les Sables d Olone or The Sands of Olone In his youth he was transported to the Caribbee islands in quality of servant or slave according to custom Having served his time he came to Hispaniola here he joined for some time with the hunters before he began his robberies upon the Spaniards At first he made two or three voyages as a common mariner wherein he behaved himself so courageously as to gain the favor of the governor of Tortuga Monsieur de la Place insomuch that he gave him a ship in which he might seek his fortune which was very favorable to him at first for in a short time he got great riches But his cruelties against the Spaniards were such that the fame of them made him so well known through the Indies that the Spaniards in his time would choose rather to die or sink fighting than surrender knowing they should have no mercy at his hands But Fortune being seldom constant after some time turned her back for in a huge storm he lost his ship on the coast of Campechy The men were all saved but coming upon dry land the Spaniards pursued them and killed the greatest part wounding also Lolonois Not knowing how to escape he saved his life by a stratagem mingling sand with the blood of his wounds with which besmearing his face and other parts of his body and hiding himself dextrously among the dead he continued there till the Spaniards quitted the field They being gone he retired to the woods and bound up his wounds as well as he could These being pretty well healed he took his way to Campechy having disguised himself in a Spanish habit here he enticed certain slaves to whom he promised liberty if they would obey him and trust to his conduct They accepted his promises and stealing a canoe they went to sea with him Now the Spaniards having made several of his companions prisoners kept them close in a dungeon while Lolonois went about the town and saw what passed These were often asked What is become of your captain To whom they constantly answered He is dead which rejoiced the Spaniards who made thanks to God for their deliverance from such a cruel pirate Lolonois having seen these rejoicings for his death made haste to escape with the slaves above mentioned and came safe to Tortuga the common refuge of all sorts of wickedness and the seminary as it were of pirates and thieves Though now his fortune was low yet he got another ship with craft and subtlety and in it twenty one men Being well provided with arms and necessaries he set forth for Cuba on the south whereof is a small village called De los Cayos The inhabitants drive a great trade in tobacco sugar and hides and all in boats not being able to use ships by reason of the little depth of that sea Lolonois was persuaded he should get here some considerable prey but by the good fortune of some fishermen who saw him and the mercy of God they escaped him for the inhabitants of the town dispatched immediately a vessel overland to the Havannah complaining that Lolonois was come to destroy them with two canoes The governor could hardly believe this having received letters from Campechy that he was dead but at their importunity he sent a ship for their relief with ten guns and ninety men well armed giving them this express command that they should not return into his presence without having totally destroyed those pirates To this effect he gave them a negro to serve for a hangman and orders that they should immediately hang every one of the pirates excepting Lolonois their captain whom they should bring alive to the Havannah This ship arrived at Cayos of whose coming the pirates were advertised beforehand and instead of flying went to seek it in the river Estera where she rode at anchor The pirates seized some fishermen and forced them by night to show them the entry of the port hoping soon to obtain a greater vessel than their two canoes and thereby to mend their fortune They arrived after two in the morning very nigh the ship and the watch on board the ship asking them whence they came and if they had seen any pirates abroad They caused one of the prisoners to answer they had seen no pirates nor anything else Which answer made them believe that they were fled upon hearing of their coming But they soon found the contrary for about break of day the pirates assaulted the vessel on both sides with their two canoes with such vigor that though the Spaniards behaved themselves as they ought and made as good defense as they could making some use of their great guns yet they were forced to surrender being beaten by the pirates with sword in hand down under the hatches From hence Lolonois commanded them to be brought up one by one and in this order caused their heads to be struck off Among the rest came up the negro designed to be the pirates executioner this fellow implored mercy at his hands very dolefully telling Lolonois he was constituted hangman of that ship and if he would spare him he would tell him faithfully all that he should desire Lolonois making him confess what he thought fit commanded him to be murdered with the rest Thus he cruelly and barbarously put them all to death reserving only one alive whom he sent back to the governor of the Havannah with this message in writing I shall never henceforward give quarter to any Spaniard whatsoever and I have great hopes I shall execute on your own person the very same punishment I have done upon them you sent against me Thus I have retaliated the kindness you designed to me and my companions The governor much troubled at this bad news swore in the presence of many that he would never grant quarter to any pirate that should fall into his hands But the citizens of the Havannah desired him not to persist in the execution of that rash and rigorous oath seeing the pirates would certainly take occasion from thence to do the same and they had an hundred times more opportunity of revenge than he that being necessitated to get their livelihood by fishery they should hereafter always be in danger of their lives By these reasons he was persuaded to bridle his anger and remit the severity of his oath Now Lolonois had got a good ship but very few provisions and people in it to purchase both which he resolved to cruise from one port to another Doing thus for some time without success he determined to go to the port of Maracaibo Here he surprised a ship laden with plate and other merchandises outward bound to buy cocoa nuts With this prize he returned to Tortuga where he was received with joy by the inhabitants they congratulating his happy success and their own private interest He stayed not long there but designed to equip a fleet sufficient to transport five hundred men and necessaries Thus provided he resolved to pillage both cities towns and villages and finally to take Maracaibo itself For this purpose he knew the island of Tortuga would afford him many resolute and courageous men fit for such enterprises besides he had in his service several prisoners well acquainted with the ways and places designed upon Of this design Lolonois giving notice to all the pirates whether at home or abroad he got together in a little while above four hundred men beside which there was then in Tortuga another pirate named Michael de Basco who by his piracy had got riches sufficient to live at ease and go no more abroad having withal the office of major of the island But seeing the great preparations that Lolonois made for this expedition he joined him and offered him that if he would make him his chief captain by land seeing he knew the country very well and all its avenues he would share in his fortunes and go with him They agreed upon articles to the great joy of Lolonois knowing that Basco had done great actions in Europe and had the repute of a good soldier Thus they all embarked in eight vessels that of Lolonois being the greatest having ten guns of indifferent carriage All things being ready and the whole company on board they set sail together about the end of April being in all six hundred and sixty persons They steered for that part called Bayala north of Hispaniola here they took into their company some French hunters who voluntarily offered themselves and here they provided themselves with victuals and necessaries for their voyage From hence they sailed again the last of July and steered directly to the eastern cape of the isle called Punta d Espada Hereabouts espying a ship from Puerto Rico bound for New Spain laden with cocoa nuts Lolonois commanded the rest of the fleet to wait for him near Savona on the east of Cape Punta d Espada he alone intending to take the said vessel The Spaniards though they had been in sight full two hours and knew them to be pirates yet would not flee but prepared to fight being well armed and provided The combat lasted three hours and then they surrendered This ship had sixteen guns and fifty fighting men aboard they found in her one hundred twenty thousand weight of cocoa forty thousand pieces of eight and the value of ten thousand more in jewels Lolonois sent the vessel presently to Tortuga to be unladed with orders to return as soon as possible to Savona where he would wait for them meanwhile the rest of the fleet being arrived at Savona met another Spanish vessel coming from Coman with military provisions to Hispaniola and money to pay the garrisons there This vessel they also took without any resistance though mounted with eight guns In it were seven thousand weight of powder a great number of muskets and like things with twelve thousand pieces of eight These successes encouraged the pirates they seeming very lucky beginnings especially finding their fleet pretty well recruited in a little time for the first ship arriving at Tortuga the governor ordered it to be instantly unladen and soon after sent back with fresh provisions and other necessaries to Lolonois This ship he chose for himself and gave that which he commanded to his comrade Anthony du Puis Being thus recruited with men in lieu of them he had lost in taking the prizes and by sickness he found himself in a good condition to set sail for Maracaibo in the province of Neuva Venezuela in the latitude of twelve deg ten min north This island is twenty leagues long and twelve broad To this port also belong the islands of Onega and Monges The east side thereof is called Cape saint Roman and the western side Cape of Caquibacoa the gulf is called by some the Gulf of Venezuela but the pirates usually call it the Bay of Maracaibo At the entrance of this gulf are two islands extending from east to west that towards the east is called Isla de las Vigilias or the Watch Isle because in the middle is a high hill on which stands a watch house The other is called Isla de la Palomas or the Isle of Pigeons Between these two islands runs a little sea or rather lake of fresh water sixty leagues long and thirty broad which disgorging itself into the ocean dilates itself about the said two islands Between them is the best passage for ships the channel being no broader than the flight of a great gun of about eight pounds On the Isle of Pigeons standeth a castle to impede the entry of vessels all being necessitated to come very nigh the castle by reason of two banks of sand on the other side with only fourteen feet water Many other banks of sand there are in this lake as that called El Tablazo or the Great Table no deeper than ten feet forty leagues within the lake others there are that have no more than six seven or eight feet in depth all are very dangerous especially to mariners unacquainted with them West hereof is the city of Maracaibo very pleasant to the view its houses being built along the shore having delightful prospects all round the city may contain three or four thousand persons slaves included all which make a town of reasonable bigness There are judged to be about eight hundred persons able to bear arms all Spaniards Here are one parish church well built and adorned four monasteries and one hospital The city is governed by a deputy governor substituted by the governor of the Caraccas The trade here exercised is mostly in hides and tobacco The inhabitants possess great numbers of cattle and many plantations which extend thirty leagues in the country especially towards the great town of Gibraltar where are gathered great quantities of cocoa nuts and all other garden fruits which serve for the regale and sustenance of the inhabitants of Maracaibo whose territories are much drier than those of Gibraltar Hither those of Maracaibo send great quantities of flesh they making returns in oranges lemons and other fruits for the inhabitants of Gibraltar want flesh their fields not being capable of feeding cows or sheep Before Maracaibo is a very spacious and secure port wherein may be built all sorts of vessels having great convenience of timber which may be transported thither at little charge Nigh the town lies also a small island called Borrica where they feed great numbers of goats which cattle the inhabitants use more for their skins than their flesh or milk they slighting these two unless while they are tender and young kids In the fields are fed some sheep but of a very small size In some islands of the lake and in other places hereabouts are many savage Indians called by the Spaniards bravoes or wild these could never be reduced by the Spaniards being brutish and untameable They dwell mostly towards the west side of the lake in little huts built on trees growing in the water so to keep themselves from innumerable mosquitoes or gnats which infest and torment them night and day To the east of the said lake are whole towns of fishermen who likewise live in huts built on trees as the former Another reason of this dwelling is the frequent inundations for after great rains the land is often overflown for two or three leagues there being no less than twenty five great rivers that feed this lake The town of Gibraltar is also frequently drowned by these so that the inhabitants are constrained to retire to their plantations Gibraltar situate at the side of the lake about forty leagues within it receives its provisions of flesh as has been said from Maracaibo The town is inhabited by about fifteen hundred persons whereof four hundred may bear arms the greatest part of them keep shops wherein they exercise one trade or another In the adjacent fields are numerous plantations of sugar and cocoa in which are many tall and beautiful trees of whose timber houses may be built and ships Among these are many handsome and proportionable cedars seven or eight feet about of which they can build boats and ships so as to bear only one great sail such vessels being called piraguas The whole country is well furnished with rivers and brooks very useful in droughts being then cut into many little channels to water their fields and plantations They plant also much tobacco well esteemed in Europe and for its goodness is called there tobacco de sacerdotes or priest s tobacco They enjoy nigh twenty leagues of jurisdiction which is bounded by very high mountains perpetually covered with snow On the other side of these mountains is situate a great city called Merida to which the town of Gibraltar is subject All merchandise is carried hence to the aforesaid city on mules and that but at one season of the year by reason of the excessive cold in those high mountains On the said mules returns are made in flour of meal which comes from towards Peru by the way of Estaffe Lolonois arriving at the gulf of Venezuela cast anchor with his whole fleet out of sight of the Vigilia or Watch Isle next day very early he set sail thence with all his ships for the lake of Maracaibo where they cast anchor again then they landed their men with design to attack first the fortress that commanded the bar therefore called de la barra This fort consisted only of several great baskets of earth placed on a rising ground planted with sixteen great guns with several other heaps of earth round about for covering their men the pirates having landed a league off this fort advanced by degrees towards it but the governor having espied their landing had placed an ambuscade to cut them off behind while he should attack them in front This the pirates discovered and getting before they defeated it so entirely that not a man could retreat to the castle this done Lolonois with his companions advanced immediately to the fort and after a fight of almost three hours with the usual desperation of this sort of people they became masters thereof without any other arms than swords and pistols while they were fighting those who were the routed ambuscade not being able to get into the castle retired into Maracaibo in great confusion and disorder crying The pirates will presently be here with two thousand men and more The city having formerly been taken by this kind of people and sacked to the uttermost had still an idea of that misery so that upon these dismal news they endeavored to escape towards Gibraltar in their boats and canoes carrying with them all the goods and money they could Being come to Gibraltar they told how the fortress was taken and nothing had been saved nor any persons escaped The castle thus taken by the pirates they presently signified to the ships their victory that they should come farther in without fear of danger the rest of that day was spent in ruining and demolishing the said castle They nailed the guns and burnt as much as they could not carry away burying the dead and sending on board the fleet the wounded Next day very early they weighed anchor and steered directly towards Maracaibo about six leagues distant from the fort but the wind failing that day they could advance little being forced to await the tide Next morning they came in sight of the town and prepared for landing under the protection of their own guns fearing the Spaniards might have laid an ambuscade in the woods They put their men into canoes brought for that purpose and landed shooting meanwhile furiously with their great guns Of those in the canoes half only went ashore the other half remained aboard They fired from the ships as fast as possible towards the woody part of the shore but could discover nobody then they entered the town whose inhabitants were retired to the woods and Gibraltar with their wives children and families Their houses they left well provided with victuals as flour bread pork brandy wines and poultry and with these the pirates fell to making good cheer for in four weeks before they had no opportunity of filling their stomachs with such plenty They instantly possessed themselves of the best houses in the town and placed sentinels wherever they thought necessary the great church served them for their main guard Next day they sent out an hundred and sixty men to find out some of the inhabitants in the woods thereabouts These returned the same night bringing with them twenty thousand pieces of eight several mules laden with household goods and merchandise and twenty prisoners men women and children Some of these were put to the rack to make them confess where they had hid the rest of the goods but they could extort very little from them Lolonois who valued not murdering though in cold blood ten or twelve Spaniards drew his cutlass and hacked one to pieces before the rest saying If you do not confess and declare where you have hid the rest of your goods I will do the like to all your companions At last amongst these horrible cruelties and inhuman threats one promised to show the place where the rest of the Spaniards were hid But those that were fled having intelligence of it changed place and buried the remnant of their riches underground so that the pirates could not find them out unless some of their own party should reveal them Besides the Spaniards flying from one place to another every day and often changing woods were jealous even of each other so that the father durst scarce trust his own son After the pirates had been fifteen days in Maracaibo they resolved for Gibraltar but the inhabitants having received intelligence thereof and that they intended afterwards to go to Merida gave notice of it to the governor there who was a valiant soldier and had been an officer in Flanders His answer was he would have them take no care for he hoped in a little while to exterminate the said pirates Whereupon he came to Gibraltar with four hundred men well armed ordering at the same time the inhabitants to put themselves in arms so that in all he made eight hundred fighting men With the same speed he raised a battery toward the sea mounted with twenty guns covered with great baskets of earth another battery he placed in another place mounted with eight guns This done he barricaded a narrow passage to the town through which the pirates must pass opening at the same time another one through much dirt and mud into a wood which was totally unknown to the pirates The pirates ignorant of these preparations having embarked all their prisoners and booty took their way towards Gibraltar Being come in sight of the place they saw the royal standard hanging forth and that those of the town designed to defend their homes Lolonois seeing this called a council of war what they ought to do telling his officers and mariners That the difficulty of the enterprise was very great seeing the Spaniards had had so much time to put themselves in a posture of defense and had got a good body of men together with much ammunition but notwithstanding said he have a good courage we must either defend ourselves like good soldiers or lose our lives with all the riches we have got Do as I shall do who am your captain at other times we have fought with fewer men than we have in our company at present and yet we have overcome greater numbers than there possibly can be in this town the more they are the more glory and the greater riches we shall gain The pirates supposed that all the riches of the inhabitants of Maracaibo were transported to Gibraltar or at least the greatest part After this speech they all promised to follow and obey him Lolonois made answer Tis well but know ye withal that the first man who shall show any fear or the least apprehension thereof I will pistol him with my own hands With this resolution they cast anchor nigh the shore near three quarters of a league from the town next day before sun rising they landed three hundred and eighty men well provided and armed every one with a cutlass and one or two pistols and sufficient powder and bullet for thirty charges Here they all shook hands in testimony of good courage and began their march Lolonois speaking thus Come my brethren follow me and have good courage They followed their guide who believing he led them well brought them to the way which the governor had barricaded Not being able to pass that way they went to the other newly made in the wood among the mire which the Spaniards could shoot into at pleasure but the pirates full of courage cut down the branches of trees and threw them on the way that they might not stick in the dirt Meanwhile those of Gibraltar fired with their great guns so furiously they could scarce hear nor see for the noise and smoke Being passed the wood they came on firm ground where they met with a battery of six guns which immediately the Spaniards discharged upon them all loaded with small bullets and pieces of iron and the Spaniards sallying forth set upon them with such fury as caused the pirates to give way few of them caring to advance towards the fort many of them being already killed and wounded This made them go back to seek another way but the Spaniards having cut down many trees to hinder the passage they could find none but were forced to return to that they had left Here the Spaniards continued to fire as before nor would they sally out of their batteries to attack them any more Lolonois and his companions not being able to climb up the bastion of earth were compelled to use an old stratagem wherewith at last they deceived and overcame the Spaniards Lolonois retired suddenly with all his men making show as if he fled hereupon the Spaniards crying out They flee they flee let us follow them sallied forth with great disorder to the pursuit Being drawn to some distance from the batteries which was the pirates only design they turned upon them unexpectedly with sword in hand and killed above two hundred men and thus fighting their way through those who remained they possessed themselves of the batteries The Spaniards that remained abroad giving themselves over for lost fled to the woods those in the battery of eight guns surrendered themselves obtaining quarter for their lives The pirates being now become masters of the town pulled down the Spanish colors and set up their own taking prisoners as many as they could find These they carried to the great church where they raised a battery of several great guns fearing lest the Spaniards that were fled should rally and come upon them again but next day being all fortified their fears were over They gathered the dead to bury them being above five hundred Spaniards besides the wounded in the town and those that died of their wounds in the woods The pirates had also above one hundred and fifty prisoners and nigh five hundred slaves many women and children Of their own companions only forty were killed and almost eighty wounded whereof the greatest part died through the bad air which brought fevers and other illness They put the slain Spaniards into two great boats and carrying them a quarter of a league to sea they sunk the boats this done they gathered all the plate household stuff and merchandise they could or thought convenient to carry away The Spaniards who had anything left had hid it carefully but the unsatisfied pirates not contented with the riches they had got sought for more goods and merchandise not sparing those who lived in the fields such as hunters and planters They had scarce been eighteen days on the place when the greatest part of the prisoners died for hunger For in the town were few provisions especially of flesh though they had some but no sufficient quantity of flour of meal and this the pirates had taken for themselves as they also took the swine cows sheep and poultry without allowing any share to the poor prisoners For these they only provided some small quantity of mules and asses flesh and many who could not eat of that loathsome provision died for hunger their stomachs not being accustomed to such sustenance Of the prisoners many also died under the torment they sustained to make them discover their money or jewels and of these some had none nor knew of none and others denying what they knew endured such horrible deaths Finally after having been in possession of the town four entire weeks they sent four of the prisoners to the Spaniards that were fled to the woods demanding of them a ransom for not burning the town The sum demanded was ten thousand pieces of eight which if not sent they threatened to reduce it to ashes For bringing in this money they allowed them only two days but the Spaniards not having been able to gather so punctually such a sum the pirates fired many parts of the town whereupon the inhabitants begged them to help quench the fire and the ransom should be readily paid The pirates condescended helping as much as they could to stop the fire but notwithstanding all their best endeavors one part of the town was ruined especially the church belonging to the monastery was burned down After they had received the said sum they carried aboard all the riches they had got with a great number of slaves which had not paid the ransom for all the prisoners had sums of money set upon them and the slaves were also commanded to be redeemed Thence they returned to Maracaibo where being arrived they found a general consternation in the whole city to which they sent three or four prisoners to tell the governor and inhabitants they should bring them thirty thousand pieces of eight aboard their ships for a ransom of their houses otherwise they should be sacked anew and burned Among these debates a party of pirates came on shore and carried away the images pictures and bells of the great church aboard the fleet The Spaniards who were sent to demand the sum aforesaid returned with orders to make some agreement who concluded with the pirates to give for their ransom and liberty twenty thousand pieces of eight and five hundred cows provided that they should commit no further hostilities but depart thence presently after payment of money and cattle The one and the other being delivered the whole fleet set sail causing great joy to the inhabitants of Maracaibo to see themselves quit of them but three days after they renewed their fears with admiration seeing the pirates appear again and re enter the port with all their ships but these apprehensions vanished upon hearing one of the pirate s errand who came ashore from Lolonois to demand a skilful pilot to conduct one of the greatest ships over the dangerous bank that lieth at the very entry of the lake Which petition or rather command was instantly granted They had now been full two months in these towns wherein they committed those cruel and insolent actions we have related Departing thence they took their course to Hispaniola and arrived there in eight days casting anchor in a port called Isla de la Vacca or Cow Island This island is inhabited by French buccaneers who mostly sell the flesh they hunt to pirates and others who now and then put in there to victual or trade Here they unladed their whole cargazon of riches the usual storehouse of the pirates being commonly under the shelter of the buccaneers Here they made a dividend of all their prizes and gains according to the orders and degree of every one as has been mentioned before Having made an exact calculation of all their plunder they found in ready money two hundred sixty thousand pieces of eight this being divided every one received for his share in money as also in silk linen and other commodities to the value of one hundred pieces of eight Those who had been wounded received their first part after the rate mentioned before for the loss of their limbs then they weighed all the plate uncoined reckoning ten pieces of eight to a pound the jewels were prized indifferently either too high or too low by reason of their ignorance this done every one was put to his oath again that he had not smuggled anything from the common stock Hence they proceeded to the dividend of the shares of such as were dead in battle or otherwise these shares were given to their friends to be kept entire for them and to be delivered in due time to their nearest relations or their apparent lawful heirs The whole dividend being finished they set sail for Tortuga Here they arrived a month after to the great joy of most of the island for as to the common pirates in three weeks they had scarce any money left having spent it all in things of little value or lost it at play Here had arrived not long before them two French ships with wine and brandy and suchlike commodities whereby these liquors at the arrival of the pirates were indifferent cheap But this lasted not long for soon after they were enhanced extremely a gallon of brandy being sold for four pieces of eight The governor of the island bought of the pirates the whole cargo of the ship laden with cocoa giving for that rich commodity scarce the twentieth part of its worth Thus they made shift to lose and spend the riches they had got in much less time than they were obtained The taverns and stews according to the custom of pirates got the greatest part so that soon after they were forced to seek more by the same unlawful means they had got the former FOOTNOTES fourteen The Buccaneers of America THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE DORRILL AND THE MOCA fifteen These truly representeth a scheem of what misfortune has befell us as we were going through the streights of Malacca in the persuance to our pretended voyage vizt Wednesday the seventh July five o clock morning we espied a ship to windward as soon as was well light perceived her to bare down upon us Wee thought at first she had been a Dutchman bound for Atcheen or Bengall when perceived she had no Gallerys did then suppose her to be what after to our dreadful sorrow found her Wee gott our ship in the best posture of defence that suddain emergent necessity would permitt Wee kept good looking out expecting to see an Island called Pullo Verello Pulo Barahla but as then saw it not About eight of the clock the ship came up fairely within shott Saw in room of our Gallerys there was large sally ports in each of which was a large gunn seemed to be brass Her tafferill was likewise taken downe Wee having done what possibly could to prepare ourselves fearing might be suddenly sett on ordered our people to their respective stations for action Wee now hoisted our colours The Captain commanded to naile our Ensigne to the staff in sight of the enimie which was immediately done As they perceived wee hoisted our colours they hoisted theirs with the Union Jack and let fly a broad red Pendant at their maintopmast head The Pirate being now in little more than half Pistoll shott from us wee could discerne abundance of men who went aft to the Quarter Deck which as wee suppose was to consult They stood as we stood but wee spoke neither to other Att noone it fell calme so that wee were affraid should by the sea have been hove on one another Att one a clock sprang up a gale The Pirate kept as wee kept Att three a clock the villain backt her sailes and they went from us Wee kept close halled having a contrary wind for Mallacca When the Pirate was about seven miles distant tackt and stood after us Att six that evening saw the lookt for island and the Pirate came up with us on our starboard side within shott Wee see he kept a man at each topmast head looking out till it was darke then he halled a little from us but kept us company all night At eight in the morning he drew near us but wee had time to mount our other four guns that were in hold and now wee were in the best posture of defence could desire He drawing near us and seeing that if wee would wee could not gett from him he far outsailing us by or large in one direction or another the Captain resolved to see what the rogue would doe soe ordered to hand furl all our small sailes and furled our mainesaile He seeing this did the like and as he drew near us beat a drum and sounded trumpets and then hailed us four times before we answered him At last it was thought fitt to know what he would say soe the Boatswaine spoke to him as was ordered which was that wee came from London Then he enquired whether peace or war with France Our answer there was an universall peace through Europe att which they paused and then said That s well He further enquired if had touched at Attcheen Wee said a boat came off to us but wee came not near itt by several leagues Further he enquired our Captain s name and whither wee were bound Wee answered to Mallacca They too and would have had the Captain gone aboard to drink a glass of wine Wee said that would see one another at Mallacca Then he called to lye by and he would come aboard us Our answer was as before saying it was late He said true it was for China and enquired whether should touch at the Water Islands Pulo Ondan off Malacca Wee said should Then said he So shall wee After he had asked us all these questions wee desired to know from whence he was He said from London their Captain name Collyford the ship named the Resolution bound for China This Collyford had been Gunners Mate at Bombay and after run away with the Ketch Thus past the eighth July Friday the ninth do he being some distance from us About one two an hour after ten came up with us Then it grew calme Wee could discerne a fellow on the Quarter Deck wearing a sword As he drew near this Hellish Imp cried Strike you doggs which wee perceived was not by a general consent for he was called away Our Boatswaine in a fury run upon the poop unknown to the Captain and answered that wee would strike to noe such doggs as he telling him the rogue Every and his accomplices were all hanged The Captain was angry that he spake without order then ordered to haile him and askt what was his reason to dogg us One stept forward on the forecastle beckoned with his hand and said Gentlemen wee want not your ship nor men but money Wee told them had none for them but bid them come up alongside and take it as could gett it Then a parcell of bloodhound rogues clasht their cutlashes and said they would have itt or our hearts blood saying What doe you not know us to be the Moca Our answer was Yes Yes Thereon they gave a great shout and so they all went out of sight and wee to our quarters They were going to hoist colours but the ensigne halliards broke which our people perceiving gave a great shout so they lett them alone As soon as they could bring their chase gunns to bear fired upon us and soe kept on our quarter Our gunns would not bear in a small space but as soon as did hap gave them better than the pirates did like His second shott carried away our spritt saile yard About half on hour after or more he came up alongside and soe wee powered in upon him and continued some time broadsides and sometimes three or four gunns as opportunity presented and could bring them to doe best service He was going to lay us athwart the hawse but by God s providence Captain Hide frustrated his intent by pouring a broadside into him which made him give back and goe asterne where he lay and paused without fireing then in a small space fired one gunn The shott come in at our round house window without damage to any person after which he filled and bore away and when was about one four mile off fired a gunn to leeward which wee answered by another to windward About an hour after he tackt and came up with us againe Wee made noe saile but lay by to receive him but he kept aloof off The distance att most in all our fireing was never more than two ships length the time of our engagement was from one two an hour after eleven till about three afternoon When wee came to see what damage wee had sustained found our Cheife Mate mister Smith wounded in the legg close by the knee with a splinter or piece of chaine which cannot well be told our Barber had two of his fingers shott off as was spunging one of our gunns the Gunner s boy had his legg shott off in the waste John Amos Quartermaster had his leg shott off while at the helme the Boatswaine s boy a lad of thirteen years old was shott in the thigh which went through and splintered his bone the Armorer Jos Osborne in the round house wounded by a splinter just in the temple the Captain s boy on the Quarter Deck a small shott raised his scull through his cap and was the first person wounded and att the first onsett Wm Reynolds s boy had the brim of his hatt one two shott off and his forefinger splintered very sorely John Blake turner the flesh of his legg and calfe a great part shott away Our ships damage is the Mizentopmast shott close by the cap and it was a miracle stood soe long and did not fall in the rogues sight Our rigging shott that had but one running rope left clear our mainshrouds three on one side two on the other cutt in two Our mainyard ten feet from the mast by a shott cutt eight inches deep our foretopmast backstays shott away a great shott in the roundhouse one on the Quarter Deck and two of the roundhouse shott came on the said deck severall in the stearidge betwixt decks and in the forecastle two in the bread room which caused us to make much water and damaged the greatest part of our bread They dismounted one of our gunns in the roundhouse two in the stearidge two in the waste one in the forecastle with abundance more damage which may seem tedious to rehearse Their small shott were most Tinn and Tuthenage tutenaga spelter They fired pieces of glass bottles do teapots chains stones and what not which were found on our decks We could observe abundance of great shott to have passed through the rogues foresaile and our hope is have done that to him which will make him shunn having to do with any Europe ship againe Att night wee perceived kept close their lights Wee did the like and lay by In the morning they were as far off as wee could discerne upon deck Wee sent up to see how they stood which was right with us In the night wee knotted our rigging and in the morning made all haist to repare our carriages Our men seeing they stood after us wee could perceive their countinances to be dejected Wee cheared them what wee could and for their encouragement the Captain and wee of our proper money did give them to every man and boy three dollars each which animated them and promised to give them as much more if engaged againe and that if wee took the ship for every prisoner five pounds and besides a gratuity from the Gentlemen Employers Wee read the King s Proclamation about Every c and the Right Honble Company s About nine o clock the tenth July wee perceived the rogue made from us soe wee gave the Almighty our most condigne thanks for his mercy that delivered us not to the worst of our enimies for truly he the pirate was very strong having at least an hundred Europeans on board thirty four gunns mounted besides ten pattererers and two small mortars in the head his lower tier some of them as wee judged sixteen and eighteen pounders We lay as near our course as could and next day saw land on our starboard side which was the Maine Land Kept on our way The twelfth July dyed the Boatswaine s boy George Mopp in the morning Friday the sixteenth do in the evening dyed the Gunner s boy Thomas Matthews Sunday the eighteenth at anchor two leagues from the Pillo Sumbelong Pulo Sembilan Islands dyed the Barber Andrew Miller Do the thirty first dyed the Cheife Mate mister John Smith The other two are yet in a very deplorable condition and wee are ashore here to refresh them The Chinese further report the Mocco was at the Maldives and creaned careened there they gave an end to the life of their commanding rogue Stout who they murdered for attempting to run away FOOTNOTES fifteen From The Indian Antiquary Vol forty nine JADDI THE MALAY PIRATE sixteen Long before that action with the English man of war which drove me to Singapore I sailed in a fine fleet of prahus belonging to the Rajah of Johore Sultan Mahmad Shah We were all then very rich ah such numbers of beautiful wives and such feasting but above all we had a great many most holy men in our force When the proper monsoon came we proceeded to sea to fight the Bugismen of Celebes and Chinamen bound from Borneo and the Celebes to Java for you must remember our Rajah was at war with them Jadee always maintained that the proceedings in which he had been engaged partook of a purely warlike and not of a piratical character Our thirteen prahus had all been fitted out in and about Singapore I wish you could have seen them Touhan Tuean Sir These prahus we see here are nothing to them such brass guns such long pendants such creeses Malay kris dagger Allah il Allah Our Datoos datuk a chief were indeed great men Sailing along the coast as high as Patani we then crossed over to Borneo two Illanoon prahus acting as pilots and reached a place called Sambas West Borneo there we fought the Chinese and Dutchmen who ill treat our countrymen and are trying to drive the Malays out of that country Gold dust and slaves in large quantities were here taken most of the latter being our countrymen of Sumatra and Java who are captured and sold to the planters and miners of the Dutch settlements Do you mean to say I asked that the Dutch countenance such traffic The Hollanders replied Jadee have been the bane of the Malay race no one knows the amount of villainy the bloody cruelty of their system towards us They drive us into our prahus to escape their taxes and laws and then declare us pirates and put us to death There are natives in our crew Touhan of Sumatra and Java of Bianca Banka and Borneo ask them why they hate the Dutchmen why they would kill a Dutchman It is because the Dutchman is a false man not like the white man English The Hollander stabs in the dark he is a liar However from Borneo we sailed to Biliton island between Banka and Borneo and Bianca and there waited for some large junks that were expected Our cruise had been so far successful and we feasted away fighting cocks smoking opium and eating white rice At last our scouts told us that a junk was in sight She came a lofty sided one of Fokien Fuhkien We knew these Amoy men would fight like tiger cats for their sugar and silks and as the breeze was fresh we only kept her in sight by keeping close inshore and following her Not to frighten the Chinamen we did not hoist sail but made our slaves pull Oh said Jadee warming up with the recollection of the event oh it was fine to feel what brave fellows we then were Towards night we made sail and closed upon the junk and at daylight it fell a stark calm and we went at our prize like sharks All our fighting men put on their war dresses the Illanoons danced their war dance and all our gongs sounded as we opened out to attack her on different sides But those Amoy men are pigs They burnt joss paper sounded their gongs and received us with such showers of stones hot water long pikes and one or two well directed shots that we hauled off to try the effect of our guns sorry though we were to do it for it was sure to bring the Dutchmen upon us Bang bang we fired at them and they at us three hours did we persevere and whenever we tried to board the Chinese beat us back every time for her side was as smooth and as high as a wall with galleries overhanging We had several men killed and hurt a council was called a certain charm was performed by one of our holy men a famous chief and twenty of our best men devoted themselves to effecting a landing on the junk s deck when our look out prahus made the signal that the Dutchmen were coming and sure enough some Dutch gun boats came sweeping round a headland In a moment we were round and pulling like demons for the shores of Biliton the gun boats in chase of us and the Chinese howling with delight The sea breeze freshened and brought up a schooner rigged boat very fast We had been at work twenty four hours and were heartily tired our slaves could work no longer so we prepared for the Hollanders they were afraid to close upon us and commenced firing at a distance This was just what we wanted we had guns as well as they and by keeping up the fight until dark we felt sure of escape The Dutchmen however knew this too and kept closing gradually upon us and when they saw our prahus bailing out water and blood they knew we were suffering and cheered like devils We were desperate surrender to Dutchmen we never would we closed together for mutual support and determined at last if all hope of escape ceased to run our prahus ashore burn them and lie hid in the jungle until a future day But a brave Datoo with his shattered prahus saved us he proposed to let the Dutchmen board her creese stab with a kris all that did so and then trust to Allah for his escape It was done immediately we all pulled a short distance away and left the brave Datoo s prahu like a wreck abandoned How the Dutchmen yelled and fired into her The slaves and cowards jumped out of the prahu but our braves kept quiet at last as we expected one gun boat dashed alongside of their prize and boarded her in a crowd Then was the time to see how the Malay man could fight the creese was worth twenty swords and the Dutchmen went down like sheep We fired to cover our countrymen who as soon as their work was done jumped overboard and swam to us but the brave Datoo with many more died as brave Malays should do running a muck against a host of enemies The gun boats were quite scared by this punishment and we lost no time in getting away as rapidly as possible but the accursed schooner by keeping more in the offing held the wind and preserved her position signaling all the while for the gun boats to follow her We did not want to fight any more it was evidently an unlucky day On the opposite side of the channel to that we were on the coral reefs and shoals would prevent the Hollanders following us it was determined at all risks to get there in spite of the schooner With the first of the land wind in the evening we set sail before it and steered across for Bianca The schooner placed herself in our way like a clever sailor so as to turn us back but we were determined to push on take her fire and run all risks It was a sight to see us meeting one another but we were desperate we had killed plenty of Dutchmen it was their turn now I was in the second prahu and well it was so for when the headmost one got close to the schooner the Dutchman fired all his guns into her and knocked her at once into a wrecked condition We gave one cheer fired our guns and then pushed on for our lives Ah sir it was a dark night indeed for us Three prahus in all were sunk and the whole force dispersed To add to our misfortunes a strong gale sprang up We were obliged to carry canvas our prahu leaked from shot holes the sea continually broke into her we dared not run into the coral reefs on such a night and bore up for the Straits of Malacca The wounded writhed and shrieked in their agony and we had to pump we fighting men and bale like black fellows Caffre or negro slaves By two in the morning we were all worn out I felt indifferent whether I was drowned or not and many threw down their buckets and sat down to die The wind increased and at last as if to put us out of our misery just such a squall as this came down upon us I saw it was folly contending against our fate and followed the general example God is great we exclaimed but the Rajah of Johore came and reproved us Work until daylight he said and I will ensure your safety We pointed at the black storm which was approaching Is that what you fear he replied and going below he produced just such a wooden spoon and did what you have seen me do and I tell you my captain as I would if the Company Sahib stood before me that the storm was nothing and that we had a dead calm one hour afterwards and were saved God is great and Mahomet is his prophet but there is no charm like the Johore one for killing the wind FOOTNOTES sixteen From The Indian Antiquary Vol forty nine THE TERRIBLE LADRONES seventeen RICHARD GLASSPOOLE On the seventeenth of September eighteen oh nine the Honorable Company s ship Marquis of Ely anchored under the Island of Sam Chow in China about twelve English miles from Macao where I was ordered to proceed in one of our cutters to procure a pilot and also to land the purser with the packet I left the ship at five P M with seven men under my command well armed It blew a fresh gale from the N E We arrived at Macao at nine P M where I delivered the packet to mister Roberts and sent the men with the boat s sails to sleep under the Company s Factory and left the boat in charge of one of the Compradore s men during the night the gale increased At half past three in the morning I went to the beach and found the boat on shore half filled with water in consequence of the man having left her I called the people and baled her out found she was considerably damaged and very leaky At half past five A M the ebb tide making we left Macao with vegetables for the ship One of the Compradore s men who spoke English went with us for the purpose of piloting the ship to Lintin as the Mandarines in consequence of a late disturbance at Macao would not grant permission for regular pilots I had every reason to expect the ship in the roads as she was preparing to get under weigh when we left her but on our rounding Cabaretta Point we saw her five or six miles to leeward under weigh standing on the starboard tack it was then blowing fresh at N E Bore up and stood towards her when about a cable s length to windward of her she tacked we hauled our wind and stood after her A hard squall then coming on with a strong tide and heavy swell against us we drifted fast to leeward and the weather being hazy we soon lost sight of the ship Struck our masts and endeavored to pull finding our efforts useless set a reefed foresail and mizzen and stood towards a country ship at anchor under the land to leeward of Cabaretta Point When within a quarter of a mile of her she weighed and made sail leaving us in a very critical situation having no anchor and drifting bodily on the rocks to leeward Struck the masts after four or five hours hard pulling succeeded in clearing them At this time not a ship in sight the weather clearing up we saw a ship to leeward hull down shipped our masts and made sail towards her she proved to be the Honourable Company s ship Glatton We made signals to her with our handkerchiefs at the mast head she unfortunately took no notice of them but tacked and stood from us Our situation was now truly distressing night closing fast with a threatening appearance blowing fresh with hard rain and a heavy sea our boat very leaky without a compass anchor or provisions and drifting fast on a lee shore surrounded with dangerous rocks and inhabited by the most barbarous pirates I close reefed my sails and kept tack and tack till daylight when we were happy to find we had drifted very little to leeward of our situation in the evening The night was very dark with constant hard squalls and heavy rain Tuesday the nineteenth no ships in sight About ten o clock in the morning it fell calm with very hard rain and a heavy swell struck our masts and pulled not being able to see the land steered by the swell When the weather broke up found we had drifted several miles to leeward During the calm a fresh breeze springing up made sail and endeavored to reach the weather shore and anchor with six muskets we had lashed together for that purpose Finding the boat made no way against the swell and tide bore up for a bay to leeward and anchored about one A M close under the land in five or six fathoms water blowing fresh with hard rain Wednesday the twentieth at daylight supposing the flood tide making weighed and stood over to the weather land but found we were drifting fast to leeward About ten o clock perceived two Chinese boats steering for us Bore up and stood towards them and made signals to induce them to come within hail on nearing them they bore up and passed to leeward of the islands The Chinese we had in the boat advised me to follow them and he would take us to Macao by the leeward passage I expressed my fears of being taken by the Ladrones Our ammunition being wet and the muskets rendered useless we had nothing to defend ourselves with but cutlasses and in too distressed a situation to make much resistance with them having been constantly wet and eaten nothing but a few green oranges for three days As our present situation was a hopeless one and the man assured me there was no fear of encountering any Ladrones I complied with his request and stood in to leeward of the islands where we found the water much smoother and apparently a direct passage to Macao We continued pulling and sailing all day At six o clock in the evening I discovered three large boats at anchor in a bay to leeward On seeing us they weighed and made sail towards us The Chinese said they were Ladrones and that if they captured us they would most certainly put us all to death Finding they gained fast on us struck the masts and pulled head to wind for five or six hours The tide turning against us anchored close under the land to avoid being seen Soon after we saw the boats pass us to leeward Thursday the twenty first at daylight the flood making weighed and pulled along shore in great spirits expecting to be at Macao in two or three hours as by the Chinese account it was not above six or seven miles distant After pulling a mile or two perceived several people on shore standing close to the beach they were armed with pikes and lances I ordered the interpreter to hail them and ask the most direct passage to Macao They said if we came on shore they would inform us not liking their hostile appearance I did not think proper to comply with the request Saw a large fleet of boats at anchor close under the opposite shore Our interpreter said they were fishing boats and that by going there we should not only get provisions but a pilot also to take us to Macao I bore up and on nearing them perceived there were some large vessels very full of men and mounted with several guns I hesitated to approach nearer but the Chinese assuring me they were Mandarine junks eighteen and salt boats we stood close to one of them and asked the way to Macao They gave no answer but made some signs to us to go in shore We passed on and a large rowboat pulled after us she soon came alongside when about twenty savage looking villains who were stowed at the bottom of the boat leaped on board us They were armed with a short sword in each hand one of which they laid on our necks and the other pointed to our breasts keeping their eyes fixed on their officer waiting his signal to cut or desist Seeing we were incapable of making any resistance he sheathed his sword and the others immediately followed his example They then dragged us into their boat and carried us on board one of their junks with the most savage demonstrations of joy and as we supposed to torture and put us to a cruel death When on board the junk they searched all our pockets took the handkerchiefs from our necks and brought heavy chains to chain us to the guns At this time a boat came and took me with one of my men and the interpreter on board the chief s vessel I was then taken before the chief He was seated on deck in a large chair dressed in purple silk with a black turban on He appeared to be about thirty years of age a stout commanding looking man He took me by the coat and drew me close to him then questioned the interpreter very strictly asking who we were and what was our business in that part of the country I told him to say we were Englishmen in distress having been four days at sea without provisions This he would not credit but said we were bad men and that he would put us all to death and then ordered some men to put the interpreter to the torture until he confessed the truth Upon this occasion a Ladrone who had been once to England and spoke a few words of English came to the chief and told him we were really Englishmen and that we had plenty of money adding that the buttons on my coat were gold The chief then ordered us some coarse brown rice of which we made a tolerable meal having eat nothing for nearly four days except a few green oranges During our repast a number of Ladrones crowded round us examining our clothes and hair and giving us every possible annoyance Several of them brought swords and laid them on our necks making signs that they would soon take us on shore and cut us in pieces which I am sorry to say was the fate of some hundreds during my captivity I was now summoned before the chief who had been conversing with the interpreter he said I must write to my captain and tell him if he did not send a hundred thousand dollars for our ransom in ten days he would put us all to death In vain did I assure him it was useless writing unless he would agree to take a much smaller sum saying we were all poor men and the most we could possibly raise would not exceed two thousand dollars Finding that he was much exasperated at my expostulations I embraced the offer of writing to inform my commander of our unfortunate situation though there appeared not the least probability of relieving us They said the letter should be conveyed to Macao in a fishing boat which would bring an answer in the morning A small boat accordingly came alongside and took the letter About six o clock in the evening they gave us some rice and a little salt fish which we ate and they made signs for us to lay down on the deck to sleep but such numbers of Ladrones were constantly coming from different vessels to see us and examine our clothes and hair they would not allow us a moment s quiet They were particularly anxious for the buttons of my coat which were new and as they supposed gold I took it off and laid it on the deck to avoid being disturbed by them it was taken away in the night and I saw it on the next day stripped of its buttons About nine o clock a boat came and hailed the chief s vessel he immediately hoisted his mainsail and the fleet weighed apparently in great confusion They worked to windward all night and part of the next day and anchored about one o clock in a bay under the island of Lantow where the head admiral of Ladrones was lying at anchor with about two hundred vessels and a Portuguese brig they had captured a few days before and murdered the captain and part of the crew Saturday the twenty threed early in the morning a fishing boat came to the fleet to inquire if they had captured an European boat being answered in the affirmative they came to the vessel I was in One of them spoke a few words of English and told me he had a Ladrone pass and was sent by Captain Kay in search of us I was rather surprised to find he had no letter He appeared to be well acquainted with the chief and remained in his cabin smoking opium and playing cards all the day nineteen In the evening I was summoned with the interpreter before the chief He questioned us in a much milder tone saying he now believed we were Englishmen a people he wished to be friendly with and that if our captain would lend him seventy thousand dollars till he returned from his cruise up the river he would repay him and send us all to Macao I assured him it was useless writing on those terms and unless our ransom was speedily settled the English fleet would sail and render our enlargement altogether ineffectual He remained determined and said if it were not sent he would keep us and make us fight or put us to death I accordingly wrote and gave my letter to the man belonging to the boat before mentioned He said he could not return with an answer in less than five days The chief now gave me the letter I wrote when first taken I have never been able to ascertain his reasons for detaining it but suppose he dare not negotiate for our ransom without orders from the head admiral who I understood was sorry at our being captured He said the English ships would join the mandarines and attack them twenty He told the chief that captured us to dispose of us as he pleased Monday the twenty fourth it blew a strong gale with constant hard rain we suffered much from the cold and wet being obliged to remain on deck with no covering but an old mat which was frequently taken from us in the night by the Ladrones who were on watch During the night the Portuguese who were left in the brig murdered the Ladrones that were on board of her cut the cables and fortunately escaped through the darkness of the night I have since been informed they ran her on shore near Macao Tuesday the twenty fifth at daylight in the morning the fleet amounting to about five hundred sail of different sizes weighed to proceed on their intended cruise up the rivers to levy contributions on the towns and villages It is impossible to describe what were my feelings at this critical time having received no answers to my letters and the fleet under way to sail hundreds of miles up a country never visited by Europeans there to remain probably for many months which would render all opportunities of negotiating for our enlargement totally ineffectual as the only method of communication is by boats that have a pass from the Ladrones and they dare not venture above twenty miles from Macao being obliged to come and go in the night to avoid the Mandarines and if these boats should be detected in having any intercourse with the Ladrones they are immediately put to death and all their relations though they had not joined in the crime twenty one share in the punishment in order that not a single person of their families should be left to imitate their crimes or revenge their death This severity renders communication both dangerous and expensive no boat would venture out for less than a hundred Spanish dollars Wednesday the twenty sixth at daylight we passed in sight of our ships at anchor under the island of Chun Po The chief then called me pointed to the ships and told the interpreter to tell us to look at them for we should never see them again About noon we entered a river to the westward of the Bogue three or four miles from the entrance We passed a large town situated on the side of a beautiful hill which is tributary to the Ladrones the inhabitants saluted them with songs as they passed The fleet now divided into two squadrons the red and the black twenty two and sailed up different branches of the river At midnight the division we were in anchored close to an immense hill on the top of which a number of fires were burning which at daylight I perceived proceeded from a Chinese camp At the back of the hill was a most beautiful town surrounded by water and embellished with groves of orange trees The chop house custom house twenty three and a few cottages were immediately plundered and burned down most of the inhabitants however escaped to the camp The Ladrones now prepared to attack the town with a formidable force collected in rowboats from the different vessels They sent a messenger to the town demanding a tribute of ten thousand dollars annually saying if these terms were not complied with they would land destroy the town and murder all the inhabitants which they would certainly have done had the town laid in a more advantageous situation for their purpose but being placed out of the reach of their shot they allowed them to come to terms The inhabitants agreed to pay six thousand dollars which they were to collect by the time of our return down the river This finesse had the desired effect for during our absence they mounted a few guns on a hill which commanded the passage and gave us in lieu of the dollars a warm salute on our return October the first the fleet weighed in the night dropped by the tide up the river and anchored very quietly before a town surrounded by a thick wood Early in the morning the Ladrones assembled in rowboats and landed then gave a shout and rushed into the town sword in hand The inhabitants fled to the adjacent hills in numbers apparently superior to the Ladrones We may easily imagine to ourselves the horror with which these miserable people must be seized on being obliged to leave their homes and everything dear to them It was a most melancholy sight to see women in tears clasping their infants in their arms and imploring mercy for them from those brutal robbers The old and the sick who were unable to fly or to make resistance were either made prisoners or most inhumanly butchered The boats continued passing and repassing from the junks to the shore in quick succession laden with booty and the men besmeared with blood Two hundred and fifty women and several children were made prisoners and sent on board different vessels They were unable to escape with the men owing to that abominable practice of cramping their feet several of them were not able to move without assistance in fact they might all be said to totter rather than walk Twenty of these poor women were sent on board the vessel I was in they were hauled on board by the hair and treated in a most savage manner When the chief came on board he questioned them respecting the circumstances of their friends and demanded ransoms accordingly from six thousand to six hundred dollars each He ordered them a berth on deck at the after part of the vessel where they had nothing to shelter them from the weather which at this time was very variable the days excessively hot and the nights cold with heavy rains The town being plundered of every thing valuable it was set on fire and reduced to ashes by the morning The fleet remained here three days negotiating for the ransom of the prisoners and plundering the fish tanks and gardens During all this time the Chinese never ventured from the hills though there were frequently not more than a hundred Ladrones on shore at a time and I am sure the people on the hills exceeded ten times that number twenty four October fifth the fleet proceeded up another branch of the river stopping at several small villages to receive tribute which was generally paid in dollars sugar and rice with a few large pigs roasted whole as presents for their joss the idol they worship twenty five Every person on being ransomed is obliged to present him with a pig or some fowls which the priest offers him with prayers it remains before him a few hours and is then divided amongst the crew Nothing particular occurred till the tenth except frequent skirmishes on shore between small parties of Ladrones and Chinese soldiers They frequently obliged my men to go on shore and fight with the muskets we had when taken which did great execution the Chinese principally using bows and arrows They have match locks but use them very unskillfully On the tenth we formed a junction with the black squadron and proceeded many miles up a wide and beautiful river passing several ruins of villages that had been destroyed by the black squadron On the seventeenth the fleet anchored abreast four mud batteries which defended a town so entirely surrounded with wood that it was impossible to form any idea of its size The weather was very hazy with hard squalls of rain The Ladrones remained perfectly quiet for two days On the third day the forts commenced a brisk fire for several hours the Ladrones did not return a single shot but weighed in the night and dropped down the river The reasons they gave for not attacking the town or returning the fire were that Joss had not promised them success They are very superstitious and consult their idol on all occasions If his omens are good they will undertake the most daring enterprizes The fleet now anchored opposite the ruins of the town where the women had been made prisoners Here we remained five or six days during which time about a hundred of the women were ransomed the remainder were offered for sale amongst the Ladrones for forty dollars each The woman is considered the lawful wife of the purchaser who would be put to death if he discarded her Several of them leaped overboard and drowned themselves rather than submit to such infamous degradation The fleet then weighed and made sail down the river to receive the ransom from the town before mentioned As we passed the hill they fired several shots at us but without effect The Ladrones were much exasperated and determined to revenge themselves they dropped out of reach of their shot and anchored Every junk sent about a hundred men each on shore to cut paddy and destroy their orange groves which was most effectually performed for several miles down the river During our stay here they received information of nine boats lying up a creek laden with paddy boats were immediately dispatched after them Next morning these boats were brought to the fleet ten or twelve men were taken in them As these had made no resistance the chief said he would allow them to become Ladrones if they agreed to take the usual oaths before Joss Three or four of them refused to comply for which they were punished in the following cruel manner their hands were tied behind their back a rope from the mast head rove through their arms and hoisted three or four feet from the deck and five or six men flogged them with three rattans twisted together till they were apparently dead then hoisted them up to the mast head and left them hanging nearly an hour then lowered them down and repeated the punishment till they died or complied with the oath October the twentieth in the night an express boat came with the information that a large mandarine fleet was proceeding up the river to attack us The chief immediately weighed with fifty of the largest vessels and sailed down the river to meet them About one in the morning they commenced a heavy fire till daylight when an express was sent for the remainder of the fleet to join them about an hour after a counter order to anchor came the mandarine fleet having run Two or three hours afterwards the chief returned with three captured vessels in tow having sunk two and eighty three sail made their escape The admiral of the mandarines blew his vessel up by throwing a lighted match into the magazine as the Ladrones were boarding her she ran on shore and they succeeded in getting twenty of her guns In this action very few prisoners were taken the men belonging to the captured vessels drowned themselves as they were sure of suffering a lingering and cruel death if taken after making resistance The admiral left the fleet in charge of his brother the second in command and proceeded with his own vessel towards Lantow The fleet remained in this river cutting paddy and getting the necessary supplies On the twenty eighth of October I received a letter from Captain Kay brought by a fisherman who had told him he would get us all back for three thousand dollars He advised me to offer three thousand and if not accepted extend it to four but not farther as it was bad policy to offer much at first at the same time assuring me we should be liberated let the ransom be what it would I offered the chief the three thousand which he disdainfully refused saying he was not to be played with and unless they sent ten thousand dollars and two large guns with several casks of gunpowder he would soon put us all to death I wrote to Captain Kay and informed him of the chief s determination requesting if an opportunity offered to send us a shift of clothes for which it may be easily imagined we were much distressed having been seven weeks without a shift although constantly exposed to the weather and of course frequently wet On the first of November the fleet sailed up a narrow river and anchored at night within two miles of a town called Little Whampoa In front of it was a small fort and several mandarine vessels lying in the harbor The chief sent the interpreter to me saying I must order my men to make cartridges and clean their muskets ready to go on shore in the morning I assured the interpreter I should give the men no such orders that they must please themselves Soon after the chief came on board threatening to put us all to a cruel death if we refused to obey his orders For my own part I remained determined and advised the men not to comply as I thought by making ourselves useful we should be accounted too valuable A few hours afterwards he sent to me again saying that if myself and the quartermaster would assist them at the great guns that if also the rest of the men went on shore and succeeded in taking the place he would then take the money offered for our ransom and give them twenty dollars for every Chinaman s head they cut off To these proposals we cheerfully acceded in hopes of facilitating our deliverance Early in the morning the forces intended for landing were assembled in rowboats amounting in the whole to three or four thousand men The largest vessels weighed and hauled in shore to cover the landing of the forces and attack the fort and mandarine vessels About nine o clock the action commenced and continued with great spirit for nearly an hour when the walls of the fort gave way and the men retreated in the greatest confusion The mandarine vessels still continued firing having blocked up the entrance of the harbor to prevent the Ladrone boats entering At this the Ladrones were much exasperated and about three hundred of them swam on shore with a short sword lashed close under each arm they then ran along the banks of the river till they came abreast of the vessels and then swam off again and boarded them The Chinese thus attacked leaped overboard and endeavored to reach the opposite shore the Ladrones followed and cut the greater number of them to pieces in the water They next towed the vessels out of the harbor and attacked the town with increased fury The inhabitants fought about a quarter of an hour and then retreated to an adjacent hill from which they were soon driven with great slaughter After this the Ladrones returned and plundered the town every boat leaving it when laden The Chinese on the hills perceiving most of the boats were off rallied and retook the town after killing near two hundred Ladrones One of my men was unfortunately lost in this dreadful massacre The Ladrones landed a second time drove the Chinese out of the town then reduced it to ashes and put all their prisoners to death without regarding either age or sex I must not omit to mention a most horrid though ludicrous circumstance which happened at this place The Ladrones were paid by their chief ten dollars for every Chinaman s head they produced One of my men turning the corner of a street was met by a Ladrone running furiously after a Chinese he had a drawn sword in his hand and two Chinaman s heads which he had cut off tied by their tails and slung round his neck I was witness myself to some of them producing five or six to obtain payment On the fourth of November an order arrived from the admiral for the fleet to proceed immediately to Lantow where he was lying with only two vessels and three Portuguese ships and a brig constantly annoying him several sail of mandarine vessels were daily expected The fleet weighed and proceeded towards Lantow On passing the island of Lintin three ships and a brig gave chase to us The Ladrones prepared to board but night closing we lost sight of them I am convinced they altered their course and stood from us These vessels were in the pay of the Chinese government and style themselves the Invincible Squadron cruising in the river Tigris to annihilate the Ladrones On the fifth in the morning the red squadron anchored in a bay under Lantow the black squadron stood to the eastward In this bay they hauled several of their vessels on shore to bream their bottoms and repair them In the afternoon of the eighth of November four ships a brig and a schooner came off the mouth of the bay At first the pirates were much alarmed supposing them to be English vessels come to rescue us Some of them threatened to hang us to the mast head for them to fire at and with much difficulty we persuaded them that they were Portuguese The Ladrones had only seven junks in a fit state for action these they hauled outside and moored them head and stern across the bay and manned all the boats belonging to the repairing vessels ready for boarding The Portuguese observing these maneuvers hove to and communicated by boats Soon afterwards they made sail each ship firing her broadside as she passed but without effect the shot falling far short The Ladrones did not return a single shot but waved their colors and threw up rockets to induce them to come further in which they might easily have done the outside junks lying in four fathoms water which I sounded myself though the Portuguese in their letters to Macao lamented there was not sufficient water for them to engage closer but that they would certainly prevent their escaping before the mandarine fleet arrived On the twentieth of November early in the morning I perceived an immense fleet of mandarine vessels standing for the bay On nearing us they formed a line and stood close in each vessel as she discharged her guns tacked to join the rear and reload They kept up a constant fire for about two hours when one of their largest vessels was blown up by a firebrand thrown from a Ladrone junk after which they kept at a more respectful distance but continued firing without intermission till the twenty first at night when it fell calm The Ladrones towed out seven large vessels with about two hundred rowboats to board them but a breeze springing up they made sail and escaped The Ladrones returned into the bay and anchored The Portuguese and mandarines followed and continued a heavy cannonading during that night and the next day The vessel I was in had her foremast shot away which they supplied very expeditiously by taking a mainmast from a smaller vessel On the twenty threed in the evening it again fell calm the Ladrones towed out fifteen junks in two divisions with the intention of surrounding them which was nearly effected having come up with and boarded one when a breeze suddenly sprung up The captured vessel mounted twenty two guns Most of her crew leaped overboard sixty or seventy were taken immediately cut to pieces and thrown into the river Early in the morning the Ladrones returned into the bay and anchored in the same situation as before The Portuguese and mandarines followed keeping up a constant fire The Ladrones never returned a single shot but always kept in readiness to board and the Portuguese were careful never to allow them an opportunity On the twenty eighth at night they sent in eight fire vessels which if properly constructed must have done great execution having every advantage they could wish for to effect their purpose a strong breeze and tide directly into the bay and the vessels lying so close together that it was impossible to miss them On their first appearance the Ladrones gave a general shout supposing them to be mandarine vessels on fire but were very soon convinced of their mistake They came very regularly into the center of the fleet two and two burning furiously one of them came alongside of the vessel I was in but they succeeded in booming her off She appeared to be a vessel of about thirty tons her hold was filled with straw and wood and there were a few small boxes of combustibles on her deck which exploded alongside of us without doing any damage The Ladrones however towed them all on shore extinguished the fire and broke them up for fire wood The Portuguese claim the credit of constructing these destructive machines and actually sent a dispatch to the Governor of Macao saying they had destroyed at least one third of the Ladrones fleet and hoped soon to effect their purpose by totally annihilating them On the twenty ninth of November the Ladrones being all ready for sea they weighed and stood boldly out bidding defiance to the invincible squadron and imperial fleet consisting of ninety three war junks six Portuguese ships a brig and a schooner Immediately the Ladrones weighed they made all sail The Ladrones chased them two or three hours keeping up a constant fire finding they did not come up with them they hauled their wind and stood to the eastward Thus terminated the boasted blockade which lasted nine days during which time the Ladrones completed all their repairs In this action not a single Ladrone vessel was destroyed and their loss about thirty or forty men An American was also killed one of three that remained out of eight taken in a schooner I had two very narrow escapes the first a twelve pounder shot fell within three or four feet of me another took a piece out of a small brass swivel on which I was standing The chief s wife frequently sprinkled me with garlic water which they consider an effectual charm against shot The fleet continued under sail all night steering towards the eastward In the morning they anchored in a large bay surrounded by lofty and barren mountains On the second of December I received a letter from Lieutenant Maughn commander of the Honorable Company s cruiser Antelope saying that he had the ransom on board and had been three days cruising after us and wished me to settle with the chief on the securest method of delivering it The chief agreed to send us in a small gunboat till we came within sight of the Antelope then the Compradore s boat was to bring the ransom and receive us I was so agitated at receiving this joyful news that it was with considerable difficulty I could scrawl about two or three lines to inform Lieutenant Maughn of the arrangements I had made We were all so deeply affected by the gratifying tidings that we seldom closed our eyes but continued watching day and night for the boat On the sixth she returned with Lieutenant Maughn s answer saying he would respect any single boat but would not allow the fleet to approach him The chief then according to his first proposal ordered a gunboat to take us and with no small degree of pleasure we left the Ladrone fleet about four o clock in the morning At one P M saw the Antelope under all sail standing toward us The Ladrone boat immediately anchored and dispatched the Compradore s boat for the ransom saying that if she approached nearer they would return to the fleet and they were just weighing when she shortened sail and anchored about two miles from us The boat did not reach her till late in the afternoon owing to the tide s being strong against her She received the ransom and left the Antelope just before dark A mandarine boat that had been lying concealed under the land and watching their maneuvers gave chase to her and was within a few fathoms of taking her when she saw a light which the Ladrones answered and the Mandarine hauled off Our situation was now a most critical one the ransom was in the hands of the Ladrones and the Compradore dare not return with us for fear of a second attack from the mandarine boat The Ladrones would not remain till morning so we were obliged to return with them to the fleet In the morning the chief inspected the ransom which consisted of the following articles two bales of superfine scarlet cloth two chests of opium two casks of gunpowder and a telescope the rest in dollars He objected to the telescope not being new and said he should detain one of us till another was sent or a hundred dollars in lieu of it The Compradore however agreed with him for the hundred dollars Every thing being at length settled the chief ordered two gunboats to convey us near the Antelope we saw her just before dusk when the Ladrone boats left us We had the inexpressible pleasure of arriving on board the Antelope at seven P M where we were most cordially received and heartily congratulated on our safe and happy deliverance from a miserable captivity which we had endured for eleven weeks and three days A few Remarks on the Origin Progress Manners and Customs of the Ladrones The Ladrones are a disaffected race of Chinese that revolted against the oppressions of the mandarins They first commenced their depredations on the Western coast Cochin China by attacking small trading vessels in rowboats carrying from thirty to forty men each They continued this system of piracy several years at length their successes and the oppressive state of the Chinese had the effect of rapidly increasing their numbers Hundreds of fishermen and others flocked to their standard and as their number increased they consequently became more desperate They blockaded all the principal rivers and captured several large junks mounting from ten to fifteen guns each With these junks they formed a very formidable fleet and no small vessels could trade on the coast with safety They plundered several small villages and exercised such wanton barbarity as struck horror into the breasts of the Chinese To check these enormities the government equipped a fleet of forty imperial war junks mounting from eighteen to twenty guns each On the very first rencontre twenty eight of the imperial junks struck to the pirates the rest saved themselves by a precipitate retreat These junks fully equipped for war were a great acquisition to them Their numbers augmented so rapidly that at the period of my captivity they were supposed to amount to near seventy thousand men eight hundred large vessels and nearly a thousand small ones including rowboats They were divided into five squadrons distinguished by different colored flags each squadron commanded by an admiral or chief but all under the orders of A juo Chay Ching y i h saou their premier chief a most daring and enterprising man who went so far as to declare his intention of displacing the present Tartar family from the throne of China and to restore the ancient Chinese dynasty This extraordinary character would have certainly shaken the foundation of the government had he not been thwarted by the jealousy of the second in command who declared his independence and soon after surrendered to the mandarines with five hundred vessels on promise of a pardon Most of the inferior chiefs followed his example A juo Chay Ching y i h saou held out a few months longer and at length surrendered with sixteen thousand men on condition of a general pardon and himself to be made a mandarine of distinction The Ladrones have no settled residence on shore but live constantly in their vessels The after part is appropriated to the captain and his wives he generally has five or six With respect to conjugal rights they are religiously strict no person is allowed to have a woman on board unless married to her according to their laws Every man is allowed a small berth about four feet square where he stows with his wife and family From the number of souls crowded in so small a space it must naturally be supposed they are horridly dirty which is evidently the case and their vessels swarm with all kinds of vermin Rats in particular which they encourage to breed and eat them as great delicacies in fact there are very few creatures they will not eat During our captivity we lived three weeks on caterpillars boiled with rice They are much addicted to gambling and spend all their leisure hours at cards and smoking opium FOOTNOTES seventeen From The Ladrone Pirates eighteen Junk is the Canton pronunciation of chuen ship nineteen The pirates had many other intimate acquaintances on shore like Doctor Chow of Macao twenty The pirates were always afraid of this We find the following statement concerning the Chinese pirates taken from the records in the East India House and printed in Appendix C to the Report relative to the trade with the East Indies and China in the sessions eighteen twenty and eighteen twenty one reprinted eighteen twenty nine p three hundred eighty seven In the year eighteen oh eight eighteen oh nine and eighteen ten the Canton river was so infested with pirates who were also in such force that the Chinese government made an attempt to subdue them but failed The pirates totally destroyed the Chinese force ravaged the river in every direction threatened to attack the city of Canton and destroyed many towns and villages on the banks of the river and killed or carried off to serve as Ladrones several thousands of inhabitants These events created an alarm extremely prejudicial to the commerce of Canton and compelled the Company s supercargoes to fit out a small country ship to cruize for a short time against the pirates twenty one That the whole family must suffer for the crime of one individual seems to be the most cruel and foolish law of the whole Chinese criminal code twenty two We know by the History of the Chinese Pirates that these wasps of the ocean to speak with Yuen tsze yung lun were originally divided into six squadrons twenty three In the barbarous Chinese English spoken at Canton all things are indiscriminately called chop You hear of a chop house chop boat tea chop Chaou chaou chop et cetera To give a bill or agreement on making a bargain is in Chinese called ch a tan ch a in the pronunciation of Canton is chop which is then applied to any writing whatever twenty four The following is the Character of the Chinese of Canton as given in ancient Chinese books People of Canton are silly light weak in body and weak in mind without any ability to fight on land twenty five Joss is a Chinese corruption of the Portuguese Dios God The Joss or idol of which mister Glasspoole speaks is the San po shin which is spoken of in the work of Yuen tsze THE FEMALE CAPTIVE twenty six LUCRETIA PARKER The event which is here related is the capture by the Pirates of the English sloop Eliza Ann bound from saint Johns to Antigua and the massacre of the whole crew ten in number with the exception of one female passenger whose life by the interposition of Divine Providence was miraculously preserved The particulars are copied from a letter written by the unfortunate Miss Parker the female passenger above alluded to to her brother in New York saint Johns April three eighteen twenty five Dear Brother You have undoubtedly heard of my adverse fortune and the shocking incident that has attended me since I had the pleasure of seeing you in November last Anticipating your impatience to be made acquainted with a more circumstantial detail of my extraordinary adventures I shall not on account of the interest which I know you must feel in my welfare hesitate to oblige you yet I must declare to you that it is that consideration alone that prompts me to do it as even the recollection of the scenes which I have witnessed you must be sensible must ever be attended with pain and that I cannot reflect on what I have endured and the scenes of horror that I have been witness to without the severest shock I shall now brother proceed to furnish you with a detail of my misfortunes as they occurred without exaggeration and if it should be your wish to communicate them to the public through the medium of a public print or in any other way you are at liberty to do it and I shall consider myself amply rewarded if in a single instance it proves beneficial in removing a doubt in the minds of such who although they dare not deny the existence of a Supreme Being yet disbelieve that he ever in any way revealed Himself to his creatures Let Philosophy as it is termed smile with pity or contempt on my weakness or credulity yet the superintendence of a particular PROVIDENCE interfering by second causes is so apparent to me and was so conspicuously displayed in the course of my afflictions that I shall not banish it from my mind from the beginning to the end of my narration On the twenty eighth February I took passage on board the sloop Eliza Ann captain Charles Smith for Antigua in compliance with the earnest request of brother Thomas and family who had advised me that they had concluded to make that island the place of their permanent residence having a few months previous purchased there a valuable Plantation We set sail with a favorable wind and with every appearance of a short and pleasant voyage and met with no incident to destroy or diminish those flattering prospects until about noon of the fourteenth day from that of our departure when a small schooner was discovered standing toward us with her deck full of men and as she approached us from her suspicious appearance there was not a doubt in the minds of any on board but that she was a Pirate When within a few yards of us they gave a shout and our decks were instantly crowded with the motley crew of desperadoes armed with weapons of almost every description that can be mentioned and with which they commenced their barbarous work by unmercifully beating and maiming all on board except myself As a retreat was impossible and finding myself surrounded by wretches whose yells oaths and imprecations made them more resemble demons than human beings I fell on my knees and from one who appeared to have the command I begged for mercy and for permission to retire to the cabin that I might not be either the subject or a witness of the murderous scene that I had but little doubt was about to ensue The privilege was not refused me The monster in human shape for such was then his appearance conducted me by the hand himself to the companionway and pointing to the cabin said to me Descend and remain there and you will be perfectly safe for although Pirates we are not barbarians to destroy the lives of innocent females Saying this he closed the companion doors and left me alone to reflect on my helpless and deplorable situation It is indeed impossible for me brother to paint to your imagination what were my feelings at this moment being the only female on board my terror it cannot be expected was much less than that of the poor devoted mariners I resigned my life to the Being who had lent it and did not fail to improve the opportunity which I thought it not improbable might be my last to call on Him for that protection which my situation so much at this moment required and never shall I be persuaded but that my prayers were heard While I remained in this situation by the sound of the clashing of swords attended by shrieks and dismal groans I could easily imagine what was going on on deck and anticipated nothing better than the total destruction by the Pirates of the lives of all on board After I had remained about one hour and a half alone in the cabin and all had become silent on deck the cabin doors were suddenly thrown open and eight or ten of the Piratical crew entered preceded by him whom I had suspected to be their leader and from whom I had received assurances that I should not be injured By him I was again addressed and requested to banish all fears of personal injury that they sought only for the money which they suspected to be secreted somewhere on board the vessel and which they were determined to have although unable to extort a disclosure of the place of its concealment by threats and violence from the crew The Pirates now commenced a thorough search throughout the cabin the trunks and chests belonging to the captain and mate were broken open and rifled of their most valuable contents nor did my baggage and stores meet with any better fate indeed this was a loss which at this moment caused me but little uneasiness I felt that my life was in too much jeopardy to lament in any degree the loss of my worldly goods surrounded as I was by a gang of the most ferocious looking villains that my eyes ever before beheld of different complexions and each with a drawn weapon in his hand some of them fresh crimsoned with the blood as I then supposed of my murdered countrymen and whose horrid imprecations and oaths were enough to appal the bravest heart Their search for money proving unsuccessful with the exception of a few dollars which they found in the captain s chest they returned to the deck and setting sail on the sloop steered her for the place of their rendezvous a small island or key not far distant I imagine from the island of Cuba where we arrived the day after our capture The island was nearly barren producing nothing but a few scattered mangroves and shrubs interspersed with the miserable huts of these outlaws of civilization among whom power formed the only law and every species of iniquity was here carried to an extent of which no person who had not witnessed a similar degree of pollution could form the most distant idea As soon as the sloop was brought to an anchor the hatches were thrown off and the unfortunate crew ordered on deck a command which to my surprise was instantly obeyed as I had harboured strong suspicions that they had been all murdered by the Pirates the day previous The poor devoted victims although alive exhibited shocking proofs of the barbarity with which they had been treated by the unmerciful Pirates their bodies exhibiting deep wounds and bruises too horrible for me to attempt to describe Yet however great had been their sufferings their lives had been spared only to endure still greater torments Being strongly pinioned they were forced into a small leaky boat and rowed on shore which we having reached and a division of the plunder having been made by the Pirates a scene of the most bloody and wanton barbarity ensued the bare recollection of which still chills my blood Having first divested them of every article of clothing but their shirts and trousers with swords knives axes et cetera they fell on the unfortunate crew of the Eliza Ann with the ferocity of cannibals In vain did they beg for mercy and intreat of their murderers to spare their lives In vain did poor captain S attempt to touch their feelings and to move them to pity by representing to them the situation of his innocent family that he had a wife and three small children at home wholly dependent on him for support But alas the poor man intreated in vain His appeal was to monsters possessing hearts callous to the feelings of humanity Having received a heavy blow from one with an ax he snapped the cords with which he was bound and attempted an escape by flight but was met by another of the ruffians who plunged a knife or dirk to his heart I stood near him at this moment and was covered with his blood On receiving the fatal wound he gave a single groan and fell lifeless at my feet Nor were the remainder of the crew more fortunate The mate while on his knees imploring mercy and promising to accede to anything that the vile assassins should require of him on condition of his life being spared received a blow from a club which instantaneously put a period to his existence Dear brother need I attempt to paint to your imagination my feelings at this awful moment Will it not suffice for me to say that I have described to you a scene of horror which I was compelled to witness and with the expectation too of being the next victim selected by these ferocious monsters whose thirst for blood appeared to be insatiable There appeared now but one alternative left me which was to offer up a prayer to Heaven for the protection of that Being who has power to stay the assassin s hand and who is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can ask or think sincerely in the language of scripture I can say I found trouble and sorrow then called I upon the name of the Lord I remained on my knees until the inhuman wretches had completed their murderous work and left none but myself to lament the fate of those who but twenty four hours before were animated with the pleasing prospects of a quick passage and a speedy return to the bosoms of their families The wretch by whom I had been thrice promised protection and who seemed to reign chief among them again approached me with hands crimsoned with the blood of my murdered countrymen and with a savage smile once more repeated his assurances that if I would but become reconciled to my situation I had nothing to fear There was indeed something truly terrific in the appearance of this man or rather monster as he ought to be termed He was of a swarthy complexion near six feet in height his eyes were large black and penetrating his expression was remarkable and when silent his looks were sufficient to declare his meaning He wore around his waist a leathern belt to which was suspended a sword a brace of pistols and a dirk He was as I was afterward informed the acknowledged chief among the Pirates all appeared to stand in awe of him and no one dared to disobey his commands Such dear brother was the character who had promised me protection if I would become reconciled to my situation in other words subservient to his will But whatever might have been his intentions although now in his power without a visible friend to protect me yet such full reliance did I place in the Supreme Being who sees and knows all things and who has promised his protection to the faithful in the hour of tribulation that I felt myself in a less degree of danger than you or any one would probably imagine As the day drew near to a close I was conducted to a small temporary hut or cabin where I was informed I might repose peaceably for the night which I did without being disturbed by any one This was another opportunity that I did not suffer to pass unimproved to pour out my soul to that Being who had already given me reasons to believe that he did not say to the house of Jacob seek you me in vain Oh that all sincere Christians would in every difficulty make Him their refuge He is a hopeful stay Early in the morning ensuing I was visited by the wretch alone whom I had viewed as chief of the murderous band As he entered and cast his eyes upon me his countenance relaxed from its usual ferocity to a feigned smile Without speaking a word he seated himself on a bench that the cabin contained and drawing a table toward him leaned upon it resting his cheek upon his hand His eyes for some moments were fixed in stedfast gaze upon the ground while his whole soul appeared to be devoured by the most diabolical thoughts In a few moments he arose from his seat and hastily traversed the hut apparently in extreme agitation and not unfrequently fixing his eyes stedfastly upon me But that Providence which while it protects the innocent never suffers the wicked to go unpunished interposed to save me and to deliver me from the hands of this remorseless villain at the very instant when in all probability he intended to have destroyed my happiness forever On a sudden the Pirate s bugle was sounded which as I was afterward informed was the usual signal of a sail in sight The ruffian monster thereupon without uttering a word left my apartment and hastened with all speed to the place of their general rendezvous on such occasions Flattered by the pleasing hope that Providence might be about to complete her work of mercy and was conducting to the dreary island some friendly aid to rescue me from my perilous situation I mustered courage to ascend to the roof of my hovel to discover if possible the cause of the alarm and what might be the issue A short distance from the island I espied a sail which appeared to be lying to and a few miles therefrom to the windward another which appeared to be bearing down under a press of sail for the former in a moment the whole gang of Pirates with the exception of four were in their boats and with their oars et cetera were making every possible exertion to reach the vessel nearest to their island but by the time they had effected their object the more distant vessel which proved to be a British sloop of war disguised had approached them within fair gunshot and probably knowing or suspecting their characters opened their ports and commenced a destructive fire upon them The Pirates were now as nearly as I could judge with the naked eye thrown into great confusion Every possible exertion appeared to have been made by them to reach the island and escape from their pursuers Some jumped from their boats and attempted to gain the shore by swimming but these were shot in the water and the remainder who remained in their boats were very soon after overtaken and captured by two well manned boats dispatched from the sloop of war for that purpose and soon had I the satisfaction to see them all on board of the sloop and in the power of those from whom I was fully satisfied that they would meet with the punishment due to their crimes In describing the characters of this Piratical band of robbers I have dear brother represented them as wretches of the most frightful and ferocious appearance blood thirsty monsters who in acts of barbarity ought only to be ranked with cannibals who delight to feast on human flesh Rendered desperate by their crimes and aware that they should find no mercy if so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of those to whom they show no mercy to prevent a possibility of detection and the just execution of the laws wantonly destroy the lives of every one however innocent who may be so unfortunate as to fall into their power such indeed brother is the true character of the band of Pirates to the number of thirty or forty by whom it was my misfortune to be captured with the exception of a single one who possessed a countenance less savage and had the appearance of possessing a heart less callous to the feelings of humanity Fortunately for me as Divine Providence ordered this person was one of the four who remained on the island and on whom the command involved after the unexpected disaster which had deprived them forever of so great a portion of their comrades From this man after the capture of the murderous tyrant to whose commands he had been compelled to yield I received the kindest treatment and assurances that I should be restored to liberty and to my friends when an opportunity should present or when it could be consistently done with the safety of their lives and liberty This unhappy man for such he declared himself to be took an opportunity to indulge me with a partial relation of a few of the most extraordinary incidents of his life He declared himself an Englishman by birth but his real name and place of nativity was he said a secret he would never disclose although I must said he acknowledge myself by profession a Pirate yet I can boast of respectable parentage and the time once was when I myself sustained an unimpeachable character Loss of property through the treachery of those whom I considered friends and in whom I had placed implicit confidence was what first led me to and induced me to prefer this mode of life to any of a less criminal nature but although I voluntarily became the associate of a band of wretches the most wicked and unprincipled perhaps on earth yet I solemnly declare that I have not in any one instance personally deprived an innocent fellow creature of life It was an act of barbarity at which my heart ever recoiled and against which I always protested With the property I always insisted we ought to be satisfied without the destruction of the lives of such who were probably the fathers of families and who had never offended us But our gang was as you may suppose chiefly composed of and governed by men without principle who appeared to delight in the shedding of blood and whose only excuse has been that by acting with too much humanity in sparing life they might thereby be exposed and themselves arraigned to answer for their crimes at an earthly tribunal You can have no conception madam continued he of the immense property that has been piratically captured and of the number of lives that have been destroyed by this gang alone and all without the loss of a single one on our part until yesterday when by an unexpected circumstance our number has been reduced as you see from thirty five to four This island has not been our constant abiding place but the bodies of such as have suffered here have always been conveyed a considerable distance from the shore and thrown into the sea where they were probably devoured by the sharks as not a single one has ever been known afterward to drift on our shores The property captured has not been long retained on this island but shipped to a neighboring port where we have an agent to dispose of it Of the great number of vessels captured by us continued he you are the first and only female that has been so unfortunate as to fall into our hands and from the moment that I first saw you in our power well knowing the brutal disposition of him whom we acknowledged our chief I trembled for your safety and viewed you as one deprived perhaps of the protection of a husband or brother to become the victim of an unpitying wretch whose pretended regard for your sex and his repeated promises of protection were hypocritical a mere mask to lull your fears until he could effect your ruin His hellish designs agreeable to his own declarations would have been carried into effect the very morning that he last visited you had not an all wise Providence interfered to save you and so sensible am I that the unexpected circumstance of his capture as well as that of the most of our gang as desperate and unprincipled as himself must have been by order of Him from whose all seeing eye no evil transaction can be hidden that were I so disposed I should be deterred from doing you any injury through fear of meeting with a similar fate Nor do my three remaining companions differ with me in opinion and we all now most solemnly pledge ourselves that so long as you remain in our power you shall have nothing to complain of but the deprivation of the society of those whose company no doubt would be more agreeable to you and as soon as it can be done consistently with our own safety you shall be conveyed to a place from which you may obtain a passage to your friends We have now become too few in number to hazard a repetition of our Piratical robberies and not only this but some of our captured companions to save their own lives may prove treacherous enough to betray us we are therefore making preparation to leave this island for a place of more safety when you madam shall be conveyed and set at liberty as I have promised you Dear brother if you before doubted is not the declaration of this man which I have recorded as correctly as my recollection will admit of sufficient to satisfy you that I owe my life and safety to the interposition of a Divine Providence Oh yes surely it is and I feel my insufficiency to thank and praise my Heavenly Protector as I ought for his loving kindness in preserving me from the evil designs of wicked men and for finally restoring me to liberty and to my friends I cannot praise Him as I would But He is merciful and good From this moment every preparation was made by the Pirates to remove from the island The small quantity of stores and goods which remained on hand principally of the Ann Eliza s cargo was either buried on the island or conveyed away in their boats in the night to some place unknown to me The last thing done was to demolish their temporary dwellings which was done so effectually as not to suffer a vestige of any thing to remain that could have led to a discovery that the island had ever been inhabited by such a set of beings Eleven days from that of the capture of the Ann Eliza the Pirates having previously put on board several bags of dollars which from the appearance of the former I judged had been concealed in the earth I was ordered to embark with them but for what place I then knew not About midnight I was landed on the rocky shores of an island which they informed me was Cuba they furnished me with a few hard biscuit and a bottle of water and directed me to proceed early in the morning in a northeast direction to a house about a mile distant where I was told I would be well treated and be furnished with a guide that would conduct me to Mantansies With these directions they left me and I never saw them more At daybreak I set out in search of the house to which I had been directed by the Pirates and which I had the good fortune to reach in safety in about an hour and a half It was a humble tenement thatched with canes without any flooring but the ground and was tenanted by a man and his wife only from whom I met with a welcome reception and by whom I was treated with much hospitality Although Spaniards the man could speak and understand enough English to converse with me and to learn by what means I had been brought so unexpectedly alone and unprotected to his house Though it was the same to which I had been directed by the Pirates yet he declared that so far from being in any way connected with them in their Piratical robberies or enjoying any portion of their ill gotten gain no one could hold them in greater abhorrence Whether he was sincere in these declarations or not is well known to Him whom the lying tongue cannot deceive it is but justice to them to say that by both the man and his wife I was treated with kindness and it was with apparent emotions of pity that they listened to the tale of my sufferings By their earnest request I remained with them until the morning ensuing when I set out on foot for Mantansies accompanied by the Spaniard who had kindly offered to conduct me to that place which we reached about seven in the evening of the same day At Mantansies I found many Americans and Europeans by whom I was kindly treated and who proffered their services to restore me to my friends but as there were no vessels bound direct from thence to Antigua or saint Johns I was persuaded to take passage for Jamaica where it was the opinion of my friends I might obtain a passage more speedily for one or the other place and where I safely arrived after a pleasant passage of four days The most remarkable and unexpected circumstance of my extraordinary adventures I have yet dear brother to relate Soon after my arrival at Jamaica the Authority having been made acquainted with the circumstance of my recent capture by the Pirates and the extraordinary circumstance which produced my liberation requested that I might be conducted to the Prison to see if I could among a number of Pirates recently committed recognize any of those by whom I had been captured I was accordingly attended by two or three gentlemen and two young ladies who had politely offered to accompany me to the prison apartment on entering which I not only instantly recognized among a number therein confined the identical savage monster of whom I have had so much occasion to speak the Pirates Chief but the most of those who had composed his gang and who were captured with him The sudden and unexpected introduction into their apartment of one whom they had probably in their minds numbered with the victims of their wanton barbarity produced unquestionably on their minds not an inconsiderable degree of horror as well as surprise and considering their condemnation now certain they no doubt heaped curses upon their more fortunate companions for sparing the life and setting at liberty one whom an all wise Providence had conducted to and placed in a situation to bear witness to their unprecedented barbarity Government having through me obtained the necessary proof of the guilt of these merciless wretches after a fair and impartial trial they were all condemned to suffer the punishment due to their crimes and seven ordered for immediate execution one of whom was the barbarian their chief After the conviction and condemnation of this wretch in hopes of eluding the course of justice he made as I was informed an attempt upon his own life by inflicting upon himself deep wounds with a knife which he had concealed for that purpose but in this he was disappointed the wounds not proving so fatal as he probably anticipated I never saw this hardened villain or any of his equally criminal companions after their condemnation although strongly urged to witness their execution and am therefore indebted to one who daily visited them for the information of their behavior from that period until that of their execution which as regarded the former I was informed was extremely impenitent that while proceeding to the place of ignominy and death he talked with shocking unconcern hinting that by being instrumental in the destruction of so many lives he had become too hardened and familiar with death to feel much intimidated at its approach He was attended to the place of execution by a Roman Catholic Priest who it was said labored to convince him of the atrociousness of his crimes but he seemed deaf to all admonition or exhortation and appeared insensible to the hope of happiness or fear of torment in a future state and so far from exhibiting a single symptom of penitence declared that he knew of but one thing for which he had cause to reproach himself which was in sparing my life and not ordering me to be butchered as the others had been How awful was the end of the life of this miserable criminal He looked not with harmony regard or a single penitent feeling toward one human being in the last agonies of an ignominious death After remaining nine days at Jamaica I was so fortunate as to obtain a passage with captain Ellsmore direct for saint Johns the thoughts of once more returning home and of so soon joining my anxious friends when I could have an opportunity to communicate to my aged parents to a beloved sister and a large circle of acquaintances the sad tale of the misfortunes which had attended me since I bid them adieu would have been productive of the most pleasing sensations had they not been interrupted by the melancholy reflection that I was the bearer of tidings of the most heart rending nature to the bereaved families of those unfortunate husbands and parents who had in my presence fallen victims to Piratical barbarity Thankful should I have been had the distressing duty fell to the lot of some one of less sensibility but unerring Providence had ordered otherwise We arrived safe at our port of destination after a somewhat boisterous passage of eighteen days I found my friends all well but the effects produced on their minds by the relation of the distressing incidents and adverse fortune that had attended me since my departure I shall not attempt to describe and much less can you expect brother that I should attempt a description of the feelings of the afflicted widow and fatherless child who first received from me the melancholy tidings that they were so Thus brother have I furnished you with as minute a detail of the sad misfortunes that have attended me in my intended passage to Antigua in February and March last as circumstances will admit of and here permit me once more to repeat the enquiry is it not sufficient to satisfy you and every reasonable person that I owe my life and liberty to the interposition of a Divine Providence so fully persuaded am I of this dear brother and of my great obligations to that Supreme Being who turned not away my prayer nor his mercy from me that I am determined to engage with my whole heart to serve Him the residue of my days on earth by the aid of his heavenly grace and invite all who profess to fear Him should a single doubt remain on their minds to come and hear what he hath done for me I am dear brother affectionately yours LUCRETIA PARKER FOOTNOTES twenty six From an Old Pamphlet published in eighteen twenty five THE PASSING OF MOGUL MACKENZIE The Last of the North Atlantic Pirates twenty seven ARTHUR HUNT CHUTE In the farther end of the Bay of Fundy about a mile off from the Nova Scotian coast is the Isle of Haut It is a strange rocky island that rises several hundred feet sheer out of the sea without any bay or inlets A landing can only be effected there in the calmest weather and on account of the tremendous ebb of the Fundy tides which rise and fall sixty feet every twelve hours the venturesome explorer cannot long keep his boat moored against the precipitous cliffs Because of this inaccessibility little is known of the solitary island Within its rampart walls of rock they say there is a green valley and in its center is a fathomless lake where the Micmac Indians used to bury their dead and hence its dread appellation of the Island of the Dead Beyond these bare facts nothing more is certain about the secret valley and the haunted lake Many wild and fabulous descriptions are current but they are merely the weavings of fancy Sometimes on a stormy night the unhappy navigators of the North Channel miss the coast lights in the fog and out from the Isle of Haut a gentle undertow flirts with their bewildered craft Then little by little they are gathered into a mighty current against which all striving is in vain and in the white foam among the iron cliffs their ship is pounded into splinters The quarry which she gathers in so softly at first and so fiercely at last however is soon snatched away from the siren shore The ebb tide bears every sign of wreckage far out into the deeps of the Atlantic and not a trace remains of the ill starred vessel or her crew But one of the boats in the fishing fleet never comes home and from lonely huts on the coast reproachful eyes are cast upon the Island of the Dead On the long winter nights when the boys gather about the fire in Old Steele s General Stores at Hall s Harbor their hard gray life becomes bright for a spell When a keg of hard cider is flowing freely the grim fishermen forget their taciturnity the ice is melted from their speech and the floodgates of their souls pour forth But ever in the background of their talk unforgotten like a haunting shadow is the Island of the Dead Of their weirdest and most blood curdling yarns it is always the center and when at last with uncertain steps they leave the empty keg and the dying fire to turn homeward through the drifting snow fearful and furtive glances are cast to where the island looms up like a ghostly sentinel from the sea Across its high promontory the Northern Lights scintillate and blaze and out of its moving brightness the terrified fishermen behold the war canoes of dead Indians freighted with their redskin braves the forms of c oe ur de bois and desperate Frenchmen swinging down the sky line in a ghastly snake dance the shapes and spars of ships long since forgotten from the Missing List and always most dread inspiring of them all the distress signals from the sinking ship of Mogul Mackenzie and his pirate crew Captain Mogul Mackenzie was the last of the pirates to scourge the North Atlantic seaboard He came from that school of freebooters that was let loose by the American Civil War With a letter of marque from the Confederate States he sailed the seas to prey on Yankee shipping He and his fellow privateers were so thorough in their work of destruction that the Mercantile Marine of the United States was ruined for a generation to come When the war was over the defeated South called off her few remaining bloodhounds on the sea But Mackenzie who was still at large had drunk too deeply of the wine of a wild free life He did not return to lay down his arms but began on a course of shameless piracy He lived only a few months under the black flag until he went down on the Isle of Haut The events of that brief and thrilling period are unfortunately obscure with only a ray of light here and there But the story of his passing is the most weird of all the strange yarns that are spun about the Island of the Dead In May eighteen sixty five a gruesome discovery was made off the coast of Maine which sent a chill of fear through all the seaport towns of New England A whaler bound for New Bedford was coming up Cape Cod one night long after dark There was no fog and the lights of approaching vessels could easily be discerned The man on the lookout felt no uneasiness at his post when without any warning of bells or lights the sharp bow of a brigantine suddenly loomed up hardly a ship s length in front What the blazes are you trying to do roared the mate from the bridge enraged at this unheard of violation of the right of way But no voice answered his challenge and the brigantine went swinging by with all her sails set to a spanking breeze She bore directly across the bow of the whaler which just grazed her stern in passing There s something rotten on board there said the mate Ay said the captain who had come on the bridge there s something rotten there right enough Swing your helm to port and get after the devils he ordered Ay ay sir came the ready response and nothing loth the helmsman changed his course to follow the eccentric craft She was evidently bound on some secret mission for not otherwise would she thus tear through the darkness before the wind without the flicker of a light The whaler was the swifter of the two ships and she could soon have overhauled the other but fearing some treachery the captain refrained from running her down until daylight All night long she seemed to be veering her course attempting to escape from her pursuer In the morning off the coast of Maine she turned her nose directly out to sea Then a boat was lowered from the whaler and rowed out to intercept the oncoming vessel When they were directly in her course they lay on their oars and waited The brigantine did not veer again but came steadily on and soon the whalemen were alongside and made themselves fast to a dinghy which she had in tow A few minutes of apprehensive waiting followed and as nothing happened one of the boldest swung himself up over the tow rope on to the deck He was followed by the others and they advanced cautiously with drawn knives and pistols Not a soul was to be seen and the men who were brave enough before a charging whale trembled with fear The wheel and the lookout were alike deserted and no sign of life could be discovered anywhere below In the galley were the embers of a dead fire and the table in the captain s cabin was spread out ready for a meal which had never been eaten On deck everything was spick and span and not the slightest evidence of a storm or any other disturbance could be found The theory of a derelict was impossible Apparently all had been well on board and they had been sailing with good weather when without any warning her crew had been suddenly snatched away by some dread power The sailors with one accord agreed that it was the work of a sea serpent But the mate had no place for the ordinary superstitions of the sea and he still scoured the hold expecting at any minute to encounter a dead body or some other evil evidence of foul play Nothing more however was found and the mate at length had to end his search with the unsatisfactory conclusion that the St Clare a brigantine registered from Hartpool with cargo of lime had been abandoned on the high seas for no apparent reason Her skipper had taken with him the ship s papers and had not left a single clue behind A crew was told off to stand by the St Clare to bring her into port and the others climbed into the long boat to row back to the whaler Just see if there is a name on that there dinghy before we go said the mate An exclamation of horror broke from one of the men as he read on the bow of the dinghy the name Kanawha The faces of all went white with a dire alarm as the facts of the mystery suddenly flashed before them The Kanawha was the ship in which Captain Mogul Mackenzie had made himself notorious as a privateersman Every one had heard her awe inspiring name and every Yankee seafaring man prayed that he might never meet her on the seas After the Alabama was sunk and the Talahassee was withdrawn the Kanawha still remained to threaten the shipping of the North For a long time her whereabouts had been unknown and then she was discovered by a Federal gunboat which gave chase and fired upon her Without returning fire she raced in for shelter amongst the dangerous islands off Cape Sable and was lost in the fog Rumor had it that she ran on the rocks off that perilous coast and sank with all on board As time went by and there was no more sign of the corsair the rumor was accepted as proven Men began to spin yarns in the forecastle about Mogul Mackenzie with an interest that was tinged with its former fear Skippers were beginning to feel at ease again on the grim waters when suddenly like a bolt from the blue came the awful news of the discovery of the St Clare Gunboats put off to scour the coast line and again with fear and trembling the look out began to eye suspiciously every new sail coming up on the horizon One afternoon toward the end of May a schooner came tearing into Portland harbor with all her canvas crowded on and flying distress signals Her skipper said that off the island of Campabello he had seen a long gray sailing ship with auxiliary power sweeping down upon him As the wind was blowing strong inshore he had taken to his heels and made for Portland He was chased all the way and his pursuer did not drop him until he was just off the harbor bar Many doubted his story however saying that no one would dare to chase a peaceful craft so near to a great port in broad daylight And again it was urged that an auxiliary vessel could easily have overhauled the schooner between Campabello and Portland The fact that the captain of the schooner was as often drunk as sober and that when he was under the influence of drink he was given to seeing visions was pointed to as conclusive proof that his yarn was a lie After the New Bedford whaler came into port with the abandoned St Clare it was known beyond doubt that the Kanawha was still a real menace But nobody cared to admit that Mogul Mackenzie was as bold as the schooner s report would imply and hence countless arguments were put forward to allay such fears But a few days later the fact that the pirates were still haunting their coast was absolutely corroborated A coastal packet from Boston arrived at Yarmouth with the news that she had not only sighted Kanawha in the distance but they had crossed each other s paths so near that the name could be discerned beyond question with a spyglass She was heading up the Bay of Fundy and did not pause or pay any heed to the other ship This news brought with it consternation and every town and village along the Fundy was a hum with stories and theories about the pirate ship The interest instead of being abated was augmented as the days went by with no further report In the public houses and along the quays it was almost the only topic of conversation The excitement became almost feverish when it was known that several captains outward bound had taken with them a supply of rifles and ammunition The prospect of a fight seemed imminent About a week after the adventure of the Boston packet Her Majesty s ship Buzzard appeared off Yarmouth harbor The news of the Kanawha had come to the Admiral at Halifax and he had dispatched the warship to cruise about the troubled coast That ll be the end of old Mogul Mackenzie now that he s got an English ship on his trail averred a Canadian as he sat drinking in the Yarmouth Light with a group of seafaring men of various nationalities It takes the British jack tar to put the kibosh on this pirate game One of them is worth a shipload of Yankees at the business Well don t you crow too loud now replied a Boston skipper I reckon that that Nova Scotian booze artist who ran into Portland the other day scared of his shadow would not do you fellows much credit Yes but what about your gunboats that have had the job of fixing the Kanawha for the last three years and haven t done it yet The feelings between Canada and the United States were none too good just after the Civil War and the Canadian was bound not to lose this opportunity for horse play You re a fine crowd of sea dogs you are you fellows from the Boston Tea Party Three years after one little half drowned rat and haven t got him yet Wouldn t Sir Francis Drake or Lord Nelson be proud of the record that you long legged slab sided Yankees have made on the sea Shut your mouth you blue nosed down East herring choker roared the Yankee skipper I reckon we ve given you traitors that tried to stab us in the back a good enough licking and if any more of your dirty dogs ever come nosing about down south of Mason and Dixon s Line I bet they ll soon find out what our record is Well you fools can waste your tongue and wind said a third man raising his glass but for me here s good luck to the Buzzard So say we all of us chimed in the others and the Yankee and the Canadian drank together to the success of the British ship forgetting their petty jealousies before a common foe Everywhere the news of the arrival of the British warship was hailed with delight All seemed to agree that her presence assured the speedy extermination of the pirate crew But after several days of futile cruising about the coast her commander to escape from a coming storm had to put into saint Mary s Bay with the object of his search still eluding his vigilance He only arrived in time to hear the last chapter of the Kanawha s tale of horrors The night before Dominic Lefountain a farmer living alone at Meteighan a little village on the French shore had been awakened from his sleep by the moaning and wailing of a human voice For days the imminent peril of an assault from the pirates had filled the people of the French coast with forebodings And now awakened thus in the dead of night the lonely Frenchman was wellnigh paralyzed with terror With his flesh creeping and his eyes wide he groped for his rifle and waited in the darkness while ever and anon came those unearthly cries from the beach Nearly an hour passed before he could gather himself together sufficiently to investigate the cause of the alarm At last when the piteous wailing had grown weak and intermittent the instinct of humanity mastered his fears and he went forth to give a possible succor to the one in need On the beach lying prostrate with the water lapping about his feet he found a man in the last stage of exhaustion The blood was flowing from his mouth and as Dominic turned him over to stanch its flow he found that his tongue had been cut out and hence the unearthly wailing which had roused him from his sleep The beach was deserted by this time and it was too dark to see far out into the bay Dominic carried the unfortunate man to his house and nursed him there for many weeks He survived his frightful experiences and lived on for twenty years a pathetic and helpless figure supported by the big hearted farmers and fishermen of the French shore Evidently he had known too much for his enemies and they had sealed his mouth forever He became known as the Mysterious Man of Meteighan and his deplorable condition was always pointed to as a mute witness of the last villainy of Mogul Mackenzie On the night following the episode of the Mysterious Man of Meteighan a wild and untoward storm swept down the North Atlantic and over the seaboard far and near In the Bay of Fundy that night the elements met in their grandest extremes Tide rips and mountain waves opposed each other with titanic force All along the bleak and rock ribbed coast the boiling waters lay churned into foam Over the breakwaters the giant combers crashed and soared far up into the troubled sky while out under the black clouds of the night the whirlpools and the tempests met Was ever a night like this before Those on shore thanked God and those with fathers on the sea gazed out upon a darkness where no star of hope could shine Now and again through the Stygian gloom a torrent of sheet lightning rolled down across the heavens bringing in its wake a moment of terrible light It was in one of these brief moments of illumination that the wan watchers at Hall s Harbor discerned a long gray ship being swept like a specter before the winds towards the Isle of Haut Until the flash of lightning the doomed seamen appeared to have been unconscious of their fast approaching fate and then as if suddenly awakened they sent a long thin trail of light to wind itself far up into the darkness Again and again the rockets shot upward from her bow while above the noises of the tempest came the roar of a gun The people on the shore looked at each other with blanched faces speechless helpless A lifetime by that shore had taught them the utter puniness of the sons of men Others would have tried to do something with what they thought was their strong arm But the fishermen knew too well that the Fundy s arm was stronger In silence they waited with bated breath while the awful moments passed Imperturbable they stood there with their feet in the white foam and their faces in the salt spray and gazed at the curtain of the night behind which a tragedy was passing as dark and dire as any in the annals of the sea Another flash of lightning and there dashing upon the iron rocks was a great ship with all her sails set and a cloud of lurid smoke trailing from her funnel She was gray colored with auxiliary power and as her lines dawned upon those who saw her in the moment of light they burst out with one accord It s the Kanawha It s the Kanawha As if an answer to their sudden cry another gun roared and another shower of rockets shot up into the sky and then all was lost again in the darkness and the voices of the tempest Next morning the winds had gone out with the tide and when in the afternoon the calm waters had risen a boat put off from Hall s Harbor and rowed to the Isle of Haut For several hours the rocky shores were searched for some traces of the wreck but not a spar or splinter could be found All about the bright waters laughed with naught but the sunbeams on their bosom and not a shadow remained from last night s sorrow on the sea So Mogul Mackenzie who had lived a life of stress passed out on the wings of storm In his end as always he baffled pursuit and was sought but could not be found His sailings on the sea were in secret and his last port in death was a mystery But as has been already related when the Northern Lights come down across the haunted island the distress signals of his pirate crew are still seen shooting up into the night FOOTNOTES twenty seven From Blackwood s Magazine THE LAST OF THE SEA ROVERS The Riff Coast Pirates twenty eight W B LORD O nay O nay then said our King O nay this must not be To yield to such a rover Myself will not agree He hath deceived the Frenchman Likewise the King of Spain And how can he be true to me That hath been false to twain OLD SEA SONG OF THE YEAR sixteen twenty Probably by this time the greater part of the piratical craft along the Riff coast has been destroyed and the long promised Moorish gunboat stationed there to protect foreign shipping twenty nine These steps have doubtless been hastened by the fact that the pirates unfortunately for themselves attacked a vessel some little time ago belonging to the Sultan of Morocco 
2294_169656_000005_000001	train-clean-360	For years past the Governments of several European Powers have sought to put friendly pressure upon the Sultan of Morocco to effectually stop the depredations of the Riffian coast pirates 
2294_169656_000005_000002	train-clean-360	No strong measures however were really taken until the above episode occurred 
2294_169656_000005_000003	train-clean-360	It is said that in early days the Moors were some time in accustoming themselves to the perils of the deep 
none	none	At first they marvelled greatly at those that go down to the sea in ships and have their business in great waters but they did not hasten to follow their example 
2294_169656_000005_000005	train-clean-360	One eminent ruler of ancient times in that region when asked what the sea was like replied The sea is a huge beast which silly folk ride like worms on logs But it afterwards became clear that the Moors had a strong fancy for the worms and logs too 
2294_169656_000005_000006	train-clean-360	They gave up marvelling at those who went to sea and went on it themselves in search of plunder 
2294_169656_000005_000007	train-clean-360	The risk the uncertainty the danger the sense of superior skill and ingenuity that attract the adventurous spirit and the passion for sport are stated by some writers to have brought such a state of things into existence 
2294_169656_000005_000008	train-clean-360	One fact seems to be pretty certain that when these depredations were first made they took the form of reprisals upon the Spaniards 
2294_169656_000005_000009	train-clean-360	No sooner was Granada fallen than thousands of desperate Moors left the land disdaining to live under a Spanish yoke 
2294_169656_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Settling along a portion of the northern coast of Africa they immediately proceeded to first attack all Spanish vessels that could be found 
none	none	Their quickness and knowledge of the coasts gave them the opportunity of reprisals for which they longed 
2294_169656_000005_000012	train-clean-360	Probably this got monotonous in course of time for in their wild sea courses they took to harrying the vessels belonging to other nations and so laid the foundation for a race of pirates which has continued down to quite recently 
2294_169656_000005_000013	train-clean-360	As nowadays the Moors cruised in boats from the commencement of their marauding expeditions 
2294_169656_000005_000014	train-clean-360	Each man pulled an oar and knew how to fight as well as row 
2294_169656_000005_000015	train-clean-360	Drawing little water a small squadron of these craft could be pushed up almost any creek or lie hidden behind a rock till the enemy came in sight 
2294_169656_000005_000016	train-clean-360	Then oars out and a quick stroke for a few minutes 
2294_169656_000005_000017	train-clean-360	Next they were alongside their unsuspecting prey and pouring in a first volley 
2294_169656_000005_000018	train-clean-360	Ultimately the prize was usually taken the crew put in irons and the pirates returned home with their capture no doubt being received with acclamation upon their arrival 
2294_169656_000006_000000	train-clean-360	As far back as the sixteenth century the Spanish forts at Alhucemas not to mention other places were established for the purpose of repressing piracy in its vicinity 
none	none	Considerable interest is attached to several of the piracies committed during the past few years as they culminated in strong representations being made to the Sultan of Morocco by the various Governments under whose flag the respective vessels sailed 
2294_169656_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Some of them went so far as to send warships to cruise along the Riffian coast 
2294_169656_000006_000003	train-clean-360	This step apparently had some moral effect upon the pirates for from that time onwards attacks upon foreign vessels practically ceased Something more than this however was needed for no one could say how soon the marauding expeditions might be renewed upon a larger scale than ever so as to make up for lost opportunities 
none	none	On August fourteen eighteen ninety seven the Italian three masted schooner Fiducia was off the coast of Morocco in the Mediterranean homeward bound from Pensacola to Marseilles 
2294_169656_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Here she got becalmed and while in that condition two boats approached her from the shore 
none	none	At first the crew of the Fiducia thought they were native fishing boats 
2294_169656_000006_000007	train-clean-360	When however the latter got within a hundred yards or so of the helpless vessel the suspicions of the crew were aroused 
none	none	The captain warned the Moors not to approach any nearer a volley of bullets was returned by way of reply followed by a regular fusillade as the boats advanced 
2294_169656_000006_000009	train-clean-360	There were only three revolvers on board the schooner and with these the crew prepared to defend themselves 
2294_169656_000006_000010	train-clean-360	Soon however their supply of ammunition became exhausted and the pirates boarded the schooner without further opposition 
none	none	The vessel was at once ransacked even the clothes of the crew being taken 
2294_169656_000006_000012	train-clean-360	The ship s own boat was lowered and into this the marauders put their booty and took it ashore also carrying the captain and one of the crew with them 
2294_169656_000006_000013	train-clean-360	About an hour later another boat containing about twenty pirates came off and fired on the ship 
2294_169656_000006_000014	train-clean-360	The crew seeing that they could offer no effective resistance hid themselves away in the hold 
2294_169656_000006_000015	train-clean-360	The other pirates had left very little for the new arrivals to take and this seemed to annoy them so much that they gave vent to their ill feelings in several ways not the least wanton being the pollution of the ship s fresh water 
2294_169656_000006_000016	train-clean-360	They also smashed the vessel s compass and tore up the charts For the next two days the crew existed on a few biscuits which the pirates had left behind 
none	none	The following day the British steamship Oanfa of London hove in sight 
2294_169656_000006_000018	train-clean-360	The crew of the schooner hoisted a shirt as a signal which was fortunately seen and a boat sent off in response thereto 
none	none	Assistance was promptly rendered and the Fiducia put in a position to resume her voyage This was done until spoken by the Italian cruiser Ercole which assisted the schooner to her destination In October eighteen ninety six the French barque Prosper Corue was lying becalmed off Alhucemas a place fortified by the Spaniards to keep the pirates in check when several boats full of armed Moors seized the vessel and made the crew prisoners 
2294_169656_000007_000001	train-clean-360	They then completely pillaged the ship removing almost everything of any use or value 
none	none	While the miscreants were thus busily engaged a Spanish merchant steamship named the Sevilla happened to come along and was in time to capture one boat and rescue several of the prisoners The Sevilla then made towards the barque but the pirates opened fire on the steamer killing and wounding some of the crew 
2294_169656_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The Spaniard was compelled to retire leaving the captain of the barque in the hands of the Moors 
none	none	Subsequently the barque was picked up in an abandoned condition by the British steamship Oswin and towed into Almeria An arrangement was afterwards made with the pirates to release the captains of the Fiducia and the Portuguese barque Rosita Faro a much earlier capture and some members of both crews in exchange for the Riffians captured by the Spanish steamer Sevilla and a ransom of three thousand dollars It was only after prolonged negotiations and a large sum of money that a French warship succeeded in obtaining the freedom of the captain of the Prosper Corue and a few other Frenchmen 
2294_169656_000007_000008	train-clean-360	For some reason or other the pirates seemed very much disinclined to part with these prisoners 
2294_169656_000007_000009	train-clean-360	Only a short time before the attack on the French barque took place a notice was issued by the British Board of Trade in which the attention of ship owners and masters of vessels was called to the dangers attending navigation off the coast of Morocco 
none	none	The document then proceeded to detail the case of the British schooner Mayer of Gibraltar which was boarded about ten miles from the Riff coast by twenty Moors armed with rifles and daggers As usual the pirates ransacked the vessel destroyed the ensign and ship s papers brutally assaulted the men on board and then made off in their boat Scarcely had the foregoing notice been generally circulated than another case of a similar character happened in connection with the Italian schooner Scatuola Again there is the Spanish cutter Jacob She was running along the Moorish coast one fine summer s evening a few years since when a boat full of pirates suddenly came alongside and speedily upset the quietness which had previously reigned on board the Jacob 
2294_169656_000007_000014	train-clean-360	Five of the crew managed to escape in the cutter s boat and were picked up some days later by a passing vessel 
2294_169656_000007_000015	train-clean-360	Those who remained on board the cutter fared very badly 
2294_169656_000007_000016	train-clean-360	After the vessel had been pillaged the rigging and sails destroyed the men were all securely bound and left to their fate 
none	none	Fortunately the weather continued fine and the Jacob drifted towards the Spanish coast where she was seen and assistance promptly rendered The captain of another Spanish vessel had quite a thrilling adventure among these pirates in May eighteen ninety two He left Gibraltar in command of the barque San Antonio for Alhucemas and when about six miles from Penon de la Gomera a boat manned by thirteen Moors was observed to be approaching the vessel 
2294_169656_000008_000002	train-clean-360	When near enough they opened fire and ordered the captain to lower his sails which was done as the Spaniards were practically speaking without arms 
none	none	The Moors then boarded the San Antonio and took her in tow 
2294_169656_000008_000004	train-clean-360	When close to the land the captain was rowed ashore and the pirates spent part of the night in unloading the cargo 
none	none	Next morning the San Antonio was seen drifting out to sea and the captain who was afraid of being put to death suggested that he should go on board and bring her back to the anchorage 
2294_169656_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Probably thinking that some of their comrades were on the barque but unable to set the necessary canvas to return only two Moors were sent off with the captain and these remained in the boat when the vessel was reached Upon gaining the deck of the barque the captain was surprised to find himself alone 
2294_169656_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Without hesitating for a moment he released the crew who were confined below hoisted sail and stood out to sea 
2294_169656_000008_000008	train-clean-360	The Moors who had been left in the boat were speedily cut adrift much to their amazement for it so happened that none of the pirates had stayed on board 
none	none	No doubt they were eager to find a safe hiding place for their plunder and thinking the barque quite secure till morning took no further heed of the matter A few days later the San Antonio arrived at Gibraltar where full particulars of the outrage were furnished to the authorities Space will not admit of details being given of the attacks on the Spanish barque Goleta the Portuguese barque Rosita Faro the British felucca Joven Enrique and other vessels It should be mentioned however that several famous British and foreign sailing yachts upon various occasions have had remarkably narrow escapes from being captured by these sea ruffians It is sincerely to be hoped that the Sultan of Morocco is carrying out his task in such a manner as will induce the inhabitants of the Riff coast to follow some occupation in future which is more likely to be appreciated by those who have to navigate vessels in the Mediterranean Previous to stern measures being taken by the Sultan it was not at all uncommon for his envoys to the native tribes for the purpose of obtaining the release of captives to be received with derision 
2294_169656_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Often too they were maltreated to such an extent that they were glad to escape with their lives 
2294_169656_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Some of the neighboring tribes continually endeavored to purchase captives for the pleasure of killing them but it is satisfactory to learn that no sales are recorded as the anticipated ransom was always largely in excess of the sums offered by the bloodthirsty natives
