DEW WATER RAIN SNOW HAIL ATMOSPHERE WIND LIGHTNING THUNDER ELECTRICITY TWILIGHT AND THE AURORA BOREALIS What is Dew Moisture collected from the atmosphere by the action of cold During the day the powerful heat of the sun causes to arise from the earth and water a moist vapor which after the sun sinks below the horizon is condensed by the cold and falls in the form of dew Dews are more copious in the Spring and Autumn than at any other season in warm countries than in cold ones because of the sudden changes of temperature Egypt abounds in dews all the summer for the air being too hot to condense the vapors in the day time they never gather into clouds and form rain Horizon the line which bounds the view on all sides so that the earth and sky appear to meet A Greek word from the verb signifying to mark boundaries Temperature degree of heat or cold Condense to cause the particles of a body to approach or unite more closely What are its uses It cools and refreshes the vegetable creation and prevents it from being destroyed by the heat of the sun All hot countries where there is little or no rain are therefore blessed with this provision by the all bountiful Creator to render them luxuriant and inhabitable and the dews which fall are so copious that the earth is as deeply soaked with them during the night as if a heavy rain had fallen For this reason also it is that we so often read in the Bible of the dew of Heaven being promised to the Israelites as a signal favor Luxuriant fertile flourishing Signal remarkable eminent From what does the vapor originate Vapor is water combined with a still greater quantity of caloric that is an imponderable and subtile form of matter which causes the sensation of heat and which driving asunder the particles of the water renders it aeriform Imponderable without sensible weight Subtile thin not dense or compact Particle a small portion of matter Aeriform having the form of air What is Water The fluid which covers more than three fifths of the surface of our globe and which is necessary for the life and health of the animal and vegetable creation for without water there would be neither rain nor dew and everything would perish It is likewise a necessary beverage for man and the inferior animals Beverage drink liquor for drinking In how many states do we find Water In four first solid as in ice snow hail c twod fluid as in its common form threed aeriform as in steam and fourth in a state of union with other matter Its most simple state is that of ice which is water deprived of a certain portion of its caloric crystallization then takes place and the water becomes solid and is called ice Crystallization the process by which the parts of a solid body separated by solution or fusion are again brought into the solid form If the process is slow the figure assumed is regular and bounded by plane and smooth surfaces Solution the diffusion of a solid through some liquid Fusion melting or rendering fluid by heat From what cause is the Water deprived of its caloric From the coldness of the atmosphere underneath the poles of our globe it is mostly solid there it is similar to the hardest rocks and may be cut with a chisel like stone or marble This great solidity is occasioned by the low temperature of the surrounding air and in very cold countries ice may be ground so fine as to be blown away by the wind and will still be ice Poles the extremities or ends of the axis an imaginary line supposed to be drawn through the centre of the earth or when applied to the heavens the two points directly over them Is ice the only instance of Water existing in a state of solidity No it is found in a solid state in many minerals as in marble c and is then called water of Crystallization It is essential in many cases to their solidity and transparency Essential necessary Transparency clearness the power of transmitting light Does Nature decompose Water in any of her operations Yes every living vegetable has the power of decomposing water by a secret process peculiar to itself Fish too and all cold blooded amphibious animals are gifted with the same power Decomposing separating a mixed body into its several parts Amphibious able to live both in water and out of it Of what use is this power to vegetables The water which they decompose affords them nourishment for the support of their vital juices and enables them by combining the fluid gases which compose it with those of the air and the soil to form their different products while the superfluous gas is abundantly given out by their leaves to refresh the spent air and render it wholesome for the animals that breathe it Vital belonging to life necessary to existence Superfluous unnecessary not wanted What is Rain The condensed aqueous vapors raised in the atmosphere by the sun and wind converted into clouds which fall in rain snow hail or mist their falling is occasioned by their own weight in a collision produced by contrary currents of wind from the clouds passing into a colder part of the air or by electricity If the vapors are more copious and rise a little higher they form a mist or fog which is visible to the eye higher still they produce rain Hence we may account for the changes of the weather why a cold summer is always a wet one a warm a dry one Aqueous watery consisting of water Collision a striking together a clash a meeting Electricity a natural agent existing in all bodies see page eighteen What seasons are more liable to rain than others The Spring and Autumn are generally the most rainy seasons the vapors rise more plentifully in Spring and in the Autumn as the sun recedes from us and the cold increases the vapors which lingered above us during the summer heats fall more easily Recede to fall back to retreat What is Snow Rain congealed by cold in the atmosphere which causes it to fall to the earth in white flakes Snow fertilizes the ground by defending the roots of plants from the intenser cold of the air and the piercing winds Congealed turned by the force of cold from a fluid to a solid state hardened Fertilize to render fruitful Intenser raised to a higher degree more powerful What is Hail Drops of rain frozen in their passage through cold air Hail assumes various figures according to the degrees of heat or cold through which it passes being sometimes round flat c What is the Atmosphere The mass of aeriform fluid which encompasses the earth on all sides it extends about fifty miles above its surface Air is the elastic fluid of which it is composed Elastic having the power of springing back or recovering its former figure after the removal of any external pressure which has altered that figure When the force which compresses the air is removed it expands and resumes its former state What are the uses of air It is necessary to the well being of man since without it neither he nor any animal or vegetable could exist If it were not for atmospheric air we should be unable to converse with each other we should know nothing of sound or smell or of the pleasures which arise from the variegated prospects which surround us it is to the presence of air and carbonic acid that water owes its agreeable taste Boiling deprives it of the greater part of these and renders it insipid Variegated diversified changed adorned with different colors Insipid tasteless What is Wind Air in motion with any degree of velocity What is Lightning The effect of electricity in the clouds A flash of lightning is simply a stream of the electric fluid passing from the clouds to the earth from the earth to the clouds or from one cloud to another Lightning usually strikes the highest and most pointed objects as high hills trees spires masts of ships c What is Thunder The report which accompanies the electrical union of the clouds or the echoes of the report between them and the earth Thunder is caused by a sudden discharge of electrical matter collected in the air by which vibrations are produced which give rise to the sound What is Electricity One of those agents passing through the earth and all substances without giving any outward signs of its presence when at rest yet when active often producing violent and destructive effects It is supposed to be a highly elastic fluid capable of moving through matter Clouds owe their form and existence probably to it and it passes through all substances but more easily through metals water the human body c which are called conductors than through air glass and silk which are called non conductors When bodies are not surrounded with non conductors the electricity escapes quickly into the earth To what part of bodies is Electricity confined To their surfaces as the outside may be electric and the inside in a state of neutrality The heat produced by an electric shock is very powerful but is only accompanied by light when the fluid is obstructed in its passage The production and condensation of vapor is a great source of the atmospheric electricity Condensation the act of making any body dense or compact that is of bringing its parts into closer union In what other sense is the term Electricity employed This term is also employed to designate that important branch of knowledge which relates to the properties shown by certain bodies when rubbed against or otherwise brought in contact with each other to attract substances and emit sparks of fire Designate to point out by some particular token Emit to send forth to throw out Illustration CUTTING AND GATHERING ICE ON THE HUDSON RIVER NEW YORK Whence is the word derived From electron the Greek word for amber a yellow transparent substance remarkable for its electrical power when rubbed amber is of a resinous nature and is collected from the sea shore or dug from the earth in many parts of the world It is employed in the manufacture of beads and other toys on account of its transparency is of some use in medicine and in the making of varnishes Transparent clear capable of being seen through Resinous containing resin a gummy vegetable juice Name a few substances possessing this remarkable property Silks of all kinds the hair and fur of animals paper sulphur and some other minerals most of the precious stones the paste of which false gems are made and many other substances used by us in the common affairs of life are susceptible of electrical excitement among domestic animals the cat furnishes a remarkable instance When dry and warm the back of almost any full grown cat the darker its color the better can be excited by rubbing it with the hand in the direction of the hair a process which is accompanied with a slight snapping noise and in the dark by flashes of pale blue light When a piece of glass is rubbed with silk or a stick of red sealing wax with woollen cloth each substance acquires the property of attracting and repelling feathers straws threads of cotton and other light substances the substances just mentioned as highly electric are however merely specimens All objects without exception most probably are capable of being electrically excited but some require more complicated contrivances to produce it than others Electric having the properties of electricity Susceptible disposed to admit easily Repelling the act of driving back Complicated formed by the union of several parts in one Is there not a machine by which we are enabled to obtain large supplies of electric power at pleasure Yes the electrical machine It is made of different forms and sizes for common purposes those of the simplest form are the best A common form of the machine consists of a circular plate of glass which can be turned about a horizontal axis by means of a suitable handle This plate turns between two supports and near its upper and lower edges are two pairs of cushions usually made of leather stuffed with horse hair and coated with a mixture of zinc tin and mercury called an amalgam These cushions are the rubbers for producing friction and are connected with the earth by means of a metal chain or rod Two large hollow cylinders of brass with globular ends each supported by two glass pillars constitute the reservoir for receiving the electricity They are called the prime conductors and are supplied with U shaped rods of metal furnished with points along their sides called combs for the purpose of receiving the electricity from the glass plate the arms of the U being held upon either side The other ends of the conductors are connected by a rod from the middle of which projects another rod terminating in a knob for delivering the spark On turning the plate a faint snapping sound is heard and when the room is darkened a spark is seen to be thrown out from the knob projecting from the prime conductors Many curious and interesting experiments may be performed by means of the machine illustrating the general properties of electricity For instance a person standing on an insulated bench that is a bench with glass legs or having the legs resting on glass and having one hand on the conductor can send sparks with the other hand to everything and everybody about This illustrates communication of electricity by contact A wooden head covered with long hairs when placed on the conductor illustrates electrical repulsion by the hairs standing on end If the hand is held to the knob sparks will pass from it in rapid succession causing in the hand a sensation of pain This is called an electric shock and is caused by the electric fluid occasioning a sudden motion by the contraction of the muscles through which it passes The force of the shock is in proportion to the power of the machine What are the Muscles Bundles of thin fleshy fibres or threads fastened to the bones of animals the contraction and expansion of which move the bones or perform the organic functions of life Organic relating to organs or natural instruments by which some process is carried on Functions employments or offices of any part of the body Contraction drawing in or shortening Expansion extending or spreading out What is Twilight The light from the first dawning of day to the rising of the sun and again between its setting and the last remains of day Without twilight the sun s light would appear at its rising and disappear at its setting instantaneously and we should experience a sudden transition from the brightest sunshine to the profoundest obscurity The duration of twilight is different in different climates and in the same places it varies at different periods of the year Instantaneously done in an instant in a moment s time Obscurity darkness want of light How is it produced By the sun s refraction that is the variation of the rays of light from their direct course occasioned by the difference of density in the atmosphere Variation change Density closeness of parts compactness What is the poetical name for the morning Twilight Aurora the goddess of the morning and harbinger of the rising sun whom poets and artists represent as drawn by white horses in a rose colored chariot unfolding with her rosy fingers the portals of the East pouring reviving dew upon the earth and re animating plants and flowers Harbinger a forerunner Portals gates doors of entrance Reanimating invigorating with new life What remarkable phenomenon is afforded to the inhabitants of the polar regions The Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights a luminous appearance in the northern parts of the heavens seen mostly during winter or in frosty weather and clear evenings it assumes a variety of forms and hues especially in the polar regions where it appears in its perfection and proves a great solace to the inhabitants amidst the gloom of their long winter s night which lasts from one to six months while the summer s day which succeeds it lasts in like manner for the same period of time Of what nature is the Aurora Borealis It is decidedly an electrical phenomenon which takes place in the higher regions of the atmosphere It is somehow connected with the magnetic poles of the earth and generally appears in form of a luminous arch from east to west but never from north to south Phenomenon an extraordinary appearance The word is from a Greek one signifying to show or appear Magnetic belonging to the magnet or loadstone Luminous bright shining In what country is it seen constantly from October to Christmas In Siberia where it is remarkably bright On the western coast of Hudson s Bay the sun no sooner disappears than the Aurora Borealis diffuses a thousand different lights and colors with such dazzling beauty that even the full moon cannot eclipse it CHAPTER II CORN BARLEY PEARL BARLEY OATS RYE POTATOES TEA

CALICO COTTON CLOTH WOOL BAIZE LINEN FLAX HEMP DIAPER HOLLAND CANVAS AND FLANNEL What is Calico A kind of printed cotton cloth of different colors From what place did it take its name From Calicut a city on the coast of Malabar where it was first made much is now manufactured in the United States England and many other countries What is Cotton A downy or woolly substance enclosed in the pod or seed vessel of the cotton plant The commercial classification of cotton is determined one by cleanliness or freedom from sand dry leaf and other impurities two by absence of color both subject also to character of staple length and strength and fineness of fibre These together determine relative value There are two general classifications long stapled and short stapled Of the former the best is the sea island cotton of the United States The short staple cotton grows in the middle and upper country the long staple is cultivated in the lower country near the sea and on the islands near the coasts How is it cultivated The seeds are sown in ridges made with the plough or hoe when the plants are mature the pods open and the cotton is picked from them Where did Cotton anciently grow and for what was it used In Egypt where it was used by the priests and sacrificers for a very singular kind of garment worn by them alone In what manufacture is it now used It is woven into muslins dimities cloths calicoes c and is also joined with silks and flax in the composition of other stuffs and in working with the needle How is the Cotton separated from the seed By machines called cotton gins of which there are two kinds the roller gin and the saw gin In the former the cotton just as gathered from the plant is drawn between two rollers placed so closely together as to permit the passage of the cotton but not of the seeds which are consequently left behind In the saw gin the cotton is placed in a receiver one side of which consists of a grating of parallel wires about an eighth of an inch apart circular saws revolving on a common axis between these wires entangle in their teeth the cotton and draw it from the seeds which are too large to pass between the wires How is it made into Calico c The cotton having been separated from the seed is spun by a machine for the purpose It is next woven then dressed and printed What is Cloth The word in its general sense includes all kinds of stuffs woven in the loom whether the threads be of wool cotton hemp or flax To what is it more particularly applied To a web or tissue of woollen threads Web any thing woven What is Wool The covering or hair of sheep To prepare it for the weaver it is first shorn washed and dried then carded or combed by machinery into fibres or threads formerly this was always performed by the hand by means of an instrument called a comb with several rows of pointed teeth this though not much used now is still occasionally employed except in large factories This combing is repeated two or three times till it is sufficiently smooth and even for spinning Spinning or converting wool or cotton silk c into thread was anciently performed by the distaff and spindle these we find mentioned in sacred history and they have been used in all ages and in all countries yet discovered The natives of India and of some other parts of the world still employ this simple invention What was the next improvement The invention of the hand wheel In seventeen sixty seven a machine called the spinning jenny was invented by a weaver named Hargreaves but the greatest improvement in the art of spinning was effected by mister Arkwright in seventeen sixty eight these two inventions were combined and again improved upon in seventeen seventy six so that by the new plan the material can be converted into thread in a considerably shorter space of time than in the ancient mode leaving to man merely to feed the machine and join the threads when they break The sheep whose wool forms the material for nearly all woollen clothing came originally from Africa Does weaving differ according to the material used The principle of weaving is the same in every kind of fabric and consists in forming any kind of thread into a flat web or cloth by interlacing one thread with another the various appearances of the manufacture arise as much from the modes in which the threads are interwoven as from the difference of material Is not the employment of Wool in the manufacture of Clothing of great antiquity In the earliest records we possess of the arts of mankind wool is mentioned as forming a chief article in the manufacture of clothing it is spoken of in the Bible as a common material for cloth as early as the time of Moses The ancient Greeks and Romans are well known to have possessed this art At the beginning of the thirteenth century the manufacture was established in many parts of Europe particularly in Spain from which country it extended itself to France and Italy There is no doubt that it was introduced into England by its conquerors the Romans a manufactory being established at Winchester sufficiently large to supply the Roman army Manufactory a place where things are made or manufactured derived from the Latin manus a hand and the verb facio to do or make What circumstance contributed to the progress of this manufacture among the English In thirteen thirty the English being desirous of improving their woollen manufacture invited over the Flemings by the offer of various privileges to establish manufactories there The skill of these people soon effected a great improvement in the English fabrics so that there no longer remained any occasion for the exportation of English wool into Flanders to be manufactured into fine cloth and a law was passed by the government to forbid it Both the cotton and woollen manufactures have of late years arisen to great importance in the United States What country affords the best Wool The wool of Germany is most esteemed at the present day that of Spain was formerly the most valuable but the Spanish breed of sheep having been introduced into Germany succeeded better there than in Spain and increased so

invented fabrics of finer or coarser qualities composed of the same materials mixed in various degrees as Mousselines de laine Challis c What is Crape A light transparent stuff resembling gauze made of raw silk very loosely woven or of wool by raw silk is meant silk in the state in which it is taken from the silk worm Where was Crape first made At Bologna a city of Italy What city of France was

been distinguished for the beauty of its crapes What is Camlet A stuff made sometimes of wool sometimes of silk and hair especially that of goats The oriental camlet is made of the pure hair of a sort of goat a native of Angora a city of Natolia in Turkey The European camlets are made of a mixture of woollen thread and hair What countries are most noted for them England France Holland and Flanders

States c What is Lace A work composed of many threads of fine linen or silk interwoven one with another according to some particular pattern Belgium France and England are the principal countries in which this manufacture is carried on vast quantities of the finest laces were formerly made in Flanders From what is Silk produced From the silk worm an insect not more remarkable for the precious matter it furnishes than for the many forms it assumes before and after it envelopes itself in the beautiful ball the silken threads of which form the elegant texture which is so much worn Texture a web or substance woven What are the habits of this insect and on what does it feed After bursting from the egg it becomes a large worm or caterpillar of a yellowish white color which is its first state this caterpillar feeds on the leaves of the mulberry tree till arriving at maturity it winds itself up in a silken bag or case called a cocoon about the size and shape of a pigeon s egg and becomes a chrysalis in which state it lies without signs of life in about ten days it eats its way out of its case a perfect butterfly which lays a number of eggs and then dies In the warmth of the summer weather these eggs are hatched and become worms as their parents did at first Maturity ripeness perfection How much silk is each ball said to contain Each ball consists of a very fine soft bright delicate thread which being wound off extends in length six miles What is meant by Chrysalis The second state into which the insect passes before it comes to be a butterfly The maggot or worm having ceased to eat fixes itself in some place till its skin separates and discovers a horny oblong body which is the chrysalis Where was Silk first made The culture and manufacture of silk was originally confined to China The Greeks under Alexander the Great brought home among other Eastern luxuries wrought silks from Persia about three hundred twenty three B C It was not long unknown to the Romans although it was so rare that it was even sold weight for weight with gold The Emperor Aurelian who died in two hundred seventy five B C refused the Empress his wife a suit of silk which she solicited with much earnestness merely on account of its dearness Heliogabalus the Emperor who died half a century before Aurelian was the first who wore a holosericum or garment all of silk Who introduced the Silk Worm itself into Europe Two monks engaged as missionaries in China obtained a quantity of silk worms eggs which they concealed in a hollow cane and conveyed in safety to Constantinople in five hundred fifty two the eggs were hatched in the proper season by the warmth of manure and the worms fed with the leaves of the wild mulberry tree These worms in due time spun their silk and propagated under the care of the monks who also instructed the Romans in the whole process of manufacturing their production From the insects thus produced proceeded all the silk worms which have since been reared in Europe and the western parts of Asia The mulberry tree was then eagerly planted and on this their natural food they were successfully reared in Greece and the manufacture was established at Thebes Athens and Corinth in particular The Venetians soon after this time commencing a trade with the Greeks supplied all the Western parts of Europe with silks for many centuries Where were the cities of Thebes and Athens situated Thebes was an ancient city of Beotia in Greece founded by Cadmus a Phenician though of Egyptian parentage Sailing from the coast of Phenicia he arrived in Beotia and built the city calling it Thebes from the city of that name in Egypt To this prince is ascribed the invention of sixteen letters of the Greek Alphabet Athens was the capital of Attica founded by Cecrops an Egyptian It was the seat of learning and the arts and has produced some of the most celebrated warriors statesmen orators poets and sculptors in the world Since the emancipation of Greece from the cruel bondage of its conquerors the Turks who had oppressed it for three centuries Athens has been chosen as its capital and is still a considerable town adorned with splendid ruins of the beautiful buildings it once possessed Thebes and Corinth another celebrated city are now only villages Warrior a soldier Statesmen men versed in the arts of government Orator a public speaker Poet one who composes poetry Sculptor one who cuts figures in stone marble or ivory Who were the Venetians Inhabitants of Venice a city of Italy Did this manufacture continue to be confined to the Greeks and Venetians By no means The rest of Italy and Spain by degrees learnt the art from some manufactories in Sicily and about the reign of Francis the First the French became masters of it It however long remained a rarity their King Henry the Second is supposed to have worn the first pair of knit silk stockings The Fourth Henry encouraged the planting of mulberry trees his successors also did the same and the produce of silk in France is now very considerable When was the manufacture of silk introduced into England There was a company of silk women in England as early as the year fourteen fifty five but they probably were merely employed in needlework of silk and thread for Italy supplied England with the broad manufacture during the chief part of the fifteenth century The great advantage this new manufacture afforded made King James the First very desirous for its introduction into England particularly in sixteen oh eight when it was recommended in very earnest terms to plant mulberry trees for the rearing of silk worms but unhappily without effect However towards the latter end of this reign the broad silk manufacture was introduced and with great success The revocation of the Edict of Nantes contributed greatly to its promotion by the number of French workmen who took refuge in England to them the English are indebted for the art of manufacturing many elegant kinds of silks satins velvets c which had formerly been imported from abroad up to the year seventeen eighteen The silk manufacture has also been successfully introduced into some portions of the United States Revocation act of recalling repeal Imported brought into What was the Edict of Nantes A law made in favor of the Protestants the repealing of which drove many of their most skilful workmen to take refuge in England They were kindly received and settled in Spitalfields and many other parts of England as well as Ireland where they carried on a flourishing and ingenious manufacture Were the attempts to rear Silk Worms in England successful No after many trials all of which failed attention was directed to the establishments for procuring both raw and wrought silks in the settlements in India belonging to Britain this was attended with complete success the climate being extremely favorable and the price of labor cheap Raw silk is imported in quantities from India China Italy c How is the Silk taken from the Worm The people who are employed in the care of these insects collect the golden balls from off the mulberry trees to the leaves of which the insects glue their silk and put them into warm water that the threads may unfasten and wind off more easily having taken off the coarse woolly part which covers the balls they take twelve or fourteen threads at a time and wind them off into skeins In order to prepare this beautiful material for the hand of the weaver to be wrought into silks stuffs brocades satins velvets ribbons c it is spun reeled milled bleached and dyed Milled worked in a kind of mill Bleached whitened What is Velvet A rich kind of stuff all silk covered on the outside with a close short fine soft shag the wrong side being very strong and close The principal number and the best velvets were made in France and Italy others in Holland they are now brought to great perfection in England An inferior kind is made by mixing cotton with the silk Velvet has been known in Europe for some centuries but its manufacture was long confined to some of the chief cities of Italy From that country the French learned the art and greatly improved it Whence is the word Velvet derived From the Italian word velluto signifying velvet which comes from vellus hair or fleece What is Mohair The hair of a kind of goat common about Angora in Turkey It is used in the manufacture of various kinds of stuffs shawls c Is there not another animal much celebrated for the material it furnishes in the making of shawls Yes the Thibet goat The wool is sent to Cashmere where it is spun and dyed Cashmere is situated in the north west extremity of India and has long been celebrated for the beautiful and valuable shawls bearing its name which are manufactured there The goats are beautiful creatures with long fine wavy hair reaching nearly to the ground so as almost to conceal their legs The material of which the shawls are

PARCHMENT AND VELLUM What is Glass A transparent solid brittle factitious body produced by fusing sand with an alkali The essential ingredients of glass are silex and potash or soda a few other substances are sometimes added Silex is found nearly pure in rock crystal flint and other varieties of quartz for the manufacture of the better kinds of glass in this country it is generally obtained from sand especially the white sand of New Jersey Factitious made by art not found in a state of nature What is Potash The saline matter obtained from the ashes of wood by causing water to pass through them the water imbibes the salt which is then obtained from it by evaporation When purified by calcination it is termed pearlash In countries where there are vast forests as in America and Russia it is manufactured on a very large scale What can you say of the origin of Glass The period of its invention is quite unknown Pliny relates that some merchants driven by a storm to the coast of Phenicia near the river Belus made a large fire on the sand to dress some food using as fuel some of the plant Kali which grew there in great abundance an imperfect glass was thus formed by the melting of the sand and ashes together This production was picked up by a Syrian merchant who attracted by its great beauty examined the cause of its origin and after many attempts succeeded in its manufacture Who was Pliny A celebrated Roman naturalist and historian At what place was Glass first made Some authors mention Sidon in Syria which became famous for glass and glass houses but others maintain that the first glass houses noticed in history were built at Tyre which they add was the only place where glass was made for many ages It is certain that the art was known to the Egyptians What is Phenicia A sub division of Syria in Asia What is an author A person who writes a book What is signified by a glass house A building erected for the making and working of glass What countries had glass windows first Italy then France and England they began to be common about the year eleven eighty In what year and where was the making of glass bottles begun In fifteen fifty seven in London The first glass plates for mirrors and coach windows were made at Lambeth in sixteen seventy three What is a Mirror A body which exhibits the images of objects presented to it by reflection The word mirror is more peculiarly used to signify a smooth surface of glass tinned and quicksilvered at the back three which reflects the images of objects placed before it Footnote three See Chapter XII article Mercury Are they a modern invention The use of mirrors is very ancient mention is made of brazen mirrors or looking glasses in Exodus the thirty eighth chapter and eighth verse Some modern commentators will not admit the mirrors themselves to have been of brass but of glass set or framed in brass but the most learned among the Jewish rabbins say that in those times the mirrors made use of by the Hebrew women in dressing their heads were of metal and that the devout women mentioned in this passage made presents to Moses of all their mirrors to make the brazen laver for the Tabernacle It might likewise be proved that the ancient Greeks made use of brazen mirrors from many passages in the ancient poets Commentators explainers of passages in the Bible c Rabbins doctors among the Jews their learned men or teachers What nation invented the large looking glass plates now in use The French What city of Italy excelled all Europe for many years in the making of fine glass Venice The manufacture of fine glass was first introduced into England by Venetian artists in ten seventy eight Of what is Earthenware composed Of clay and those earths which are capable of being kneaded into a paste easily receiving any form and acquiring solidity by exposure to fire sand chalk and flint are likewise mixed with clay In what manner is it formed into such a variety of shapes The flint or sand and soft clay are mixed together in various proportions for the different kinds of ware this paste is afterwards beaten till it becomes fit for being formed at the wheel into plates dishes basins c These are then put into a furnace and baked after which they are glazed What nation so greatly excelled in the manufacture of a beautiful species of Earthenware The Chinese who as far as can be ascertained were its inventors Porcelain is a fine sort of earthenware chiefly made in China whence it was called China or China ware it is also brought from many parts of the East especially from Japan Siam Surat and Persia The art of making porcelain was one of those in which Europe had been excelled by oriental nations but for many years past earthenwares have been made in different parts of Europe so like the oriental that they have acquired the name of porcelain The first European porcelains were made in Saxony and France and afterwards in England Germany and Italy all of which differed from those of Japan and China but each possessing its peculiar character They are now brought to great perfection in Europe particularly in England France and Prussia Before the invention of Earthenware what supplied its place to the early inhabitants of the world The more civilized the inhabitants of any country became the more they would perceive the convenience of possessing vessels of various descriptions for holding or preparing their food some of the objects which first presented themselves would be the larger kinds of shells and in hot climates the hard coverings of the cocoa nut or gourd In some cases the skins of beasts were used as they still are in the East where they are sewed together and formed into a kind of bottle to hold milk wine c but the people of colder climates would not be able to avail themselves of these natural productions and would be obliged to make use of other substances What then would they employ Clay which in many countries is found in great abundance from its adhesive property and its retaining its form when dry and becoming insoluble in water after having been baked in the fire would naturally attract the attention of an improving people from this it arises that the early remains of culinary and other vessels which have been discovered have been formed of this material Among the remains of ancient Egypt numerous vessels have been found formed of common clay baked in the fire and though of rude workmanship extremely elegant in form Adhesive sticky apt or tending to adhere Insoluble not capable of being dissolved Culinary belonging to cooking or domestic purposes Of what are Needles made Of steel and though exceedingly cheap they go through a great number of operations before they are brought to perfection It was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth that the English learnt the art of making needles Of what are Pins made Of brass wire blanched with tin They are manufactured in England France the United States and other countries Though there is scarcely any commodity cheaper than pins there is no other which passes through the hands of a greater number of workmen more than twenty persons being successively employed in the manufacture of each from the drawing of the brass wire to the sticking of the pin in the paper Pins are supposed to have been made in England about fifteen forty three or even earlier Before this art was invented the ladies made use of wooden skewers Blanched whitened Of what is Paper made Of linen and cotton rags beaten to a pulp in water also from straw wood and many plants What materials were used for writing before the invention of Paper Various were the materials on which mankind in different ages and countries contrived to write stones bricks the leaves of herbs and trees and their rinds or barks tablets of wood wax and ivory plates of lead silk linen rolls c At length the Egyptian paper made of the papyrus was invented then parchment and lastly paper manufactured of cotton or linen rags There are few sorts of plants which have not at some time been used for paper and books In Ceylon for instance the leaves of the talipot in India the leaves of the palm with which they commonly covered their houses were used for books In the East Indies the leaves of the plantain tree dried in the sun were used for the same purpose In China paper is made of the inner bark of the mulberry the bamboo the elm the cotton and other trees What is Papyrus A large rush chiefly growing in Egypt on the banks of the Nile The ancient Egyptians made sails ropes mats blankets and canvas of the stalks and fibres of the papyrus Their priests also wore shoes made of it and even sugar was extracted from this plant Moses the deliverer raised by God to rescue the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt was exposed to the Nile in a basket of papyrus The plant is now however exceedingly scarce Where was the first Paper Mill erected in England At Dartford by a German named Spilman in fifteen eighty eight The only sort made however was the coarse brown and it was not till sixteen ninety when the French protestant refugees settled in England that their own paper makers began to make white writing and printing paper The manufacture has been brought to great perfection both for beauty and substance in England and the United States Protestant a name given in Germany to those who adhered to the doctrines of the apostate monk Martin Luther because they protested against a decree of Charles V and applied to a general council Refugee from refuge a place of safety from danger an asylum Here it more particularly means those French Protestants who quit their homes and sought other countries after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes which deprived them of their religious liberty Illustration THE DOME OF PISA ITALY WITH THE FAMOUS LEANING TOWER IN THE DISTANCE Is it known to whom we are indebted for the invention of Linen Paper Not exactly It has long been disputed among the learned when and by whom it was invented some authors say it was discovered by the Germans others by the Italians others ascribe it to some refugee Greeks at Basil who took the idea from the making of cotton paper in their own country some that the Arabs first introduced it into Europe Perhaps the Chinese have the best title to the invention inasmuch as they have for many ages made paper and in some provinces of the same materials as are now used by us in its manufacture In what place was the art of Printing first practised Who were the inventors of Printing in what city and in what year it was begun has long been a subject of great dispute Mentz Harlem and Strasburg cities of Germany all lay claim to the invention but Mentz seems to have the best title to it What was the first Book that was printed from metal types A copy of the Holy Scriptures which made its appearance between the years fourteen fifty and fourteen fifty two Who introduced Printing into England William Caxton a merchant of London who had acquired a knowledge of it in his travels abroad Of what does Printing consist Of the art of taking impressions with ink from movable characters and figures made of metal c upon paper or parchment What is Parchment Sheep or goat s skin prepared after a peculiar manner which renders it proper for several uses especially for writing on and for the covering of books The ancients seem to have used the skins of animals as a writing material from a remote period From what is the word Parchment taken From Pergamena the ancient name of this manufacture which it is said to have taken from the country of Pergamus and to Eumenes king of that country its invention is usually ascribed though in reality that prince appears to have been the improver rather than the inventor of parchment since some accounts refer its invention to a still earlier period of time Herodotus an ancient Greek historian who lived about four hundred fifty years before Christ relates that the ancient Ionians made use of sheep and goat skins in writing many ages before the time of Eumenes the Persians of old too wrote all their records on skins and probably such skins were prepared and dressed for that purpose after a manner not unlike our parchments though not so artificially Who were the Ionians The inhabitants of Ionia an ancient country in the western part of Asia Minor In what manner is Parchment now prepared The sheep skins are smeared over with lime four on the fleshy side folded laid in heaps and thus left for some days they are next stretched very tight on wooden frames after having been washed drained and half dried The flesh is then carefully taken off with iron instruments constructed on purpose and the skin cleansed from the remaining hairs that adhere to it After having gone through several operations till it is perfectly clean and smooth it is fit for writing upon Footnote four See Chapter XVI article Lime What are the uses of Parchment Parchment is of great use for writings which are to be preserved on account of its great durability the writing on it remaining perfect for a great number of years It is also used for the binding of books and various other purposes What is Vellum A finer sort of parchment than the former but prepared in the same manner except that it is not passed through the lime pit It is made of the skins of very young calves there is also a still finer sort made of the skins of sucking lambs or kids this is called virgin parchment and is very thin fine and white and is used for fancy work such as ladies fans c CHAPTER VIII CAPERS ALMONDS ORANGES LEMONS CITRONS LIMES OLIVES OILS MELONS TAMARINDS AND DATES What are Capers The full grown flower buds of the Caper Tree a small shrub generally found growing out of the fissures of rocks or among rubbish on old walls and ruins giving them a gay appearance with its large white flowers It is a native of Italy it is also common in the south of France where it is much cultivated How are they prepared and for what are they used They are gathered and dried in the shade then infused in vinegar to which salt is added after which they are put in barrels to be used as a pickle chiefly in sauces What are frequently substituted for Capers The buds of broom pickled in the same manner or the berries of the nasturtium an American annual plant with pungent fruit What are Almonds The nut of the Almond Tree a species of the peach growing in most of the southern parts of Europe there are two kinds the bitter and the sweet What are their qualities and use The sweet almonds are of a soft grateful taste and much used by the confectioner in numerous preparations of sweet meats cookery c Both sorts yield an oil and are useful in medicine Of what country is the Orange a native It is a native of China India and most tropical countries but has long been produced in great perfection in the warmer parts of Europe and America Oranges are imported in immense quantities every year from the Azores Spain Portugal Italy c They are brought over in chests and boxes packed separately in paper to preserve them The oranges in common use with us are the bitter or Seville the China or sweet orange and those from Florida Where are the Azores situated In the Atlantic Ocean about eight hundred miles west of Portugal These islands are very productive in wine and fruits Where is Seville In Spain it is an ancient and considerable city the capital of the province of Andalusia The flowers of the Seville orange are highly odoriferous and justly esteemed one of the finest perfumes Its fruit is larger than the China orange and rather bitter the yellow rind or peel is warm and aromatic The juice of oranges is a grateful and wholesome acid Odoriferous sweet scented fragrant having a brisk agreeable smell which may be perceived at a distance Who first introduced the China Orange into Europe The Portuguese It is said that the very tree from which all the European orange trees of this sort were produced was still preserved some years back at the house of the Count saint Laurent in Lisbon In India those most esteemed and which are made presents of as rarities are no larger than a billiard ball The Maltese oranges are said by some to be the finest in the world Who are the Maltese The inhabitants of Malta an island of the Mediterranean situated between Africa and Sicily Whence are Lemons brought The Lemon is a native of Eastern Asia whence it was brought to Greece and afterwards to Italy from Italy it was transplanted to Spain Portugal and the South of France whence lemons are imported in great plenty What is the Citron The fruit of the Citron Tree resembling the lemon but somewhat larger and having a finer pulp The citron was also brought originally from the East of Asia but has since been produced in the warm parts of Europe like the orange and lemon Genoa especially is the greatest nursery for them Its rind is principally brought to this country in a candied state and is applied by confectioners to various purposes Where is Genoa A city of Northern Italy on the Mediterranean between the rivers Bisagno and Polcevera What is the Lime The Lime is by some thought to be a species of lemon by others not it is a smaller fruit and in the West Indies is greatly preferred to the lemon It is cultivated in the South of Europe the West Indies and the warm parts of America The agreeable scent called Bergamot is prepared from the rind of a small species of lime What are Olives The fruit of the Olive Tree an evergreen now common in the woods of France Spain and Italy but in the wild state producing a small fruit of no value when cultivated however which it is extensively both for the fruit and the quantity of oil which it yields it forms one of the richest productions of Southern Europe The olive came originally from Asia Its use is very ancient it is frequently spoken of in the Bible both as in a wild and cultivated state The promised land of the Israelites was a land of oil olive and honey From the time that the dove returned to Noah in the Ark with an olive leaf plucked off in all ages and countries wherever this tree is known down to the present day has an olive branch been the favorite emblem of peace What nation holds the olive in great repute This tree was a great favorite with the ancient Greeks and scarcely an ancient custom existed in which the olive was not in some way associated at their marriages and festivals all parts of their dwellings especially the doors were ornamented with them and the same custom prevails at the present day both in public and private rejoicings It was also scarcely less a favorite with the Romans although it was not held in the same sacred light as amongst the Greeks The olive branch has likewise been universally considered the emblem of plenty and as such is found on the coins of those countries of which it is not a native Two centuries after the foundation of Rome both Italy and Africa were strangers to this useful plant it afterwards became naturalized in those countries and at length arrived in Spain France c Olive trees sometimes attain a great age How are the Olives eaten The olives while on the tree are intolerably bitter without any of that peculiar taste which gains them admittance at the richest tables to fit them for which they are pickled Ripe olives are eaten in the Eastern countries especially amongst the Greeks as an article of food particularly in Lent The oil which they yield in great quantities is very highly esteemed being that chiefly used for salads c in medicine and in various manufactures Lent a time of fasting the time from Ash Wednesday to Easter How is the Oil drawn from the Olive By presses or mills made for the purpose The sweetest and best olive oil comes from the South of France from Naples Florence and Lucca quantities are also brought from Spain and the Ionian Islands Where is Naples In the South of Italy Where are Florence and Lucca situated In Italy Florence is a very ancient large and celebrated city the capital of Italy Lucca formerly a republic belongs now to the kingdom of Italy Republic a state in which the supreme power of government is lodged in representatives chosen by the people instead of being vested in an emperor or king You said that the olive is an Evergreen to what plant or shrub is the term particularly applied To any shrub or tree whose leaves continue fresh and green all the year round winter and summer as the laurel pine cedar holly c which do not shed their leaves in autumn as other trees Is oil a production confined to the Olive alone By no means Oil is a fatty inflammable matter drawn from many vegetable and animal bodies The oils in common use are of three different kinds The first are mere oily or fatty bodies extracted either by pressure or by decoction of the first kind are those of almonds nuts olives c and of the other those of different berries c which are procured by boiling the substance in water which causes the oil to collect on the top Decoction act of boiling a chemical term What are the second and third kinds of Oils The second are those drawn from vegetables by common distillation in the alembic with the aid of water these contain the oily and volatile part of the plant and are called essential oils The third sort are those produced by distillation but of a different kind in an open vessel and without the help of water They are likewise divided into vegetable oils animal oils and mineral oils which last are those drawn from amber and a few other substances partaking both of the vegetable and mineral natures as Petroleum commonly known as kerosene or coal oil Alembic a chemical vessel used in distilling It consists of a vessel placed over a fire containing the substance to be distilled the upper part which receives and condenses the steam is called the head the beak of this is fitted to a vessel called a receiver Volatile easily escaping quickly flying off Whence is the word Oil derived From the Latin oleum formed from olea olive tree the fruit of which abounds in oil What immense fish is it that furnishes us with a quantity of animal oil The Whale the largest and noblest inhabitant of the waters It is protected from the cold by a case or coating of blubber that is a thick oily fat from which the oil is made numbers of them are caught for the sake of that Ambergris highly prized in perfumery is a product of the sperm whale In what seas are they found Chiefly in the Northern Seas extensive whale fisheries are carried on by the Americans English Dutch c and numbers of vessels are sent out for the purpose of taking the fish they usually sail in the latter end of March and begin fishing about May The whale fishery continues generally from that time till the latter end of June or July There are also other fishes and animals which afford us oils of different kinds which are used for various purposes in medicine and the arts Is the oil called castor which is so much used in medicine the product of an animal or a plant Castor oil is expressed from a West Indian shrub called Palma Christi and especially from the ripe seeds which are full of this oil It is prepared by collecting these ripe seeds and freeing them from the husks then bruising and beating them into a paste they are next boiled in water when the oil rising to the surface is skimmed off as it continues to appear The Castor oil plant is found growing abundantly in Sumatra particularly near the sea shore Where is Sumatra situated In the Oriental Archipelago off the south eastern part of the continent of Asia In what other countries is this plant found In some parts of Africa Syria and Egypt It was anciently cultivated in the two last mentioned countries in large quantities the seeds being used for the oil they yielded which was burnt in lamps Illustration BEAVERS BUILDING THEIR HUTS Is not the Palma Christi much affected by soil and situation Greatly so In some places it attains the stature of a tree and is not a biennial plant but endures for many years as in the warm plains of Irak Arabia and some parts of Africa Biennial lasting for the space of two years only What are Melons A species of the Cucumis a genus of plants to which the cucumber belongs There are great varieties of this fruit cultivated in different parts of the world that sort called the Cantaleup so named from being cultivated at a place of that name in the neighborhood of Rome whither it was brought from Armenia is a species of musk melon the mature fruit is juicy and delicately flavored Where is Armenia situated Armenia is a large country situated in Asiatic Turkey to the west of the Caspian Sea What species of Melon is that which almost makes up for a scarcity of good water in hot countries The water melon which affords a cool refreshing juice and quenches the thirst produced by the excessive heats It requires a dry sandy soil and a warm climate the pulp of the fruit is remarkably rich and delicious What are Tamarinds The fruit of the Tamarind Tree a native of both the Indies Asia Africa c It is of a roundish form and composed of two pods inclosed one within the other between which is a soft pulpy substance of a tart but agreeable taste the inner pod contains the seeds or stones Tart sharp acid For what are they used We use them only as medicine but the Africans and many of the Oriental nations with whom they are common make them into a kind of preserve with sugar which they eat as a delicacy and which cools them in the violent heats of their climate From what nation was the knowledge of their use in medicine obtained From the Arabians What does the word Oriental signify Belonging to the East therefore those countries of the globe situated in the East are called Oriental those in the West Occidental from Oriens signifying East and Occidens West What are Dates The fruit of the Palm a beautiful and graceful tree peculiar to the warmer regions of the globe the growth of the palm is extremely singular for although some species attain to the height of the largest forest trees their structure differs materially from that of a tree properly so called The leaves of the young plant arise directly from the surface of the ground and there is no appearance of any stem for several years this stem once formed never increases in size the growth of the plant being always upward so that the stem itself is formed by the prior growth of the green portions of the palm Structure the manner of formation How often does this tree cast its circle of leaves Every year so that the number of years a palm has existed is known by the scars which are left by their falling off The palm is an evergreen What are the uses of this Tree The Palm is of the utmost importance to the inhabitants of the tropical regions the fruit and sap providing them with food the fibrous parts with clothing and the leaves forming the greater part of their slightly constructed huts the leaves of some species are formed into fans hats and parasols others are written on in the same manner that we write on paper artificial flowers are made of the pith of some the light and supple rattan walking cane is the slender shoot of another kind and solid and useful utensils are made of the shell of the cocoa nut The fibres of the Date Palm are formed into ropes and twine a liquor is drawn from the trunk called palm wine the trunks of the old trees furnish a hard and durable wood and even the nuts or stones of the fruit are useful for feeding cattle a wholesome flour is also made of the fruit when dried and reduced to powder Constructed put together Whence is its name derived From the Latin word palma a hand given to these productions of the vegetable world from the supposed resemblance of their broad leaves to the human hand The Date the fruit of the Date Palm derives its name from the Greek dactylus a finger from its mode of growing in clusters spreading out like the fingers of the hand The Palm sometimes forms impenetrable forests but more frequently is found in small groups of two or three or even singly beside springs and fountains of water affording a kindly shade to the thirsty traveller Impenetrable not easily penetrated or got through From what countries are Dates brought From Egypt Syria Persia Africa and the Indies Among the Egyptians and Africans they make a principal article of food Dates when ripe are of a bright coral red of an oblong form and possess a sharp biting taste they are usually gathered in autumn before being perfectly ripe CHAPTER IX HATS STOCKINGS SHOES GLOVES LEATHER FURS AND INK Of what are Hats made Of felt and wool Dress hats for men s wear were formerly made of beaver fur but the increasing scarcity of this article led to the introduction of silk plush as a substitute and the result is that beaver is entirely superseded and plush is used altogether They possess many advantages over the beaver hat as they are light glossy and durable Hats are also made of straw plaited and sewed together When did Hats come into general use The first mention made of hats is about the time of the Saxons but they were not worn except by the rich Hats for men were invented at Paris by a Swiss in fourteen oh four About the year fifteen ten they were first manufactured in London by Spaniards Before that time both men and women in England commonly wore close knitted woollen caps They appear to have become more common in the reign of Queen Elizabeth It is related that when Charles the Second made his public entry into Rouen in fourteen forty nine he wore a hat lined with red velvet surmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers from which entry or at least during his reign the use of hats and caps is to be dated and from that time they took the place of chaperons and hoods that had been worn before in France Where is Rouen In the province of Lower Seine in France it was formerly the capital of Normandy Describe the Castor or Beaver and its habits The Beaver has a broad flat tail covered with scales serving as a rudder to direct its motion in the water the toes of its hind feet are furnished with membranes after the manner of water fowl the fore feet supply the place of hands like those of the squirrel The Beaver has two kinds of hair of a light brown color one long and coarse the other short and silky The teeth resemble those of a rat or squirrel but are longer and admirably adapted for cutting timber or stripping off the bark from trees Membranes thin flexible expanded skins connecting the toes of water fowl and amphibious animals and thus enabling them to swim with greater ease Where do Beavers usually fix their habitations Their houses are always situated in the water they are composed of clay which they make into a kind of mortar with their paws these huts are of an oval figure divided into three apartments raised one above the other and erected on piles driven into the mud Each beaver has his peculiar cell assigned him the floor of which he strews with leaves or small branches of the pine tree The whole building is generally capable of containing eight or ten inhabitants On what does the Beaver feed Its food consists of fruit and plants and in winter of the wood of the ash and other trees The hunters and trappers in America formerly killed vast numbers for their skins which were in great demand as they were used in making hats but as the only use they are now put to is for trimming and for men s gloves and collars the demand has fallen off Of what are stockings made Of cotton silk or wool woven or knitted Anciently the only stockings in use were made of cloth or stuff sewed together but since the invention of knitting and weaving stockings of silk c the use of cloth has been discontinued From what country is it supposed that the invention of silk knitted stockings originally came From Spain in fifteen eighty nine The art of weaving stockings in a frame was invented by William Lee M A of saint John s College Cambridge England Explain the signification of M A Master of Arts a degree of honor conferred by the Universities What are Shoes A covering for the foot now usually made of leather In different ages and countries shoes have been made of various materials as raw skins rushes broom paper silk wool iron silver and gold What nation wore Shoes made of the bark of the papyrus The Egyptians The Turks always take off their shoes and leave them at the door when they enter Mosques or dwelling houses The same custom also prevails in other Eastern nations What is a Mosque A Mahomedan church or temple What is meant by Mahomedan Belonging to the religion of Mahomed the warrior and prophet of Arabia and Turkey who was its founder He was born at Mecca a city of Arabia in five hundred seventy one and died in six hundred thirty one at Medina a city situated between Arabia Felix and Arabia Deserta His creed maintains that there is but one God and that Mahomed is his Prophet it enjoins the observance of prayers washings almsgiving fasting sobriety pilgrimage to Mecca c What do the appellations of Felix and Deserta signify Arabia a country of Asia lying on the borders of the Red Sea is divided into Petraea Deserta and Felix Petraea signifying the Stony Deserta the Desert and Felix the fortunate or fruitful What is Leather The skins of various animals as oxen cows calves c dressed and prepared for use How is the Leather prepared By tanning that is steeping the skins in an infusion of tan by which they are rendered firm durable and in a great degree impervious to water Infusion a liquor made by steeping anything in water or other liquids without boiling What is Tan The bark of the oak tree c ground by a mill into a coarse powder What is Lime five A white soft friable earthy substance prepared from marble chalk and other lime stones or from shells by burning in a kiln Footnote five For a further account of it see Chapters XIII XVI Friable easily powdered For what is it used Its greatest use is in the composition of mortar for building it is also much used by tanners skinners c in the preparation of leather by soap boilers in the manufacture of soap and by sugar bakers for refining sugar What is a Kiln A fabric of brick or stone formed for admitting heat in order to dry or burn materials placed in it Of what are Gloves made Of leather silk thread cotton worsted c What skins are generally used for Gloves Those of the chamois kid lamb dog doe and many other animals What are Furs and how are they prepared Furs are the skins of wild animals dressed with the hair on and used as apparel either for warmth ornament or distinction of rank or dignity Name a few of the principal furs in use The fur of the ermine an animal inhabiting the cold regions of Europe and America is highly valued and much used for ornamental purposes In summer the upper part of the body is of a yellowish brown color the under parts white slightly tinged with yellow It is then called a stoat In winter the fur is closer and finer and is of a snowy white color the tip of the tail is black throughout the year In Europe the fur is much used for ornamenting the state robes of sovereigns and nobles The sable is another animal much prized for its rich fur it is a native of Northern Europe and America The skins of the marten found in North America as well as in Northern Asia and the mountains of Kamtschatka and also of the bear fox raccoon badger lynx musk rat rabbit hare and squirrel which are all procured in North America are valuable One of the most valuable descriptions of fur is that of the seal How is it procured By hunting the animals which is the employment both of natives and settlers from other countries the hunters sell the skins for money to a company established for the purpose of trading in furs or more frequently exchange them for clothes arms and other articles The Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco is granted by the United States Government the exclusive privilege of catching the fur seal What is Alum A kind of mineral of a strong sharp taste It dissolves both in cold and boiling water but best in the latter It is of some use in medicine a principal ingredient in dyeing and coloring neither of which can be well performed without it as it sets and brightens the colors and prevents them from washing out It is also extremely useful in many arts and manufactures Are there not different sorts of this material The principal kinds are native alums viz those prepared and perfected underground by the spontaneous operations of nature as the roch commonly called rock alum from Rocha in Syria whence it is brought Spontaneous unassisted by art Orientals inhabitants of the Eastern parts of the world What is Ink A liquor used in writing on paper or parchment made of copperas galls and gum arabic six mixed together There are likewise several plants that may serve for the making of ink as oak bark red roses log wood c It is also made from an infusion of oak galls and iron filings there are also many other ways as well as materials employed in the making of this useful article Ink is the name applied to all liquids used in writing of whatever color they may be as red blue c though black is the most used for common purposes The ink of the ancients seems to have been of a thick oily nature unlike the modern ink it consisted of nothing more than a species of soot or ivory black mixed with one fourth of gum Footnote six See Chapter XI What is Copperas A kind of vitriol Copperas is the name given to green vitriol which is a preparation from iron The blue vitriol is a sulphate of copper and the white vitriol a sulphate of zinc For what is Vitriol used In the making of glass to color it in many arts and manufactures and in medicine What are Galls Excrescences formed on a kind of oak tree in certain warm climates perforations are made by an insect into the bark of the tree whence issues a liquid which hardens by exposure They are used in dyeing making ink and other compositions There are two sorts of oak galls in our shops brought from the Levant and the southern parts of Europe What does the word Levant signify A country to the eastward It is applied to the countries of Turkey Greece Asia Minor Syria Egypt c which are washed by the eastern part of the Mediterranean Is the Ink used in Printing the same as writing Ink No it is more of the nature of paint being thicker and more glutinous it chiefly consists of a mixture of oil and lamp black or some other ingredient according to the color required and is remarkable for the ease with which it adheres to paper that is moistened Glutinous gummy resembling glue What is Indian or Chinese Ink An admirable composition not liquid like our ink but solid and made into cakes somewhat like the mineral colors we use in painting It is made into all sorts of figures usually long and about an inch thick sometimes gilt with the figures of birds flowers c To use this ink it must be rubbed with water on stone or earthenware till it produces a beautiful liquid shining black It is used in drawing c and is brought from China It is composed of lamp black and size or animal glue or gum to which perfumes and other substances are sometimes added CHAPTER X ASBESTUS SALT COAL IRON COPPER BRASS ZINC AND LAPIS CALAMINARIS What is the name of the remarkable stone of which a cloth has been made that resists the action of fire The Asbestus a mineral substance of a whitish or silver color There are several species of this mineral which are distinguished by different names according to the appearance of each as fibrous asbestus hard asbestus and woody asbestus it is the fibrous sort which is most noted for its uses in the arts It is usually found inclosed within very hard stones sometimes growing on their outside and sometimes detached from them Fibrous full of fibres or threads What are its qualities It is insipid will not dissolve in water and exposed to the fire it neither consumes nor calcines The industry of mankind has found a method of working upon this untoward mineral and employing it in making cloth and paper the process is however difficult Insipid without taste Was not this curious mineral better known to the ancients than it is at present The linen made from it was highly esteemed by them it was not only better known but more common than among us being equally valuable with the richest pearls but the superiority of all other cloths to this in every respect except the resistance to fire has caused incombustible cloth to be regarded in modern times merely as a curiosity but it is still employed in chemical preparations Incombustible remaining undestroyed in fire To what use did they put it In royal funerals it formed the shroud to wrap the body in that its ashes might be prevented from mingling with the wood c that composed the pile Some of the ancients made themselves clothes of it particularly the Brahmins among the Hindoos it formed wicks for their perpetual lamps thread ropes nets and paper were also made of it Pliny the Roman naturalist says he has seen napkins of asbestus taken soiled from the table after a feast which were thrown into the fire and by that means better scoured than if they had been washed with water Naturalist a person who studies nature especially in what relates to minerals vegetables and animals Brahmins Hindoo priests Where is the Asbestus found This mineral is found in the greatest quantity in the silver mines of Saxony at Bleyburg in Carinthia in Sweden Corsica and sometimes in France England and the United States also in Tartary and Siberia What method is used in preparing the Asbestus The stone is laid in warm water to soak then opened and divided by the hands that the earthy matter may be washed out This washing is several times repeated and the flax like filaments collected and dried these are easily spun with the addition of flax The cloth when woven is best preserved by oil from breaking or wasting on exposure to the fire the flax and the oil burn out and the cloth remains of a pure white The shorter threads which separate on washing the stone may be made into paper in the usual manner What is Salt A saline crystallization of a sharp pungent taste and cleansing quality used to season flesh fish butter c and other things that are to be kept It is distinguished with reference to the general sources from which it is most plentifully derived into three different sorts namely fossil or rock salt sea or marine salt and spring salt or that drawn from briny springs and wells Marine belonging to the sea Saline consisting of salt Briny consisting of brine which means water tasting of salt it is used to signify the waters of the sea or any salt water What is Fossil or Rock Salt That which is found in large beds in the bowels of the earth and which has not undergone any artificial preparation it is sometimes colorless but more frequently red yellow or blue and mixed with earthy impurities this salt was entirely unknown to the ancients who by rock salt meant that which adheres to the rocks above high water mark being lodged there by the spray of the sea which is evaporated by the heat of the sun this is the purest salt and is to be found on the rocks of Sicily and several islands of the West Indies Artificial produced by art and the labor of man Evaporated converted into vapor and dissipated What is Marine Salt That which is made from sea water concentrated by repeated evaporations and at length crystallized What is Spring Salt That salt which is not made from sea water but from the water of salt wells or springs large quantities of this salt are made in the United States in some parts of which saline springs are numerous In what manner is it obtained The means employed for extracting the salt from the water vary according to circumstances In hot countries the water is merely exposed to the action of the sun until the water is evaporated the salt procured in this manner is considered the best What method is usually employed in countries where the sun s heat is not sufficiently powerful In climates where the rays of the sun do not afford sufficient heat the water which has been partly evaporated in large shallow reservoirs formed in the earth called salt pans is poured into enormous coppers and boiled for four or five hours when the contents of the copper are wasted to half the quantity the liquid begins to be crystallized the vessel is again filled up and the brine again boiled and purified this is repeated three or four times After the last purifying the fire is kept very low for twelve or fourteen hours and when the moisture is nearly evaporated the salt is removed and after the remaining brine has drained off is placed in the store houses In what countries is Salt generally found This substance so necessary to the comfort of mankind is widely distributed over the face of the earth and nothing except perhaps the air we breathe is more easily placed within our reach The ocean is an exhaustless store house of this valuable article Those nations of the earth which are placed at a distance from the sea find themselves provided with magazines of salt either in solid masses or dissolved in the waters of inland lakes or issuing from the solid rocks in springs of brine At Salina Syracuse and other places in Onondaga company New York salt springs are remarkably abundant and yield annually several millions of bushels immense quantities are also obtained from the salt wells on the Great and Little Kanawha and other places in Western Virginia it is also extensively manufactured in the western part of Pennsylvania and throughout the Western States Name the countries most noted for mines of Salt Poland Upper Hungary and the mountains of Catalonia have extensive salt mines those in the village of Wieliczca in Poland about five leagues from Cracow are of a surprising depth and size In the interior of Hindostan there is a remarkable salt lake and in several parts of the globe there are spots of ground impregnated entirely with this substance an island of the East Indies contains a singular kind of fossil or native dry salt the soil there is in general very fruitful but in certain parts of the island there are spots of ground entirely barren without the appearance of anything vegetable upon them these spots taste very much of salt and abound with it in such quantities as to supply not only the whole island but the greater part of the adjacent continent In Utah Territory especially in the neighborhood of the Mormon city at the Great Salt Lake are found extensive plains thus impregnated with salt which is procured in great abundance Fossil the remains of minerals or shells dug from the earth Impregnated filled saturated Catalonia a considerable province of Spain situated to the north east Adjacent adjoining lying near or contiguous To what use did the ancient inhabitants of Africa and Arabia put this substance The large slabs of rock salt with which their country abounds were employed by them instead of stones in building their dwellings the pieces being easily cemented together by sprinkling the joints with water which melting the parts of the two surfaces that opposed each other formed the whole when dry into one solid block Does Rock Salt undergo any preparation before it is used Yes when taken from the earth it is dissolved in cold water and afterwards drawn off into salt pans and refined in the same manner as the sea salt What is Coal A hard black sulphurous and inflammable substance dug out of the earth serving in many countries as fuel It is common in most of the countries of Europe and America In some parts of the United States it is found in beds having an area of several thousand square miles From what is Coal supposed to have originated Its origin is supposed to be derived from gigantic trees which flourished in the swamps and forests of the primeval earth These having been torn away from their native bed by storms and inundations were transported into some adjacent lake river or sea Here they floated on the waters until saturated with them they sank to the bottom and being buried in the lower soil of adjacent lands became transformed into a new state among the members of the mineral kingdom A long interment followed during which a course of chemical changes and new combinations of their vegetable elements converted them to the mineral condition of coal Primeval original existing before the flood Gigantic extremely large greater than the usual size Interment burial under the ground Elements the several parts or principles of which bodies are composed What is a Coal Mine A subterraneous excavation from which coal is obtained Do the terms Coal and Charcoal signify the same substance No Charcoal is an artificial fuel made in imitation of coal by burning wood covered with earth so as partially to exclude the air It is used for various purposes as the making of gunpowder seven polishing brass and copper c and when a clear and bright fire is required as it burns with little or no smoke it is dangerous however for one to remain many hours in a close room with a charcoal fire as the fumes it throws out are hurtful and would destroy life Charcoal in fact is the coaly residuum of any vegetables burnt in close vessels but the common charcoal is that prepared from wood and is generally black very brittle light and destitute of taste or smell It is a powerful antiseptic unalterable and indestructible Footnote seven See Chapter XII Residuum the remaining part that which is left Antiseptic that which prevents putrefaction What is Iron One of the most useful and abundant metals being found in all mineral earths and stones in plants and animal fluids and is the chief cause of the varieties of color in all Iron is found in great masses in various states in the bowels of the earth it is usually however compounded with stone from which it is separated by the action of fire In some parts of the world whole mountains are formed of iron among these may be mentioned the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mountain in Missouri being unsurpassed by anything of the kind found elsewhere What are its characteristics It is hard fusible not very malleable but extremely ductile and very tenacious it is of a greyish color and nearly eight times heavier than water Without iron society could make no progress in the cultivation of the ground in mechanical arts or trades in architecture or navigation it is therefore of the greatest use to man Iron tools have been used in all European countries as long as their histories have existed this metal appears likewise to have been known and used by the inhabitants of the world in the earliest ages being frequently mentioned in the Holy Scriptures In the fourth chapter of Genesis Tubalcain is spoken of as a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron and thus their existence was evidently known at that early period of the world Artificer one who works or makes Fusible capable of being melted by fire Illustration THE SALT MINES OF WIELICZCA What do you mean by Metals Useful substances dug from the bowels of the earth being sometimes found pure but mostly combined with other matter They are distinguished by their weight tenacity hardness opacity color and peculiar lustre known as the metallic lustre they are fusible by heat and good conductors of heat and electricity many of them are malleable and some extremely ductile Those which were first known are gold silver iron copper mercury lead and tin Tenacity the firmness with which one part adheres to another Opacity want of transparency or clearness What are Metals called in their natural state Ores so named because the metal contained in them is either mixed with other metals or with mineral earths from which they are separated and purified by various means such as washing roasting c but the method is always regulated by the nature of the ore What is Copper A hard heavy ductile metal found native and in many ores of these the most important is copper pyrites which is a sulphuret of copper Next to gold silver and platinum copper is the most malleable and ductile of metals it may be drawn into wires as fine as hair or beaten into leaves as thin as those of silver The rust of copper is very poisonous Copper mixed with a certain quantity of tin forms bell metal With a smaller proportion it forms bronze a substance used in sculpture for casting figures and statues It is an abundant metal and is found in various parts of the world Native oxides of copper are found in Cornwall Siberia and in North and South America Oxide a substance combined with Oxygen eight in a proportion not sufficient to produce acidity Sulphuret a combination of sulphur with a base Footnote eight See Chapter XIII article Oxygen What are the uses of Copper They are too various to be enumerated In sheets it is much used to sheathe the bottoms of ships for boilers and other utensils Copper coin was the only money used by the Romans till the four hundred and eighty fifth year of their city when silver began to be coined In Sweden houses are covered with this metal What is a Mine A cavity under ground formed for the purpose of obtaining metals c mines are often very deep and extensive The descent into them is by a pit called a shaft the clues by which mines are discovered are mineral springs the discoloration of vegetables the appearance of pieces of ore c Clues signs or means by which things hidden are brought to light What is Brass A factitious metal consisting of copper and zinc Brass is lighter and harder than pure copper and less subject to rust owing to these properties together with its beautiful color it is extremely useful in the manufacture of many utensils Factitious made by art not found in a natural state What is Zinc A metal of a brilliant bluish white color Its name was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Arabians It is mixed with other substances in the ore from which it is obtained by smelting in the furnace It has never yet been found native or pure For what is Zinc used From its readiness to dissolve in all acids and unite with other metals it is used in alloy with them in the composition of brass c Thin sheets of zinc are also used to cover roofs of houses and in the manufacture of various household utensils What is Lapis Calaminaris Lapis Calaminaris or calamine stone is a native carbonate of zinc of some use in medicine but chiefly in founding It is sometimes brownish as that found in Germany and England or red as that of France It is dug out of mines usually in small pieces generally out of those of lead Calamine is mostly found in barren rocky soils Founding the art of casting metals CHAPTER XI YAMS MANGOES BREAD FRUIT SHEA OR BUTTER TREE COW TREE WATER TREE LICORICE MANNA OPIUM TOBACCO AND GUM What are Yams The roots of a climbing plant growing in tropical climates The root of the yam is wholesome and well flavored nearly as large as a man s leg and of an irregular form Yams are much used for food in those countries where they grow the natives either roast or boil them and the white people grind them into flour of which they make bread and puddings The yam is of a dirty brown color outside but white and mealy within What are Mangoes The fruit of the Mango Tree a native of India and the south western parts of Asia it also grows abundantly in the West Indies and Brazil It was introduced into Jamaica in seventeen eighty two where it attains the height of thirty or forty feet with thick and wide extended branches The varieties of the mango are very numerous upwards of eighty are cultivated and the quality of these varies according to the countries and situations in which they grow The mangoes of Asia are said to be much better than those of America Describe the appearance of the Mango Tree The flowers of this tree are small and whitish formed in pyramidal clusters The fruit has some resemblance to a short thick cucumber about the size of a goose s egg its taste is delicious and cooling it has a stone in the centre like that of a peach At first this fruit is of a fine green color and some varieties continue so while others change to a fine golden or orange color The mango tree is an evergreen bearing fruit once or twice a year from six or seven years old to a hundred Pyramidal resembling a pyramid How is this fruit eaten When ripe it is eaten by the natives either in its natural state or bruised in wine It is brought to us either candied or pickled as the ripe fruit is very perishable in the latter case they are opened with a knife and the middle filled up with fresh ginger garlic mustard salt and oil or vinegar The fruit of the largest variety weighs two pounds or upwards The several parts of this tree are all applied to some use by the Hindoos the wood is consecrated to the service of the dead from the flour of the dried kernels different kinds of food are prepared the leaves flowers and bark are medicinal Medicinal fit for medicine possessing medical properties Consecrated separated from a common to a sacred use Is there not a tree which bears a fruit that may be used for bread Yes the Bread fruit Tree originally found in the southeastern parts of Asia and the islands of the Pacific Ocean though introduced into the tropical parts of America It is one of the most interesting as well as singular productions of the vegetable kingdom being no less beautiful than it is useful This tree is large and shady its leaves are broad and indented like those of the fig tree from twelve to eighteen inches long rather fleshy and of a dark green The fruit when full grown is from six to nine inches round and of an oval form when ripe of a rich yellow tinge it generally hangs in clusters of two or three on a small thick stalk the pulp is white partly farinaceous and partly fibrous but when ripe becomes yellow and juicy Indented toothed like the edge of a saw Farinaceous mealy consisting of meal or flour from farina flour How is the Bread Fruit eaten It is roasted until the outside is of a brown color and crisp the pulp has then the consistency of bread which the taste greatly resembles and thus it forms a nourishing food it is also prepared in many different ways besides that just mentioned The tree produces three sometimes four crops in a year and continues bearing for fifty years so that two or three trees are enough for a man s yearly supply Its timber which at first is of a rich yellow but afterwards assumes the color of mahogany is used in the building of houses and canoes the flowers when dried serve as tinder the sap or juice serves for glue the inner bark is made by the natives of some of the islands of the Pacific Ocean into a kind of cloth and the leaves are useful for many purposes One species of the bread fruit called the Jaca tree grows chiefly on the mainland of Asia Mainland the continent Describe the Jaca Tree This kind grows to the same if not a larger size than the bread fruit of the islands but is neither so palatable nor so nutritious the fruit often weighs thirty pounds and contains two or three hundred seeds each four times as large as an almond December is the time when the fruit ripens it is then eaten but not much relished the seeds are also eaten when roasted There are also other trees in different parts of the world mostly of the palm species which yield bread of a similar kind Is there not a tree which produces a substance resembling the Butter which we make from the milk of the cow The Shea or Butter Tree a native of Africa it is similar in appearance to the American oak and the fruit from the kernel of which the butter is prepared is somewhat like an olive in form The kernel is inclosed in a sweet pulp under a thin green rind How is the Butter extracted The kernel being taken out and dried in the sun is boiled in water by which process a white firm and rich flavored butter is produced which will keep for a whole year without salt The growth and preparation of this commodity is one of the first objects of African industry and forms a principal article of their trade with one another You have given me an account of a useful Butter prepared from a plant is there not also a tree which can supply the want of a cow In South America there is a tree the juice of which is a nourishing milk it is called the Cow Tree This tree is very fine the leaves are broad and some of them ten inches long the fruit is rather fleshy and contains one or two nuts or kernels The milk is very abundant and is procured by incisions made in the trunk of the tree it is tolerably thick and of a glutinous quality a pleasant taste and agreeable smell The negroes and people at work on the farms drink it dipping into it their bread made of maize Glutinous having the quality of glue an adhesive gummy substance prepared from the skins of animals it is used in joining wood c and for many other purposes What time of the day is the best for drawing the juice Sunrise the blacks and natives then hasten from all quarters with large bowls to receive the milk some drink it on the spot others carry it home to their families What island possesses a remarkable substitute for the want of springs of Water Ferro one of the Canary Isles situated in the Atlantic Ocean In this island there is no water except on a part of the beach which is nearly inaccessible to supply the place of a fountain Nature has bestowed on the island a particular kind of tree unknown in other parts of the world It is of a moderate size with straight long evergreen leaves on its top a small cloud continually rests which so drenches the leaves with moisture that it perpetually distils upon the ground a stream of clear water To these trees as to perennial springs the inhabitants of Ferro repair and are supplied with abundance of water for themselves and cattle Perennial lasting through the year perpetual What is Licorice A plant the juice of which is squeezed from the roots and then boiled with sugar and used as a remedy for coughs c Great quantities are exported from Spain Italy c The dried root is of great use in medicine and makes an excellent drink for colds and other affections of the lungs by boiling it with linseed What are the Lungs The organs of respiration in man and many other animals There are two of these organs one on each side of the chest Respiration breathing the act of inhaling air into the lungs and again expelling it by which animal life is supported What is Manna A sweet white juice oozing from the branches and leaves of a kind of ash tree growing chiefly in the southern parts of Italy during the heats of summer When dry it is very light easily crumbled and of a whitish or pale yellow color not unlike hardened honey Is Manna peculiar to the Ash Tree of Southern Italy No Manna is nothing more than the nutritious juices of the tree which exude during the summer heats and what confirms this is that the very hot summers are always those which are most productive of manna Several different species of trees produce a kind of manna the best and most used is however that of Calabria in Italy What are its uses It was much esteemed formerly in medicine but it has now gone nearly into disuse The peasants of Mount Libanus eat it as others do honey The Bedouin Arabs consume great quantities considering it the greatest dainty their country affords In Mexico they are said to have a manna which they eat as we do cheese At Briancon in France they collect it from all sorts of trees that grow there and the inhabitants observe that such summers as produce the greatest quantities of manna are very fatal to the trees many of them perishing in the winter Is there not another tree which produces Manna Yes the Tamarisk a tree peculiar to Palestine and parts of Arabia This remarkable substance is produced by several trees and in various countries of the East On Mount Sinai there is a different species of Tamarisk that yields it It is found on the branches of the tree and falls on the ground during the heat of the day Where is Mount Libanus Mount Libanus or Lebanon is situated in Asiatic Turkey it was anciently famous for its large and beautiful cedar trees The Cedars of Lebanon are frequently mentioned in Holy Writ There are now scarcely any remaining of superior size and antiquity but they vary from the largest size down to mere saplings and their numbers seem to increase rather than diminish there being many young trees springing up How is Manna gathered From August to September the Italians collect it in the following manner viz by making an incision at the foot of the tree each day over that of the preceding about four inches from one another these cuts or incisions are nearly two inches long and half an inch deep When the cut is made the manna directly begins to flow at first like clear water but congealing as it flows it soon becomes firm this they collect in baskets Manna has been found to consist of two distinct substances one nearly resembling sugar the other similar to a gum or mucilage What nation was fed with a kind of Manna The Children of Israel when wandering in the desert wilderness where no food was to be procured were fed by a miraculous supply of manna showered down from Heaven every morning on the ground in such quantities as to afford sufficient food for the whole host What is Opium A narcotic gummy resinous juice drawn from the head of the white poppy and afterwards thickened it is brought over in dark reddish brown lumps which when powdered become yellow Narcotic producing sleep and drowsiness In what countries is it cultivated In many parts of Asia India and even the southern parts of Europe whence it is exported into other countries The Turks and other Eastern nations chew it With us it is chiefly used in medicine The juice is obtained from incisions made in the seed vessels of the plant it is collected in earthen pots and allowed to become sufficiently hard to be formed into roundish masses of about four pounds weight In Europe the poppy is cultivated mostly for the seeds Morphia and laudanum are medicinal preparations of opium What is Tobacco An herbaceous plant which flourishes in many temperate climates particularly in North America it is supposed to have received its name from Tabaco a province of Mexico it is cultivated in the West Indies the Levant on the coast of Greece in the Archipelago Malta Italy France Ceylon c It was not known in Europe till the discovery of America by the Spaniards and was carried to England about the time of Queen Elizabeth either by Sir Francis Drake or Sir Walter Raleigh Tobacco is either taken as snuff smoked in pipes or in the form of cigars or chewed in the mouth like opium There are many different species of this plant most of them natives of America some of the Cape of Good Hope and China Tobacco contains a powerful poison called nicotine Herbaceous like an herb or plant not a shrub or tree What part of the plant is used The leaves which are stripped from the plant and after being moistened with water are twisted up into rolls these are cut up by the tobacconist and variously prepared for sale or reduced into a scented powder called snuff Who was Sir Francis Drake Sir Francis Drake was a distinguished naval officer who flourished in the reign of Elizabeth He made his name immortal by a voyage into the South Seas through the Straits of Magellan which at that time no Englishman had ever attempted He died on board his own ship in the West Indies fifteen ninety five Who was Sir Walter Raleigh Sir Walter Raleigh was also an illustrious English navigator and historian born in fifteen fifty two He performed great services for Queen Elizabeth particularly in the discovery of Virginia and in the defeat of the Spanish Armada he lived in honor and prosperity during her reign but on the accession of James the First was stripped of his favor at court unaccountably accused of high treason tried and condemned to die being reprieved however he was imprisoned in the Tower of London many years during which time he devoted himself to writing and study Receiving at last a commission to go and explore the gold mines at Guiana he embarked but his design having been betrayed to the Spaniards he was defeated and on his return to England in July sixteen eighteen was arrested and beheaded by order of the King on his former attainder October twenty nine suffering his fate with great magnanimity High Treason in England means an offence committed against the sovereign In the United States it consists in levying war against the government adhering to its enemies and giving them aid and comfort Reprieved respited from sentence of death Magnanimity greatness of mind bravery What is Gum A mucilaginous juice exuding from the bark of certain trees or plants drawn thence by the warmth of the sun in the form of a glutinous matter and afterwards by the same cause rendered firm and tenacious There are many different gums named after the particular tree or plant from which they are produced Mucilaginous consisting of mucilage Tenacious adhering closely What is the character of Gum Gum is capable of being dissolved in water and forming with it a viscid transparent fluid but not in vinous spirits or oil it burns in the fire to a black coal without melting or catching fire and does not dissolve in water at boiling heat The name of gum has been inaccurately given to several species of gum resins which consist of resin and various other substances flowing from many kinds of trees and becoming hard by exposure to the air These are soluble in dilute alcohol Gum is originally a milky liquor having a greater quantity of water mixed with its oily parts and for that reason it dissolves in either water or oil Another sort is not oily and therefore dissolves in water only as gum Arabic the gum of the cherry tree c Viscid thick ropy Vinous having the qualities of wine Are the last mentioned sorts properly called Gums No though commonly called gums they are only dried mucilages which were nothing else than the mucilaginous lymph issuing from the vessels of the tree in the same manner as it does from mallows comfrey and even from the cucumber the vessels of which being cut across yield a lymph which is plainly mucilaginous and if well dried at length becomes a kind of gum or rather a hardened mucilage Lymph transparent fluid What is Gum Arabic The juice of a small tree of the Acacia tribe growing in Egypt Arabia Petraea Palestine and in different parts of America Are there other plants or trees which produce Gum besides those already mentioned A great number though not all commonly in use The leaves of rhubarb the common plum and even the sloe and the laurel produce a clear tasteless gum there are also a number of different gums brought from foreign countries of great use in medicine and the arts Most of the Acacias produce gums though the quality of all is not equally good What is Rhubarb A valuable root growing in China Turkey and Russian Tartary Quantities of it are imported from other parts of the world that from Turkey is esteemed the best Rhubarb is also cultivated in our gardens and the stalks of the leaves are often used in tarts but the root from the difference of climate does not possess any medicinal virtue CHAPTER XII SPECTACLES MARINER S COMPASS BAROMETER THERMOMETER WATCHES CLOCKS TELESCOPE MICROSCOPE GUNPOWDER STEAM ENGINE AND ELECTRO MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH When were Spectacles invented and who was their inventor It is supposed that they were first known about the thirteenth century and invented by a monk of Pisa in Italy named Alexander de Spina Spectacles are composed of two circular pieces of glass set in a frame What are these glasses called Lenses They are either convex or concave according to the kind of sight requiring them Old people and those who can only see things at a distance from the flatness of the eye which prevents the rays of light converging so as to meet in the centre require convex lenses People who can only distinguish objects when viewed closely from the eye being too convex require concave lenses to counteract it by spreading the rays and thus rendering vision distinct Convex rising outwardly in a circular form opposite to concave Concave hollow round but hollow as the inner curve of an arch c Converging tending to one point from different parts Vision the faculty of seeing What is the Mariner s Compass A most useful and important instrument by the aid of which the navigator guides his ship on the sea and steers his way to the place of his destination The inventor of the Mariner s Compass is not known nor the exact time of its introduction it was employed in Europe in navigation about the middle of the thirteenth century and has been in use more than five hundred years The Chinese are said to have been acquainted with it much earlier but no reliance can be placed on their dates The power of the loadstone to attract iron was known to the ancient Egyptians but it was not applied to any practical purpose Navigator one who guides a ship Steer to direct or guide a vessel in its course Destination the place to which a person is bound Practical capable of practice not merely speculative What is the Loadstone An ore of iron which possesses the peculiar property of attracting iron namely of drawing it in contact with its own mass and holding it firmly attached by its own power of attraction A piece of loadstone drawn several times along a needle or a small piece of iron converts it into an artificial magnet if this magnetized needle is carefully balanced it will turn round of itself till its end points towards the North The magnetized needle also possesses the power of attracting iron and of communicating this power to another piece of iron or steel similar to that of the loadstone itself Contact touch Magnetized rendered magnetic Describe the Mariner s Compass The Mariner s Compass consists of a circular box enclosing a magnetized bar of steel called the needle carefully balanced on an upright steel pivot and having that end which points to the North shaped like the head of an arrow attached to this needle and turning with it is a card on which are printed the divisions of North South East and West called the points of the compass By simply looking at the position of the needle the mariner can see the direction in which his vessel is sailing and regulate his helm accordingly Helm the instrument by which a ship is steered consisting of a rudder and tiller What is a Barometer An instrument for measuring the weight of the atmosphere which enables us to determine the changes of the weather the height of mountains c It consists of a glass tube hermetically sealed at one end filled with mercury and inverted in a basin of mercury according to the weight of the atmosphere this mercury rises or falls How is the Hermetic seal formed By heating the edges of a vessel till they are just ready to melt and then twisting them closely together with hot pincers so that the air may be totally excluded The word is taken from Hermes the Greek name for Mercury the heathen god of arts and learning and the supposed inventor of chemistry nine which is sometimes called the hermetical art or perhaps from Hermes an ancient king of Egypt who was either its inventor or excelled in it Footnote nine See Chapter XVIII article Chemistry What is Mercury Quicksilver or mercury is a white fluid metal the heaviest except platina and gold it readily combines with nearly all other metals and is used in the manufacture of looking glasses barometers thermometers c in some of the arts and in the preparation of several powerful medicines It is found in California Hungary Sweden Spain China and Peru The quicksilver mine of Guanca Velica in Peru is one hundred and seventy fathoms in circumference and four hundred and eighty deep In this profound abyss are seen streets squares and a chapel where religious worship is performed The quicksilver mines of Idria a town of Lower Austria have continually been wrought for more than three hundred years The vapor which is continually arising from the mercury is very hurtful to the miners who seldom survive many years Abyss a gulf a depth without bottom In what state is Mercury usually found Either native or in the form of ore it is often found mixed with silver but more frequently with sulphur in the form of sulphuret which is decomposed by distillation Running mercury is found in globules in America and is collected from the clefts of the rocks Mercury has the appearance of melted silver it is neither ductile nor malleable in this state it is a substance so volatile when heated that it may be evaporated like water it is always seen in a fluid state even in temperate climates as a very small portion of heat is sufficient to preserve its fluidity It is used to separate gold and silver from the foreign matter found with those metals Calomel a valuable medicine and vermilion a color are both preparations of mercury Globules small particles of matter having the form of a ball or sphere What is a Thermometer An instrument for measuring temperature It consists of a fine glass tube terminated at one end in a bulb usually filled with mercury which expands or contracts according to the degree of heat or cold On the scale of the Fahrenheit thermometer the freezing point of water is marked thirty two deg and the boiling point at two hundred twelve deg In both the Centigrade and the Reaumur scales the freezing point is at zero and the boiling point at one hundred deg in the Centigrade and at eighty deg in Reaumur s The invention of this instrument dates from about the close of the sixteenth century but it is not known by whom it was first brought into use Terminated finished ended When and by whom were Watches and Clocks invented Watches were invented about the year fifteen hundred but who was the inventor is disputed They were however of little value as time keepers before the application of the spiral spring as a regulator to the balance the glory of this excellent invention lies between doctor Hooke and M Huygens the English ascribing it to the former the Dutch French c to the latter Some assert that pocket watches were first made about fourteen seventy seven at Nuremberg in Germany The most ancient clock of which we possess any certain account was made in sixteen thirty four by Henry de Wycke a German artist it was erected in a tower of the palace of Charles V king of France The pendulum was applied by Huygens in sixteen fifty six What is a Pendulum A weight so suspended from a fixed point that it may easily swing backward and forward its oscillations are always performed in equal times provided the length of the pendulum and the gravity remain the same It is said that the idea of employing the pendulum for the measurement of time was first conceived by Galileo while a young man upon his observing attentively the regular oscillations of a lamp suspended from the roof of a church in Pisa It was not however till the time of Huygens that a method was devised of continuing its motions and registering the number of its oscillations Oscillation a swinging backward and forward Gravity the tendency of a body toward the centre of the earth Registering recording Illustration CHARCOAL BURNING Illustration GOLD MINERS WASHING ORE To whom is the invention of Gunpowder ascribed Most authors suppose it was invented by Bartholdus Schwartz a monk of Goslar a town of Brunswick in Germany about the year thirteen twenty it appears however that it was known much earlier in many parts of the world and that the famous Roger Bacon who died in twelve ninety two knew its properties but it is not certain that he was acquainted with its application to fire arms Who was Roger Bacon A learned Franciscan born at Ilchester England in twelve fourteen He studied at Oxford and afterwards became professor at that great University He was familiar with every branch of human knowledge but was especially distinguished for his extraordinary proficiency in the natural sciences To him we owe the invention of the telescope that of gunpowder is ascribed to him as stated above although we have no evidence to show whether he discovered its ingredients himself or whether he derived the knowledge from some ancient manuscripts Bacon suffered some from the ignorance of the age in which he lived many of his experiments being looked upon as magic He died at Oxford in the year twelve ninety four What is understood by Magic Magic is a term used to signify an unlawful and wicked kind of science depending as was pretended on the assistance of superhuman beings and of departed souls The term was anciently applied to all kinds of learning and in particular to the science of the Magi or Wise Men of Persia from whom it was called magic Natural magic is no more than the application of natural active causes to passive things or subjects to produce effects apparently supernatural Supernatural beyond the powers of nature miraculous Of what is Gunpowder composed Of saltpetre ten sulphur and charcoal mixed together and powdered its explosive force when fired is owing to the instantaneous and abundant liberation of gaseous matter by the intense heat resulting from the action of the combustibles upon the saltpetre It is not known by whom it was first applied to the purposes of war but it is certain that it was used early in the fourteenth century Cannons were used at the battle of Cressy in thirteen forty six small guns or muskets were introduced into the Spanish army in fifteen twenty one Footnote ten See Chapter XIII Explosive bursting out with violence and noise Liberation a setting at liberty Is not Gunpowder highly combustible So combustible is gunpowder that a single spark of fire lighting upon any of it will cause it to explode with immense force and instances have occurred when any store or magazine of it has taken fire that have been attended with the most fatal effects It is useful to the miner and engineer as a ready means of overcoming the obstacles which are presented in their search for mineral treasures and in procuring materials for building From many passages in the ancient authors there is reason to suppose that gunpowder or a composition extremely like it was known to them but it does not appear to have been in general use and the invention of fire arms is comparatively modern Dynamite a recent invention has a still greater explosive force than gunpowder Engineer one who works or directs an engine Obstacles hinderances obstructions What is Saltpetre A bitter kind of salt called by the ancients nitre but more commonly among us saltpetre It is composed of nitric acid and potassa eleven It is found in earthy substances sometimes native or pure in the form of a shapeless salt Vast quantities are found in several of the marly earths of the East Indies China Persia and also in South America In India it is found naturally crystallized and forming thin crusts upon the surface of the earth It is especially abundant in the United States being found in immense quantities in the limestone caves in the south western States Footnote eleven See Potash Chapter VII article Glass What do you mean by Marly Consisting of marl a kind of earth composed of different proportions of clay and carbonate of lime it is much used for manure There are several different colored marls each possessing different qualities The most common are the red and the white though there are grey brown blue and yellow colored marls What is a Telescope An optical instrument which serves for discovering and viewing distant objects either directly by glasses or by reflection The invention of the telescope is one of the noblest and most useful of which modern ages can boast since by means of this instrument the wonderful motions of the planets and fixed stars and all the heavenly bodies are revealed to us The honor of the invention is much disputed it is certain however that the celebrated Galileo was the first who improved the telescope so as to answer astronomical purposes The name is formed from two Greek words one signifying far the other to observe Optical relating to Optics the science of vision Astronomical relating to Astronomy Who was Galileo A most eminent astronomer and mathematician born at Florence in Italy His inventions and discoveries in Astronomy Geometry and Mechanics contributed much to the advancement of those sciences He died in sixteen forty two Astronomer one versed in Astronomy Mathematician one versed in Mathematics a science which treats of magnitude and number What is Astronomy twelve That science which teaches the knowledge of the heavenly bodies with the nature and causes of their various phenomena Footnote twelve See Chapter xviii What is Geometry An ancient perfect and beautiful science which treats of the relations and properties of lines surfaces and solids What is meant by Mechanics The science which investigates the laws of forces and powers and their action on bodies either directly or by machinery When the term mechanic is applied to a person it means one skilled in mechanics accustomed to manual labor Investigate to search to inquire into Manual performed by the hand What is a Microscope An optical instrument by means of which very minute objects are represented exceedingly large and viewed very distinctly according to the laws of refraction or reflection Nothing certain is known respecting the inventor of microscopes or the exact time of their invention but that they were first used in Germany about sixteen twenty one Minute small diminutive Refraction a change in the direction of a ray of light when it passes through transparent substances of different densities Reflection a turning back of a ray of light after striking upon any surface What is the Steam Engine A machine that derives its moving power from the force of the steam produced from boiling water which is very great especially when as in the steam engine it is confined within a limited compass this useful machine is one of the most valuable presents that the arts of life have received from the philosopher and is of the greatest importance in working mines supplying cities with water in working metals in many mechanical arts and in navigation By the aid of steam vessels are propelled with greater swiftness than those which are wholly dependent on the winds and tides and thus trade is facilitated and we are enabled to communicate with distant lands in a much shorter space of time than was formerly consumed On land railroads are constructed on which steam carriages run with astonishing rapidity so that a journey which by coach and horses formerly required two or more days may now be performed in four or five hours Mechanical belonging to Mechanics To whom are we indebted for its invention Its invention is by most writers ascribed to the Marquis of Worcester an Englishman about sixteen sixty three but it does not appear that the inventor could ever interest the public in favor of this or his other discoveries The steam engine of Captain Savery also an Englishman is the first of which any definite description has been preserved It was invented in sixteen ninety eight Since that period it has been successively improved by various persons but it is to mister Watt and mister Boulton of England that it is indebted for much of its present state of perfection By whom was the Steam Engine first applied to the purposes of Navigation By John Fitch of Pennsylvania From papers in the historical collections of Pennsylvania it appears that the first successful experiments were made at Philadelphia in seventeen eighty five three years before the attempts at Falkirk and on the Clyde in Scotland The boat made several trips on the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers but owing to repeated accidents to her machinery and the want of funds and competent mechanics for the necessary repairs she was abandoned In eighteen oh seven Robert Fulton also of Pennsylvania made his first experimental trip on the Hudson River with complete success To this distinguished and ingenious American justly belongs the honor of having brought navigation by steam to a state of perfection In eighteen nineteen the first steamship crossed the Atlantic from Savannah to Liverpool and in eighteen thirty eight a regular communication by steamship was established between Great Britain and the United States Since that period ocean navigation by steam vessels has made rapid progress and at the present time numbers of steamers connect our various seaports with those of other nations and with each other What is the Electro Magnetic Telegraph An instrument or apparatus by means of which intelligence is conveyed to any distance with the velocity of lightning The electric fluid when an excess has accumulated in one place always seeks to transfer itself to another until an equilibrium of its distribution is fully restored Consequently when two places are connected by means of a good conductor of electricity as for instance the telegraphic wire the fluid generated by a galvanic battery if the communication be rendered complete instantaneously traverses the whole extent of the wire and charges at the distant station an electro magnet this attracts one end of a lever and draws it downward while the other extremity is thrown up and by means of a style marks a slip of paper which is steadily wound off from a roller by the aid of clock work If the communication is immediately broken only one wave of electricity passes over and a dot is made upon the paper if kept up a line is marked These dots and lines are made to represent the letters of the alphabet so that an operator employed for the purpose can easily read the message which is transmitted The Electro Magnetic Telegraph was first introduced upon a line between Baltimore and Washington by Professor Morse in eighteen forty four at the present time it is in successful operation between nearly all the important cities and towns of the United States and of Europe An Electro Magnet is a piece of soft iron rendered temporarily magnetic by being placed within a coil of wire through which a current of electricity is passing CHAPTER XIII SOAP CANDLES TALLOW TREE SPERMACETI WAX MAHOGANY INDIAN RUBBER OR CAOUTCHOUC SPONGE CORAL LIME CARBON OXYGEN NITROGEN GAS HYDROGEN CHALK AND MARBLE Of what is Soap composed Of soda or potash and various oily substances it is so useful for domestic and other purposes that it may be regarded as one of the necessaries of life immense quantities of it are consumed in all civilized countries Soft soap is generally made of a lye of wood ashes and quicklime boiled up with tallow or oil common household soap of soda and tallow or of potash and tallow when potash is used a large portion of common salt which contains soda is added to harden it The finest white soaps are made of olive oil and a lye consisting of soda and quicklime perfumes are sometimes added or various coloring matters stirred in to give the soap a variegated appearance The ancient Greeks and Hebrews appear to have been acquainted with the art of making soap or a composition very similar to it and also the ancient Gauls and Germans A soap boiler s shop with soap in it was found in the city of Pompeii in Italy which was overwhelmed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius A D seventy nine What is Soda Soda or barilla is obtained from the ashes of marine plants and by the decomposition of common salt its great depository is the ocean soda being the basis of salt The marine plants from which the soda is obtained are endowed with the property of decomposing the sea salt which they imbibe and of absorbing the soda which it contains It is found native in Egypt and is there called natron a name similar to that which it bore among the Jews and Greeks Depository store house place where anything is lodged Imbibe to drink in to absorb Of what are Candles made Of Tallow which means animal fat melted and clarified that is cleansed or purified from filth Tallow is procured from many animals but the most esteemed and the most used is that made from oxen sheep swine goats deer bears c some of which tallows or fats are used in medicine some in making soap and dressing leather others in the manufacture of candles c For the last mentioned article that of sheep and oxen is most used candles of a better sort are likewise made of wax and spermaceti Candles are kept burning by means of a wick of cotton or rush placed in the centre of the tallow which is moulded into a cylindrical form Cylindrical having the form of a cylinder Is there not a tree which yields a vegetable Tallow Yes China possesses a tree producing a substance like our tallow of which the Chinese make their candles this tallow is extracted from the stone of the fruit the tallow being a white pulp which surrounds it In America likewise there is a shrub a native of the temperate parts especially towards the sea side the seeds of which contain a waxy substance used for the same purpose and which is extracted by boiling this shrub is a species of myrtle and does not attain to any great size Extracted drawn from What is Spermaceti A whitish flaky unctuous substance prepared from an oil of the same name drawn from a particular kind of whale distinguished from the common whale by having teeth and a hunch on its back Flaky having the nature of flakes What is Wax A soft yellow concrete matter collected from vegetables by the bee of which this industrious and useful insect constructs its cell Wax forms a considerable article of trade it is of two kinds the yellow and the white the yellow is the native wax as it is taken from the hive and the white is the same washed purified and exposed to the air Concrete grown together solid What Tree produces the beautiful and well known wood so much used in making the various articles of household furniture The Mahogany Tree growing in America and the East and West Indies it frequently grows in the crevices of rocks and other places of the same description This wood was not used for making furniture till near the end of the seventeenth century A London physician had a brother the captain of a West India ship who on his return to England having on board several logs of mahogany for the purpose of ballast made him a present of the wood he being engaged in a building project his carpenter however threw it aside observing that it was too hard to be wrought Some time after the lady of the physician being in want of a box to hold candles the cabinet maker was directed to make it of this wood he also made the same objection and declared that it spoiled his tools Being urged however to make another trial he at length succeeded when the box was polished the beautiful color of the wood was so novel that it became an object of great curiosity Before this time mahogany had been used partially in the West Indies for ship building but this new discovery of its beauty soon brought it into general use for making furniture Crevice a rent a crack Ballast the heavy matter placed in the hold of a vessel to keep it steady What is India Rubber or Caoutchouc An elastic resinous substance produced from a tree growing abundantly at Cayenne Quito and other parts of South America and also in some parts of the Indies The tree which produces it is large straight and about sixty feet high There is however a small species found in Sumatra and Java and some of the neighboring islands How is the Caoutchouc obtained from the Tree By making incisions in the trunk of the tree from which the fluid resin issues in great abundance appearing of a milky whiteness at first but gradually becoming of a dark reddish color soft and elastic to the touch To what use is this substance put The Indians make of it boots shoes bottles flambeaux and a species of cloth Amongst us it is combined with sulphur forming the vulcanized rubber of commerce which is used for many purposes A greater proportion of sulphur produces vulcanite a hard black substance resembling jet Flambeaux torches burnt to give light What is Sponge A marine substance found adhering to rocks and shells under the sea water or on the sides of rocks near the shore Sponge was formerly imagined by some naturalists to be a vegetable production by others a mineral or a collection of sea mud but it has since been discovered to be the fabric and habitation of a species of worm or polypus What do you mean by Polypus A species of animals called Zoophytes by which are meant beings having such an admixture of the characteristics of both plants and animals as to render it difficult to decide to which division they properly belong They are animal in substance possessed indeed of a stomach but without the other animal characteristics of blood vessels bones or organs of sense these creatures live chiefly in water and are mostly incapable of motion they increase by buds or excrescences from the parent zoophyte and if cut off will grow again and multiply each part becoming a perfect animal Myriads of the different species of zoophytes reside in small cells of coral sponge c or in forms like plants and multiply in such numbers as to create rocks and whole islands in many seas by their untiring industry Polypus signifies having many feet or roots it is derived from the Greek Myriads countless numbers Whence are the best and greatest number of Sponges brought From the Mediterranean especially from Nicaria an island near the coast of Asia the collection of sponges forms in some of these islands the principal support of their inhabitants They are procured by diving under water an exercise in which both men women and children are skilled from their earliest years The fine small sponges are esteemed the best and usually come from Constantinople the larger and coarser sorts are brought from Tunis and Algiers on the coast of Africa Sponge is very useful in the arts as well as for domestic purposes What is Coral A substance which like sponge was considered as a vegetable production until about the year seventeen twenty when a French gentleman of Marseilles commenced and continued for thirty years a series of observations and ascertained that the coral was a living animal of the Polypus tribe The general name of zoophytes or plant animals has since been applied to them These animals are furnished with minute glands secreting a milky juice this juice when exuded from the animal becomes fixed and hard Series a course or continued succession Glands vessels Exuded from exude to flow out Is this substance considered by naturalists as the habitation of the Insect Not merely as the habitation but as a part of the animal itself in the same manner that the shell of a snail or an oyster is of those animals and without which they cannot long exist By means of this juice or secretion the coral insects at a vast but unknown depth below the surface of the sea attach themselves to the points and ridges of rocks which form the bottom of the ocean upon which foundation the little architects labor building up by the aid of the above mentioned secretion pile upon pile of their rocky habitations until at length the work rises above the sea and is continued to such a height as to leave it almost dry when the insects leave building on that part and begin afresh in another direction under the water Huge masses of rocky substances are thus raised by this wonderful little insect capable of resisting the tremendous power of the ocean when agitated to the highest pitch by winds or tempests Architect one who builds How do these Coral Rocks become Islands After the formation of this solid rocky base sea shells fragments of coral and sea sand thrown up by each returning tide are broken and mixed together by the action of the waves these in time become a sort of stone and thus raise the surface higher and higher meanwhile the ever active surf continues to throw up the shells of marine animals and other substances which fill up the crevices between the stones the undisturbed sand on its surface offers to the seeds of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves a soil upon which they rapidly grow and overshadow the dazzling whiteness of the new formed land Trunks of trees washed into the sea by the rivers from other countries and islands here find a resting place and with these come some small animals chiefly of the lizard and insect tribe Even before the trees form a wood the sea birds nestle among their branches and the stray land bird soon takes refuge in the bushes At last man arrives and builds his hut upon the fruitful soil formed by the corruption of the vegetation and calls himself lord and master of this new creation Surf the white spray or froth of the sea waves Where is the Coral Insect found In nearly all great seas but particularly in the Mediterranean where it produces Corallines of the most beautiful forms and colors it is in the Pacific Ocean however where these tiny workmen are effecting those mighty changes which exceed the most wonderful works of man What is that part of the Pacific called where the Coral Rocks are most abundant The Coral Sea from the number of coral reefs and sunken islands with which it abounds it includes a region of many miles in extent the whole of which is studded with numberless reefs rocks islands and columns of coral continually joining and advancing towards each other All navigators who have visited these seas state that no charts or maps are of any service after a few years owing to the number of fresh rocks and reefs which are continually rising to the surface The wonderful instinct of these animals leads them to continue working without ceasing until their labors are finished or their lives extinct Reef a chain or line of rocks lying near the surface of the water Extinct at an end dead What are the names of the principal islands of Coral formation The New Hebrides the Friendly Isles the Navigator s Isles the Society Islands the Marquesas the Gambier group and others These groups are separated from each other by channels or seas wider than those which divide the individual islands which form the respective groups but all these waters abound with shoals and minor islets which point out the existence of a common base and show that the work by which they will afterwards be united above the level of the sea is continually going forward Shoals shallows places where the water is of little depth Minor less smaller than others Existence being What is a singular characteristic of the Coral Islands On all of them a plentiful supply of sweet and fresh water may be obtained by digging three or four feet into the coral and even within one yard of high water mark such a supply is to be found They are mostly covered with a deep rich soil and well wooded with trees and evergreens of different kinds These islands vary in extent as well as in the degree of finish to which they have arrived some of the largest being about thirty miles in diameter and the smallest something less than a mile all of various shapes and all formed of living coral Diameter a straight line through the middle of a circle Is Coral put to any use by man White Coral which is nowhere so abundant as about the shores of Ceylon and others of the neighboring Indian coasts is employed as lime by the inhabitants of that part of the world for building houses c by burning it after the manner of our lime This coral lies in vast banks which are uncovered at low water Coral particularly the beautiful red sort is likewise made into various ornaments as necklaces c Of what is our Lime composed Of a useful earth which absorbs moisture and carbonic acid and exists as limestone or in marble and chalk which when burnt become lime in its native state it is called carbonate of lime and is burnt to disengage the carbonic acid when made into a paste with one part water and three parts lime thirteen and mixed with some other mineral or metallic substances it forms plastic cements and mortars and afterwards imbibing carbonic acid from the atmosphere it becomes again carbonate of lime as hard as at first and hence its use in building Footnote thirteen See Chapter XVI article Lime Plastic yielding capable of being spread out or moulded What do you mean by Carbon A simple substance whose most common form is purified charcoal it is in fact the base of charcoal divested of all impurities combined with oxygen it forms carbonic acid gas formerly called fixed air It is diffused through all animal and vegetable bodies and may be obtained by exposing them to a red heat In its pure crystallized state it constitutes the diamond and as graphite is used in making the so called lead pencils fourteen Footnote fourteen See Chapter XIV article Diamond What is Oxygen Air mentioned in the first chapter of this work as the gaseous substance which composes the atmosphere is formed by a mixture of two distinct elements one called Nitrogen or Azote the other Oxygen Oxygen is therefore an element or simple substance diffused generally through nature and its different combinations are essential to animal life and combustion It is in fact the most active agent in nature and the principle of acidity and combustion So wholesome and necessary is oxygen to life that it is often called vital air Agent an actor a person or thing possessing the faculty of action Essential necessary What are the properties of Nitrogen or Azote Nitrogen is a substance also generally diffused through nature and particularly in animal bodies and causes great changes in those absorbing or exposed to it This gas combined with oxygen and hydrogen produces neither light heat nor combustion but serves to dilute the others of itself it is hurtful to animal life Nitrogen makes the principal part of the salt we call nitre What is meant by Combustion The decomposition of bodies by the action of fire the union of combustible bodies with the oxygen of the atmosphere The greater access the air has to a burning body the more rapid and complete is the process Combustible capable of taking fire Access the means or liberty of approach to anything Are all bodies equally combustible No some are more so than others and burn with a bright flame as wood dry vegetables resins oils fats c others with difficulty and without any sensible flame as soot coal the ashes of plants c There are bodies also which are incombustible that is incapable of taking fire as some alkalies earths c What is Caloric Caloric is that invisible agent which produces the sensation of heat It exists in all bodies it is a force we are ever in want of and thus it is hid in everything around us and penetrates all matter however different may be its nature or properties What is meant by Gas All highly elastic fluids are called gases Some are salutary but many extremely noxious especially such as those arising from the putrefaction of animal bodies the burning of charcoal corrupted air at the bottom of mines cellars c The inflammable gas which lights our streets churches shops c is procured chiefly from coal burnt in furnaces for the purpose the gas being passed through metal pipes conveyed underground to the places where the light is required escaping at the orifice prepared for it it is lighted when wanted and burns with a brilliant flame This gas consists of hydrogen and carbon and the oxygen of the air combined with the hydrogen causes light as long as hydrogen and oxygen exist and combine Salutary wholesome healthful Noxious hurtful unwholesome Putrefaction decay Orifice opening hole Illustration DIAMOND CUTTING AND POLISHING What is Hydrogen One of the most abundant principles in nature one part of it and eight of oxygen form water It is only met with in a gaseous form it is also very inflammable and is the gas called the fire damp so often fatal to miners it is the chief constituent of oils fats spirits c and is produced by the decomposition of water Constituent that which forms an essential part of anything What is Chalk A white fossil substance by some reckoned a stone but of a friable kind which cannot therefore be polished as marble by others more properly ranked among the earths It is of two sorts one a hard dry chalk used for making lime the other a soft unctuous kind used in manuring land c Chalk always contains quantities of flint stone and the fossil remains of shells coral animal bones marine plants c from which circumstance there can be no doubt that chalk is the deposited mud of a former ocean The chemical name of chalk is carbonate of lime It effervesces strongly with an acid Effervesce to froth or foam up Deposited placed on anything Where is Chalk found In large beds or strata in the earth Chalk on account of its abundance in England forms an important feature in the scenery and geology of that country it causes the whiteness of its sea cliffs Scotland and Wales are entirely without chalk The white chalk is found with interruptions over a space above eleven hundred miles long extending from the north of Ireland through England France Belgium Germany Poland and Southern Russia to the Crimea with a breadth of more than eight hundred miles The Island of Crete now called Candia situated in the Mediterranean was formerly noted for its chalk This substance is very useful in many of the arts and manufactures Where is the Crimea The peninsula of the Crimea is a part of Russia lying on the Black Sea by which it is bounded on the west and south Are there any other kinds of this earth besides the common white chalk Yes there are various kinds of chalk distinguished by their different colors as white black red c found in various parts of the world of great use to the painter both in oil and water colors and for drawing on paper c What is Marble A kind of stone remarkable for its hardness and firm grain and for being susceptible of the finest polish It is dug in great masses from pits or quarries and is much used in ornamental buildings and for statues altars tombs chimney pieces c The word is derived from the French marbre marble Marble is supposed to be formed deep within the bowels of the earth from a loose and porous carbonate of lime subjected to enormous heat and pressure Susceptible easily admitting anything additional Porous full of holes or interstices Are there different sorts of this Stone Marbles are of many different kinds usually named either from their color or country some of one simple color as white or black others streaked or variegated with different colors They are classified as ancient and modern the ancient are those found in quarries now lost or inaccessible to us and of which there are only some wrought pieces remaining the modern those from quarries still open and out of which blocks of marble continue to be taken In what countries is Marble found The United States Great Britain France Spain Italy Africa Egypt and many other countries produce marbles of different colors and qualities some more beautiful valuable and more highly esteemed than others as those of Egypt Italy c Those also of different places in the same country frequently differ from each other in quality and appearance Of the European marbles that of Italy is the most valuable What kind appears to have been held in the greatest esteem by the ancients A beautiful white marble called the Parian of which the Grecian statues were mostly made By some it is supposed to have taken its name from the Isle of Paros in the Mediterranean but by others from Parius a famous statuary who made it celebrated by cutting in it a statue of Venus Parian marble is often mentioned by ancient authors Statues figures of men animals c cut in stone or marble Statuary one who makes statues Who was Venus The goddess of love and beauty who was an object of adoration in the idolatrous ages when men ignorantly knelt down and worshipped stocks and stones which their own hands had fashioned after the likeness of things on the earth or imaginary creations of their fancy or again the sun moon and stars instead of the one and only true God In those times every nation had its peculiar deities to whom were paid divine rites and honors and to whose names costly temples were dedicated these deities were divided into two classes superior and inferior Venus was one of the Grecian goddesses supposed by them to have sprung from the froth of the sea Kings and celebrated warriors and sages too after death frequently received divine honors as Confucius the founder of the Chinese empire who after death was worshipped by that people as a god Romulus the first king of Rome likewise was thus adored by the Romans and many similar instances of the same species of idolatry amongst other nations might be recorded Deities fabulous gods or goddesses Idolatrous given to the worship of idols Superior higher in rank Inferior of a lower rank Sage a wise man CHAPTER XIV GOLD SILVER LEAD TIN PLATINA SULPHUR GEMS OR PRECIOUS STONES AS DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS TURQUOIS PEARLS MOTHER OR PEARLS AND IVORY What is Gold The purest and most precious of metals it is sometimes found in solid masses as in California Peru Hungary c in a shape resembling the branches of plants in thin plates covering other bodies as in Siberia sometimes in a crystal form It however generally occurs in a metallic state and most commonly in the form of grains What is it called when found in a perfect metallic form Native gold it is however seldom met with perfectly pure being frequently alloyed with silver copper iron or platina sometimes concealed in other minerals from which if sufficiently abundant it is extracted by art Where and in what manner is Gold generally found All parts of the earth afford gold though with great difference in point of purity and abundance It is chiefly obtained from mines Many rivers contain gold in their sands especially those of California and Guinea Gold mines are of rare occurrence in Europe but the metal is found in some of its rivers among its mines those of Upper Hungary are the most considerable China and Japan are rich in this metal many parts of Asia also possess it Australia produces quantities of the metal It is also found in the eastern parts and interior of Africa where gold dust is collected in great quantities from earth deposited by the rivers But it is in America that gold is found in the greatest abundance particularly in the State of California and in some parts of South America as Brazil Peru Chili c Guinea a country of Western Africa What are the uses of Gold It is used for money jewelry plate c It is also employed in various ways in the arts What is the character of Gold Gold is so ductile and malleable that an ounce of it may be drawn into a thread of seventy three leagues in length or beaten into one hundred sixty leaves of nine inches square and thin enough to be carried away by the slightest wind It readily assumes any form that human art can bestow upon it its color is unalterable and the beautiful polish of which it is susceptible renders it the best of all metals for ornamental purposes It is indestructible by air water or fire Gold is the heaviest of all metals except platina it is neither very elastic nor very hard League a measure of length containing three miles Indestructible incapable of being destroyed Is not the use of Gold quite ancient Yes it appears to have been very early known to the inhabitants of the world In the thirteenth Chapter of Genesis Abram is spoken of as very rich in silver and gold and in the twod Chapter of the same book the land of Hevilath now in the eastern part of Arabia Felix is pointed out as having gold Arabia was famed for the fineness and quality of its gold In the time of Solomon the gold of Ophir seems to have been much esteemed as it is recorded that the gold used in the building of the Temple was brought from that place by the merchant vessels of Hiram King of Tyre Ophir is supposed to have been situated somewhere in the East Indies What is Silver A beautiful white shining metal next to gold in value and like that precious substance of great antiquity It is found in Sweden Norway and the polar latitudes when it occurs in hot climates it is generally amidst mountains covered with perpetual snow Latitude breadth width in Geography the distance of a place in degrees north or south from the Equator Where are the richest Silver Mines found In South America especially among the Andes the mines of Mexico and those of Nevada also are rich in this metal The richest and most important silver mines in Europe are those of Koenigsberg in Norway and of Andalusia in Spain With the exception of gold silver is the most ductile of all metals a single grain may be extended into a plate one hundred twenty six inches long and half an inch broad It is capable of still further extension but its tenacity is inferior even to that of iron or copper A silver wire one tenth of an inch thick will scarcely bear a weight of two hundred ninety pounds whilst a gold wire of the same thickness will support nearly double that weight Like some other metals it is unalterable by air or moisture but by an intense heat may be volatilized being sometimes found in the soot of chimneys where large quantities are melted Volatilized made to fly off by evaporation In what state is Silver usually found It is rarely found in a state of purity being generally mixed with other metals as gold lead c Masses of native silver are of no determinate form being found sometimes in small branches sometimes in threads or very frequently in leaves as in the Siberian mines Native or pure silver is chiefly found in the mines of Potosi Silver was used as money in commerce eleven hundred years before the foundation of Rome Commerce trade of one nation with another or different persons c with each other What is Tin A white metal softer than any other excepting lead more elastic and more sonorous Though tin is the lightest of all metals its ore is when rich the heaviest of all metallic ores It has both smell and taste is less ductile than some harder metals though it may be beaten into very thin leaves and it fuses so quickly that it requires a heat much less than is sufficient to make it red hot Was not the use of Tin very early known Tin was found in Britain from the earliest ages the Phenicians traded to Cornwall for this metal six hundred years before Christ Where are the principal Tin Mines In Saxony Cornwall and Bohemia Tin is also found in Spain Sumatra Siam Mexico and Chili A few specimens have been found at Goshen in Massachusetts Specimens samples In what state is Tin generally found Tin is sometimes found native or pure but most frequently alloyed with other metals the working of tin mines is attended with much difficulty on account of their great depth and the hard rocks which obstruct the progress of the miners who are often obliged to cut through them This metal is very useful in the making of domestic utensils for coating the inside of copper and iron vessels and for various other purposes Obstruct to stand in the way What is Lead A coarse heavy metal of a bluish grey color it is so soft and flexible that it is easily cut with a knife and rolled out into sheets c it is very fusible and inelastic but less ductile and sonorous than any other metal Next to gold platina and mercury it is the heaviest of the metals being eleven times heavier than an equal bulk of water This metal loses its malleability in proportion as it is heated as soon as it melts it calcines and greyish colored ashes are formed on its surface when returning from a fluid to a solid state it is easily divided into small grains or powder or formed into shot c Lead was in common use among the ancients Flexible yielding easily bent Sonorous giving sound when struck Where is Lead found In various countries but it abounds principally in Great Britain and Spain the lead mines of Illinois Wisconsin and Iowa are among the richest in the world Lead is a metal of great utility it easily melts and mixes with gold silver and copper hence it is employed in refining gold and silver as it separates all the dirt and impurities from them it is much used in building particularly for covering gutters pipes c lead is also used in varnishes and oil painting and makes the basis of the glazing of all the earthen and pottery wares Refining cleansing purifying Varnishes preparations for beautifying and preserving various articles What is peculiar to the ore of Lead The ore of this metal is so poisonous that the steam arising from the furnaces in which it is smelted infects the grass of all the neighboring places and kills the animals which feed on it culinary vessels lined with a mixture of tin and lead are apt to convey pernicious qualities to the food prepared in them There are various preparations of lead serving for different purposes Infects corrupts Culinary adapted to the purposes of cooking Pernicious hurtful dangerous Ore the mineral soil earth or stone dug out of the mines which contains the metal What is Black Lead It is a kind of mineral of a deep shining black or bluish color soft and unctuous to the touch it is insoluble in acids and infusible by fire Black lead has been found in many parts of the world in a state of greater or less purity but it is the English black lead which is the most esteemed Insoluble incapable of dissolving Infusible not capable of being melted Is Black Lead a proper term for this mineral No because in reality there is not a particle of lead in it On the spot where it is procured it is called by two or three different names but the most usual is Plumbago Where is the best Black Lead found The best and greatest quantity is found in England in a mine near Keswick in Cumberland It is much used for pencils or crayons for writing drawing c for this purpose it is sawn into slips and fitted into a groove in a strip of soft wood as cedar c over which another is placed and fastened with glue What is Platina A metallic substance more recently discovered than the metals already described and analogous to the perfect metals especially gold many of whose properties it possesses Analogous bearing a resemblance Whence is its name derived It is the diminutive of plata silver to which it appears very similar platina being a silver colored metal in small grains Diminutive a word lessening the meaning of the original Whence is it obtained Mostly from Russia and also from South America Its color does not tarnish by exposure to the air and appears to be equally permanent with that of pure gold the metal is indestructible by fire Platina is capable of being alloyed with all metals is fused with difficulty but by great labor may be rendered malleable it is also the heaviest metal being twenty one times heavier than water Permanent lasting Are there any other Metals besides those already mentioned In addition to the metals known and used by the ancients the chemical science of later ages has by decomposing other earths added more than thirty to the number of metals some of them more curious than useful several of these are lighter than water All the metals possess different and distinct properties from each other They are divided into two classes the malleable and the brittle metals These last may be again divided into two others namely those which are easily and those which are with difficulty fused What do you mean by Metallurgy The art of obtaining metals from their ores comprising the processes of assaying refining smelting c By assaying is meant the particular manner of examining an ore or mixed metal according to its nature so as to discover not only what metals and what proportions of metal may be obtained from it but also what other mineral substances or earths may be contained in it What do the terms Refining and Smelting signify Refining is the art of rendering the metal free from all impurities Smelting means the melting of a metal from its ore in a smelting furnace in order to separate the metallic parts from the sulphur arsenic and the earthy and stony substances with which they may be combined What is Sulphur An inflammable fossil substance of a dry solid friable nature melting with a small proportion of heat when fired in the open air burning almost entirely away with a blue flame and noxious vapor It is abundantly diffused in many places especially where metallic minerals are found but more particularly in those districts where subterranean fires and volcanoes exist It is also found combined with many different substances Describe the nature of Sulphur and the places where it is mostly found Sulphur almost pure called native or virgin sulphur is found in volcanoes and grottoes in the form of transparent crystals but the greatest quantity which exists naturally is combined with metals in ores Sulphur is both fusible and volatile which qualities enable us to procure it from those minerals by the process of sublimation it unites easily in different degrees with all metallic matters excepting gold platina and zinc Sublimation the act of bringing a solid substance into the state of vapor by heat and condensing it again by cold Are not its uses very extensive Yes both in the arts and in chemistry it is well known to be a principal ingredient in the preparation of gunpowder and fire works it is also used for whitening wool straw silk c many other matters exposed to the vapors of sulphur when burning quickly lose their color which no other substance had been able to destroy Sulphur is also frequently found in mineral waters Whence are the greatest quantities of Sulphur brought The largest quantities are brought from Saxony in irregular masses which are afterwards melted and cast into small rolls There are about four species of sulphur namely the yellow native sulphur which in its purest state is clear and of a pale straw color found in the gold mines of Peru in Hungary and some other places the green native sulphur which is harder than the other is found in small crust like masses this sort is chiefly confined to Mount Vesuvius and the grey native sulphur common in Iceland and many other places Native sulphur is also found at the coal mines near Richmond Virginia in Connecticut Pennsylvania and other parts of the United States Which is the most rare and beautiful of all the kinds The red native sulphur it is mostly of a fine glowing red very bright and transparent it is found like the first mentioned sort in the gold mines of Peru Common sulphur such as is used in trade and the arts is of a pale yellow color and possesses a peculiar and disagreeable smell particularly when heated or rubbed This is mostly extracted from the metallic sulphurets and is commonly called brimstone It is the sort employed in making matches Is there not another substance also employed in the manufacture of matches Yes Phosphorus a peculiar substance chiefly of animal origin It is mostly procured by the decomposition of the phosphoric acid which is found in bones It was accidentally discovered at Hamburgh in sixteen sixty nine by an alchemist named Brandt Alchemist one skilled in Alchemy fifteen Footnote fifteen See Chapter XVIII article Chemistry What is the nature of Phosphorus It is a solid inflammable substance which burns when in contact with atmospheric air It is used in various chemical experiments and for making matches for various kinds of fire works c It will combine with all metals except gold and zinc and also with some earths Some animals as the glow worm possess very peculiar phosphorescent qualities Phosphorescent having a phosphoric property emitting peculiar light like phosphorus What is Arsenic A heavy metallic substance very volatile and highly inflammable so caustic or corrosive to animals as to become a violent poison in all its states In its metallic state it is used in several of the arts it is employed in the manufacture of factitious metals it is of use to the dyer in forming some of his colors and for that purpose is generally combined with potassa It is used in the making of small shot and also in the manufacture of glass to which it gives transparency in whitening copper in calico printing in the preparation of colors for the painter and in the working of platina and some other metals to render them more easily fusible Caustic dry burning Corrosive apt to corrode to eat away to penetrate How is the white powdered arsenic prepared By submitting the ore to a strong heat in a peculiar kind of furnace this produces a dark grey powder which is again heated in close iron vessels this separates it from its impurities and the arsenic is obtained in thick solid masses these by exposure to the air fall into a fine white powder From what is the word Arsenic derived From a Greek word signifying masculine powerful as a poison Arsenic is dug out of mines in Saxony near Goslar in Bohemia in England in the Mendip Hills in great quantities It has so strong a corrosive quality as sometimes to burn the hands and feet of the miners it is a deadly poison for all known animals This poisonous mineral is not found native in its perfect form being generally united with metallic ores What do you mean by Gems The word gem is used as a common name for all precious stones or jewels they consist of the siliceous earths and are much valued for their lustre transparency color hardness and rarity There are many different kinds of precious stones each distinguished by its peculiar character How are they divided Into the pellucid gems which are of great lustre and extremely hard as the diamond the semi pellucid those which are not so transparent but yet of great beauty those of one color as the emerald or turquois and those variegated or veined with different colors Gems are sometimes found of regular shapes with a natural polish near the beds of rivers after great rains these are of the pebble kind Sometimes they are found of irregular shapes with a rough coat in mines and the clefts of rocks Pearls though not stones are also ranked among the number of gems Pellucid clear as a drop of water Semi pellucid half pellucid Describe the Diamond The diamond is a precious stone the first in rank of all the gems and valued for its beautiful lustre it is the hardest of all stones as well as the most valuable The most esteemed are colorless A diamond in its natural state as it comes out of the mine and before it is cut is called rough because it has no brilliancy but is covered with an earthy crust The diamond is the Adamant of the ancients hence the expression hard as adamant from its being the hardest substance in nature The cutting of diamonds is a work of labor and requires great skill the polishing is performed by a mill of simple construction Where are they mostly found In yellow ochreous earths in mines and likewise in torrents which have torn them from their beds In former times all the diamonds that were known were brought from the famous mines of Golconda in Hindostan the islands of Molucca and Borneo have also produced many valuable stones The diamond mines of Golconda are now so exhausted that they are not thought worth the expense of working these gems are now brought chiefly from Brazil in South America What is meant by Ochreous Consisting of ochre a kind of earth with a rough and dusty surface composed of fine soft clayey particles which readily separate in water There are various colored ochres as red yellow blue green c they are very useful in many of the arts What term is used to denote the quality of the Diamond In speaking of the value of diamonds we distinguish them as diamonds of the first water meaning those which possess the greatest perfection and purity which ought to be that of the clearest drop of water when they fall short of this perfection they are said to be of the second or third water and so on till the stone may be properly called a colored one What is the Ruby A beautiful gem of a red color in its perfect state it is of great value The ruby is often found perfectly pure and free from all spots or blemishes but its value is much more frequently lessened by them especially in the larger stones It is very hard being second only to the diamond in this respect and is often naturally so bright and pure on the surface as to need no polishing it is often worn in rings c in its rough or native state The color of rubies varies from the deepest to the palest red all having more or less of a purplish tinge which is more plainly perceived in the deeper colored specimens than in the paler ones Where are Rubies found They are mostly found in gold mines We have the true rubies only from the East The Isle of Ceylon has long been celebrated for these gems they are found in a river which descends from the mountains they are brighter and more beautiful than those obtained in other parts but are very rare Some crystals are frequently found tinged with the true color of the ruby but these want its lustre and hardness Describe the Emerald It is a precious stone of a beautiful transparent green color and when in a state of perfection nearly equal to the ruby in hardness The finest and best are found in America especially among the mountains of Peru they are also obtained from a few places in the East These gems are often counterfeited as are most of the precious stones there being even false diamonds the genuine may be known by their extreme hardness and brilliancy Counterfeited imitated with a view to defraud Genuine true real What is the Turquois A beautiful blue stone it is one of the softest of the gems and some varieties are often used for seals as they admit of being engraved upon The turquois is easily imitated and that often so perfectly as to render it very difficult to distinguish the counterfeit from the true gem In what countries are they found The Oriental Turquois comes from Persia the Indies and some parts of Turkey the turquois is also found in various parts of Europe as Germany Spain and France What is Engraving The art of cutting metals or precious stones and representing thereon figures letters and devices the term is however more particularly applied to the art of producing figures or designs on metal c for the purpose of being subsequently printed on paper The ancients are well known to have excelled in engraving on precious stones many specimens have been preserved which surpass anything of the kind produced by the moderns This art is frequently alluded to in the Bible Engraving on wood according to some authors was introduced into Europe from China by Venetian merchants it is certain the art was practised in eastern and northern Italy as early as the thirteenth century The invention of copper plate engraving has been ascribed to a goldsmith of Florence about the year fourteen sixty Device that which is formed by design Design a representation of a thing by an outline a sketch Describe Wood Engraving The subject is drawn on a block of box or pear tree wood with a black lead pencil or with a pen and Indian ink the wood is then cut away so as to leave the lines which have been drawn as raised parts The ink is next applied and by pressing damp paper upon the block the impressions are obtained Albert Durer a celebrated painter of Germany brought the art of engraving on wood and metal and taking off impressions on paper c to great perfection How is engraving on copper steel c performed This sort of engraving is performed with a sharp pointed instrument called a graver by means of which figures landscapes c are traced upon a flat surface of the metal the lines are then filled with ink or a similar composition and the paper pressed on the plate When taken off an exact copy of the plate is impressed upon its surface Illustration COCHINEAL INSECTS AND PLANTS What is Lithography A species of engraving on stone from which impressions can be taken much more expeditiously and economically than from metal The process depends upon the following principles First the facility with which calcareous stones imbibe water second the power of oily substances to repel water When drawings are executed upon the stone with crayons composed of oily materials and the surface of the stone is washed over with water the moisture is imbibed by the stone but repelled from the engraving and when the ink which also contains oily substances is applied it adheres only to the drawing and not to the other portions of the stone The block is then passed through a press and the impressions are taken off as many as seventy thousand perfect copies have been obtained from a single stone Expeditiously with celerity or dispatch Economically with economy with frugality You describe Pearls as being ranked among the number of Gems although they are not Stones what kind of substance are they Pearls are excrescences found in the shells of a large species of oyster which are supposed to be produced by a disease of the fish The best pearls are generally taken from the most fleshy part of the oyster near the hinge of the shell but inferior kinds are found in all parts of the fish and adhering to the shells Pearls from many allusions made to them in the Old Testament were not only known to the ancients but were regarded by them as costly and precious gems How do they get the Oysters which contain them By diving under water and picking the oysters from the large beds at the bottom of the sea or the rocks to which they adhere The divers cast all the oysters they take into their boats and carry them ashore where they deposit them in heaps they are then left till they become putrid this being necessary in order to remove the pearls easily from the rough matter by which they are surrounded What sea produces the best and greatest number of Pearls The finest and greatest quantities are obtained off the coast of Ceylon the pearl oyster is also found in the seas of the East Indies in those of America and in some parts of the European seas but these last are much inferior The Oriental pearls are the finest on account of their size color and beauty being of a silvery white while the Occidental pearls are smaller and frequently tinged with a yellow or blackish hue Tinged slightly colored Does not the Pearl Oyster produce a substance called Mother of Pearl No the beautiful substance so much used for inlaying boxes and for ornamental knife handles c is produced from the shell not of the pearl oyster but of another sea fish of the oyster kind What is Inlaying The art of ornamenting a plain surface of wood or other material with thin slices or leaves of a finer wood of a different kind as mahogany inlaid with ebony c or with ivory and other substances There are two kinds of inlaying one of the more ordinary sort which consists only of compartments of different kinds of wood inlaid with one another the other requiring greater skill represents flowers birds and other figures The thin plates of wood or other substance being sawed into slips and cut into the required forms are carefully joined and afterwards strongly glued down on the block of wood c intended to be thus ornamented Compartment a division a separate part What is Ebony A hard black colored wood growing in the countries of the Levant c there are however several black woods of different kinds which are also called ebony What is Ivory The tooth or tusk of the Elephant which grows on each side of his trunk it is somewhat like a horn in shape Ivory is much esteemed for its beautiful white color polish and fine grain when wrought It has been used from the remotest ages of antiquity in the Scriptures we read of Solomon s ivory throne and also of vessels of ivory and beds of ivory by which it appears to have been a chief article of luxury as well as of trade Remotest most distant Of what countries is the Elephant an inhabitant Of many parts of Asia and Africa The elephant is the largest quadruped now in existence it is extremely sagacious docile and friendly in the countries where they live they are trained to useful labor and by their great strength are enabled to perform tasks which a man or horse could not accomplish among the native princes they were and even still are used in war with them the inhabitants are able to hunt and destroy the lion tiger and other beasts of prey With their long trunk or proboscis they can perform almost everything which man can with his hands Quadruped an animal with four feet CHAPTER XV STARCH ARROW ROOT TAPIOCA ISINGLASS CAVIARE THE VINE WINE GIN RUM BRANDY VINEGAR INDIGO GAMBOGE LOGWOOD TAR PITCH CAMPHOR MUSK MYRRH FRANKINCENSE AND TURPENTINE What is Starch A white powdery sediment procured from the bottom of vessels in which flour or meal has been steeped in water Pure starch is of a fine white color without taste or smell it will not dissolve in cold water but with warm forms a jelly in which form it is generally used it is made by crushing soaking and fermenting the grains of the cereals and then washing in pure water the water is then evaporated leaving behind the starch Sediment matter subsided to the bottom of liquors For what is Starch used To stiffen linen after washing to make hair powder and for other purposes in the arts From what vegetables is Starch obtained All farinaceous vegetable substances afford it as the potato horse chestnut c Starch being the nutritive part of the vegetable forms an excellent food for invalids and constitutes the principal part of arrow root tapioca c the different flavor of these substances being derived from the mixture of a small portion of foreign matter peculiar to the plants which yield them Starch is procured from potatoes by crushing them to powder and then proceeding as in the manufacture of wheat starch What is Arrow root The starch obtained from the root of an American plant by pulverization It is often adulterated with potato starch and the latter is even sold instead of it for the two kinds resemble each other so closely that they can hardly be distinguished Pulverization the act of reducing to powder Adulterated corrupted by foreign mixture What is Tapioca Tapioca is another kind of starch obtained from the root of the manioc plant which is cultivated in most hot climates in Asia Africa and America A flour is also prepared from it which is used for making bread It is particularly cultivated in the tropical parts of America and in the West India islands where it forms a very important article of food for the Negro population Negro a name given to the black inhabitants of Africa and their descendants Population inhabitants of a place or country What is Isinglass One of the purest and finest of animal glues It is the produce of several kinds of fish but especially of the sturgeon which inhabits the seas of Northern Europe and America From what part of the fish is it prepared From the air bladder and certain parts of the entrails these are taken out while fresh cut open washed and exposed to the air a short time to stiffen the outside skin is then taken off and the remaining part formed into rolls fastened together with pegs and hung up to dry The isinglass is then separated into threads of different sizes or formed into flakes Immense quantities are annually prepared in this manner in Russia What are its uses Dissolving readily in water or milk it yields a mild nutriment for the sick and enters into the composition of many delicacies for the table such as jellies c It is mixed with gum to give lustre to silk and satin it is also used in making court plaster and for clarifying various liquors Gelatine now much used on account of its being less expensive is a similar preparation but of an inferior quality What else does the Sturgeon supply Its roe furnishes the delicacy called Caviare which is in fact merely that part of the fish separated from the membranes and washed in vinegar and white wine and dried in the air It is then well salted and packed up in barrels ready for sale This is the method of preparing it in Russia where large quantities of it are consumed It is largely exported to Italy where it is highly esteemed It is unwholesome and at present the demand for it except in Russia and Italy is very limited The best is dry and of a brown color and is eaten with lemon juice on bread To what other uses is the fruit of the Vine applied besides drying it for raisins as described in the sixth chapter The well known plant called the Vine has been an object of culture from the earliest ages of the world for the sake of the fermented liquor obtained from its fruit soon after the flood Noe who appears to have been the first husbandman is mentioned as having planted a vineyard and drank of the juice of the grape in all those countries where it flourishes it is inseparably connected with their religious rites and wine like corn formed one of the principal articles which they offered on their altars to the gods whom they worshipped Husbandman one who cultivates the fruits of the earth Altar the place where sacrifices were anciently offered to some deity What countries produce the best Wines The wines of France are generally admitted to be the finest the principal ones are Champagne Burgundy and Claret Of each of these there are several varieties celebrated for their peculiar flavor they are generally named after the places where they are made Spain Portugal Italy Germany Hungary Sicily Greece and California also produce their various sorts of wine each esteemed in its kind May Wine be extracted from other vegetable bodies The word is appropriated in a more particular manner to the fermented juice of the grape but nearly all vegetable productions may be made to afford wine That produced from Apples is called Cider that from Pears Perry A kind of wine called Mead is prepared from honey and water Appropriated applied to What is Honey A sweet vegetable juice collected from the flowers of various plants by the bees What Honey was reckoned by the ancients the best in the world The honey of Hybla on the east coast of Sicily and of Hymettus a mountain of Greece near Athens What other fluid is drawn from Wine Spirits by this term is understood a volatile fluid called spirits of wine or alcohol obtained by distillation from wine beer and all fermented liquors It is colorless and of a strong penetrating taste and smell It is of great use in chemistry in dyeing to prepare the stuff for receiving colors and in many of the arts What is the vessel called which is used in Distilling A Still It is a vessel so formed as to collect the vapor which is the spirit or alcohol separated from the liquid from which it is drawn This liquid product is itself returned to the still and the same process is several times repeated till the alcohol or spirit is sufficiently strong and pure There are three principal spirits used in this country as gin rum and brandy Product thing produced What is Gin A spirit procured from raw barley oats and malt mixed together in certain proportions there are several varieties of this spirit all obtained from grain The peculiar flavor of gin is given by infusing a few hops and some of the berries of the juniper fir What is Malt Malt is barley prepared by being steeped in water and fermented and then dried in a kiln It is used for making beer c Of what are Hops the produce Of a graceful climbing plant the blossoms of which are used in making beer to preserve it and improve its flavor What is Rum A spirit obtained from molasses the fluid which drains from sugar while it is crystallizing What is Brandy A spirit distilled from any wine but the best is procured from weak French wines which are unfit for exportation Brandy from whatever wine it has been obtained is at first colorless different methods are employed to give it the color by which it is distinguished Exportation the act of sending articles from one country to another What is Vinegar An agreeable acid penetrating liquor prepared from wine beer c To make vinegar the wine or beer is made to undergo a second fermentation called the acid or acetous fermentation the first which the vegetable juice had to undergo in order to convert it into wine or beer being called the vinous fermentation Vinegar is of great use in cookery and medicine the word is derived from the French for wine vin and aigre sour The ancients had several kinds of vinegar which they used as drinks but it is most likely that these vinegars were different from that so called among us and were more probably a kind of wine Acetous sour Vinous wine like What materials are used for the dyeing and coloring of our manufactures There are many mineral and vegetable earths which furnish mankind with different colors for beautifying their various manufactures and assisting them in the arts c Some species of insects also come to their aid as for instance the cochineals these insects are killed by the application of heat and thus form the drug used for giving red colors especially crimson and scarlet and for making carmine The beautiful and permanent blue called Indigo is the produce of a small shrub two or three feet in height From what part is the Dye obtained From the leaves the color is produced by soaking them some hours in water in large vessels constructed for the purpose the sediment of the blue liquor drawn from them is afterwards dried and sold in the form of small grains For the painter they are mixed with oil or diluted and made up into small cakes with gum water In what countries is Indigo cultivated It is native in both Indies and in South America where its cultivation affords employment to many of the inhabitants It also grows wild in parts of Palestine and is much cultivated both in Syria and Egypt It once formed one of the staples of the Southern States but has in a great measure given way to the cultivation of cotton Has Indigo been long known The culture and preparation of indigo were known to the Oriental nations long before it was introduced into Europe The inhabitants of ancient Britain painted their bodies with the blue dye which they obtained from woad a plant which grows wild in France and along the shores of the Baltic and which greatly resembles indigo in all its properties except its brilliancy of color Brilliancy brightness What is Gamboge The concrete resinous juice of a species of gum tree growing in Cambodia and other parts of the Indies It is brought over in large cakes or rolls of a yellowish brown color outside and inside of a deep yellow or orange which changes to a pale bright yellow on being moistened What are the uses of Gamboge Dissolved in water it forms a beautiful and useful color for the painter It is also used in medicine Gamboge is soluble in either water or spirits of wine Mixed with a blue color it forms green in various shades according to the different proportions of the ingredients What is Logwood The wood of a tree which grows in parts of America and the West Indies It is imported in great quantities and employed in dyeing purple and the finest blacks What is Tar A coarse resinous liquor issuing from the wood and bark of pine or fir trees it is in fact the oily juices of the sap thickened and colored by the heat of the sun or by age it is extracted for use by burning the wood of the trees under a heavy covering of turf or earth the tar exudes during the slow combustion and is collected into a cavity dug in the ground for the purpose Tar is exported in great quantities from Norway Sweden and our Southern States What are its uses It is applied to the sides of ships and boats and their rigging to preserve them from the effects of the weather it is used instead of paint for palings c and sometimes also in medicine A kind called mineral tar is also drawn from coal by the process of distillation Mineral tar is also found native in some parts of the earth What is Pitch A kind of juice or gum likewise drawn from unctuous woods chiefly those of the pine and fir it is used for nearly the same purposes as tar in shipping medicine and various other arts Pitch is properly a juice of the wild pine or pitch tree it is of a glossy black color dry brittle and less bitter and pungent than the liquid tar What is Camphor A vegetable substance chiefly procured from a kind of laurel Laurus Camphora growing in Borneo Japan and many East Indian islands it is also produced from other plants and shrubs though in very small quantities How and from what part of the tree is it taken All parts of the tree are impregnated with camphor but it is principally extracted from the roots and trunk by distillation it is white and of a crystal form its odor is extremely fragrant In this state it is called rough camphor and is thus exported The Greeks and Romans do not appear to have been acquainted with this valuable drug and we are indebted to the Arabians for a knowledge of it What are the properties and uses of Camphor It is a firm dry crystal matter with a hot sharp aromatic taste It is highly odorous and so inflammable as to burn and preserve its flame in water it totally vanishes or evaporates in the open air and in Spirits of Wine it entirely dissolves Camphor has various uses as in fire works c it is an excellent preservative of animal and vegetable bodies as it resists worms and other insects In the courts of Eastern princes it is burnt at night with wax Its principal use with us is in medicine Preservative a preventive of decay What is Musk A dry friable substance of a dark color taken from a little bag under the belly of a small animal called the Thibet Musk which is a native of the Indies Tonquin and China It inhabits the woods and forests where the natives hunt it down Musk is so strong a perfume as to be agreeable only in the smallest quantities or when mingled with some other scent it is used in perfumery c Is there not another Animal which produces a similar scent Yes an animal of Arabian origin produces an odoriferous substance called Civet from which it takes its name of Civet Cat there are several species of this animal which produce it but it is from the Civet Cat that it is most commonly taken Civets are found in all the warm parts of Asia and Africa in Madagascar and the East Indian Islands It was formerly in high esteem but is at present very little used except to increase the power of other perfumes What is Myrrh A kind of gum resin issuing from the trunk of a tree growing in Arabia Egypt and Abyssinia it flows either naturally or by incision and is sent to us in small lumps of a reddish brown or yellow color Its smell is strong but not disagreeable Our myrrh is the same drug that was used by the ancients under the above name Its chief use now is in medicine The ancient Egyptians employed it as an ingredient in the embalming of dead bodies Embalming preserving the bodies of the dead from decaying or putrefying by impregnating them with aromatics and other substances which resist putrefaction Where is Abyssinia Abyssinia is a large kingdom situated in Eastern Africa What is Frankincense An odoriferous aromatic gum resin which distils in the heat of summer from incisions made in the bark of the tree which produces it notwithstanding the great use of the gum both in ancient systems of religious worship and in modern medicine authors have been much divided in opinion with regard to the kind of tree from which it is obtained it is a species of turpentine tree belonging to an order of resinous and fragrant trees and shrubs inhabiting the tropical parts of the world For what was it formerly used The ancients burnt it in their temples as a perfume and to do honor to the divinities that were worshipped in them it appears to have been applied to the same purposes by people of all religions Myrrh and Frankincense were reckoned by the Eastern nations amongst their most costly perfumes We are informed by saint Matthew s Gospel in the New Testament that the wise men who came to Bethlehem to worship our Saviour at his birth brought gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because they would not offer incense to idols In the Catholic Church we still retain its use in many ceremonies Primitive early Incense perfumes burnt in religious rites or as an offering to some deity What is the appearance of Frankincense It is generally imported in white or yellowish pieces or drops which possess a bitter disagreeable taste it is very inflammable and burns with a strong and pleasant odor That brought from the Indies is inferior to that from Arabia and inclines to a reddish color The common frankincense is softer more resinous and possesses less value than the former What is Turpentine The resinous juice of many trees as the pine larch fir c it is in fact the juice that renders them evergreen and when in an over abundant quantity bursts through their bark and oozes out Common turpentine is that procured by incisions from the wild pine there are several kinds of turpentine procured from various resinous trees some are of use in medicine and most of them in making different kinds of varnishes for preserving and beautifying boxes paintings c Ooze to flow gently Is there not a tree more particularly designated the Turpentine Tree Yes the Terebinth or Turpentine Tree of Palestine and the East It is one of the most common forest trees of those regions and is regarded with respect and distinction similar to that awarded to the oak in England What part of it produces the Gum The gum or rather the resin distils from the trunk It is called Cyprus or Chian Turpentine much of it being brought from the isles of Cyprus and Scio or Chios and is procured by incision about the month of July This turpentine owing to its superior quality as well as its scarcity each tree seldom yielding over two or three pounds is very costly Incision a cutting Costly expensive CHAPTER XVI BRICKS MORTAR GRANITE SLATE LIMESTONE OR CALCAREOUS ROCKS STEEL EARTHS VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES Of what are Bricks composed Of clay dried by the heat of the sun or burnt in kilns their color varies with the different degrees of heat to which they are subjected in burning In the East bricks were baked in the sun the Romans used them crude only laying them to dry in the air for a long space of time Crude in the rough unbaked state just as they were formed How long have Bricks been in use for building Bricks appear to have been in use at a very remote period of antiquity both from the account of them in the Holy Scriptures and from the remains of them which have been found the Tower of Babel and the walls of Babylon were built of them They were in early use among the Egyptians as appears from the history of the Jews before their deliverance by Moses In the book of Exodus we are told that this captive people were compelled to make bricks for that nation The Romans under their first kings built with massive square stones but towards the end of the Republic they began to use brick borrowing the practice from the Greeks and the greatest and most durable buildings of the succeeding Emperors were composed of them as the Pantheon c Massive bulky and heavy By whom was the Tower of Babel erected and why By the descendants of Noe s three sons Sem Cham and Japheth they were extremely numerous and dwelt in the land of Sennaar becoming ambitious of distinguishing themselves they set about building a tower whose summit might reach to heaven Sennaar was the original name of the country about Babylon Descendants those descended from a particular person or family What remarkable event followed their foolish pride The Almighty suddenly frustrated their purpose by confusing their language and causing them all to express their words by different sounds hence arose the numbers of different languages spoken by the nations of the earth and thus what they imagined would be a monument of glory was made an awful memento of their pride and folly Frustrated prevented Monument anything by which the memory of persons or things is preserved Memento a hint to awaken the memory of anything that which reminds What good effect did this event produce God who at all times can bring good out of evil by this means caused the other parts of the earth to be peopled for this visitation having effectually broken up their scheme they emigrated in parties and dispersed themselves over different parts of the world Scheme plan intention Emigrated removed from one country to another Dispersed separated Where was Babylon This celebrated city so often mentioned in Holy Writ and remarkable for the minuteness with which its destruction was foretold by the Prophets was the capital of the Assyrian Empire and situated on the river Euphrates After the destruction of Nineve the ancient capital of this empire Babylon became the most famous city of the East Minuteness particularity What is meant by the Assyrian Empire The country of Assyria in Asia For what was this city particularly celebrated For its hanging gardens palaces temples and walls the latter of which are said to have been three hundred and fifty feet high and so broad that six chariots could go abreast upon them The city was so strongly fortified both by nature and art as to be thought impregnable Fortified defended Impregnable incapable of being taken or destroyed by an enemy By whom was it destroyed and when By Cyrus five hundred thirty eight years before the birth of Christ just fifty years after Nabuchodonosor had destroyed the city of Jerusalem and its temple Who was Cyrus The founder of the Persian Empire Who was Nabuchodonosor The King of Babylon What was the Pantheon A temple of a circular form which was dedicated to all the Gods or all the Saints That of all others the most celebrated is the Pantheon of ancient Rome and its remains are the most perfect amongst the wonders of that city at the present day Circular having the form of a circle round By whom was it built By Agrippa the Consul of Rome twenty five years before Christ it was dedicated by him to Jupiter the name Pantheon was given on account of the great number of statues of the Gods ranged in niches all round it and because it was built in a circular form to represent heaven the residence of the Gods It was afterwards converted into a church by Pope Boniface IV and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and all the Martyrs under the title of Our Lady of the Rotunda Agrippa likewise built the Pantheon at Athens which was but little inferior to that of Rome The Greek Christians afterwards converted it into a church dedicating it to the Blessed Virgin but the Turks when they subdued Greece changed it into a mosque Dedicated appropriated to a particular person or to a sacred use Residence dwelling habitation Martyr one who is put to death for the cause of religion Mosque a Mahommedan temple Illustration A SLATE QUARRY What is understood by a Consul The chief magistrate of the Roman republic or commonwealth After the Romans had expelled their kings they were governed by two Consuls these were established in the year of Rome two hundred forty five The Consuls were the head of the senate they commanded the armies of the republic and judged all the differences between the citizens they held their office for the space of a year at the end of which time new ones were elected Consuls were even continued under the Emperors after the republic was destroyed but it was then little more than an honorary title and at last was totally abolished Expelled turned out Abolished annulled made void To what is the term Consul applied at the present time To an officer established by a commission from a king or state to reside in foreign countries of any considerable trade to facilitate and despatch business protect the merchants of the state c Commission a trust imposed command authority Facilitate to render easy What is meant by a Senate An assembly or council of senators that is of the principal inhabitants of a state who have a share in the government What is the government of the United States It is one of limited and definite powers defined by a written constitution How are the legislative powers granted to the government vested In a Congress consisting of a Senate of two Senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof and a House of Representatives consisting of one or more members from each state elected by the people in equal electoral districts Legislative giving or enacting laws How are our laws made Bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on receiving the sanction of the President become laws or if vetoed by the President may be passed by two thirds of both Houses Vetoed withheld assent to Who was Jupiter The principal deity of the Pagan world What is used to cement bricks firmly together Mortar a composition of lime sand gravel c mixed up with water the ancients had a kind of mortar so very hard and binding that even to this day it is next to impossible to separate the parts of some of their buildings What is Granite A rock which has been formed by the union of three different minerals in a state of fusion these on cooling have crystallized and become distinct from each other in the mass It is remarkable for the beauty of its colors its hardness and durability There are granites of many different colors as red or rose colored grey green variegated c Fusion a melted state Mass a body a lump What form does it bear Granite does not generally form one extensive mass but remains in separate and large fragments rudely compacted together besides the three minerals of which it is composed particles of other stones or metallic earths are often accidentally mixed with it It is called granite from its granulous structure Compacted joined together Granulous consisting of small grains Where is Granite found Granite occurs in all the larger mountain ranges and in isolated masses in every country not being a stratified rock and being excessively hard it is difficult to get it out in manageable masses In Arabia Petraea the whole country abounds in masses of different granites Isolated alone separated detached Stratified consisting of strata or beds What mode is usually employed in this country in obtaining it Blasting or blowing up with gunpowder the force of which detaches pieces from the rock which are hewn roughly into forms on the spot by a small pickaxe Granite is also quarried by cutting a deep line some yards long and placing strong iron wedges at equal distances along this line these wedges are struck in succession with heavy hammers till the mass splits down Another method of detaching masses of rock is by driving wooden wedges into a deep artificial or natural crack or fissure the wedges are then wet and in consequence of swelling burst the rock asunder Quarried from to quarry a term used for the getting of stone from a quarry or place where stones are dug from the earth or detached from a large mass of rock Detach to separate For what is this Rock used On account of its great hardness it is used for large public structures as bridges churches c The ancient temples and other buildings in Egypt Asia and Italy were built of different colored granites especially the beautiful Oriental red granite What is Slate The common name for a bluish fossil stone very soft when dug out of the quarry and easily cut or split into thin plates a property which renders it invaluable for a variety of purposes Invaluable extremely valuable For what is it used Slate has superseded the use of lead for covering roofs even of the largest buildings being lighter and more durable it is preferable to tile it is also employed for slabs to form cisterns shelves for dairies and other purposes on account of its strength coolness and the ease with which it can be cleaned the latter quality renders it also of great value in the business of education as a cheap substitute for paper The ancients were unacquainted with the use of slate What other kinds of stone are used in building Limestone or the calcareous rocks of the geologist of these there are many varieties Those which are easily cut and polished are termed marbles and are used in sculpture and in ornamental architecture The coarser marbles are used for the common purposes of building Calcareous partaking of the nature of calx or lime a term employed to describe chalk marble and all other combinations of lime with carbonic acid Geologist one who studies the science of Geology Of what do Calcareous Earths or Stones consist Calcareous earths stones or rocks consist of lime or pure calcareous earth carbonic acid and water What is Quick Lime Limestone deprived of its carbonic acid and water by being subjected to an intense heat in a kiln How are these Stones wrought To whatever purpose the stones are to be applied the larger blocks obtained from the quarry must be cut into smaller and more manageable pieces by sawing the saw used is a long blade of steel without teeth fixed in a heavy wooden frame These huge saws are worked by one or two men who sit in boxes to shelter them from the weather water is caused to drip constantly into the cut to facilitate the motion of the saw and keep it cool so as to prevent it from losing its temper Huge very large Temper hardness in speaking of metals it signifies the state to which they are reduced especially with regard to their hardness What is Steel Iron combined with a small portion of carbon its chemical name is Carburet of Iron It is not so malleable as iron in its ordinary state but is much harder more elastic and susceptible of a higher polish Of this material are manufactured knives swords and all kinds of cutting instruments and edge tools used for domestic purposes and in the arts from the ponderous pit saw to the finest lancet Good steel is much more ductile than iron and a finer wire may be drawn from it than from any other metal The excellence of edge tools depends upon their temper Ponderous heavy You say that a Geologist is one who studies Geology what is meant by this term A science which enables us to read in the simple language of nature the changes which have taken place on the surface of the earth in its structure and mineral constitution It describes the different materials and the strata of which the crust of the earth is composed and investigates the causes of its physical features Simple easily read What are Strata Layers of rocks and other substances of which the whole earth seems to be composed These rocks are found lying one above another in regular order beneath them are the unstratified rocks which seem to form the basis or foundations upon which the others have been deposited The various layers seem to have been formed during progressive stages of vegetable and animal organization These rocks and strata are divided into five classes or formations Progressive moving forwards Organization formation or structure of bodies Name them The Primitive or lower formations supposed to have been formed in the chaotic state of the earth because they have no trace of organized beings or petrifactions they are chiefly composed of silicious and argillaceous earths as granite slate c Transition rocks supposed to have been formed during the transition of the earth into a habitable state they differ from the primitive in containing the remains of marine animals the Secondary rocks containing the remains of animals and vegetables and consequently formed after their creation the Tertiary formation composed of layers of clay sand gravel and marl and containing peculiar organic remains and the Alluvial formation constituted of parts of previous rocks separated by water c and deposited in beds Petrifaction an animal or vegetable substance turned to stone Silicious consisting of flint Transition change from one state to another Argillaceous clayey consisting of clay Chaotic resembling chaos confused Chaos confusion a mingled heap a term used in speaking of the world while yet without form a Greek word signifying a confused mass Alluvial deposited from water Of what is this last compounded The Alluvial formation is composed of sand gravel loam clay turf c and contains plants roots moss bones petrified wood and skeletons of animals It is distinguished from the Tertiary formation chiefly by its superior position and by extending over regions where existing streams or other causes now in action could have produced it Some geologists mention another formation called the Volcanic because composed of minerals thrown from the crater of a volcano such as pumice stones lava c Crater the mouth or opening of a volcano Petrified hardened into stone You mentioned Silicious and Argillaceous Earths is not then the earthy covering of our globe of one common character No by earth is understood a combination of many distinct bodies Chemists by separating earths from each other and from foreign matters connected with them have discovered nine or ten primitive earths all of these except silex are compounds of oxygen with metallic bases Chemist one who understands the science of chemistry Of which of these Simple or Primitive Earths are the solid portions of the globe principally composed Of flint or silex lime or calcareous earth and clay or argil in various degrees of combination the greatest parts of the mountains and plains and the whole of what we commonly understand by soil mould earth c are composed These however though forming nearly all of the solid portions of the world are constantly mixed with foreign matters as metals particularly iron and acids as carbonic acid What are the properties of Silex Silex or pure flint will not dissolve in water nor can it be melted by itself in any heat but combined with alkalies as soda or potash it forms glass It is the principal ingredient of most of the precious stones What are the chief uses of Silex It is the most durable article for the formation of roads a necessary ingredient in earthenware porcelain and cements and the principal material of glass and vitreous substances The making of pastes or artificial gems is a branch of the art of glass making the basis used is a very hard and pure silex Basis that part of any mixture which is the ground or base the first principle or element of a substance Describe the properties of Lime It is of a white color and possesses a hot caustic taste It forms peculiar salts with acids changes vegetable blues to green will not fuse gives out a quantity of caloric when united with water and absorbs carbonic acid when exposed to air Lime is very useful in the arts and manufactures in medicine c The farmers use it as manure to fertilize land Caustic burning corroding a term applied to substances which eat away and burn any thing with which they are brought in contact In what state is Lime found in nature Never native but combined with other substances generally with an acid and most plentifully with carbonic acid as in chalk marble c It is also found in vegetables and is the basis of animal bones it likewise occurs in the water of the ocean and in that of all springs and rivers The method of procuring lime from chalk marble limestone oyster shells c has already been described in a former chapter What are the properties of Clay Argil or pure clay also called alumina from its being the basis of alum is soft to the touch adhesive and emits a peculiar odor when moistened forms a paste with water and hardens in the fire Its uses are so various and important that it would have been almost impossible for man to have attained his present degree of civilization if it had not been given him by nature in such abundance Its uses have already been described in the arts of brick making pottery c Besides these three principal primitive earths just described there are seven others having several properties in common yet each possessing its different and specific properties and evidently designed by nature for different purposes of utility Specific belonging to its particular species Utility usefulness What is a Volcano An opening in the surface of the earth or in a mountain from which are ejected smoke flames stones lava c Beneath the outer crust of the earth inflammable materials appear to exist which different causes excite into combustion Volcanoes are supposed to owe their origin to the metals and minerals which form the basis of earths and alkalies and which when ignited expand shake the rocky foundations and sometimes bursting through produce all the destructive effects of earthquakes They break forth under the sea as well as the land and throw up mountains which rise above the level of the water During an eruption of Vesuvius A D seventy nine three cities Herculaneum Pompeii and Stabiae were overwhelmed and lay buried beneath the matter ejected from the volcano until within a few years when excavations were made and many relics discovered streets houses papyri manuscripts grain fruit bread medicines c c all in a remarkable state of preservation have been found just as they were left by the terrified inhabitants at the time of the eruption Eruption an issuing or breaking forth with violence Ejected thrown out Are there many Volcanoes There are upwards of two hundred volcanoes upon the globe more than one half of them are in America and Oceanica The most noted volcanoes in America are Cotopaxi the highest in the world near Quito Popocatapetl in Mexico Cosiguina and the Water Volcano in Guatemala In France Spain Portugal and many other countries there are districts which show the former existence of volcanoes which have long been extinct near Naples in an area of two hundred square miles there are sixty craters some of them larger than Vesuvius in one of these the town of Cumea has stood for three thousand years What can you say of new islands formed by Volcanic Agency Many examples of new islands rising out of the sea by volcanic action are on record Some of them are permanent but others after a time disappear Teneriffe Iceland Sicily saint Helena part of Sumatra Java Japan and the Sandwich Islands seem to have been upheaved by volcanic agency Hawaii the largest of the last named group contains an area of four thousand square miles and rises eighteen thousand feet above the ocean What are Earthquakes Shakings or vibrations of the ground sometimes accompanied by rents and rockings or heavings of the surface so as to overthrow buildings and swallow up towns and large tracts of country They are attended with a terrible subterranean noise like thunder and sometimes with an eruption of fire or water or else of smoke or winds Subterranean underground What is supposed to cause them An electrical action between the atmosphere and some deep sub strata or the sudden formation of gaseous matter beneath the surface of the earth by internal volcanic fires Many hot countries where much electrical disturbance takes place are very subject to them earthquakes almost always precede volcanic eruptions an open volcano also probably diminishes the force of earthquakes by the vent which it affords Earthquakes at different times have been productive of the most terrific effects towns and cities have been swallowed up and thousands of people destroyed by them The island of Jamaica is remarkable for the earthquakes which frequently happen there Precede to go before Vent opening Terrific full of terror dreadful Where is Jamaica situated In the West Indies a large group of fertile islands which lie between North and South America Jamaica is the principal one of those which belong to the English CHAPTER XVII ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE USE OF MONEY NAVIGATION What is meant by Architecture The art of building or erecting edifices fit for the habitation of man to defend him from the weather and for his domestic comfort and convenience for devotion trade and other purposes and for the use of civilized life in every capacity Capacity state condition Is not this an art of great antiquity It is almost as ancient as human society the changes of the seasons first led men to build themselves huts or cabins into which they might retire for shelter in process of time their manner of building gradually improved and habitations were constructed of more stately forms and elegant proportions and greater skill and variety were displayed in their ornaments Hence arose the Five Orders or manners of building Of what were the first huts composed Probably of the branches of trees driven into the ground and covered with mud and stubble at length as men became more expert they placed trunks of trees upright and laid others across them to sustain the outer coverings from this they took the hint of a more regular architecture and built edifices of brick and stone the trunks of trees which supported their dwellings gave them a notion of pillars or columns which they afterwards erected of more durable materials Among uncivilized tribes at this day some reside underground having their dirty dwellings entirely closed during the winter months in warmer regions their habitations are built of stakes leaves and turf in the shape of a soldier s tent In Africa their kraals or huts are constructed in this manner but of a circular form with a hole at the top to let out the smoke In many of the South Sea Islands the natives when first discovered had progressed still further having learnt to elevate the roofs on poles and to fill in the sides of their houses with boughs or rushes mud or sods Probably most likely Edifice a building Notion idea Durable lasting What people are represented by the ancient writers as having brought the art of Building to a greater state of perfection The inhabitants of the city of Tyre to whom Solomon had recourse for workmen to build the Temple Isaias in his twenty third chapter speaks of the Tyrians and Egyptians as having brought it to a great degree of magnificence as may be drawn from the various accounts handed down to us and the remains of their obelisks pyramids c What is an Obelisk A very high and slender four sided pyramid raised as an ornament in some public place and frequently covered with inscriptions and hieroglyphics sixteen This kind of monument appears to be very ancient they were first made use of to declare to posterity the principal precepts of philosophy to mark the hours of the day by the shadows which they cast on the ground and in after times to immortalize the actions of heroes and perpetuate the memory of persons beloved Footnote sixteen See Chapter XIV Inscription something written or engraved Hieroglyphics emblems by which words were implied They were used before the invention of alphabets Implied signified denoted Posterity succeeding generations descendants Immortalize to render immortal which means never dying to perpetuate the memory of anything What is a Pyramid A solid massive edifice rising from a square triangular or other base gradually diminishing in size till it ends in a point at the top Like the obelisk pyramids were sometimes erected to preserve the memory of singular events or to transmit to future ages the glory and magnificence of princes but oftener as funeral monuments and receptacles for the dead particularly kings Triangular three sided having three angles Diminishing growing smaller Receptacle the place in which a thing is deposited Is it known who were the erectors of these Buildings No it is a curious fact that the Egyptian pyramids so celebrated for their size and great antiquity should have the time of their erection and the names of their founders wrapt in such complete mystery All the different authors who have written concerning them disagree in their accounts of those who built them and nothing certain is known of their history Founder one who establishes or erects Mystery profound secresy What other nations excelled in the art of Building The Greeks and Romans from whom we derive it also greatly excelled in this art Grecian architecture was in its highest glory under Pericles Among the Romans it arrived at its greatest perfection under the Emperor Augustus The five orders of ornamental architecture invented by the ancients at different times and on different occasions are of Grecian and Italian origin They are the Tuscan the Doric the Ionic the Corinthian and the Composite each possessing its peculiar form and beauty and found in all the principal buildings of the Christian world Christian professing the religion of Christ the term is applied to those who believe our Lord Jesus Christ to be the only true God and Saviour of the world Who was Pericles A celebrated Athenian statesman orator and general who gained several victories over the Lacedemonians and other enemies of his country Are all the species of ornamental building confined to those nations already mentioned By no means besides the Grecian and Roman orders other civilized nations possess their separate styles as the Hindoos Chinese Moors c and nothing can be more grand harmonious and picturesque than each of these in the beautiful specimens which are to be seen in their several countries The Saxons also had a simple style of architecture distinguished by semi circular arches and massive plain columns the Normans too invented a beautiful kind called the Gothic distinguished by its lightness and the number of its ornaments and by its pointed arches and pillars carved to imitate several combined together the Gothic style is found in many old cathedrals Hindoos inhabitants of Hindostan in India Moors inhabitants of Morocco a kingdom of Barbary in Africa Harmonious corresponding in all its parts with equal beauty and elegance Picturesque like a picture Saxons inhabitants of Saxony a portion of Germany Semi circular only half circular Describe the Five Orders of Architecture The Tuscan from Tuscany is the most simple and devoid of ornament and its columns or pillars are plain and massive The Doric from the Dorians in Greece is durable and noble in appearance having its columns plain like the Tuscan but the upper parts more ornamental The Ionic from Iona in Greece is neither so plain as the Doric nor so richly elegant as the Corinthian but is distinguished from the first two orders by having its columns or pillars fluted instead of plain and the upper part of them called the capitals adorned by the figures of rams horns carved on them The Corinthian is very rich and delicate with fluted pillars and the tops beautifully ornamented with leaves c The invention of this order is ascribed to Callimachus a Corinthian sculptor The Composite is compounded of the other four it is very much like the Corinthian and is also called the Roman or Italian order Devoid free from destitute What is Sculpture The art of cutting or carving wood stone and other materials and forming of them various figures or representations of men beasts and other objects The term is mostly limited to carving images or statues in stone This art is of great antiquity the sacred writings inform us of it in many passages as for instance in those in which are mentioned Laban s images carried away by Rachel the golden calf of the Israelites c Sculpture as an art is probably more ancient than painting What country was the most highly celebrated for its sculpture Greece which produced many celebrated sculptors of whom the most eminent were Phidias an Athenian the great master of this art who lived in the time of Pericles four hundred eight years before Christ Lysippus a native of Sicyon near Corinth and Praxiteles a native of Magna Grecia What event proved fatal to this art The death of Alexander the Great was followed by a visible decline in all the fine arts but the fatal blow to their existence was given by the success of the conquering Romans who reduced Greece to a Roman province Was Sculpture always performed in Stone No at first statues and other figures were formed of wood or baked clay afterwards of stone marble and metals though these last were not brought to any degree of perfection till about three hundred years before Christ The Greeks were famous for their works in ivory the great master of the art of carving statues in it was Phidias What progress did the Romans make in Sculpture Sculpture during their early history existed rather as a plant of foreign growth partially cultivated by them than as a native production of their own land They collected indeed some of the most exquisite samples of Grecian sculpture and invited to their capital the yet remaining sculptors of Greece by whose labors not only Rome itself was embellished but also many of the cities of Asia Minor Spain and Gaul then under the Roman dominion yet the taste for sculpture does not appear to have been cultivated in any measure corresponding with the advantages thus afforded them in the study of the best models of the art The best works were produced by Greek artists and chiefly Athenian while the attempts of the Romans were unskilfully executed Gaul the ancient name of France Model pattern Did it always continue thus No from the time of the Emperor Constantine sculpture and the rest of the fine arts gradually revived While inspired perhaps with a taste for sculpture by means of the scattered remains of Grecian art the Roman artists drew at the same time from their own resources and were by no means servile copyists of the sculptors of a former age The first academy of the art was founded at Florence in thirteen fifty and at the close of the same century sculpture was firmly established in Italy and itinerant sculptors not unskilful in their art wandered from thence to Germany France and even to England The most eminent master of the art was Michael Angelo born in fourteen seventy four who was also a painter and architect from his time to the latter end of the last century sculpture again gradually declined but under Canova a native of Possagno in the Venetian Alps it revived He was born in seventeen fifty seven Besides the above mentioned were a number of others of various degrees of talent as well as some still living Servile slavish mean Itinerant wandering When was the knowledge of Sculpture introduced into England At the time of its conquest by the Romans but the art appears to have been very rude and imperfect From the time of the Norman invasion and still further in the time of the Crusades an improvement however began to show itself in British sculpture But it is probable that most of their best architectural and sculptural works were executed by foreigners members of those societies of wandering sculptors before mentioned Under Edward the Third the art appears to have been much cultivated by Englishmen It is well known that two Italian sculptors were employed in England during the sixteenth century John of Padua a pupil of Michael Angelo was master of works to Henry the Eighth In the reign of Charles the First English sculptors flourished although their works are of a very low order Invasion hostile entrance upon the rights or possessions of another Architectural belong to Architecture Sculptural belonging to Sculpture Illustration GATHERING TURPENTINE BY SCRAPING Illustration DISTILLING TURPENTINE With whom may the School of British Sculptors be considered as commencing With Banks born in seventeen thirty eight and Bacon born in seventeen forty these were in every respect English artists But the most eminent worker in the art which that country has yet produced was John Flaxman born in seventeen fifty five Our own country also may boast of sculptors of superior talents and from the beautiful specimens of the art which have appeared the attainment of a high degree of excellence in it is to be anticipated Attainment the act of arriving at or reaching Anticipated expected foreseen Give me a short account of this art in Germany France and Spain In these countries as in England and the United States during their early history many of the best works were executed by Italians Germany appears to have made little progress in sculpture before the seventeenth century since that period it has produced sculptors of some eminence although it is more celebrated for its writers on the art than for artists of eminence in its practice In France sculptors of some talent are mentioned as early as the sixteenth century Girardon and Puget were the most celebrated artists of this period Spanish history gives a long list of native sculptors from the commencement of the same century but many of them are but little known beyond their own country Berruguete a pupil of Michael Angelo appears to have founded the first regular school of the art Paul de Cespides and in the eighteenth century Philip de Castro were the most eminent among them When was the use of Money first introduced It is not known with certainty there is however reason to believe that both gold and silver were very early used as money in Egypt and Asia it was afterwards introduced into Carthage and Greece whence it was brought to Rome and from that city spread gradually westward through all the Roman dominions Before the use of money was introduced the only means of trade was by barter or the exchange of one commodity for another a custom long retained by uncivilized nations In time however men discovered the necessity of something which would enable them to trade with greater facility the first mention of money is in the time of Abraham who we are told in the Bible paid four hundred sides of silver of common current money for a burying place Current generally received passing from hand to hand Where was Carthage Carthage now Tunis was a commercial city situated on the Northern Coast of Africa which long contended for the dominion of the Mediterranean with the Romans but after three wars it was taken and destroyed by the Roman general Scipio Africanus in the year two hundred fifty one before Christ Commercial carrying on commerce or trade Of what substances was Money usually made Of metals especially the precious metals because they possess great value in small bulk may be kept for any length of time without loss and their value although not altogether invariable yet generally speaking changes only by slow degrees and is less susceptible of fluctuation than that of most other articles At different times and amongst various nations however other things in the scarcity of metal have been substituted for it as shells wood leather paper or even pasteboard on extraordinary occasions Fluctuation unsteadiness a wavering Of what form was money generally made The form of money has been more various than its materials the ancient Britons used as money rings or bars of iron or tin the Lacedemonians used iron bars quenched with vinegar The money of most nations usually bore an impression peculiar to themselves as for instance the sicle of the Jews was marked with the golden pot of manna on one side and Aaron s rod on the other other coins with the figures of animals c in shape coins were either round irregular or square Have the terms Money and Coin the same signification Not exactly by money is understood any matters such as metal wood leather glass horn paper fruits shells c which have currency as a medium in commerce Coin is a particular species always made of metal and struck off according to a certain process called coining it is not of equal antiquity with money In fact the very commodities themselves were the first moneys that is were current one for another by way of exchange Coin is a piece of metal converted into money by the impression of certain marks or figures thereon The first coining of silver took place at Rome two hundred and sixty nine and of gold two hundred and six years before Christ the Romans after the commonwealth stamped their coins with the image of the reigning emperor which custom was followed by most civilized nations Coins were and are frequently struck in commemoration of a particular event or celebrated person When was the use of stamped coin introduced into Britain After the arrival of the Romans in that island the natives imitated them coining both gold and silver with the images of their kings stamped upon them but the Romans when they subdued the nation suppressed also their coins and obliged them to use their own hence the number of Roman coins found among the relics of antiquity in that island Suppressed put aside hindered from circulation Relics remains What does the first coined money in ancient Britain appear to have been Copper money but after the arrival of the Saxons in England scarcely any copper money was used for many centuries nor did it become common till sixteen seventy two it was first used in Scotland and Ireland in thirteen forty What is a Mint A place established by public authority for coining money In the United States the first mint was in Philadelphia branches have been established in other parts of the Union In most countries the privilege of coining money is regarded as a prerogative of the sovereign power Formerly in Great Britain cities towns and even individuals were allowed to coin money for the convenience of trade but now this is forbidden except at the Mint in the Tower of London What is meant by Navigation The science or art by which the mariner is taught to conduct his ship from one place to another Some perhaps will consider the formation and use of the Ark as a first step towards the invention of this art but it is an erroneous idea because the direction and means for accomplishing this immense work were afforded by God for the preservation of righteous Noe and his family Besides nothing is recorded of any means or of any necessity for its occupants navigating it to any particular place or from one place to another no intention of this sort is apparent the ark being merely a vast shelter rendered capable of floating on the water Erroneous wrong in error Apparent manifest made to appear What probably gave the first idea of Navigation Accident most likely showed that wood always floats and on the fallen trunk of a tree perhaps some one ventured beyond his depth away from the land The trunk of a tree hollowed out for a more convenient position of the body formed the canoe usually found among uncivilized nations to this day From this rude beginning at great intervals of time and a slow pace of improvement the art has at length arrived at its present state of advancement What nation first applied this art to the purposes of Trade The Phenicians especially those of Tyre their capital city and Sidon were the first who adapted it to the purposes of commerce and constructed vessels fit to make voyages to foreign countries the poverty and narrowness of their land as well as their vicinity to two or three good ports and their natural genius for traffic urging them to seek foreign supplies We hear of them trading to Arabia India Persia Greece Africa Spain and even as far as Britain Vicinity nearness neighborhood Traffic Trade commerce Who were the Phenicians The inhabitants of Phenicia a country of Syria in Asia Which was the more ancient city Tyre or Sidon Sidon having been built as is supposed soon after the Flood by Sidon the eldest son of Chanaan Tyre about twenty five miles to the south was built about the year twelve fifty two before Christ by a colony from Sidon The Phenicians planted numerous colonies on the shores of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic and diffused to a great extent among their uncivilized neighbors the arts and improvements of civilized life One of their most celebrated colonies was that founded by them on the northern coast of Africa and it was this colony that built the famous city of Carthage Diffused spread abroad scattered Did not Carthage afterwards become as flourishing as the parent city of Tyre In time Carthage not only equalled Tyre itself but surpassed it pursuing the course the Phenicians had begun and sending its merchant fleets through Hercules Pillars now the Straits of Gibraltar along the western coast of Africa and northwards along the coast of Europe visiting particularly Spain Gaul c They even undertook voyages the sole object of which was to discover new countries and explore unknown seas The Carthaginians appear to have been the first who undertook voyages solely for the sake of discoveries Were not both these celebrated cities destroyed Tyre whose immense riches and power were the subject of many ancient histories was destroyed by the Grecian Emperor Alexander the Great and its navigation and commerce transferred by him to Alexandria a new city which he meditated making his capital Alexandria in a short time became the most important commercial city in the world Thus arose navigation among the Egyptians it was afterwards so successfully cultivated by them that Tyre and Carthage which last as before mentioned was subdued by the Romans were quite forgotten Transferred removed Capital chief city or town in a state or kingdom Who was Alexander the Great The son of Philip King of Macedonia in Greece he was celebrated for his great ambition and the number of his conquests he overturned the Persian empire and subdued many cities and provinces in the East Did not Alexandria undergo the same fate as Tyre and Carthage Egypt was at last reduced to a Roman province after the battle of Actium and its trade and navigation fell into the hands of the Emperor Augustus in whose time Alexandria was little inferior to Rome and the magazines of the capital of the world were supplied with merchandise from the capital of Egypt Alexandria however at last underwent the fate of Tyre and Carthage being surprised by the Saracens who overran the northern parts of Africa and though it continued for a while to enjoy a considerable portion of the commerce of the Christian merchants it afterwards remained in a languishing condition but still even at this day it is a place of considerable trade Who were the Saracens A Mahommedan nation occupying a portion of what is now called Arabia They extended their conquests over a large portion of Asia northern Africa and Spain Their name is derived from the word Sara a desert What effect had the Fall of the Roman Empire on Navigation The fall of the Roman empire not only drew along with it its learning and the polite arts but also the art of navigation the Barbarians into whose hands the empire fell contenting themselves with enjoying the spoils of those whom they had conquered without seeking to follow their example in the cultivation of those arts and that learning which had rendered Rome and its empire so famous What other people about this period distinguished themselves in the art of Navigation The Saracens or Arabians whose fleets now rode triumphant in the Mediterranean they had taken possession of Cyprus Rhodes and many of the Grecian islands and extended their commerce and their discoveries in the East far beyond the utmost knowledge of their ancestors What other circumstance also prevented commercial intercourse from ceasing altogether Constantinople though often threatened by the fierce invaders who spread desolation over Europe was so fortunate as to escape their destructive rage In this city the knowledge of ancient arts and discoveries was preserved and commerce continued to flourish there when it was almost extinct in every other part of Europe Desolation destruction ruin Did the citizens of Constantinople confine their trade to the Islands of the Archipelago and the adjacent coast of Asia No they took a wider range and following the course which the ancients had marked out imported the productions of the East Indies from Alexandria When Egypt was torn from the Roman Empire by the Arabians the industry of the Greeks discovered a new channel by which the productions of India might be conveyed to Constantinople Did not the Barbarians after a while turn their attention to Navigation and Commerce No sooner were the brave among these nations well settled in their new provinces some in Gaul as the Franks others in Spain as the Goths and others in Italy as the Lombards than they began to learn the advantages of these arts and the proper methods of managing them from the people they had subdued and that with so much success that they even improved upon them and set on foot new institutions for their advantage To the Lombards in particular is usually ascribed the invention and use of banks book keeping and exchanges Thus the people of Italy and particularly those of Venice and Genoa have the glory of restoring to Europe the advantages that had been destroyed by their own ravages Institutions laws regulations Exchange a species of mercantile transactions by which the debts due to persons at a distance are paid by order draft or bill of exchange without the transmission either of money or goods Who were the Franks A people who settled in Gaul from them it took the name of Franconia or France Who were the Goths An ancient people who inhabited that part of Sweden called Gothland and afterwards spread themselves over great part of Europe Who were the Lombards The Lombards or Longobardi were like the Franks a nation of Germany who upon the decline of the Roman Empire invaded Italy and taking the city of Ravenna erected a kingdom Where is Ravenna In Central Italy It is the capital of a province of the same name it is an ancient town and the see of an archbishop See the seat of episcopal power the diocese of a bishop Episcopal belonging to a bishop Archbishop the presiding bishop of a province Illustration THE GRAND CANAL VENICE ITALY What was the origin of the city of Venice In the Adriatic Sea were a great number of marshy islands separated only by narrow channels but well screened and almost inaccessible inhabited by a few fishermen To these islands the people of Veneti a part of Italy situated along the coasts of the gulf retired when Alaric King of the Goths ravaged Italy These new Islanders little imagining that this was to be their fixed residence did not at first think of forming themselves into one community but each of the seventy two islands continued a long while under its respective masters and formed a distinct commonwealth Adriatic Sea a name given to the Gulf of Venice Commonwealth a republic a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the people What circumstance caused them to unite Their commerce becoming considerable enough to awaken the jealousy of their neighbors they united in a body for their mutual protection this union first begun in the sixth century and completed in the eighth laid the foundation of the future grandeur of the state of Venice From the time of this union fleets of their merchantmen sailed to all the ports of the Mediterranean and afterwards to those of Egypt particularly to Cairo a new city built by the Saracen princes on the banks of the Nile where they traded for spices c The Venetians continued to increase their trade by sea and their conquests on land till fifteen oh eight when a number of jealous princes conspired against them to their ruin which was the more easily effected in consequence of their East Indian commerce of which the Portuguese and French had each obtained a share Conspired united together in a plot What is the signification of Mediterranean Inclosed within land or remote from the ocean It is more particularly used to signify the sea which flows between Europe and Africa Had not Venice a formidable rival in a neighboring republic Genoa which had applied itself to navigation at the same time with Venice and with equal success was long its dangerous rival disputed with it the empire of the sea and shared with it the trade of Egypt and other parts both of the East and West Jealousy soon broke out and the two republics coming to blows there was almost continual war between them for three centuries at length towards the end of the fourteenth century the strife was ended by the fatal battle of Chioza the Genoese who till then had usually the advantage lost all and the Venetians almost become desperate at one decisive blow beyond all expectation secured the empire of the sea and their superiority in commerce Decisive final conclusive Where is Genoa situated In the north western part of Italy It was formerly a flourishing republic but belongs now to Italy What event likewise contributed to the more rapid progress and diffusion of Navigation and Commerce The Crusades for the Genoese Pisans and Venetians furnished the fleets which carried those vast armies composed of all the nations of Europe into Asia upon this wild undertaking and also supplied them with provisions and military stores Other travellers also besides those whom religious zeal sent forth to visit Asia ventured into remote countries from motives either of commercial advantage or those of mere curiosity Zeal devotion enthusiasm Who were the Pisans Inhabitants of Pisa an ancient town of Tuscany it was once a great independent republic and is still adorned with noble edifices Pisa has long been celebrated for its remarkable leaning tower Tuscany is a beautiful and fruitful territory of Italy its capital until the year eighteen fifty nine was Florence What were the Crusades Holy wars or expeditions undertaken by the Christians against the Turks and Saracens to recover Palestine between the years eleven hundred and fourteen hundred What causes led to these wars Many circumstances contributed to give rise to them They were undertaken first with a view to protecting the devout Christian pilgrims who were in the habit of frequenting the venerable places where our Saviour had lived taught suffered and triumphed from the fury and avarice of the heathens secondly with a view to getting possession of the Holy Land itself and of annexing it to Christendom and thirdly to break down the power of Mohammedanism and to elevate the Cross in triumph and victory over Palestine Avarice an excessive desire of gain Annexing adding joining What badge or sign was worn by those who engaged in the Crusades They distinguished themselves by crosses of different colors worn on their clothes from which they took the name of Croises or Cross bearers each nation wore different colors for instance the English had white crosses the French red and so on To what invention is the art of Navigation much indebted To that of the Mariner s Compass in the beginning of the fourteenth century and from this period may be dated the present perfection of this useful art You have given me an account of the restoration of Navigation in Southern Europe did not the inhabitants of the North also turn their attention to it Yes about the same time a new society of merchants was formed in the northern parts which not only carried commerce to the greatest perfection of which it was capable till the discovery of the Indies but also formed new codes of useful laws for its regulation Codes books or writings setting forth certain laws or rules respecting particular subjects books of civil laws Are Navigation and Commerce inseparably connected with each other It may be considered as a general maxim that their union is so intimate that the fall of one inevitably draws after it that of the other and that they will always either flourish or decline together may be seen by examining the reason of their passing successively from the Venetians Genoese c to the Portuguese and Spaniards and from them to the English Dutch c Maxim rule an established principle Intimate close Inevitably without possibility of escape unavoidably CHAPTER XVIII MUSIC PAINTING POETRY ASTRONOMY ARTS AND SCIENCES ART OF WRITING AND CHEMISTRY What are the earliest accounts of Musical Instruments on record The earliest accounts of music which we possess are to be found in the Bible in which the state of the world before the flood is noticed Jubal is said to have been the father of them that play upon the harp and organ but it is not to be supposed that these instruments at all resembled the harp and organ of modern times Musical instruments in the times of David and Solomon were used in religious services and music was certainly employed by the Jews on many other occasions as at funerals and weddings at harvest home and at festivals of all kinds Modern opposed to ancient pertaining to the present time or time not long past Festival a rejoicing a feast a season dedicated to mirth What nation was particularly celebrated for musical talents The ancient Egyptians who were so celebrated for their talents in music that the distinguished philosophers of Greece braved many dangers in order to study the science in Egypt and this at a period when the Egyptians were far from being in the same high state of civilization as their forefathers had been in earlier times The history and monuments of ancient Egypt have many accounts and representations of musical instruments and remains of these have lately been discovered so that we have ocular demonstration both of their existence and form Civilization freedom from barbarity polish politeness possession of knowledge and the arts of life Ocular known or seen by the eye Demonstration the act of proving with certainty In how many divisions may musical instruments be arranged There are three kinds namely wind instruments as the trumpet and the organ stringed instruments as the harp or lyre violin c and instruments of concussion in which the sound is produced by striking a sonorous body as for instance the drum bells c Which of these three kinds was the first invented It is impossible at the present day to decide which but it is most probable that instruments with strings were the last invented of the three kinds and it is most likely that of those in which sound is produced by the application of wind the trumpet or horn was first used This instrument in its rudest form was ready fashioned to the hand of man the horn of a ram or of an ox or some of the larger kinds of sea shells were soon discovered to possess the power of producing sound by being blown into through a small hole at the pointed end What improvement in this instrument would naturally follow Mankind having discovered the property possessed by a hollow tube of producing a certain sound soon found that the note varied according to the length and capacity of the tube A much greater improvement soon after took place it was discovered that one tube answered the purpose of many by boring holes in the course of its length and producing various musical sounds by stopping with the fingers certain of these holes Most of our modern wind instruments are but improvements on the ancient inventions Tube a pipe a long hollow body Was not Vocal Music used before the invention of Instrumental Vocal music namely that produced by the human voice so called to distinguish it from instrumental that produced by instruments was undoubtedly the first for man had not only the various tones of his own voice to make his observations on before any art or instrument was found out but the various natural strains of birds to give him a lesson in improving it and in modulating the sounds of which it is capable Modulating forming sound to a certain key To what circumstance did an ancient poet ascribe the invention of stringed instruments To the observation of the winds whistling in the hollow reeds As for other kinds of instruments there were so many occasions for cords or strings that men were not long in observing their various sounds which might give rise to stringed instruments Those of concussion as drums and cymbals might result from the observation of the naturally hollow noise made by concave bodies when struck What are the most ancient stringed instruments The most ancient instruments of this kind whose form is known are those of the ancient Egyptians among these the harp stands pre eminent One of the most celebrated representations of an Egyptian harp was drawn from a painting discovered in one of the caverns in the mountains of Egyptian Thebes by some travellers it is called the Theban harp and has thirteen strings its form is extremely elegant This harp is supposed to be one of the kind in use before and at the time of Sesostris Remains of Egyptian harps of a more simple construction with only four strings have likewise been discovered Among the monuments of ancient Rome there are representations of stringed instruments resembling the harp but not equal in beauty of form to the famous Egyptian harp already mentioned Pre eminent surpassing others Who was Sesostris A King of Egypt who is said to have reigned some ages before the siege of Troy He appears to have been celebrated for his conquests and for the number of edifices he erected to perpetuate his fame Perpetuate to preserve from extinction to continue the memory of a person or event Where was Troy Troy anciently called Ilium was the capital of Troas in Asia It became famous for the ten years siege it sustained against the Greeks the history of this event is commemorated in the poems of Homer and Virgil Is not the harp an instrument of high antiquity in Great Britain Yes it was a favorite instrument with the ancient Saxons in Great Britain The celebrated Alfred entered the Danish camp disguised as a harper because the harpers passed through the midst of the enemy unmolested on account of their calling The same deception was likewise practised by several Danish chiefs in the camp of Athelstan the Saxon The bards or harpers of old were the historians of the time they handed down from generation to generation the history of remarkable events and of the deeds and lineage of their celebrated chiefs and princes The harpers of Britain were formerly admitted to the banquets of kings and nobles their employment was to sing or recite the achievements of their patrons accompanying themselves on the harp No nations have been more famous for their harps and harpers than the Welsh and Irish Recite to repeat or chant in a particular tone or manner Achievement a great or heroic deed Patron benefactor one who bestows favors What instrument was famous among the ancient Greeks The Lyre the invention or rather discovery of this instrument is ascribed by them to their most celebrated deities It is supposed to have originated from the discovery of a dead tortoise the flesh of which had dried and wasted so that nothing was left within the shell but sinews and cartilages these tightened and contracted on account of their dryness were rendered sonorous Some one Mercury or Apollo they affirm in walking along happening to strike his foot against the tortoise was greatly pleased with the sound it produced thus was suggested to him the first idea of a lyre which he afterwards constructed in the form of a tortoise and strung with the dried sinews of dead animals The stringed instruments already described were made to give out musical sounds by causing a vibratory motion in their strings by means of the fingers Sinew a tendon that which unites a muscle to a bone Cartilage a gristly smooth solid substance softer than bone Vibratory shaking Who was Mercury The heathen god of eloquence letters c and the messenger of the other gods Who was Apollo The god of music poetry medicine and the fine arts Illustration PICKING COTTON Illustration GATHERING TEA What is a Tortoise A well known animal with a thick shelly covering belonging to the order of reptiles there are two species the sea and the land tortoise the first named is called a turtle and affords delicious food land tortoises live to a very great age It is only one sort which furnishes the beautiful shell so much prized Tortoises are found in many parts of the world The turtles on the Brazilian shore are said to be so large as to be enough to dine fourscore men and in the Indian sea the shells serve the natives for boats Of what are the strings of the Lyre c composed Sometimes of either brass or silver wire c but most commonly of catgut What is Catgut The intestines of sheep or lambs dried or twisted either singly or several together Catgut is also used by watch makers cutlers and other artificers in their different trades Great quantities are imported from France and Italy Are there no other kind of Instruments besides those already described Yes music and musical instruments have progressively improved and it would be a needless task to enumerate the numbers of instruments of each kind now in use many as for instance the organ the piano musical boxes c are exceedingly complex and ingenious in their construction as well as remarkable for the sweetness of their various sounds some as the two first named are played with the fingers and produce any melody or combination of sound at the will of the performer others as the musical box barrel organ c produce a particular melody or a certain number of melodies by means of machinery In the use of the last named the performer is not at all indebted to his own musical skill as he has only to turn the handle which sets the machinery in motion and the musical box or barrel organ will continue playing till it has finished the tunes to which it is set Upon what principle do these last mentioned instruments perform The barrel organ and musical box both play on nearly the same principle though the former is turned by a handle and the latter only requires a certain spring to be touched in order to set it off or to stop it Their machinery consists of a barrel pricked with brass pins when the barrel revolves these ping lift a series of steel springs of different lengths and thicknesses and the vibration of these springs when released produces the different notes What is Painting The art of representing objects in nature or scenes in human life with fidelity and expression either in oil or water colors c Fidelity truth faithfulness Oil Colors those colors which are mixed up with oil as the others are with water Is not this art of great antiquity There is not the slightest doubt of it but to name the country where it was first practised or the circumstances attending its origin is beyond the power of the historian About a century after the call of Abraham Greek and Egyptian tradition tells us of a colony planted at Sicyon by an Egyptian who brought with him the knowledge of painting and sculpture and founded the earliest and purest school of Greek art The walls of Babylon were adorned with paintings of different kinds of animals hunting expeditions combats c Allusions to this custom of the Babylonians of decorating their walls with paintings are found in the Bible Tradition a history or account delivered from mouth to mouth without written memorials communication from age to age Allusion reference Decorating ornamenting Sicyon a kingdom of Peloponnesus in ancient Greece Were the Egyptians acquainted with this art It is now little doubted that although painting and sculpture existed in Egypt and were probably at their highest condition eighteen centuries before the Christian era yet at a still earlier period these arts were known in the kingdom of Ethiopia and it is considered likely that the course of civilization descended from Ethiopia to Egypt There is however no record of any Egyptian painter in the annals of the art and it does not appear that it ever flourished in that country or that other nations were much indebted to Egypt for their knowledge of it Era age period Ethiopia the ancient name of the kingdoms of Nubia and Abyssinia in Africa Annal record history Exploit action achievement deed of valor Have we any notice of this art among the Hebrews There is no allusion made to the existence of painting among this people and no proof that it was cultivated among them it is supposed that the neglect of this art arose from their not being permitted to represent any object by painting What progress did the generality of the Eastern nations make in this art The art of painting among the Phenicians Persians and other Eastern nations advanced but slowly The Chinese appear until a very recent period to have contented themselves with only so much knowledge of the art as might enable them to decorate their beautiful porcelain and other wares their taste is very peculiar and though the pencilling of their birds and flowers is delicate yet their figures of men and animals are distorted and out of proportion and of perspective they seem to have but little idea Latterly however a change has taken place in Chinese art and proofs have been given of an attempt to imitate European skill The Japanese figures approach more nearly to beauty of style than Chinese productions of a similar kind Distorted having a bad figure Perspective the science by which things are represented in a picture according to their appearance to the eye Who are the Japanese The inhabitants of Japan an empire of Eastern Asia composed of several large islands They are so similar in feature and in many of their customs and ceremonies to the Chinese as to be regarded by some as the same race of men The Japanese language is so very peculiar that it is rarely understood by the people of other nations Their religion is idolatrous their government a monarchy controlled by the priesthood The people are very ingenious and the arts and sciences are held in great esteem by them In all respects Japan is an important and interesting empire Monarchy a government in which the power is vested in a king or emperor By what nations was the art of painting practised with great success By the Greeks and Romans Greece produced many distinguished painters among whom Apelles was one of the most celebrated he was a native of Cos an island in the Archipelago rather north of Rhodes he flourished in the time of Alexander the Great and witnessed both the glory and the decay of ancient art the leading features of his style were beauty and grace But painting was not at any period so completely national in Greece as sculpture its sister art the names of one hundred and sixty nine eminent sculptors are recorded while only fifteen painters are mentioned Zeuxis of Heraclea was another famous Greek painter who flourished four hundred years before Christ The Romans were not without considerable masters in this art in the latter times of the republic and under the first emperors What nation is supposed to have known and practised this art even before the foundation of Rome The Etruscans inhabitants of Etruria whose acquaintance with the arts has excited great astonishment among those who have most deeply searched into their history and traced their progress by means of the beautiful specimens of their works still extant Their early works were not superior to those of other nations but either from their intercourse with Greece or the original genius of the people they had attained considerable eminence in the arts of painting sculpture c before Rome was founded Pliny speaks of some beautiful pictures at Ardea and Lanuvium which were older than Rome and another author also says that before Rome was built sculpture and painting existed among them Where was Etruria situated In Italy on the west of the Tiber which separated it from the territory of ancient Rome to which it was afterwards annexed by conquest Etruria was the ancient name of Tuscany Annexed united Was not the art greatly obscured for some centuries The irruption of Barbarians into Italy and Southern Europe proved fatal to painting and almost reduced it to its primitive state it was not until after a long period that it was fully restored The first certain signs of its revival took place about the year ten sixty six when Greek artists were sent for to adorn several of the cities of Italy Cimabue a native of Florence in the thirteenth century caught the inspiration of the Greek artists and soon equalled their works He was both a painter and an architect Irruption inroad invasion To what did this revolution in its history give rise It caused it to be distinguished into ancient and modern The ancient painting comprehends the Greek and Roman the modern has formed several schools each of which has its peculiar character and merit The first masters who revived the art were greatly surpassed by their scholars who carried it to the greatest state of perfection and advanced it not only by their own noble works but also by those of their pupils Who were the principal masters of the Italian school Raphael and the celebrated Michael Angelo Buonarotti the former is regarded as the prince of modern painters and is often styled the divine Raphael he was born at Urbino in fourteen eighty three Michael Angelo was born at Florence in fifteen sixty four and united the professions of painter sculptor architect poet and musician Besides these there were many other illustrious Italian painters the principal of whom were Leonardo da Vinci Titian Correggio the three Caracci Guido Parmegiano Salvator Rosa c Was not Raphael also reckoned as excellent an architect as he was a painter He was not only esteemed the best painter in the world but also the best architect he was at least so admired for skill and taste in architecture that Leo the Tenth charged him with the building of saint Peter s Church at Rome Who was Leo the Tenth A great Pope who was an ardent lover and patron of learning and the arts He was born at Florence in fourteen seventy five and died in fifteen twenty one Give me a list of some of the most celebrated painters besides those already mentioned The great painters of the German school were Albert Durer Holbein Kneller and Mengs with several others Of the Dutch school were Rembrandt Gerard Dow Mieris Ostade Polemberg Berghem and Wouvermans Of the Flemish Rubens Teniers Jordaens and Vandyck The admired painters of the French school were Claude Poussin Le Brun and many others The Spaniards also have had their Murillo Velasquez c The English Hogarth Wright Reynolds Wilson Northcote Gainsborough Morland Barry and others The Americans Washington Allston Benjamin West Gilbert Stuart John Singleton Copley John Trumbull G Stuart Newton Thomas Cole Henry Inman and a number of others besides many now living or but recently deceased Upon what materials did the ancients paint their works Principally upon wood the boards or tables were prepared with a thin ground of chalk and size of some kind Linen cloth or canvas was also employed but there is no evidence of its use before the reign of Nero Parchment ivory and plaster were the other materials Evidence testimony record Who was Nero One of the Roman Emperors a monster of cruelty extravagance and debauchery he raised a dreadful persecution against the Christians in which saint Paul was beheaded and saint Peter crucified At last being deserted by his army and the senate he destroyed himself after a reign of fourteen years Debauchery wickedness What is Poetry The glowing language of impassioned feeling generally found in measured lines and often in rhyme Most ancient people had their poets Glowing warm energetic Impassioned full of passion animated Rhyme the correspondence of the last sound of one verse to the last sound or syllable of another Name a few of the ancient poets David was an inspired poet of the Hebrews Homer one of the earliest poets of the Greeks Ossian an ancient poet of the Scots Taliesen an ancient poet of the Welsh and Odin an early poet of the Scandinavians Who were the Scandinavians The inhabitants of Scandinavia the ancient name of Denmark Sweden and Norway What people are regarded as the Fathers of Poetry The Greeks Homer was the first and the prince of poets he celebrated the siege of Troy in the Iliad and Odyssey two epic poems which have never been surpassed In the same kind of composition he was followed nine hundred years after by Virgil in the Eneid by Tasso after another fifteen hundred years in the Jerusalem Delivered The Greeks also boasted of their Pindar and Anacreon in lyric poetry and of Aristophanes Euripides Sophocles and Eschylus in dramatic poetry Did the Romans possess any distinguished Poets Yes among the epic poets were Ovid and Tibullus among dramatists Plautus and Terence of didactic and philosophic poets Lucretius Virgil Horace and Silius Italicus All these were so many miracles of human genius and their works afford the models of their respective species of composition Most of the works of the ancients have in sentiment if not in spirit been translated into English Miracles wonders Genius natural talent Respective particular Sentiment thought meaning Did not the same revolution which undermined the Greek and Roman empires and destroyed learning the arts and sciences and the taste for elegance and luxury also prove fatal to Poetry It did the hordes of barbarians who overran Europe wiped out civilization in their progress and literature art and science fled before the wild conquerors to find a refuge in the monastery and the convent Here knowledge was fostered with the love and ardor which religion alone can impart Finally when the rude barbarians were converted it was to the religious Orders that the world turned for the establishment of schools and it is to the Church alone in the person of her popes her bishops and her monks that we are indebted for the preservation of learning and its revival in the fifteenth century What celebrated Poets marked this revival In Italy Dante Ariosto Petrarch and Tasso These were followed in France by Racine Corneille Boileau Voltaire La Fontaine and Delille in England by Chaucer Spenser Shakspeare Milton Dryden Pope Thomson Young Collins Gray Byron Coleridge c in Scotland by Sir Walter Scott in Ireland by Thomas Moore in Germany Klopstock Goethe and Schiller Name some of the distinguished poets of our own country Henry Wadsworth Longfellow William Cullen Bryant James Russell Lowell John G Whittier Fitz Greene Halleck and many others whose meritorious works will be impartially judged by a future age Impartially justly without prejudice Name the different kinds of Poetry Epic or historical dramatic or representative from drama the name of all compositions adapted to recitation on the stage in which are displayed for instruction and amusement all the passions feelings errors and virtues of the human race in real life lyric poetry or that suited to music as songs odes c didactic or instructive elegiac or sentimental and affecting satirical or censorious

wickedness or folly is censured Epigrammatic relating to epigram a short poem ending in a particular point or meaning understood but not expressed Pastoral from pastor a shepherd relating to rural employments and those belonging to shepherds What is Astronomy The science which treats of the heavenly bodies their arrangement magnitudes distances and motions The term Astronomy is derived from two Greek words signifying the law of the stars astron being the Greek for star What can you say of its origin Its origin has been ascribed to several persons as well as to different nations and ages Belus King of Assyria Atlas King of Mauritania and Uranus King of the countries situated on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean are all recorded as the persons to whom the world is indebted for this noble science Its origin is generally fixed in Chaldea Some choose however to attribute it to the Hebrews others to the Egyptians from whom they say it passed to the Greeks What country is meant by Mauritania Mauritania is the name formerly given to a country in the northern part of Africa Chaldea is the ancient name for Babylonia now called Irak Arabi a district of Asiatic Turkey By whom were the heavenly bodies first divided into Constellations or groups By the ancients The phenomena of the heavens were studied in very early ages by several nations of the East The Chaldeans the Indians the Chinese and the Egyptians have all left evidence of the industry and ingenuity with which their observations were conducted Phenomena appearances Ingenuity skilfulness What progress did they make in Astronomy They built observatories invented instruments for observing and measuring with correctness separated the stars into different groups or constellations for the more easily finding any particular star gave particular names to most of the moving stars or planets and noted the periods which each took to move through its apparent path in the heavens and in many other ways the ancients helped to lay the foundations of that mass of astronomical knowledge which men of later ages have brought to more maturity Constellation a cluster of fixed stars an assemblage of stars Observatory a place so built as to command a view of the heavens Who first taught the true system of the Universe Pythagoras one of the most distinguished philosophers of antiquity He is thought to have been a native of Samos an island in the Archipelago he flourished about five hundred years before Christ in the time of Tarquin the last King of Rome Pythagoras was the first among the Europeans who taught that the Earth and Planets turn round the Sun which stands immovable in the centre that the diurnal motion of the Sun and Fixed Stars is not real but apparent arising from the Earth s motion round its own axis c After the time of Pythagoras Astronomy sunk into neglect Philosopher one who studies philosophy Philosophy all knowledge whether natural or moral The term is derived from the Greek philos lover and sophia wisdom By whom was it revived By the family of the Ptolemies kings of Egypt who founded a school of astronomy at Alexandria which produced several eminent astronomers particularly one named Hipparchus The Saracens on their conquest of Egypt became possessed of the knowledge of Astronomy which they carried with them out of Africa into Spain and thus after a long exile it was introduced afresh into Europe Did not Astronomy from this time make great progress Yes it made considerable advances being cultivated by the greatest geniuses and patronized by the greatest princes The system of the Ptolemies called the Ptolemaic had hitherto been used with some slight alterations but Copernicus an eminent astronomer born at Thorn in Polish Prussia in fourteen seventy three adopted the system which had been taught by Pythagoras in Greece five or six hundred years before the time of Ptolemy About the same time with Copernicus flourished Tycho Brahe born in Denmark fifteen forty six Geniuses men gifted with superior mental faculties Mental belonging to the mind Faculties powers of doing anything whether menial or bodily abilities powers of the mind What next greatly forwarded this interesting science The introduction of telescopes by Galileo who by their means discovered the small stars or satellites which attend the planet Jupiter the various appearances of Saturn the mountains in the Moon the spots on the Sun and its revolution on its axis Satellites attendants What celebrated Astronomer arose in England The immortal Sir Isaac Newton born in sixteen forty two at Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire who has perhaps contributed more to the advancement of this science than any one who had before existed doctor William Herschel a native of Hanover in Germany born in seventeen thirty eight likewise made many useful discoveries in Astronomy it was he who first discovered the seventh primary planet which he named in honor of King George the Third the Georgium Sidus George the Third took him under his especial patronage and constituted him his astronomer with a handsome pension He resided at Slough near Windsor where he died in eighteen twenty two Patronage support favor Constituted appointed to any particular office or rank Pension yearly allowance of money What other circumstance contributed to the advancement of Astronomy The increasing perfection of our astronomical instruments by means of which the most important and interesting discoveries with regard to the heavens have been made It is now supposed that the myriads of the heavenly bodies are all distinct worlds it is certain from observations made by the aid of the telescope that the moon has its mountains valleys and caverns One of the greatest astronomers of our day was the eminent Father Secci What are generally meant by the Arts Systems of rules designed to facilitate the performance of certain actions in this sense it stands opposed to science The terms art and science are often incorrectly used Science relates to principles and art to practice The word art is derived from a Greek word signifying utility profit Arts are divided into liberal and mechanical What are the Liberal Arts The liberal arts are those that are noble and ingenious or which are worthy of being cultivated without any immediate regard to the pecuniary profit arising from them They are Poetry Music Painting Sculpture Architecture Grammar Logic Rhetoric Astronomy and Navigation The arts which relate more especially to the sight and hearing are also called Fine Arts Pecuniary relating to money Military belonging to soldiers or to arms What do the Fine Arts usually include All those which are more or less addressed to the sentiment of taste and whose object is pleasure these are more especially Music Painting Sculpture and Poetry What are the Mechanical Arts Those in which the hand and body are more concerned than the mind and which are chiefly cultivated for the sake of the profit attending them To this class belong those which furnish us with the necessaries of life and which are commonly called trades as carpentry weaving printing c There are also many other arts as the art of writing c When was the art of Writing invented It is supposed that the art was invented before the Deluge it was certainly practised long before the time of Moses There were doubtless many steps taken in slow succession before the invention of alphabetic writing Perhaps the earliest method might have been that which is still employed among the untutored tribes of North American Indians who record events by picture painting of the rudest description Picture painting was afterwards gradually converted into the hieroglyphical system which is still the only kind of writing among the Chinese It is not known who invented the alphabetic system of writing Deluge a flood the term used in particular to denote that mighty flood of water with which God swept away the first nations of the earth for their wickedness Alphabetic from alphabet the series of written signs of language called letters The word is formed from alpha beta the names of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet Untutored ignorant unlearned Were not the Egyptians quite early acquainted with this art Yes they were acquainted with two or three kinds of writing as well as the one in which symbolical characters were employed which was not used for common purposes On the contrary such symbols had something of a sacred character about them being unknown to the common people and only to be deciphered by the priests Obelisks and pyramids were the great national records and on these the hieroglyphics were constantly used because unintelligible to the people until expounded by those who had the exclusive office of explaining them Symbolical having the nature of signs or symbols that is representations of different things Deciphered read understood made out Unintelligible that cannot be understood Expounded explained interpreted Were Hieroglyphics employed before or after Alphabetic Writing They were undoubtedly employed at first from necessity not from choice or refinement and would never have been thought of if alphabetical characters had been known This style of writing must be reckoned as a rude improvement upon picture writing which had previously been used Hieroglyphics were employed by the Egyptian priests in after times as a kind of sacred writing peculiar to themselves and serving to give an air of mystery to their learning and religion though fallen into disuse for other purposes What materials were employed by ancient nations in Writing The Eastern nations used tables of stone brass and wood so that the characters were engraved instead of being written in the usual manner The instrument used in writing on wood was made of metal and called a style For stone brass c a chisel was employed When the bark and leaves of trees skins and other materials of a more pliant nature superseded the above named tables the chisel and the style or stylus gave way to the reed and cane and afterwards to the quill the hair pencil as now used by the Chinese and the convenient lead pencil Engraved inscribed with the graver a tool used in engraving on stone c Pliant yielding easily bent Have not the various nations among whom this useful art has been cultivated adopted different ways of arranging their written characters Yes The Hebrews Chaldeans Syrians Arabians and Egyptians begin each line on the right side and write towards the left The Greeks Latins and all European nations write from left to right The natives of China Japan Cochin China Corea c write from the top to the bottom of the page Where are Cochin China and Corea Cochin China is a country situated in Eastern Asia Corea is a peninsula of Asia subject to China What is meant by Science A clear and certain knowledge of anything founded on self evident principles or demonstration The term is however more particularly applied to a systematic arrangement of the principles relating to any branch of knowledge and is employed in this sense in opposition to art thus the theoretical knowledge of chemistry is ranked as a science but the practical part is called an art thus it is sometimes spoken of as a science sometimes as an art Practical relating to action not merely speculative What is Chemistry A science which enables us to discover the peculiar properties of natural bodies either in their simple or compound state and the elementary or first principles of which they are composed by the processes of analysis and combination Chemistry treats of those changes in natural bodies which are not accompanied by sensible motions Compound mixed Analysis a separation of a compound body into the several parts of which it consists Is not the knowledge of Chemistry very ancient Chemistry as far as it regards the separating of metals from foreign matters in the ore smelting and refining them is of the highest antiquity it is even supposed to have been understood and practised in the antediluvian world Antediluvian before the flood What nation appears to have excelled in Chemistry in early times The Egyptians were no mean proficients in many chemical operations especially in the arts of working metals softening ivory vitrifying flints and imitating precious stones Chemistry however experienced the common fate of all the arts at the decline of the Eastern empire Proficients those who have made great progress in any art or science By whom was it revived After having long lain buried the famous Roger Bacon revived it and from his time to the present day it has gradually progressed to a state of perfection In former times the art of chemistry consisted only in the knowledge of working metals c but in latter ages its bounds have been greatly enlarged The knowledge of Chemistry leads to many interesting and important discoveries and the arts and manufactures are greatly indebted to its aid indeed it is requisite to be a good chemist in order to attain to perfection in many of them Requisite necessary By what other name has Chemistry been known It was sometimes called Alchemy by which is properly understood a refined and mysterious species of chemistry formerly much practised What were its objects The discovery of the art of converting metals into gold including the search after the Philosopher s Stone by which this change was to be effected and the discovery of a panacea or medicine for the cure of all diseases What was the Philosopher s Stone A substance for numbers of years eagerly sought for which was to convert metals such as lead copper c into gold This unknown substance was called the Philosopher s Stone probably on account of the number of learned men who engaged in the search after it Illustration UNITED STATES SIGNAL STATION PIKE S PEAK COLORADO Was this search successful No but the delusion lasted several centuries notwithstanding the failures losses and disappointments of those engaged in it Indeed so severe and ruinous were these in many instances that laws were passed to forbid the study In Germany many of the alchemists who had the unfortunate reputation of possessing this wonderful stone were imprisoned and furnished with apparatus till they should purchase their liberty by making an ounce of gold Delusion an error arising from false views Apparatus a complete set of instruments or tools by which anything is made or any operation performed Was any gold ever produced by this method Not a particle the story of a stone having the property of converting the baser metals into gold being merely an absurd fable yet although the pursuits of Alchemy were the most preposterous that can be conceived the ardor with which they were followed and the amazing number of experiments made in consequence led to the discovery of many facts to which Chemistry is highly indebted Preposterous absurd foolish contrary to nature or reason You inform me that Chemistry enables us to discover the properties of bodies by means of analysis and combination what do these terms imply If a chemist wishes to examine the properties of a compound body he proceeds by analysis that is by a separation of the substance to be examined into its constituent parts The chemical examination of bodies is generally effected by producing a change in the nature or state of the body under examination This change is frequently brought about by the addition of some other substance which forms a combination with a part of the substance examined and leaves the remainder in a detached state By what means do Chemists effect a change in the qualities or states of natural bodies It is generally effected by means of heat which has a tendency to separate the particles of bodies from each other or by the mixture or combination of some other matter with the matter intended to be examined The mixture of two or more compounds often produces a decomposition by means of chemical affinity a property which different species of matter have to unite with each other and which is sometimes called elective affinity Thus it may be observed chemists have not only the power of decomposing natural bodies but of producing by combination various other substances such as are not found in the kingdom of nature What do you mean by decomposition In chemical language it means the separation of a compound body into its simple elements Give me an example Water may be decomposed and reduced into oxygen and hydrogen both of them simple substances incapable of further decomposition Is not the work of decomposition perpetually going forward Yes and combustion is one of the great agents in this work By it animal and vegetable substances are converted into water and carbonic acid by the union of their hydrogen and carbon with the oxygen of the air These in time are again absorbed by vegetables and again decomposed to set the oxygen at liberty to produce fresh combustions Of what use are the two remaining substances Hydrogen and Carbon These are appropriated by the vegetative organs to their growth and nourishment while the oxygen with which the carbon was combined is abundantly given off to purify the air and render it fit for the respiration of animals Give me an idea of the mode in which Chemists ascertain the affinity of bodies by relating an experiment Dissolve a tea spoonful of sugar of lead in water and pour the clear solution into a decanter or large glass bottle Then take a small piece of zinc and twist round it some brass or copper wire so as to let the ends of the wire depend from it in any agreeable form Suspend the zinc and wire in the solution which has been prepared in a short time metallic lead will deposit itself on the zinc and along the wire This is a beautiful illustration of chemical affinity the acid which constitutes a part of the sugar of lead has a stronger affinity for the zinc than for the lead and consequently will combine with the zinc and form a compound which remains in solution while the lead is precipitated on the zinc and wire in the form of a brilliant tree of metal Affinity in chemistry that attraction which takes place between the elements of bodies and forms compounds What does the word Nature signify In the above sense the system of the universe the creation the works of God By the kingdom of nature is meant the world and all things in it nature is divided into three kingdoms the animal vegetable and mineral What are the different states of natural bodies All bodies are either solid liquid or aeriform By solid bodies are meant those whose parts unite so firmly as to resist the impression or penetration of other bodies by liquid those substances whose parts do not unite firmly but have free motion among themselves by aeriform fluid substances having the form or nature of air Liquid substances are nothing more than solids converted into liquids by heat a certain increase of which would convert the liquids into vapor What other name is given to Liquids They are likewise called fluids we call the air also a fluid because it flows like a fluid and light substances will float in it What is the cause of bodies floating on liquids It is an established law of nature that all substances which weigh less than an equal bulk of any liquid will float on the surface of this liquid Thus a cork will float on water while a stone sinks to the bottom The cork will not float in the air though lighter than water and the stone is not heavier than the whole of the water but more so than a portion of water of its own bulk and thus it sinks in it Stones also differ in their weight or gravity for instance some of the asbestus kind are lighter than water Iron brass indeed nearly all substances except gold and platina will float upon mercury because they are lighter than this liquid What is the cause of bodies being either solid liquid or aeriform When the principle of attraction prevails it causes them to become solid when caloric prevails they become aeriform Fluidity is apparently a medium between the two How is the state of Solidity in bodies accounted for The particles of all bodies are subject to two opposite powers repulsion and attraction between which they remain in equilibrium While the attractive force remains strongest the body remains in a state of solidity but if heat destroys this force the particles lose their cohesion and the body ceases to be solid Cohesion act of sticking together union of the constituent parts of a body Which is supposed to be the most natural state of all bodies Solidity for by the combination of caloric with them we can reduce most substances to the fluid state while the greatest number of liquid substances take a solid form by the loss of caloric Thus water congeals and forms ice and even the gases show this disposition to become solid when they lose their elasticity by forming some combination Explain the terms Repulsion and Attraction Repulsion is a peculiar property in the particles of matter which gives them a constant tendency to recede from each other Attraction is an unknown force which causes bodies or their particles to approach each other The particles of all bodies possess this property which causes them to adhere and preserves the various substances around us from falling in pieces What different kinds of Attraction can you mention Attraction may be distinguished into that which takes place between bodies at sensible distances and that which manifests itself between the particles of matter at insensible distances Give an example of the first kind of attraction One of the most familiar instances of attraction at sensible distances is seen in the descent of heavy bodies to the ground When a stone is lifted up in the hand the earth s attraction which previously caused it to remain at its surface is overcome but as soon as the hand is withdrawn the stone falls to the earth The force which causes this is called the attraction of gravitation or simply gravitation How is the second kind of attraction or that between the particles of bodies subdivided Into the attraction of aggregation or cohesion and chemical attraction or affinity The former takes place between particles which are similar and the latter between those which are dissimilar All the operations of chemistry are founded upon the force of affinity which Nature has established between the particles of different kinds of matter and which enables the chemist to produce new compounds differing more or less from the substances by whose union they were formed Is it then necessary for chemists to understand the relative nature of all substances Yes because the basis of this science consists in an analytical examination of the works of Nature an investigation of the properties and uses of all substances we are acquainted with and the study of the effects of heat and mixture in order that we may find out their general and subordinate laws Analytical relating to analysis Investigation act of searching or tracing out Subordinate inferior in nature dignity or power Relate a few more of the advantages obtained by a knowledge of Chemistry Many of the wonderful operations of Nature and the changes which take place in substances around us are by its means revealed to us In every manufacture art or walk of life the chemist possesses an advantage over his unskilled neighbor It is necessary to the farmer and gardener as it explains the growth of plants the use of manures and their proper application and indispensable to the physician that he may understand the animal economy and the effects which certain causes chemically produce and the nature of animal vegetable and mineral poisons The study is therefore an invaluable branch in the education of youth it is useful not only in the active but the moral life by laying the foundation of an ardent and inquiring mind Even an everyday walk in the fields can be productive of instruction by a knowledge of it and let us always remember that Knowledge is Power Indispensable necessary not to be done without CHAPTER XIX ATTRACTION TIDES GRAVITY ARTESIAN WELLS AIR ANEROID BAROMETER EAR TRUMPET STETHOSCOPE AUDIPHONE TELEPHONE PHONOGRAPH MICROPHONE MEGAPHONE TASIMETER BATHOMETER ANEMOMETER CHRONOMETER What is Attraction By attraction is meant that property or quality in the particles of bodies which makes them tend toward each other Are there several kinds of attraction Yes Attraction has received different names according to the circumstances under which it acts The force which keeps the particles of matter together to form bodies or masses is called attraction of cohesion that which makes bodies stick together only on their surfaces is called adhesion that which inclines different masses toward each other as the earth and the heavenly bodies is called gravitation that which forces the particles of substances of different kinds to unite is known under the name of chemical attraction that which causes the needle of the compass to point constantly toward the poles of the earth is magnetic attraction that which is excited by friction in certain substances is known as electrical attraction How do you know that attraction exists through the whole universe This great universal law was first discovered by Sir Isaac Newton The sun and planets and other heavenly bodies are only guided in their path by gravitation Do we experience this attraction upon our earth Yes because our earth is carried around the sun by it and further the tides show it very clearly What are the Tides The ebbing and flowing of the sea which regularly takes place twice in twenty four hours The cause of the tides is the attraction of the sun but chiefly of the moon acting on the waters of the ocean What is Gravity Gravity is the attraction between the earth and the bodies on the earth which makes what we call weight of bodies What do you understand by specific weight or gravity It means the weight of a body as compared with the weight of an equal bulk of some other body taken as a standard commonly water Why do we say that certain metals as for example platina or gold are heavier than others say lead or iron Because the former have a greater specific gravity But is not a pound of gold as heavy as a pound of lead Yes but a lump of gold will be heavier than a lump of lead of equal bulk Can we explain by this what we call floating A body will float in water if its gravity is less than that of water for example wood floats for this reason in water and a balloon in the air Why does a portion of the floating body sink below the surface of the water Because the body in order to float must displace a portion of water equal in weight to the whole floating body But why do iron steamers float iron being heavier than water Because the steamer is not a solid piece of iron but is hollow and so increased in bulk for that reason the weight of the vessel and its contents is less than that of an equal bulk of water How can you ascertain that air has weight We can do it by the barometer and by very many experiences in daily life If one end of a straw be dipped into a vessel of water and the other end be sucked the liquid will rise to the mouth There we see the pressure of the outside air forces the liquid through the straw where the air was removed by sucking Can you show the same by another instrument Yes the common water pump demonstrates the same as the straw A tube is placed into the water the air is sucked out from the tube by the movement of the pump and the outside air presses the water through the tube What are Artesian wells Wells so named because they were made first at Artois in France They work on the principle that every liquid seeks its level Of the rain which falls a part soaks into the soil of mountains until coming to a layer of rocks or clay through which it cannot pass it will collect and be stored up If a hole be bored into this reservoir the water will rise in it Do you know some other properties of air It is the most necessary substance for our life it is the vehicle of all odors and smells it is the medium of all sounds and brings to our ear and so to our mind an immense knowledge of the outside world it is the cause of the beauty of the blue firmament or sky of the aurora and twilight it is the great nurse of the whole vegetable kingdom by clouds rain and dew What is an Aneroid Barometer It is a barometer in the construction of which no quicksilver or other liquid is used It consists of a metal box exhausted of air the top of which is of thin metal so elastic that it readily yields to alterations in the pressure of the atmosphere When the pressure increases the top is pressed inwards when on the contrary it decreases the elasticity of the lid aided by a spring tends to move it in the opposite direction These motions are transmitted by delicate levers to an index which moves on a scale This barometer has the advantage of being portable What is the Ear trumpet A trumpet like instrument used to aid deaf persons in hearing Its form is conical and the larger end is of a bell shape the small end is placed in the ear and the person talks in the large end It acts by concentrating the voice on the listener s ear What is a Stethoscope An instrument used by physicians for ascertaining the action of the lungs judging by the sound of their motion whether they are healthy or not Describe the Audiphone It is a fan shaped instrument to help deaf people and is made of flexible carbonized rubber Fine silk cords attached to the upper edge bend it over and are fastened by a wedge in a handle The top edge of this fan rests upon the upper teeth and the sound waves strike its surface the vibrations are thus conveyed by the teeth and the bones of the face to the acoustic nerve in the ear Describe the Telephone It is an instrument by which conversation may be carried on at a distance and is composed of three parts a thin disk of soft metal a small coil or bobbin of silk covered copper wire and a small bar magnet about four inches long The bobbin is placed on one pole of the magnet so that the wire is as it were steeped in the magnetic space round the pole The metal disk is placed face close to the pole and bobbin so that when it vibrates in front of the pole a series of wave currents will be set up in the coil of wire on the bobbin The whole is encased in wood and a mouth piece is provided for speaking against the disk The coil of wire on the bobbin is of course connected by its two ends into the circuit of a telegraph line Who invented the Telephone It was invented almost simultaneously by Alex Graham Bell a native of Scotland and Professor of Vocal Physiology in the Boston University and Elisha Gray of Chicago What is a Phonograph It is an instrument for recording the vibrations of sounds and consists of a revolving cylinder covered with tin foil To this cylinder is attached a mouth piece fitted with a thin plate or disk on the outer side of which next to the cylinder is a needle or point The cylinder runs on a screw so that the whole length of it from end to end may pass under the point On speaking into the mouth piece the voice causes the disk to vibrate and the point to trace marks corresponding to these vibrations on the tin foil By turning the cylinder so that the point again passes into the marks in the tin foil the sounds that entered at the mouth piece can be reproduced at any time By whom was the phonograph invented By Thomas A Edison who was born in Ohio in eighteen forty seven mister Edison is the inventor of many improvements in telegraphy which have been adopted into general use and are to him the source of a large income To him also we are indebted for the megaphone microphone tasimeter an improvement in the telephone a system of electric lighting and many other inventions What is a Microphone This instrument is a variety of telephone by means of which faint sounds can be heard at a very great distance It consists of a small battery for generating a weak current of electricity a telephone for the receiving instrument and a speaking or transmitting instrument The last is a small rod of gas carbon with the ends set loosely in blocks of the same material The blocks are attached to an upright support glued into a wooden base board This instrument is connected with the battery and the telephone So wonderfully sensitive is it that the ticking of a watch the walking of a fly across a board or the brush of a camel s hair pencil can be heard even though it be hundreds of miles distant Will you describe the Megaphone It is a substitute for the ear and speaking trumpet It consists of three paper funnels placed side by side The two larger ones are about six feet eight inches long and twenty seven one two inches in diameter and are each provided with a flexible tube the ends of which are held to the ear The centre funnel which is used as a speaking trumpet does not differ materially from an ordinary trumpet except that it is larger and has a larger bell mouth Two persons each provided with a megaphone can without other apparatus carry on a conversation at a distance of one and a half or two miles What is the Tasimeter It is an instrument sensitive to the smallest degree of heat and is mostly used in astronomy Attached to a telescope it will show the heat coming from the stars What is a Bathometer This ingenious instrument the invention of Prof Siemens of London enables those on board of ships to read from an index the depths of the ocean beneath them It consists of a highly sensitive steel spring to which a heavy piece of metal is attached The changes in weight to which the latter is subject in consequence of the variations of attractive force the deeper the ocean the smaller the latter and vice versa are registered on a scale by the indicator that is in connection with the steel spring What is an Anemometer An instrument for measuring the velocity and force of the wind and by which storms at a distance can be predicted What is a Chronometer A time piece of delicate and exact construction chiefly employed by astronomers and navigators It differs only from an ordinary watch in its delicate springs in not being so much influenced by heat and cold and consequently in its accuracy in giving the time CHAPTER XX LIGHT LIME LIGHT MAGNESIUM LIGHT ELECTRIC LIGHT RAINBOW PRISM SPECTRUM COLORS PHOTOGRAPHY CAMERA OBSCURA STEREOSCOPE KALEIDOSCOPE Do you know something about the nature of Light Light is a mere form of vibration like sound and like sound it requires some source to set this vibration going and some medium to carry this vibration as air carries sound Is not the air this medium No it is supposed that there is an elastic fluid called ether which pervades all space and matter and if the molecules of a body are in motion they have the power of setting this ether in motion The movement thus produced will appear either as heat or light according to its velocity What sources of light do you know We are told that the principal source of light on earth is the sun either directly with its own beams or indirectly by supplying us with combustibles to produce light for oil gas candles and most of the substances used for producing light and heat when burning are but sending forth in another form the rays of the sun which were stored up in nature s economy Another source of light is the result of chemical action such as the lime magnesium and electric light A third source of light is phosphorescence as we see it in the glow worm and fireflies What is the Drummond or Lime Light It is one of the most brilliant of artificial lights When a stream of oxygen and one of hydrogen under pressure are brought together and mixed within a few inches of the end of a blowpipe the mixture on lighting burns with a colorless flame possessing intense heat If this flame be made to play upon a ball of carbonate of lime the lime on becoming white hot gives off a powerful incandescence Incandescence the glowing whiteness of a body caused by intense heat What is a Blowpipe A tube usually bent near the end terminated with a finely pointed nozzle for blowing through the flame of a lamp or gas jet producing thereby a small conical flame possessing intense heat It is used in soldering silver brass et cetera A mixture of oxygen and hydrogen when ignited constitutes the hydrogen blowpipe invented by doctor Hare of Philadelphia What is Magnesium Light When the metal magnesium is rolled out into a fine ribbon and heated to red heat it burns with a dazzling light Which is the most powerful artificial light The so called Electric light This light whether produced by a series of galvanic cells or by dynamic power is the most brilliant and useful What is a Rainbow The rainbow is that beautiful semi circular band or arc of different colors in the clouds during the occurrence of rain in sunshine When the clouds opposite the sun are very dark and rain is falling from them the rays of the sun are divided by the raindrops as they would be by a prism There are often two rainbows at the same time because the primary bow is again reflected to another layer of clouds What is a Prism A triangular solid piece of glass on which if a ray of light be cast it will be distinctly divided into the seven colors we see in a rainbow By this fact we see that white light is composed of different rays which have different reflective susceptibilities What is a Spectrum It is this beautiful band of seven colors obtained by the refraction of a ray of light through the prism Whence come the colors in the objects we see in nature They all come from light every object has a power to absorb certain rays and to reflect others A red cloth for example absorbs all the other colored rays except red and this it gives off thus appearing red Why are the leaves of plants green Because a peculiar chemical substance called chlorophyl formed within their cells absorbs all other rays of light reflecting only blue and yellow which mixture produces the different green tints What is Photography The word means light drawing It is a mode of fixing on certain substances the lights and shades of any object by means of a lens inserted in a camera obscura This process was first called Daguerreotype from the name of the inventor Daguerre A plate of copper thinly coated with silver is exposed to the vapor of iodine then placed in a camera obscura where an image of the object to be presented through a lens is cast upon it Ambrotype is the same application to glass There are now different variations of method in the use of the same agents Now photography consists in taking the images on what is called a negative that is a glass coated with a silvered collodion gun cotton dissolved in alcohol and ether film From this plate another image is taken on silvered paper which we call the positive image There are also other chemicals used instead of silver What is a Camera Obscura A small box or dark room into which the light is admitted through a lens What is a Stereoscope It is an instrument exhibiting the effects and advantages of seeing with two eyes The instrument is so constructed that from a flat picture we may see the solid body in its reality in nature What is a Kaleidoscope An instrument invented by Sir David Brewster consisting of a tube with slips of reflecting glass so arranged in the interior that small beads bits of colored glass and similar things are by revolving the tube thrown into an endless variety of beautiful shapes CHAPTER XXI ELECTRICITY ELECTRIC CURRENTS ELECTRIC BATTERY ELECTROTYPING STEREOTYPING TELEGRAPH OCEAN CABLE LIGHTNING ROD THE GULF STREAM THE MT CENIS TUNNEL THE SUEZ CANAL SUSPENSION BRIDGES EMINENT AMERICANS What is the nature of Electricity A form of energy into which all other forms can readily be converted What is an Electric current Electricity manifests itself in a variety of ways but all may be arranged under two heads viz one as a charge two as a current By means of friction many bodies become electrified that is have acquired an electrical charge If this charge is in great quantity we call it high tension When a body containing an electrical charge is brought in contact with other bodies through which electricity is capable of passing there ensues a current of electricity Such bodies are called conductors What are the sources of currents There are currents produced by chemical action called voltaic currents by the action of heat or thermo electric currents by the motion of magnets or magneto electric currents Illustration REMOVING THE EARTH FROM THE CANAL BY MEANS OF DROMEDARIES Illustration OPENING THE SUEZ CANAL PROCESSION OF SHIPS What is positive and what negative electricity No difference in electricity in itself When a body has more than its natural amount of electricity it is said to be charged positively when it has less than its natural amount it is negatively charged What is a Cell what a Battery If a piece of zinc and copper joined by a wire be dipped in a liquid generally weak sulphuric acid which will act chemically on the metals a current is produced Such an arrangement is called a couple or cell If many cells are connected then it is called a battery What is Thermo electricity If two bars of any unlike metal for example antimony and bismuth be soldered together at one end and the other ends be connected by a wire and then the soldered end heated a current will flow What effects are produced by currents They produce heat light decomposition and combination in liquid chemical compounds they melt all metals excite magnetism and in the animal body excite movements of the muscles Can you specify these effects A strong battery produces heat in such a degree that all metals can be melted Light is produced in flashes or if the end of the leading wires are connected with two pencils of hard carbon and brought very near together then a brilliant light or arc called the voltaic arc is produced This is the dazzling bright light which we call electric light The chemical effect of a current in decomposing compound substances is called electrolysis In this way water can be decomposed into its compounds hydrogen and oxygen copper sulphate into sulphur and metallic copper et cetera In this way we can deposit strong adherent films of metal on the surface of any conductor for if the article to be coated be attached to the negative electrode of a battery and dipped into a solution of the metal with which we desire to coat the article say copper or silver and the positive electrode be attached to a plate of copper and also dipped into a liquid when the current passes the metal will be decomposed and deposited in a uniform layer over the article at the negative electrode This process is called electro plating What is Electrotyping It is the process of copying medals type wood cuts engraved copper and steel plates et cetera by means of electrical deposition It is chiefly used for making from the ordinary movable types plates of fixed metallic types for printing books Describe the process The article to be copied is first covered with black lead and then a mould is made of it in wax or gutta percha This mould is placed in a solution of sulphate of copper and attached to the negative pole of the battery while a plate of copper is hung from the positive pole The electric current decomposes the copper which is deposited in a thin film upon the mould This film is removed and stiffened by being backed with metal What is the difference between Electrotyping and Stereotyping In stereotyping a plaster of Paris mould is taken from the types and upon this mould melted type metal is poured which when hardened makes a solid plate Is there any other method of stereotyping Yes that known as the paper process A uniform sheet of soft matter is formed by pasting together sheets of thin tough tissue paper The types are oiled and the soft moist sheet is placed on them and beaten down with a stiff brush until it receives an impression of the type form Both are then run through a press and on being taken out the paper is found to form a perfect mould Into this mould the type metal is poured and the plate formed Can you tell me some magnetic effects of the current All conductors become magnetic during the passage of a current through them and thereby acquire all the properties of a magnet There are bodies which are natural magnets and they are called permanent magnets Those which become magnets only during the passage of a current are called electro magnets Do you know any application of those magnets They are employed in a great variety of electrical apparatus principally in telegraphy When was the first telegraph established It was made in eighteen thirty six being invented by Prof Steinheil of Munich and adopted by the government of Bavaria It was twelve miles long and the signals were made by small bells Who was the inventor of the telegraph in this country Samuel F B Morse who was born at Charlestown Mass April twenty seven seventeen ninety one He began life as a painter but did not give his whole attention to art chemistry and experiments in electricity and galvanism claiming much of his time He first conceived the idea of the telegraph in eighteen thirty two and exhibited his invention to Congress in eighteen thirty seven He struggled on with scanty means and was about to give up in despair when Congress appropriated thirty thousand dollars for an experimental line which was opened on May twelve eighteen forty four between Washington and Baltimore Prof Morse died in eighteen seventy two but not before he had reaped honors and fortune from his invention How rapidly does the electric current travel through the wires From experiments made it appears to be about fifteen thousand four hundred miles in a second Can more than one message be sent at the same time on the same wire Yes it is possible now to send several messages at the same time What is a Cable It is a telegraph wire under water Prof Morse in eighteen forty two laid a wire insulated by a covering of hemp coated with pitch tar and India rubber between Governor s Island and the Battery New York Several attempts were made in other countries What was the greatest telegraphic undertaking That of connecting Europe with America by a submarine cable spanning the ocean which was commenced in eighteen fifty seven and completed August five eighteen fifty eight To whom do we owe this grand undertaking This honor is entirely due to mister Cyrus W Field mister Field was born at Stockbridge Mass on November thirtieth eighteen nineteen In eighteen fifty three he became interested in ocean telegraphy and after many reverses succeeded in laying the first cable in August eighteen fifty eight The message sent by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States consisting of ninety nine words occupied sixty seven minutes in transmitting In September of the same year this cable ceased to work but the energy of Field restored confidence and another cable was made and laid down in July eighteen sixty five but after twelve hundred miles were deposited it was lost In eighteen sixty six another was made and successfully laid in July In August the lost cable was found and spliced and carried to the western shore What is a Dynamo electric machine A machine by which very powerful currents can be obtained directly from mechanical power In these by means of a steam engine or other power a number of coils of wire called the armature are set into rapid revolution between the poles of powerful electro magnets All currents are caused to flow from the armature in one direction by means of a contrivance called the commutator Very successful machines of this sort are the Gramme machine the Siemens and principally the so called Brush machine By these the electric light is now generally produced What is a Lightning Rod It is a rod of iron placed against a building to protect it from lightning Three or four feet of one end is in the moist ground or in water while several feet of the other end extend above the highest part of the building The upper end of the rod is pointed with copper or some other metal

origin It may be considered as beginning on the west coast of Africa within the region of the trade winds These cause a westward flow known as the equatorial current On reaching the coast of Brazil the greater portion of this current bends northward carrying with it the waters of the Amazon and Orinoco and passes through the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico Here it is further heated and rushes out through the only outlet the Straits of Florida Describe its course Deep and narrow it runs by Florida with a velocity varying from two to five miles an hour and pressed by the cold current between it and the shore flows parallel to the coast as far as Cape Hatteras Meeting shoals near this point the banks of sand extending as far as Newfoundland it there turns abruptly to the east and with diminished speed and increased width rolls onward towards the coast of Europe Before long it divides into two great branches the northern and southern The former extends as far as Spitzbergen the latter sweeping along by the Madeira and Canary Islands returns to the equator completing the circuit What influence has the Gulf Stream on the climate of Europe Various opinions have been expressed as to this It has been estimated that the amount of heat arising from the stream on a winter s day is sufficient to raise the atmosphere over the British Isles from the freezing point to a summer temperature How may the Gulf Stream be distinguished It can be distinctly traced in the ocean by its dark indigo color its temperature and the swiftness of its waters Which is the largest tunnel in
