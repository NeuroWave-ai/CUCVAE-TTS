none	none	Get our announcement out as quickly as you can Number Five You and Colonel Ravney can decide what interpolations are needed to fit the situation Number Five the really tough one Degbrend considered I take it that by interpolations you do not mean dilutions Oh no don t water the drink Spike it Lanze Degbrend grinned at him Then he snapped down the visor of his helmet unslung his carbine and presented it He was still standing at present arms when Trevannion blanked the screen That still doesn t excuse a wanton and unprovoked aggression Erskyll was telling Shatrak his thin face flushed and his voice quivering with indignation We came here to help these people not to murder them We didn t come here to do either Obray he said turning to face the younger man We came here to annex their planet to the Galactic Empire whether they wish it annexed or not Commodore Shatrak used the quickest and most effective method of doing that It would have done no good to attempt to parley with them from off planet You heard those telecasts of theirs Authoritarian Shatrak said then mimicked pompously Everybody is commanded to remain calm the Mastership is taking action The Convocation of the Lords Master is in special session they will decide how to deal with the invaders The administrators are directed to reassure the supervisors the overseers will keep the workers at their tasks Any person disobeying the orders of the Mastership will be dealt with most severely Static too No spaceships into this system for the last five hundred years the Convocation equals Parliament I assume hasn t been in special session for two hundred and fifty Yes I ve taken over planets with that kind of government before Shatrak said You can t argue with them You just grab them by the center of authority quick and hard Count Erskyll said nothing for a moment He was opposed to the use of force Force he believed was the last resort of incompetence he had said so frequently enough since this operation had begun Of course he was absolutely right though not in the way he meant Only the incompetent wait until the last extremity to use force and by then it is usually too late to use anything even prayer But at the same time he was opposed to authoritarianism except of course when necessary for the real good of the people And he did not like rulers who called themselves Lords Master Good democratic rulers called themselves Servants of the People So he relapsed into silence and stared at the viewscreens One from an outside pickup on the Empress Eulalie herself showed the surface of the planet a hundred miles down the continent under them curving away to a distant sun reflecting sea beyond the curved horizon the black sky was spangled with unwinking stars Fifty miles down the sun glinted from the three thousand foot globes of the two transport cruisers Canopus and Mizar Another screen from Mizar gave a clearer if more circumscribed view of the surface green countryside veined by rivers and wrinkled with mountains little towns that were mere dots a scatter of white clouds Nothing that looked like roads There had been no native sapient race on this planet and in the thirteen centuries since it had been colonized the Terro human population had never completely lost the use of contragravity vehicles In that screen farther down the four destroyers Irma Irene Isobel and Iris were tiny twinkles From Irene they had a magnified view of the city On the maps none later than eight hundred years old it was called Zeggensburg it had been built at the time of the first colonization under the old Terran Federation Tall buildings rising from wide interspaces of lawns and parks and gardens and at the very center widely separated from anything else the mass of the Citadel a huge cylindrical tower rising from a cluster of smaller cylinders with a broad circular landing stage above topped by the newly raised flag of the Galactic Empire There was a second city a thick crescent to the south and east The old maps placed the Zeggensburg spaceport there but not a trace of that remained In its place was what was evidently an industrial district located where the prevailing winds would carry away the dust and smoke There was quite a bit of both but the surprising thing was the streets long curved ones and shorter ones crossing at regular intervals to form blocks He had never seen a city with streets before and he doubted if anybody else on the Empire ships had Long boulevards to give unobstructed passage to low level air traffic of course and short winding walkways but not things like these Pictures of course of native cities on planets colonized at the time of the Federation and even very ancient ones of cities on pre Atomic Terra But these people had contragravity the towering wide spaced city beside this cross gridded anachronism proved that They knew so little about this planet which they had come to bring under Imperial rule It had been colonized thirteen centuries ago during the last burst of expansion before the System States War and the disintegration of the Terran Federation and it had been named Aditya in the fashion of the times for some forgotten deity of some obscure and ancient polytheism A century or so later it had seceded from or been abandoned by the Federation then breaking up That much they had gleaned from old Federation records still existing on Baldur After that darkness lighted only by a brief flicker when more records had turned up on Morglay Morglay was one of the Sword Worlds settled by refugee rebels from the System States planets Mostly they had been soldiers and spacemen there had been many women with them and many were skilled technicians engineers scientists They had managed to carry off considerable equipment with them and for three centuries they had lived in isolation spreading over a dozen hitherto undiscovered planets Excalibur Tizona Gram Morglay Durendal Flamberge Curtana Quernbiter the names were a roll call of fabulous blades of Old Terran legend Then they had erupted suddenly and calamitously into what was left of the Terran Federation as the Space Vikings carrying pillage and destruction until the newborn Empire rose to vanquish them In the sixth Century Pre Empire one of their fleets had come from Morglay to Aditya The Adityans of that time had been near barbarians the descendants of the original settlers had been serfs of other barbarians who had come as mercenaries in the service of one or another of the local chieftains and had remained to loot and rule Subjugating them had been easy the Space Vikings had taken Aditya and made it their home For several centuries there had been communication between them and their home planet Then Morglay had become involved in one of the interplanetary dynastic wars that had begun the decadence of the Space Vikings and again Aditya dropped out of history Until this morning when history returned in the black ships of the Galactic Empire He stubbed out the cigarette and summoned the robot to give him another Shatrak was speaking You see Count Erskyll we really had to do it this way for their own good He wouldn t have credited the commodore with such guile anything was justified according to Obray of Erskyll if done for somebody else s good What we did we just landed suddenly knocked out their army seized the center of government before anybody could do anything If we d landed the way you d wanted us to somebody would have resisted and the next thing we d have had to kill about five or six thousand of them and blow down a couple of towns and we d have lost a lot of our own people doing it You might say we had to do it to save them from themselves Obray of Erskyll seemed to have doubts but before he could articulate them Shatrak s communication screen was calling attention to itself The commodore flicked the switch and his executive officer Captain Patrique Morvill appeared in it We ve just gotten reports sir that some of Ravney s people have captured a half dozen missile launching sites around the city His air reconn tells him that that s the lot of them I have an officer of one of the parties that participated You ought to hear what he has to say sir Well good Vann Shatrak whooshed out his breath I don t mind admitting I was a little on edge about that Wait till you hear what Lieutenant Carmath has to say Morvill seemed to be strangling a laugh Ready for him Commodore Shatrak nodded Morvill made a hand signal and vanished in a flicker of rainbow colors when the screen cleared a young Landing Troop lieutenant in battle dress was looking out of it He saluted and gave his name rank and unit This missile launching site I m occupying sir it s twenty miles north west of the city We took it thirty minutes ago no resistance whatever There are four hundred or so people here Of them twelve one dozen are soldiers The rest are civilians Ten enlisted men a non com of some sort and something that appears to be an officer The officer had a pistol fully loaded The non com had a submachine gun empty with two loaded clips on his belt The privates had rifles empty and no ammunition The officer did not know where the rifle ammunition was stored Shatrak swore The second lieutenant nodded Exactly my comment when he told me sir But this place is beautifully kept up Lawns all mowed trees neatly pruned everything policed up like inspection morning And there is a headquarters office building here adequate for an army division How about the armament Lieutenant Shatrak asked with forced patience Ah yes the armament sir There are eight big launching cradles for panplanetary or off planet missiles They are all polished up like the Crown Jewels But none repeat none of them is operative And there is not a single missile on the installation Shatrak s facial control didn t slip It merely intensified which amounted to the same thing Lieutenant Carmath I am morally certain I heard you correctly but let s just check You said He repeated the lieutenant back almost word for word Carmath nodded That was it sir The missile crypts are stacked full of old photoprints and recording and microfilm spools The sighting and guidance systems for all the launchers are completely missing The letoff mechanisms all lack major parts There is an elaborate set of detection equipment which will detect absolutely nothing I saw a few pairs of binoculars about I suspect that that is what we were first observed with This office now I suppose all the paperwork is up to the minute in quintulplicate and initialed by everybody within sight or hearing I haven t checked on that yet sir If you re thinking of betting on it please don t expect me to cover you though Well thank you Lieutenant Carmath Stick around I m sending down a tech intelligence crew to look at what s left of the place While you re waiting you might sort out whoever seems to be in charge and find out just what in Nifflheim he thinks that launching station was maintained for Illustration I think I can tell you that now Commodore Prince Trevannion said as Shatrak blanked the screen We have a petrified authoritarianism Quite likely some sort of an oligarchy I d guess that this Convocation thing they talk about consists of all the ruling class everybody has equal voice and nobody will take the responsibility for doing anything And the actual work of government is probably handled by a corps of bureaucrats entrenched in their jobs unwilling to exert any effort and afraid to invite any criticism and living only to retire on their pensions I ve seen governments like that before He named a few One thing once a government like that has been bludgeoned into the Empire it rarely makes any trouble later Just to judge by this missileless non launching station Shatrak said they couldn t even decide on what kind of trouble to make or how to start it I think you re going to have a nice easy Proconsulate here Count Erskyll Count Erskyll started to say something No doubt he was about to tell Shatrak cuttingly that he didn t want an easy Proconsulate but an opportunity to help these people He was saved from this by the buzzing of Shatrak s communication screen It was Colonel Pyairr Ravney the Navy Landing Troop commander Like everybody else who had gone down to Zeggensburg he was in battle dress and armed the transpex visor of his helmet was pushed up Between Shatrak s generation and Count Erskyll s he sported a pointed mustache and a spiky chin beard which on his thin and dark eyed face looked distinctly Mephistophelean He was grinning Well sir I think we can call it a done job he said There s a delegation here who want to talk to the Lords Master of the ships on behalf of the Lords Master of the Convocation Two of them with about a dozen portfolio bearers and note takers I m not too good in Lingua Terra outside Basic at best and their brand is far from that I gather that they re some kind of civil servants personal representatives of the top Lords Master Do we want to talk to them Shatrak asked Well we should only talk to the actual titular heads of the government Mastership Erskyll suddenly protocol conscious objected We can t negotiate with subordinates Oh who s talking about negotiating there isn t anything to negotiate Aditya is now a part of the Galactic Empire If this present regime assents to that they can stay in power If not we will toss them out and install a new government We will receive this delegation inform them to that effect and send them back to relay the information to their Lords Master He turned to the Commodore May I speak to Colonel Ravney Shatrak assented He asked Ravney where these Lords Master were Here in the Citadel in what they call the Convocation Chamber Close to a thousand of them screaming recriminations at one another Sounds like feeding time at the Imperial Zoo I think they all want to surrender but nobody dares propose it first I ve just put a cordon around it and placed it off limits to everybody And everything outside off limits to the Convocation Well thought of Colonel I suppose the Citadel teems with bureaucrats and such low life forms Bulging with them Literally thousands Lanze Degbrend and Commander Douvrin and a few others are trying to get some sensible answers out of some of them This delegation how had you thought of sending them up Landing craft to Isobel Isobel will bring them the rest of the way He looked at his watch Well don t be in too much of a rush to get them here Colonel We don t want them till after lunch Delay them on Isobel the skipper can see that they have their own lunch aboard And entertain them with some educational films Something to convince them that there is slightly more to the Empire than one ship of the line two cruisers and four destroyers Count Erskyll was dissatisfied about that too He wanted to see the delegation at once and make arrangements to talk to their superiors Count Erskyll among other things was zealous and of this he disapproved Zealous statesmen perhaps did more mischief than anything in the Galaxy with the possible exception of procrastinating soldiers That could indicate the fundamental difference between statecraft and war He d have to play with that idea a little An Empire ship of the line was almost a mile in diameter It was more than a battle craft it also had political functions The grand salon on the outer zone where the curvature of the floors was less disconcerting was as magnificent as any but a few of the rooms of the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin the floor richly carpeted and the walls alternating mirrors and paintings The movable furniture varied according to occasion at present it consisted of the bare desk at which they sat the three chairs they occupied and the three secretary robots their rectangular black casts blazened with the Sun and Cogwheel of the Empire It faced the door at the far end of the room on either side a rank of spacemen in dress uniform and under arms stood In principle annexing a planet to the Empire was simplicity itself but like so many things simple in principle it was apt to be complicated in practice and to this he suspected the present instance would be no exception In principle one simply informed the planetary government that it was now subject to the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty the Galactic Emperor This information was always conveyed by a Ministerial Secretary directly under the Prime Minister and only one more step down from the Emperor in the present instance Jurgen Prince Trevannion To make sure that the announcement carried conviction the presumedly glad tidings were accompanied by the Imperial Space Navy at present represented by Commodore Vann Shatrak and a seven ship battle line unit and two thousand Imperial Landing Troops When the locals had been properly convinced with as little bloodshed as necessary but always beyond any dispute an Imperial Proconsul in this case Obray Count Erskyll would be installed He would by no means govern the planet The Imperial Constitution was definite on that point every planetary government should be sovereign as to intraplanetary affairs The Proconsul within certain narrow and entirely inelastic limits would merely govern the government Unfortunately Obray Count Erskyll appeared not to understand this completely It was his impression that he was a torch bearer of Imperial civilization or something equally picturesque and metaphorical As he conceived it it was the duty of the Empire as represented by himself to make over backward planets like Aditya in the image of Odin or Marduk or Osiris or Baldur or preferably his own home world of Aton This was Obray of Erskyll s first proconsular appointment it was due to family influence and it was a mistake Mistakes of course were inevitable in anything as large and complex as the Galactic Empire and any institution guided by men was subject to one kind of influence or another family influence being no worse than any other kind In this case the ultra conservative Erskylls of Aton from old Errol Duke of Yorvoy down had become alarmed at the political radicalism of young Obray and had on his graduation from the University of Nefertiti persuaded the Prime Minister to appoint him to a Proconsulate as far from Aton as possible where he would not embarrass them Just at that time more important matters having been gotten out of the way Aditya had come up for annexation and Obray of Erskyll had been named Proconsul That had been the mistake He should have been sent to some planet which had been under Imperial rule for some time where the Proconsulate ran itself in a well worn groove and where he could at leisure learn the procedures and unlearn some of the unrealisms absorbed at the University from professors too well insulated from the realities of politics There was a stir among the guards helmet visors were being snapped down feet scuffed They stiffened to attention the great doors at the other end of the grand salon slid open and the guards presented arms as the Adityan delegation was ushered in There were fourteen of them They all wore ankle length gowns and they all had shaven heads The one in the lead carried a staff and wore a pale green gown he was apparently a herald Behind him came two in white gowns their empty hands folded on their breasts one was a huge bulk of obesity with a bulging brow protuberant eyes and a pursey little mouth and the other was thin and cadaverous with a skull like almost fleshless face The ones behind in dark green and pale blue carried portfolios and slung sound recorder cases There was a metallic twinkle at each throat as they approached he could see that they all wore large silver gorgets They came to a halt twenty feet from the desk The herald raised his staff I present the Admirable and Trusty Tchall Hozhet personal chief slave of the Lord Master Olvir Nikkolon Chairman of the Presidium of the Lords Master s Convocation and Khreggor Chmidd chief slave in office to the Lord Master Rovard Javasan Chief of Administration of Management of the Mastership he said Then he stopped puzzled looking from one to another of them When his eyes fell on Vann Shatrak he brightened Are you he asked the chief slave of the chief Lord Master of this ship Shatrak s face turned pink the pink darkened to red He used a word it was a completely unprintable word So except for a few scattered pronouns conjunctions and prepositions were the next fifty words he used The herald stiffened The two delegates behind him were aghast The subordinate burden bearers in the rear began looking around apprehensively I Shatrak finally managed am an officer of his Imperial Majesty s Space Navy I am in command of this battle line unit I am not he reverted briefly to obscenity a slave You mean you are a Lord Master too That seemed to horrify the herald even more that the things Shatrak had been calling him Forgive me Lord Master I did not think That s right you didn t Shatrak agreed And don t call me Lord Master again or I ll Just a moment Commodore He waved the herald aside and addressed the two in white gowns shifting to Lingua Terra This is a ship of the Galactic Empire he told them In the Empire there are no slaves Can you understand that Evidently not The huge one Khreggor Chmidd turned to the skull faced Tchall Hozhet saying Then they must all be Lords Master He saw the objection to that at once But how can one be a Lord Master if there are no slaves The horror was not all on the visitors side of the desk either Obray of Erskyll was staring at the delegation and saying Slaves under his breath Obray of Erskyll had never in his not too long life seen a slave before They can t be Tchall Hozhet replied A Lord Master is one who owns slaves He gave that a moment s consideration But if they aren t Lords Master they must be slaves and No That wouldn t do either But a slave is one who belongs to a Lord Master Rule of the Excluded Third evidently Pre Atomic formal logic had crept back to Aditya Chmidd looking around saw the ranks of spacemen on either side now at parade rest But aren t they slaves he asked They are spacemen of the Imperial Navy Shatrak roared Call one a slave to his face and you ll get a rifle butt in yours And I shan t lift a finger to stop it He glared at Chmidd and Hozhet Who had the infernal impudence to send slaves to deal with the Empire He needs to be taught a lesson Why I was sent by the Lord Master Olvir Nikkolon and Tchall Chmidd hissed at him We cannot speak to Lords Master We must speak to their chief slaves But they have no slaves Hozhet objected Didn t you hear the the one with the small beard say so But 
5717_100145_000019_000001	train-clean-360	that s ridiculous 
none	none	Khreggor Who does the work and who tells them what to do Who told these people to come here Our Emperor sent us That is his picture behind me But we are not his slaves He is merely the chief man among us Do your Masters not have one among them who is chief That s right Chmidd said to Hozhet In the Convocation your Lord Master is chief and in the Mastership my Lord Master Rovard Javasan is chief But they don t tell the other Lords Master what to do In Convocation the other Lords Master tell them That s what I meant about an oligarchy he whispered in Imperial to Erskyll Suppose we tell Ravney to herd these Lords Master onto a couple of landing craft and bring them up here Shatrak suggested He made the suggestion in Lingua Terra Basic and loudly I think we can manage without that He raised his voice speaking in Lingua Terra Basic It does not matter whether these slaves talk to us or not This planet is now under the rule of his Imperial Majesty Rodrik III If this Mastership wants to govern the planet under the Emperor they may do so If not we will make an end of them and set up a new government here He paused Chmidd and Hozhet were looking at one another in shocked incredulity Tchall they mean it Chmidd said They can do it too We have nothing more to say to you slaves he continued Hereafter we will speak directly to the Lords Master But The Lords Master never do business directly Hozhet said It is un Masterly Such discussions are between chief slaves This thing they call the Convocation Shatrak mentioned I wonder if the members have the business done entirely through their slaves Oh no That shocked Chmidd into direct address No slave is allowed in the Convocation Chamber He wondered how they kept the place swept out Robots no doubt Or else what happened when the Masters weren t there didn t count Very well Your people have recorders are they on Hozhet asked Chmidd Chmidd asked the herald who asked one of the menials in the rear who asked somebody else The reply came back through the same channels they were Very well At this time tomorrow we will speak to the Convocation of Lords Master Commodore Shatrak see to it that Colonel Ravney has them in the Convocation Chamber and that preparations in the room are made so that we may address them in the dignity befitting representatives of his Imperial Majesty He turned to the Adityan slaves That is all You have permission to go They watched the delegation back out with the honor guard following When the doors had closed behind them Shatrak ran his hand over his bald head and laughed Shaved heads every one of them That s probably why they thought I was your slave Bet those gorgets are servile badges too He touched the Knight s Star of the Order of the Empire at his throat Probably thought that was what this was We would have to draw something like this They simply can t imagine anybody not being either a slave or a slave owner Erskyll was saying That must mean that there is no free non slave holding class at all Universal slavery Well we ll have to do something about that Proclaim total emancipation immediately Oh no we can t do anything like that The Constitution won t permit us to Section Two Article One Every Empire planet shall be self governed as to its own affairs in the manner of its own choice and without interference But slavery Section Two Article Six Erskyll objected There shall be no chattel slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire no sapient being of any race whatsoever shall be the property of any being but himself That s correct he agreed If this Mastership intends to remain the planetary government under the Empire they will be obliged to abolish slavery but they will have to do it by their own act We cannot do it for them You know what I d do Prince Trevannion Shatrak said I d just heave this Mastership thing out and set up a nice tight military dictatorship We have the planet under martial rule now let s just keep it that way for about five years till we can train a new government That suggestion seemed to pain Count Erskyll almost as much as the existing situation They dined late in Commodore Shatrak s private dining room Beside Shatrak Erskyll and himself there were Lanze Degbrend and Count Erskyll s charge d affaires Sharll Ernanday and Patrique Morvill and Pyairr Ravney and the naval intelligence officer Commander Andrey Douvrin Ordinarily he deplored serious discussion at meals but under the circumstances it was unavoidable nobody could think or talk of anything else The discussion which he had hoped would follow the meal began before the soup course We have a total population of about twenty million Lanze Degbrend reported A trifle over ten thousand Masters all ages and both sexes The remainder are all slaves I find that incredible Erskyll declared promptly Twenty million people held in slavery by ten thousand Why do they stand for it Why don t they rebel Well I can think of three good reasons Douvrin said Three square meals a day Illustration And no responsibilities no need to make decisions Degbrend added They ve been slaves for seven and a half centuries They don t even know the meaning of freedom and it would frighten them if they did Chain of command Shatrak said When that seemed not to convey any meaning to Erskyll he elaborated We have a lot of dirty necked working slaves Over every dozen of them is an overseer with a big whip and a stungun Over every couple of overseers there is a guard with a submachine gun Over them is a supervisor who doesn t need a gun because he can grab a handphone and call for troops Over the supervisors there are higher supervisors Everybody has it just enough better than the level below him that he s afraid of losing his job and being busted back to fieldhand That s it exactly Commodore Degbrend said The whole society is a slave hierarchy Everybody curries favor with the echelon above and keeps his eye on the echelon below to make sure he isn t being undercut We have something not too unlike that ourselves Any organizational society is in some ways like a slave society And everything is determined by established routine The whole thing has simply been running on momentum for at least five centuries and if we hadn t come smashing in with a situation none of the routines covered it would have kept on running for another five till everything wore out and stopped I heard about those missile stations by the way They re typical of everything here That s another thing Erskyll interrupted These Lords Master are the descendants of the old Space Vikings and the slaves of the original inhabitants The Space Vikings were a technologically advanced people they had all the old Terran Federation science and technology and a lot they developed for themselves on the Sword Worlds Well They still had a lot of it on the Sword Worlds two centuries ago when we took them over But technology always drives out slavery that s a fundamental law of socio economics Slavery is economically unsound it cannot compete with power industry let alone cybernetics and robotics He was tempted to remind young Obray of Erskyll that there were no such things as fundamental laws of socio economics merely usually reliable generalized statements of what can more or less be depended upon to happen under most circumstances He resisted the temptation Count Erskyll had had enough shocks today without adding to them by gratuitous blasphemy In this case Obray it worked in reverse The Space Vikings enslaved the Adityans to hold them in subjugation That was a politico military necessity Then being committed to slavery with a slave population who had to be made to earn their keep they found cybernetics and robotics economically unsound And almost at once they began appointing slave overseers and the technicians would begin training slave assistants Then there would be slave supervisors to direct the overseers slave administrators to direct them slave secretaries and bookkeepers slave technicians and engineers How about the professions Lanze All slave Slave physicians teachers everything like that All the Masters are taught by slaves the slaves are educated by apprenticeship The courts are in the hands of slaves cases are heard by the chief slaves of judges who don t even know where their own courtrooms are every Master has a team of slave lawyers Most of the lawsuits are estate inheritance cases some of them have been in litigation for generations What do the Lords Master do Shatrak asked Masterly things Degbrend replied I was only down there since noon but from what I could find out that consists of feasting making love to each other s wives being entertained by slave performers and feuding for social precedence like wealthy old ladies on Odin You got this from the slaves How did you get them to talk Lanze Degbrend and Ravney exchanged amused glances Ravney said Well I detailed a sergeant and six privates to accompany Honorable Degbrend Ravney said They How would you put it Lanze I asked a slave a question If he refused to answer somebody knocked him down with a rifle butt Degbrend replied I never had to do that more than once in any group and I only had to do it three times in all After that when I asked questions I was answered promptly and fully It is surprising how rapidly news gets around the Citadel You mean you had those poor slaves beaten Erskyll demanded Oh no Beating implies repeated blows We only gave one to a customer that was enough Well how about the army if that s what those people in the long red brown coats were Shatrak changed the subject by asking Ravney All slave of course officers and all What will we do about them sir I have about three thousand either confined to their barracks or penned up in the Citadel I requisitioned food for them paid for it in chits There were a few isolated companies and platoons that gave us something of a fight most of them just threw away their weapons and bawled for quarter I ve segregated the former with your approval I ll put them under Imperial officers and noncoms for a quickie training in our tactics and then use them to train the rest Do that Pyairr We only have two thousand men of our own and that s not enough Do you think you can make soldiers out of any of them Yes I believe so sir They are trained organized and armed for civil order work which is what we ll need them for ourselves In the entire history of this army all they have done has been to overawe unarmed slaves I am sure they have never been in combat with regular troops They have an elaborate set of training and field regulations for the sort of work for which they were intended What they encountered today was entirely outside those regulations which is why they behaved as they did Did you have any trouble getting cooperation from the native officers Shatrak asked Not in the least They cooperated quite willingly if not always too intelligently I simply told them that they were now the personal property of his Imperial Majesty Rodrik III They were quite flattered by the change of ownership If ordered to I believe that they would fire on their former Lords Master without hesitation You told those slaves that they belonged to the Emperor Count Erskyll was aghast He stared at Ravney for an instant then snatched up his brandy glass the meal had gotten to that point and drained it at a gulp The others watched solicitously while he coughed and spluttered over it Commodore Shatrak he said sternly I hope that you will take severe disciplinary action this is the most outrageous I ll do nothing of the sort Shatrak retorted The colonel is to be commended did the best thing he could under the circumstances What are you going to do when slavery is abolished here Colonel Oh tell them that they have been given their freedom as a special reward for meritorious service and then sign them up for a five year enlistment That might work Again it might not I think Colonel that before you do that you had better disarm them again You might possibly have some trouble otherwise Ravney looked at him sharply They might not want to be free I d thought of that Nonsense Erskyll declared Who ever heard of slaves rebelling against freedom Freedom was a Good Thing It was a Good Thing for everybody everywhere and all the time Count Erskyll knew it because freedom was a Good Thing for him He thought suddenly of an old tomcat belonging to a lady of his acquaintance at Paris on Baldur a most affectionate cat who insisted on catching mice and bringing them as presents to all his human friends To this cat s mind it was inconceivable that anybody would not be most happy to receive a nice fresh killed mouse Too bad we have to set any of them free Vann Shatrak said Too bad we can t just issue everybody new servile gorgets marked Personal Property of his Imperial Majesty and let it go at that But I guess we can t Commodore Shatrak you are joking Erskyll began I hope I am Shatrak replied grimly The top landing stage of the Citadel grew and filled the forward viewscreen of the ship s launch It was only when he realized that the tiny specks were people and the larger birdseed sized specks vehicles that the real size of the thing was apparent Obray of Erskyll beside him had been silent He had been looking at the crescent shaped industrial city like a servile gorget around Zeggensburg s neck The way they ve been crowded together he said And the buildings no space between And all that smoke They must be using fossil fuel It s probably too hard to process fissionables in large quantities with what they have You were right last evening These people have deliberately halted progress even retrogressed rather than give up slavery Halting progress to say nothing of retrogression was an unthinkable crime to him Like freedom progress was a Good Thing anywhere at all times and without regard to direction Colonel Ravney met them when they left the launch The top landing stage was swarming with Imperial troops Convocation Chamber s three stages down he said About two thousand of them there now been coming in all morning We have everything set up He laughed They tell me slaves are never permitted to enter it Maybe but they have the place bugged to the ceiling all around Bugged What with Shatrak asked and Erskyll was wanting to know what he meant No doubt he thought Ravney was talking about things crawling out of the woodwork Screen pickups radio pickups wired microphones you name it and it s there I ll bet every slave in the Citadel knows everything that happens in there while it s happening Shatrak wanted to know if he had done anything about them Ravney shook his head If that s how they want to run a government that s how they have a right to run it Commander Douvrin put in a few of our own a little better camouflaged than theirs There were more troops on the third stage down They formed a procession down a long empty hallway a few scared looking slaves peeping from doorways at them There were more troops where the corridor ended in great double doors emblazoned with a straight broad sword diagonally across an eight pointed star Emblematology of planets conquered by the Space Vikings always included swords and stars An officer gave a signal the doors started to slide apart and within from a screen speaker came a fanfare of trumpets At first all he could see was the projection screen far ahead and the tessellated aisle stretching toward it The trumpets stopped and they advanced and then he saw the Lords Master They were massed standing among benches on either side and if anything Pyairr Ravney had understated their numbers They all wore black trimmed with gold he wondered if the coincidence that these were also the Imperial colors might be useful Queer garments tightly fitted tunics at the top which became flowing robes below the waist deeply scalloped at the edges The sleeves were exaggeratedly wide a knife or a pistol and not necessarily a small one could be concealed in every one He was sure that thought had entered Vann Shatrak s mind They were armed not with dress daggers but with swords long straight cross hilted broadswords They were the first actual swords he had ever seen except in museums or on the stage There was a bench of gold and onyx at the front where normally the seven man Presidium sat and in front of it were thronelike seats for the Chiefs of Managements equivalent to the Imperial Council of Ministers Because of the projection screen that had been installed they had all been moved to an improvised dais on the left There was another dais on the right under a canopy of black and gold velvet emblazoned with the gold sun and superimposed black cogwheel of the Empire There were three thrones for himself Shatrak and Erskyll and a number of lesser but still imposing chairs for their staffs They took their seats He slipped the earplug of his memophone into his left ear and pressed the stud in the middle of his Grand Star of the Order of Odin The memophone began giving him the names of the Presidium and of the Chiefs of Managements He wondered how many upper slaves had been gunbutted to produce them Lords and Gentlemen he said after he had greeted them and introduced himself and the others I speak to you in the name of his Imperial Majesty Rodrik III His Majesty will now greet you in his own voice by recording He pressed a button on the arm of his chair The screen lighted flickered and steadied and the trumpets blared again When the fanfare ended a voice thundered The Emperor speaks Rodrik III compromised on the beard question with a small mustache He wore the stern but kindly expression the best theatrical directors in Asgard had taught him Public Face Number Three He inclined his head slightly and stiffly as a man wearing a seven pound crown must We greet our subjects of Aditya to the fellowship of the Empire We have long had good reports of you and we are happy now to speak to you Deserve well of us and prosper under the Sun and Cogwheel Another fanfare as the image vanished Before any of the Lords Master could find voice he was speaking to them Well Lords and Gentlemen you have been welcomed into the Empire by his Majesty I know there hasn t been a ship in or out of this system for five centuries and I suppose you have a great many questions to ask about the Galactic Empire Members of the Presidium and Chiefs of Managements may address me directly others will please address the chairman Olvir Nikkolon the owner of Tchall Hozhet was on his feet at once He had a loose lipped mouth and a not entirely straight nose and pale eyes that were never entirely still What I want to know is why did you people have to come here to take our planet away from us Isn t the rest of the Galaxy big enough for you No Lord Nikkolon The Galaxy is not big enough for any competition of sovereignty There must be one and only one completely sovereign power The Terran Federation was once such a power It failed and vanished you know what followed Darkness and anarchy We are clawing our way up out of that darkness We will not fail We will create a peaceful and unified Galaxy He talked to them about the collapse of the old Federation about the interstellar wars about the Neobarbarians about the long night He told them how the Empire had risen on a few planets five thousand light years away and how it had spread We will not repeat the mistakes of the Terran Federation We will not attempt to force every planetary government into a common pattern or dictate the ways in which they govern themselves We will foster in every way peaceful trade and communication But we will not again permit the plague of competing sovereignties the condition under which war is inevitable The first attempt to set up such a sovereignty in competition with the Empire will be crushed mercilessly and no planet inhabited by any sapient race will be permitted to remain outside the Empire Lords and Gentlemen permit me to show you a little of what we have already accomplished in the past three hundred years He pressed another button The screen flickered and the show started It lasted for almost two hours he used a handphone to interject comments and explanations He showed them planet after planet Marduk where the Empire had begun Baldur Vishnu Belphegor Morglay whence their ancestors had come Amaterasu Irminsul Fafnir finally Odin the Imperial Planet He showed towering cities swarming with aircars spaceports where the huge globes of interstellar ships landed and lifted out farms and industries vast crowds at public celebrations troop reviews and naval bases and fleet maneuvers historical views of the battles that had created Imperial power That Lords and Gentlemen is what you have an opportunity to bring your planet into If you accept you will continue to rule Aditya under the Empire If you refuse you will only put us to the inconvenience of replacing you with a new planetary government which will be annoying for us and probably fatal for you Nobody said anything for a few minutes Then Rovard Javasan the Chief of Administration and the owner of the mountainous Khreggor Chmidd rose Lords and Gentlemen we cannot resist anything like this he said We cannot even resist the force they have here that was tried yesterday and you all saw what happened Now Prince Trevannion just to what extent will the Mastership retain its sovereignty under the Empire To practically the same extent as at present You will of course acknowledge the Emperor as your supreme ruler and will govern subject to the Imperial Constitution Have you any colonies on any of the other planets of this system We had a shipyard and docks on the inner moon and we had mines on the fourth planet of this system but it is almost airless and the colony was limited to a couple of dome cities Both were abandoned years ago Both will be reopened before long I daresay We d better make the limits of your sovereignty the orbit of the outer planet of this system You may have your own normal space ships but the Empire will control all hyperdrive craft and all nuclear weapons I take it you are the sole government on this planet Then no other will be permitted to compete with you Illustration Well what are they taking away from us then somebody in the rear asked I assume that you are agreed to accept the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty Good 
5717_100145_000002_000002	train-clean-360	As a matter of form Lord Nikkolon will you take a vote His Imperial Majesty would be most gratified if it were unanimous 
5717_100145_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Somebody insisted that the question would have to be debated which meant that everybody would have to make a speech all two thousand of them 
5717_100145_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He informed them that there was nothing to debate they were confronted with an accomplished fact which they must accept 
5717_100145_000003_000002	train-clean-360	So Nikkolon made a speech telling them at what a great moment in Adityan history they stood and concluded by saying 
5717_100145_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I take it that it is the unanimous will of this Convocation that the sovereignty of the Galactic Emperor be acknowledged and that we the Mastership of Aditya do here proclaim our loyal allegiance to his Imperial Majesty Rodrik the Third 
5717_100145_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Any dissent 
5717_100145_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Then it is ordered so recorded 
5717_100145_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Then he had to make another speech to inform the representatives of his new sovereign of the fact 
none	none	Prince Trevannion in the name of the Emperor delivered the well worn words of welcome and Lanze Degbrend got the coronet out of the black velvet bag under his arm and the Imperial Proconsul Obray Count Erskyll was crowned 
5717_100145_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Erskyll s charge d affaires Sharll Ernanday produced the scroll of the Imperial Constitution and Erskyll began to read 
5717_100145_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Section One The universality of the Empire 
5717_100145_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The absolute powers of the Emperor 
none	none	The rules of succession 
5717_100145_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The Emperor also to be Planetary King of Odin 
5717_100145_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Section Two Every planetary government to be sovereign in its own internal affairs 
5717_100145_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Only one sovereign government upon any planet or within normal space travel distance 
5717_100145_000007_000002	train-clean-360	All hyperspace ships and all nuclear weapons 
none	none	No planetary government shall make war enter into any alliance tax regulate or restrain interstellar trade or communication 
5717_100145_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Every sapient being shall be equally protected 
5717_100145_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Then he came to Article Six 
5717_100145_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He cleared his throat raised his voice and read 
none	none	There shall be no chattel slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire no sapient being of any race whatsoever shall be the property of any being but himself 
5717_100145_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The Convocation Chamber was silent like a bomb with a defective fuse for all of thirty seconds 
5717_100145_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Then it blew up with a roar 
5717_100145_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Out of the corner of his eye he saw the doors slide apart and an airjeep bristling with machine guns float in and rise to the ceiling 
5717_100145_000010_000003	train-clean-360	The first inarticulate roar was followed by a babel of voices like a tropical cloudburst on a prefab hut 
5717_100145_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Olvir Nikkolon s mouth was working as he shouted unheard 
none	none	He pressed another of the row of buttons on the arm of his chair 
5717_100145_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Out of the screen speaker a voice as loud by actual sound meter test as an anti vehicle gun thundered 
none	none	SILENCE Into the shocked stillness which it produced he spoke like a schoolmaster who has returned to find his room in an uproar Lord Nikkolon what is this nonsense You are Chairman of the Presidium is this how you keep order here 
5717_100145_000014_000002	train-clean-360	What is this a planetary parliament or a spaceport saloon 
5717_100145_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You tricked us Nikkolon accused 
5717_100145_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 You didn t tell us about that article when we voted 
5717_100145_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Why our whole society is based on slavery 
5717_100145_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Other voices joined in 
5717_100145_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 That s all right for you people you have robots 
none	none	Maybe you don t know it but there are twenty million slaves on this planet
5717_100145_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Look you can t free slaves 
none	none	That s ridiculous A slave s a slave Who ll do the work And who would they belong to They d have to belong to somebody What I want to know Rovard Javasan made himself heard is how are you going to free them There was an ancient word originating in one of the lost languages of Pre Atomic Terra sixtifor 
5717_100145_000022_000001	train-clean-360	It meant the basic fundamental question 
5717_100145_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Rovard Javasan he suspected had just asked the sixtifor 
5717_100145_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Of course Obray Count Erskyll Planetary Proconsul of Aditya didn t realize that 
5717_100145_000022_000004	train-clean-360	He didn t even know what Javasan meant 
5717_100145_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Just free them Commodore Vann Shatrak couldn t see much of a problem either 
5717_100145_000022_000006	train-clean-360	He would have answered Just free them and then shoot down the first two or three thousand who took it seriously 
5717_100145_000022_000007	train-clean-360	Jurgen Prince Trevannion had no intention whatever of attempting to answer the sixtifor 
5717_100145_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Lord Javasan that is the problem of the Adityan Mastership They are your slaves we have neither the intention nor the right to free them 
5717_100145_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But let me remind you that slavery is specifically prohibited by the Imperial Constitution if you do not abolish it immediately the Empire will be forced to intervene 
5717_100145_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I believe toward the last of those audio visuals you saw some examples of Imperial intervention 
none	none	They had A few looked apprehensively at the ceiling as though expecting the hellburners and planet busters and nega matter bombs at any moment Then one of the members among the benches rose We don t know how we are going to do it Prince Trevannion he said We will do it since this is the Empire law but you will have to tell us how
5717_100145_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the first thing will have to be an Act of Convocation outlawing the ownership of one being by another 
none	none	Set some definite date on which the slaves must all be freed that need not be too immediate 
5717_100145_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Then I would suggest that you set up some agency to handle all the details And as soon as you have enacted the abolition of slavery which should be this afternoon appoint a committee say a dozen of you to confer with Count Erskyll and myself 
none	none	Say you have your committee aboard the Empress Eulalie in six hours We ll have transportation arranged by then 
5717_100145_000026_000005	train-clean-360	And let me point out I hope for the last time that we discuss matters directly without intermediaries 
5717_100145_000026_000006	train-clean-360	We don t want any more slaves pardon freedmen coming aboard to talk for you as happened yesterday 
5717_100145_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Obray Count Erskyll was unhappy about it 
5717_100145_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He did not think that the Lords Master were to be trusted to abolish slavery he said so on the launch returning to the ship 
5717_100145_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Jurgen Prince Trevannion was inclined to agree 
none	none	He doubted if any of the Lords Master he had seen were to be trusted unassisted to fix a broken mouse trap 
5717_100145_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Line Commodore Vann Shatrak was also worried 
5717_100145_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He was wondering how long it would take for Pyairr Ravney to make useful troops out of the newly surrendered slave soldiers and where he was going to find contragravity to shift them expeditiously from trouble spot to trouble spot 
5717_100145_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Erskyll thought he was anticipating resistance on the part of the Masters and for once he approved the use of force 
5717_100145_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Ordinarily force was a Bad Thing but this was a Good Cause which justified any means 
5717_100145_000029_000000	train-clean-360	They entertained the committee from the Convocation for dinner that evening 
5717_100145_000029_000001	train-clean-360	They came aboard stiffly hostile most understandably so under the circumstances and Prince Trevannion exerted all his copious charm to thaw them out beginning with the pre dinner cocktails and continuing through the meal 
5717_100145_000029_000002	train-clean-360	By the time they retired for coffee and brandy to the parlor where the conference was to be held the Lords ex Masters were almost friendly 
5717_100145_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve enacted the Emancipation Act Olvir Nikkolon who was ex officio chairman of the committee reported 
none	none	Every slave on the planet must be free before the opening of the next Midyear Feasts
5717_100145_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 And when will that be 
5717_100145_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Aditya he knew had a three hundred and fifty eight day year even if the Midyear Feasts were just past they were giving themselves very little time 
5717_100145_000032_000001	train-clean-360	In about a hundred and fifty days Nikkolon said 
5717_100145_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Good heavens Erskyll began indignantly 
5717_100145_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I should say so myself he put in cutting off anything else the new Proconsul might have said 
none	none	You gentlemen are allowing yourselves dangerously little time 
5717_100145_000034_000002	train-clean-360	A hundred and fifty days will pass quite rapidly and you have twenty million slaves to deal with 
5717_100145_000034_000003	train-clean-360	If you start at this moment and work continuously you ll have a little under a second apiece for each slave 
5717_100145_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The Lords Master looked dismayed 
5717_100145_000035_000001	train-clean-360	So he was happy to observe did Count Erskyll 
none	none	I assume you have some system of slave registration he continued 
5717_100145_000037_000000	train-clean-360	That was safe 
5717_100145_000037_000001	train-clean-360	They had a bureaucracy and bureaucracies tend to have registrations of practically everything 
5717_100145_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes of course Rovard Javasan assured him 
5717_100145_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 That s your Management isn t it Sesar Servile Affairs 
5717_100145_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes we have complete data on every slave on the planet Sesar Martwynn the Chief of Servile Management said 
none	none	Of course I d have to ask Zhorzh about the details Zhorzh was Zhorzh Khouzhik Martwynn s chief slave in office At least he was my chief slave now you people have taken him away from me I don t know what I m going to do without him For that matter I don t know what poor Zhorzh will do either
5717_100145_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you gentlemen informed your chief slaves that they are free yet 
5717_100145_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Nikkolon and Javasan looked at each other 
none	none	Sesar Martwynn laughed
5717_100145_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 They know Javasan said 
5717_100145_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I must say they are much disturbed 
none	none	Well reassure them as soon as you re back at the Citadel he told them Tell them that while they are now free they need not leave you unless they so desire that you will provide for them as before
5717_100145_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean we can keep our chief slaves somebody cried 
5717_100145_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes of course chief freedmen you ll have to call them now 
none	none	You ll have to pay them a salary
5717_100145_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean give them money Ranal Valdry the Lord Provost Marshal demanded incredulously 
5717_100145_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Pay our own slaves 
5717_100145_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 You idiot somebody told him they aren t our slaves any more 
5717_100145_000049_000001	train-clean-360	That s the whole point of this discussion 
5717_100145_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 But but how can we pay slaves one of the committeemen at large asked 
5717_100145_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 Freedmen I mean 
5717_100145_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 With money 
5717_100145_000051_000001	train-clean-360	You do have money haven t you 
5717_100145_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course we have 
none	none	What do you think we are savages
5717_100145_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 What kind of money 
5717_100145_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Why money what did he think 
5717_100145_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The unit was the star piece the stelly When he asked to see some of it they were indignant 
5717_100145_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Nobody carried money wasn t Masterly 
5717_100145_000054_000003	train-clean-360	A Master never even touched the stuff that was what slaves were for 
5717_100145_000054_000004	train-clean-360	He wanted to know how it was secured and they didn t know what he meant and when he tried to explain their incomprehension deepened 
5717_100145_000054_000005	train-clean-360	It seemed that the Mastership issued money to finance itself and individual Masters issued money on their personal credit and it was handled through the Mastership Banks 
none	none	That s Fedrig Daffysan s Management he isn t here Rovard Javasan said
5717_100145_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t explain it myself 
none	none	And without his chief slave Fedrig Daffysan probably would not be able to either Yes gentlemen I understand You have money Now the first thing you will have to do is furnish us with a complete list of all the slave owners on the planet and a list of all the slaves held by each This will be sent back to Odin and will be the basis for the compensation to be paid for the destruction of your property rights in these slaves How much is a slave worth by the way Nobody knew Slaves were never sold it wasn t Masterly to sell one s slaves It wasn t even heard of Well we ll arrive at some valuation Now as soon as you get back to the Citadel talk at once to your former chief slaves and their immediate subordinates and explain the situation to them This can be passed down through administrative freedmen to the workers you must see to it that it is clearly understood at all levels that as long as the freedmen remain at their work they will be provided for and paid but that if they quit your service they will receive nothing Do you think you can do that You mean give them everything we ve been giving them now and then pay them money Ranal Valdry almost howled Oh no You pay them a fixed wage You charge them for everything you give them and deduct that from their wages It will mean considerable extra bookkeeping but outside of that I believe you ll find that things will go along much as they always did The Masters had begun to relax and by the time he was finished all of them were smiling in relief Count Erskyll on the other hand was almost writhing in his chair It must be horrible to be a brilliant young Proconsul of liberal tendencies and to have to sit mute while a cynical old Ministerial Secretary vastly one s superior in the Imperial Establishment and a distant cousin of the Emperor to boot calmly bartered away the sacred liberties of twenty million people But would that be legal under the Imperial Constitution Olvir Nikkolon asked I shouldn t have suggested it if it hadn t been The Constitution only forbids physical ownership of one sapient being by another it emphatically does not guarantee anyone an unearned livelihood The Convocation committee returned to Zeggensburg to start preparing the servile population for freedom or reasonable facsimile The chief slaves would take care of that each one seemed to have a list of other chief slaves and the word would spread from them on an each one call five system The public announcement would be postponed until the word could be passed out to the upper servile levels A meeting with the chief slaves in office of the various Managements was scheduled for the next afternoon Count Erskyll chatted with forced affability while the departing committeemen were being seen to the launch that would take them down When the airlock closed behind them he drew Prince Trevannion aside out of earshot of their subordinates You know what you re doing he raged in a hoarse whisper You re simply substituting peonage for outright slavery I d call that something of a step He motioned Erskyll into one of the small hall cars climbed in beside him and lifted it starting toward the living area The Convocation has acknowledged the principle that sapient beings should not be property That s a great deal for one day But the people will remain in servitude you know that The Masters will keep them in debt and they ll be treated just as brutally Oh there will be abuses that s to be expected This Freedmen s Management nee Servile Management will have to take care of that Better make a memo to talk with this chief freedman of Martwynn s what s his name Zhorzh Khouzhik that s right let Zhorzh do it Employment Practices Code investigation agency enforcement If he can t do the job that s not our fault The Empire does not guarantee every planet an honest intelligent and efficient government just a single one But It will take two or three generations At first the freedmen will be exploited just as they always have been but in time there will be protests and disorders and each time there will be some small improvement A society must evolve Obray Let these people earn their freedom Then they will be worthy of it They should have their freedom now This present generation What do you think freedom means to them We don t have to work any more So down tools and let everything stop at once We can do anything we want to Let s kill the overseer And Anything that belongs to the Masters belongs to us we re Masters too now No I think it s better for the present to tell them that this freedom business is just a lot of Masterly funny talk and that things aren t really being changed at all It will effect a considerable saving of his Imperial Majesty s ammunition for one thing He dropped Erskyll at his apartment and sent the hall car back from his own Lanze Degbrend was waiting for him when he entered Ravney s having trouble That is the word he used Degbrend said In Pyairr Ravney s lexicon trouble meant shooting The news of the Emancipation Act is leaking all over the place Some of the troops in the north who haven t been disarmed yet are mutinying and there are slave insurrections in a number of places They think the Masters have forsaken them and it s every slave for himself He hadn t expected that to start so soon The announcement had better go out as quickly as possible And I think we re going to have some trouble You have information taps into Count Erskyll s numerous staff Use them as much as you can You think he s going to try to sabotage this employment programme of yours sir Oh he won t think of it in those terms He ll be preventing me from sabotaging the Emancipation He doesn t want to wait three generations he wants to free them at once Everything has to be at once for six month old puppies six year old children and reformers of any age The announcement did not go out until nearly noon the next day In terms comprehensible to any low grade submoron it was emphasized that all this meant was that slaves should henceforth be called freedmen that they could have money just like Lords Master and that if they worked faithfully and obeyed orders they would be given everything they were now receiving Ravney had been shuttling troops about dealing with the sporadic outbreaks of disorder here and there many of these had been put down and the rest died out after the telecast explaining the situation In addition some of Commander Douvrin s intelligence people had discovered that the only source of fissionables and radioactives for the planet was a complex of uranite mines separation plants refineries and reaction plants on the smaller of Aditya s two continents Austragonia In spite of other urgent calls on his resources Ravney landed troops to seize these and a party of engineers followed them down from the Empress Eulalie to make an inspection At lunch Count Erskyll was slightly less intransigent on the subject of the wage employment proposals No doubt some of his advisors had been telling him what would happen if any appreciable number of Aditya s labor force stopped work suddenly and the wave of uprisings that had broken out before any public announcement had been made puzzled him He was also concerned about finding a suitable building for a proconsular palace the business of the Empire on Aditya could not be conducted long from shipboard Going down to the Citadel that afternoon they found the chief freedmen of the non functional Chiefs of Management assembled in a large room on the fifth level down There was a cluster of big tables and communication screens and wired telephones in the middle with smaller tables around them at which freedmen in variously colored gowns sat The ones at the central tables a dozen and a half all wore chief slaves white gowns Trevannion and Erskyll and Patrique Morvill and Lanze Degbrend joined these subordinates guided the rest of the party a couple of Ravney s officers and Erskyll s numerous staff of advisors and specialists to distribute themselves with their opposite numbers in the Mastership Everybody on the Adityan side seemed uneasy with these strange hermaphrodite creatures who were neither slaves nor Lords Master Well gentlemen Count Erskyll began I suppose you have been informed by your former Lords Master of how relations between them and you will be in the future Oh yes Lord Proconsul Khreggor Chmidd replied happily Everything will be just as before except that the Lords Master will be called Lords Employer and the slaves will be called freedmen and any time they want to starve to death they can leave their Employers if they wish Count Erskyll frowned That wasn t just exactly what he had hoped Emancipation would mean to these people Nobody seems to understand about this money thing though Zhorzh Khouzhik Sesar Martwynn s chief freedman said My Lord Master He slapped himself across the mouth and said Lord Employer five times rapidly My Lord Employer tried to explain it to me but I don t think he understands very clearly himself None of them do The speaker was a small man with pale eyes and a mouth like a rat trap Yakoop Zhannar chief freedman to Ranal Valdry the Provost Marshal Its really your idea Prince Trevannion Erskyll said Perhaps you can explain it Oh it s very simple You see At least it had seemed simple when he started Labor was a commodity which the worker sold and the employer purchased a fair wage was one which enabled both to operate at a profit Everybody knew that except here on Aditya On Aditya a slave worked because he was a slave and a Master provided for him because he was a Master and that was all there was to it But now it seemed there weren t any more Masters and there weren t any more slaves That s exactly it he replied when somebody said as much So now if the slaves I mean freedmen want to eat they have to work to earn money to buy food and if the Employers want work done they have to pay people to do it Illustration Then why go to all the trouble about the money That was an elderly chief freedman Mykhyl Eschkhaffar whose Lord Employer Oraze Borztall was Manager of Public Works Before your ships came the slaves worked for the Masters and the Masters took care of the slaves and everybody was content Why not leave it like that Because the Galactic Emperor who is the Lord Master of these people says that there must be no more slaves Don t ask me why Tchall Hozhet snapped at him I don t know either But they are here with ships and guns and soldiers what can we do That s very close to it he admitted But there is one thing you haven t considered A slave only gets what his master gives him But a free worker for pay gets money which he can spend for whatever he wants and he can save money and if he finds that he can make more money working for somebody else he can quit his employer and get a better job We hadn t thought of that Khreggor Chmidd said A slave even a chief slave was never allowed to have money of his own and if he got hold of any he couldn t spend it But now A glorious vista seemed to open in front of him And he can accumulate money I don t suppose a common worker could but an upper slave Especially a chief slave He slapped his mouth and said Freedman five times Yes Khreggor That was Ridgerd Schferts Fedrig Daffysan Fiscal Management I am sure we could all make quite a lot of money now that we are freedmen Some of them were briefly puzzled gradually comprehension dawned Obray Count Erskyll looked distressed he seemed to be hoping vainly that they weren t thinking of what he suspected they were How about the Mastership freedmen another asked We here will be paid by our Lords Mas Lords Employer But everybody from the green robes down were provided for by the Mastership Who will pay them now Why the Mastership of course Ridgerd Schferts said My Management my Lord Employer s I mean will issue the money to pay them You may need a new printing press Lanze Degbrend said And an awful lot of paper This planet will need currency acceptable in interstellar trade Erskyll said Everybody looked blankly at him He changed the subject mister Chmidd could you or mister Hozhet tell me what kind of a constitution the Mastership has You mean like the paper you read in the Convocation Hozhet asked Oh there is nothing at all like that The former Lords Master simply ruled No They reigned This servile tammanihal another ancient Terran word of uncertain origin ruled Well how is the Mastership organized then Erskyll persisted How did the Lord Nikkolon get to be Chairman of the Presidium and the Lord Javasan to be Chief of Administration That was very simple The Convocation consisting of the heads of all the Masterly families actually small clans numbered about twenty five hundred They elected the seven members of the Presidium who drew lots for the Chairmanship They served for life Vacancies were filled by election on nomination of the surviving members The Presidium appointed the Chiefs of Managements who also served for life At least it had stability It was self perpetuating Does the Convocation make the laws Erskyll asked Hozhet was perplexed Make laws Lord Proconsul Oh no We have laws There were planets here and there through the Empire where an attitude like that would have been distinctly beneficial planets with elective parliaments every member of which felt himself obligated to get as many laws enacted during his term of office as possible But this is dreadful you must have a constitution Obray of Erskyll was shocked We will have to get one drawn up and adopted We don t know anything about that at all Khreggor Chmidd admitted This is something new You will have to help us I certainly will mister Chmidd Suppose you form a committee yourself and mister Hozhet and three or four others select them among yourselves and we can get together and talk over what will be needed And another thing We ll have to stop calling this the Mastership There are no more Masters The Employership Lanze Degbrend dead panned Erskyll looked at him angrily This is something he told the chief freedmen that should not belong to the Employers alone It should belong to everybody Let us call it the Commonwealth That means something everybody owns in common Something everybody owns nobody owns Mykhyl Eschkhaffar objected Oh no Mykhyl it will belong to everybody Khreggor Chmidd told him earnestly But somebody will have to take care of it for everybody That he added complacently will be you and me and the rest of us here I believe Yakoop Zhannar said almost smiling that this freedom is going to be a wonderful thing For us I don t like it Mykhyl Eschkhaffar said stubbornly Too many new things and too much changing names We have to call slaves freedmen we have to call Lords Master Lords Employer we have to call the Management of Servile Affairs the Management for Freedmen Now we have to call the Mastership this new name Commonwealth And all these new things for which we have no routine procedures and no directives I wish these people had never heard of this planet That makes at least two of us Patrique Morvill said sotto voce Well the planetary constitution can wait just a bit Prince Trevannion suggested We have a great many items on the agenda which must be taken care of immediately For instance there s this thing about finding a proconsular palace A surprising amount of work had been done at the small tables where Erskyll s staff of political and economic and technological experts had been conferring with the subordinate upper freedmen It began coming out during the pre dinner cocktails aboard the Empress Eulalie continued through the meal and was fully detailed during the formal debriefing session afterward Finding a suitable building for the Proconsular Palace would present difficulties Real estate was not sold on Aditya any more than slaves were It was not only un Masterly but illegal estates were all entailed and the inalienable property of Masterly families What was wanted was one of the isolated residential towers in Zeggensburg far enough from the Citadel to avoid an appearance of too close supervision The last thing anybody wanted was to establish the Proconsul in the Citadel itself The Management of Business of the Mastership however had promised to do something about it That would mean no doubt that the Empress Eulalie would be hanging over Zeggensburg serving as Proconsular Palace for the next year or so The Servile Management rechristened Freedmen s Management would undertake to safeguard the rights of the newly emancipated slaves There would be an Employment Code Count Erskyll was invited to draw that up and a force of investigators and an enforcement agency under Zhorzh Khouzhik One of Commander Douvrin s men who had been at the Austragonia nuclear industries establishment was present and reported Great Ghu you ought to see that place They ve people working in places I wouldn t send an unshielded robot and the hospital there is bulging with radiation sickness cases The equipment must have been brought here by the Space Vikings What s left of it is the damnedest mess of goldbergery I ever saw The whole thing ought to be shut down and completely rebuilt Erskyll wanted to know who owned it The Mastership he was told That s right one of his economics men agreed Management of Public Works That would be Mykhyl Eschkhaffar who had so bitterly objected to the new nomenclature If anybody needs fissionables for a power reactor or radioactives for nuclear electric conversion his chief business slave gets what s needed Furthermore doesn t even have to sign for it Don t they sell it for revenue Nifflheim no This government doesn t need revenue This government supports itself by counterfeiting When the Mastership needs money they just have Ridgerd Schferts print up another batch Like everybody else Then the money simply isn t worth anything Erskyll was horrified which was rapidly becoming his normal state Who cares about money Obray he said Didn t you hear them last evening It s un Masterly to bother about things like money Of course everybody owes everybody for everything but it s all in the family Well something will have to be done about that That was at least the tenth time he had said that this evening It came practically as a thunderbolt when Khreggor Chmidd screened the ship the next afternoon to report that a Proconsular Palace had been found and would be ready for occupancy in a day or so The chief freedmen of the Management of Business of the Mastership and of the Lord Chief Justiciar had found one the Elegry Palace which had been unoccupied except for what he described as a small caretaking staff for years while two Masterly families disputed inheritance rights and slave lawyers quibbled endlessly before a slave judge The chief freedman of the Lord Chief Justiciar had simply summoned judge and lawyers into his office and ordered them to settle the suit at once The settlement had consisted of paying both litigants the full value of the building this came to fifty million stellies apiece Arbitrarily the stelly was assigned a value in Imperial crowns of a hundred for one A million crowns was about what the building would be worth with contents on Odin It would be paid for with a draft on the Imperial Exchequer Well you have some hard currency on the planet now he told Count Erskyll while they were having a pre dinner drink together that evening I hope it doesn t touch off an inflation if the term is permissible when applied to Adityan currency Erskyll snapped his fingers Yes And there s the money we ve been spending for supplies And when we start compensation payments Excuse me for a moment He dashed off his drink in his hand After a long interval he was back carrying a fresh one he had gotten from a bartending robot en route Well that s taken care of he said My fiscal man s getting in touch with Ridgerd Schferts the Elegry heirs will be paid in Adityan stellies and the Imperial crowns will be held in the Commonwealth Bank or better banked in Asgard to give Aditya some off planet credit And we ll do the same with our other expenditures and with the slave compensation This is going to be wonderful this planet needs everything in the way of industrial equipment this is how they re going to get it But Obray the compensations are owing to the individual Masters They should be paid in crowns You know as well as I do that this hundred for one rate is purely a local fiction On the interstellar exchange these stellies have a crown value of precisely zero point zero You know what would happen if these ci devant Masters got hold of Imperial crowns Erskyll said They d only squander them back again for useless imported luxuries This planet needs a complete modernization and this is the only way the money to pay for it can be gotten He was gesturing excitedly with the almost full glass in his hand Prince Trevannion stepped back out of the way of the splash he anticipated I have no sympathy for these ci devant Masters They own every stick and stone and pinch of dust on this planet as it is Is that fair Possibly not But neither is what you re proposing to do Obray Count Erskyll couldn t see that He was proposing to secure the Greatest Good for the Greatest Number and to Nifflheim with any minorities who happened to be in the way The Navy took over the Elegry Palace the next morning ran up the Imperial Sun and Cogwheel flag and began transmitting views of its interior up to the Empress Eulalie It was considerably smaller than the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin but room for room the furnishings were rather more ornate and expensive By the next afternoon the counter espionage team that had gone down reported the Masterly living quarters clear of pickups microphones and other apparatus of servile snooping of which they had found many The Canopus was recalled from her station over the northern end of the continent and began sending down the proconsulate furnishings stowed aboard including several hundred domestic robots The skeleton caretaking staff Chmidd had mentioned proved to number five hundred What are we going to do about them Erskyll wanted to know There s a limit to the upkeep allowance for a proconsulate and we can t pay five hundred useless servants The chief freedman and about a dozen assistants and a few to operate the robots when we train them but five hundred Let Zhorzh do it Prince Trevannion suggested Isn t that what this Freedmen s Management is for to find employment for emancipated slaves Just emancipate them and turn them over to Khouzhik Khouzhik promptly placed all of them on the payroll of his Management Khouzhik was having his hands full He had all his top mathematical experts some of whom even understood the use of the slide rule trying to work up a scale of wages Erskyll loaned him a few of his staff None of the ideas any of them developed proved workable Khouzhik had also organized a corps of investigators and he was beginning to annex the private guard companies of the Lords ex Master whom he was organizing into a police force The nuclear works on Austragonia were closed down Mykhyl Eschkhaffar ordered a programme of rationing and priorities to conserve the stock of plutonium and radioactive isotopes on hand and he decided that henceforth nuclear energy materials would be sold instead of furnished freely He simply found out what the market quotations on Odin were translated that into stellies and adopted it This was just a base price there would have to be bribes for priority allocations rakeoffs for the under freedmen and graft for the business freedmen of the Lords ex Masters who bought the stuff The latter were completely unconcerned none of them even knew about it The Convocation adjourned until the next regular session at the Midyear Feasts an eight day intercalary period which permitted dividing the three hundred fifty eight day Adityan year into ten months of thirty five days each Count Erskyll was satisfied to see them go He was working on a constitution for the Commonwealth of Aditya and was making very little progress with it It s one of these elaborate check and balance things Lanze Degbrend reported To begin with it was the constitution of Aton with an elective president substituted for a hereditary king Of course there are a lot of added gadgets Atonian Radical Democrat stuff Chmidd and Hozhet and the other chief slaves don t like it either Slap your mouth and say Freedmen five times Nuts his subordinate retorted insubordinately I know a slave when I see one A slave is a slave with or without a gorget if he doesn t wear it around his neck he has it tattooed on his soul It takes at least three generations to rub it off I could wish that Count Erskyll he began What else is our Proconsul doing Well I m afraid he s trying to set up some kind of a scheme for the complete nationalization of all farms factories transport facilities and other means of production and distribution Degbrend said He s not going to try to do that himself is he He was he discovered speaking sharply and modified his tone He won t do it with Imperial authority or with Imperial troops Not as long as I m here And when we go back to Odin I ll see to it that Vann Shatrak understands that Oh no The Commonwealth of Aditya will do that Degbrend said Chmidd and Hozhet and Yakoop Zhannar and Zhorzh Khouzhik and the rest of them that is He wants it done legitimately and legally That means he ll have to wait till the Midyear Feasts when the Convocation assembles and he can get his constitution enacted If he can get it written by then Vann Shatrak sent two of the destroyers off to explore the moons of Aditya of which there were two The outer moon Aditya Ba was an irregular chunk of rock fifty miles in diameter barely visible to the naked eye The inner Aditya Alif however was an eight hundred mile sphere it had once been the planetary ship station and shipyard base It seemed to have been abandoned when the Adityan technology and economy had begun sagging under the weight of the slave system Most of the installations remained badly run down but repairable Shatrak transferred as many of his technicians as he could spare to the Mizar and sent her to recondition the shipyard and render the underground city inhabitable again so that the satellite could be used as a base for his ships He decided then to send the Irma back to Odin with reports of the annexation of Aditya a proposal that Aditya Alif be made a permanent Imperial naval base and a request for more troops Prince Trevannion taped up his own reports describing the general situation on the newly annexed planet and doing nothing to minimize the problems facing its Proconsul Count Erskyll he finished is doing the best possible under circumstances from which I myself would feel inclined to shrink If not carried to excess perhaps youthful idealism is not without value in Empire statecraft I understand that Commodore Shatrak who is also coping with some very trying problems is requesting troop reenforcements I believe this request amply justified and would recommend that they be gotten here as speedily as possible Illustration I understand that he is also recommending a permanent naval base on the larger of this planet s two satellites This I also endorse unreservedly It would have a most salutary effect on the local government I would further recommend that Commodore Shatrak be placed in command of it with suitable promotion which he has long ago earned Erskyll was surprised that he was not himself returning to Odin on the destroyer and evidently disturbed He mentioned it during pre dinner cocktails that evening I know my own work here is finished was the moment the Convocation voted acknowledgment of Imperial rule Prince Trevannion replied I would like to stay on for the Midyear Feasts though The Convocation will vote on your constitution and I would like to be able to report their action to the Prime Minister How is it progressing by the way Well we have a rough draft I don t care much for it myself but Citizen Hozhet and Citizen Chmidd and Citizen Zhannar and the others are most enthusiastic and after all they are the ones who will have to operate under it The Masterly estates would be the representative units from each the freedmen would elect representatives to regional elective councils and these in turn would elect representatives to a central electoral council which would elect a Supreme People s Legislative Council This would not only function as the legislative body but would also elect a Manager in Chief who would appoint the Chiefs of Management who in turn would appoint their own subordinates I don t like it myself Erskyll said It s not democratic enough There should be a direct vote by the people Well he grudged I suppose it will take a little time for them to learn democracy This was the first time he had come out and admitted that There is to be a Constituent Convention in five years to draw up a new constitution How about the Convocation You don t expect them to vote themselves out of existence do you Oh we re keeping the Convocation in the present constitution but they won t have any power Five years from now we ll be rid of them entirely Look here you re not going to work against this are you You won t advise these ci devant Lords Master to vote against it when it comes up Certainly not I think your constitution Khreggor Chmidd s and Tchall Hozhet s to be exact will be nothing short of a political disaster but it will insure some political stability which is all that matters from the Imperial point of view An Empire statesman must always guard against sympathizing with local factions and interests and I can think of no planet on which I could be safer from any such temptation If these Lords Master want to vote their throats cut and the slaves want to re enslave themselves they may all do so with my complete blessing If he had been at all given to dramatic gestures he would then have sent for water and washed his hands Metaphorically he did so at that moment thereafter his interest in Adityan affairs was that of a spectator at a boring and stupid show watching only because there is nothing else to watch and wishing that it had been possible to have returned to Odin on the Irma The Prime Minister however was entitled to a full and impartial report which he would scarcely get from Count Erskyll on this new jewel in the Imperial Crown To be able to furnish that he would have to remain until the Midyear Feasts when the Convocation would act on the new constitution Whether the constitution was adopted or rejected was in itself unimportant in either case Aditya would have a government recognizable as such by the Empire which was already recognizing some fairly unlikely looking governments In either case too Aditya would make nobody on any other planet any trouble It wouldn t have at least for a long time even if it had been left unannexed but no planet inhabited by Terro humans could be trusted to remain permanently peaceful and isolated There is a spark of aggressive ambition in every Terro human people no matter how debased which may smoulder for centuries or even millennia and then burst fanned by some random wind into flame To shift the metaphor slightly the Empire could afford to leave no unwatched pots around to boil over unexpectedly Occasionally he did warn young Erskyll of the dangers of overwork and emotional over involvement Each time the Proconsul would pour out some tale of bickering and rivalry among the chief freedmen of the Managements Citizen Khouzhik and Citizen Eschkhaffar they were all calling each other Citizen now were contesting overlapping jurisdictions Khouzhik wanted to change the name of his Management he no longer bothered mentioning Sesar Martwynn to Labor and Industry To this Mykhyl Eschkhaffar objected vehemently any Industry that was going to be managed would be managed by his Oraze Borztall was similarly left unmentioned management of Public Works And they were also feuding about the robotic and remote controlled equipment that had been sent down from the Empress Eulalie to the Austragonia nuclear power works Khouzhik was also in controversy with Yakoop Zhannar who was already calling himself People s Provost Marshal Khouzhik had taken over all the private armed guards on the Masterly farms and in the factories and assimilated them into something he was calling the People s Labor Police ostensibly to enforce the new Code of Employment Practice Zhannar insisted that they should be under his Management when Chmidd and Hozhet supported Khouzhik he began clamoring for the return of the regular army to his control Commodore Shatrak was more than glad to get rid of the Adityan army and so was Pyairr Ravney who was in immediate command of them The Adityans didn t care one way or the other Zhannar was delighted and so were Chmidd and Hozhet So oddly was Zhorzh Khouzhik At the same time the state of martial law proclaimed on the day of the landing was terminated The days slipped by There were entertainments at the new Proconsular Palace for the Masterly residents of Zeggensburg and Erskyll and his staff were entertained at Masterly palaces The latter affairs pained Prince Trevannion excessively hours on end of gorging uninspired cooking and guzzling too sweet wine and watching ex slave performers whose acts were either brutal or obscene and frequently both and more unforgivable stupidly so The Masterly conversation was simply stupid He borrowed a reconn car from Ravney he and Lanze Degbrend and usually one or another of Ravney s young officers took long trips of exploration They fished in mountain streams and hunted the small deerlike game and he found himself enjoying these excursions more than anything he had done in recent years certainly anything since Aditya had come into the viewscreens of the Empress Eulalie Once in a while they claimed and received Masterly hospitality at some large farming estate They were always greeted with fulsome cordiality and there was always surprise that persons of their rank and consequence should travel unaccompanied by a retinue of servants He found things the same wherever he stopped None of the farms were producing more than a quarter of the potential yield per acre and all depleting the soil outrageously Ten slaves he didn t bother to think of them as freedmen doing the work of one and a hundred of them taking all day to do what one robot would have done before noon White gowned chief slaves lording it over green and orange gowned supervisors and clerks overseers still carrying and frequently using whips and knouts and sandbag flails Once or twice when a Masterly back was turned he caught a look of murderous hatred flickering into the eyes of some upper slave Once or twice when a Master thought his was turned he caught the same look in Masterly eyes directed at him or at Lanze The Midyear Feasts approached each time he returned to the city he found more excitement as preparations went on Mykhyl Eschkhaffar s Management of Public Works was giving top priority to redecorating the Convocation Chamber and the lounges and dining rooms around it in which the Masters would relax during recesses More and more Masterly families flocked in from outlying estates with contragravity flotillas and retinues of attendants to be entertained at the city palaces There were more and gaudier banquets and balls and entertainments By the time the Feasts began every Masterly man woman and child would be in the city There were long columns of military contragravity coming in too troop carriers and combat vehicles Yakoop Zhannar was bringing in all his newly recovered army and Zhorzh Khouzhik his newly organized People s Labor Police Vann Shatrak who was now commanding his battle line unit by screen from the Proconsular Palace began fretting I wish I hadn t been in such a hurry to terminate martial rule he said once And I wish Pyairr hadn t been so confoundedly efficient in retraining those troops That may cost us a few extra casualties before we re through Count Erskyll laughed at his worries It s just this rivalry between Citizen Khouzhik and Citizen Zhannar he said They re like a couple of ci devant Lords Master competing to give more extravagant feasts Zhannar s going to hold a review of his troops and of course Khouzhik intends to hold a review of his police That s all there is to it Well just the same I wish some reenforcements would get here from Odin Shatrak said Erskyll was busy in the days before the Midyear Feasts either conferring at the Citadel with the ex slaves who were the functional heads of the Managements or at the Proconsular Palace with Hozhet and Chmidd and the chief freedmen of the influential Convocation leaders and Presidium members Everybody was extremely optimistic about the constitution He couldn t quite understand the optimism himself If I were one of these Lords Master I wouldn t even consider the thing he told Erskyll I know they re stupid but I can t believe they re stupid enough to commit suicide and that s what this amounts to Yes it does Erskyll agreed cheerfully As soon as they enact it they ll be of no more consequence than the Assemblage of Peers on Aton they ll have no voice in the operation of the Commonwealth and none in the new constitution that will be drawn up five years from now And that will be the end of them All the big estates and the factories and mines and contragravity ship lines will be nationalized And they ll have nothing at all except a hamper full of repudiated paper stellies he finished That s what I mean What makes you think they ll be willing to vote for that They don t know they re voting for it They ll think they re voting to keep control of the Mastership People like Olvir Nikkolon and Rovard Javasan and Ranal Valdry and Sesar Martwynn think they still own their chief freedmen they think Hozhet and Chmidd and Zhannar and Khouzhik will do exactly what they tell them And they believe anything the Hozhets and Chmidds and Zhannars tell them And every chief freedman is telling his Lord Employer that the only way they can keep control is by adopting the constitution that they can control the elections on their estates and hand pick the People s Legislative Council I tell you Prince Trevannion the constitution is as good as enacted Two days before the opening of the Convocation the Irma came into radio range five light hours away and began transmitting in taped matter at sixty speed Erskyll s report and his own acknowledged a routine well done for the successful annexation Commendation for Shatrak s handling of the landing operation Orders to take over Aditya Alif and begin construction of a permanent naval base Notification of promotion to base admiral and blank commission as line commodore that would be Patrique Morvill And advice that one transport cruiser Algol with an Army contragravity brigade aboard and two engineering ships would leave Odin for Aditya in fifteen days The last two words erased much of the new base admiral s pleasure Fifteen days great Ghu And those tubs won t make near the speed of Irma getting here We ll be lucky to see them in twenty And Beelzebub only knows what ll be going on here then Four times the big screen failed to respond They were all crowded into one of the executive conference rooms at the Proconsular Palace the batteries of communication and recording equipment incongruously functional among the gold encrusted luxury of the original Masterly furnishings Shatrak swore Andrey I thought your people had planted those pickups where they couldn t be found he said to Commander Douvrin There is no such place sir the intelligence officer replied Just places where things are hard to find Did you mention our pickups to Chmidd or Hozhet or any of the rest of the shaveheads Shatrak asked Erskyll No I didn t even know where they were And it was the freedmen who found them Erskyll said I don t know why they wouldn t want us looking in Lanze Degbrend at the screen twisted the dial again and this time the screen flickered and cleared and they were looking into the Convocation Chamber from the extreme rear above the double doors Far away in front Olvir Nikkolon was rising behind the gold and onyx bench and from the speaker the call bell tolled slowly and the buzz of over two thousand whispering voices diminished Nikkolon began to speak Seven and a half centuries ago our fathers went forth from Morglay to plant upon this planet a new banner It was evidently a set speech one he had recited year after year and every Lord Chairman of the Presidium before him The splendid traditions The glories of the Masterly race The all conquering Space Vikings The proud heritage of the Sword Worlds Lanze was fiddling with the control knobs stepping up magnification and focusing on the speaker s head and shoulders Then everybody laughed Nikkolon had a small plug in one ear with a fine wire running down to vanish under his collar Degbrend brought back the full view of the Convocation Chamber Nikkolon went on and on Vann Shatrak summoned a robot to furnish him with a cold beer and another cigar Erskyll was drumming an impatient devil s tattoo with his fingernails on the gold encrusted table in front of him Lanze Degbrend began interpolating sarcastic comments And finally Pyairr Ravney who came from Lugaluru reverted to the idiom of his planet s favorite sport Come on come on turn out the bull What s the matter is the gate stuck If so it came quickly unstuck and the bull emerged pawing and snorting This year other conquerors have come to Aditya here to plant another banner the Sun and Cogwheel of the Galactic Empire and I blush to say it we are as helpless against these conquerors as were the miserable barbarians and their wretched serfs whom our fathers conquered seven hundred and sixty two years ago whose descendants until this black day had been our slaves He continued his voice growing more impassioned and more belligerent Count Erskyll fidgeted This wasn t the way the Chmidd Hozhet Constitution ought to be introduced So perforce we accepted the sovereignty of this alien Empire We are now the subjects of his Imperial Majesty Rodrik III We must govern Aditya subject to the Imperial Constitution Groans boos catcalls if the Adityan equivalent of cats made noises like that At one stroke this Constitution has abolished our peculiar institution upon which is based our entire social structure This I know But this same Imperial Constitution is a collapsium strong shielding let me call your attention to Article One Section Two Every Empire planet shall be self governed as to its own affairs in the manner of its own choice and without interference Mark this well for it is our guarantee that this government of the Masters by the Masters and for the Masters shall not perish from Aditya Prolonged cheering Now these arrogant conquerors have overstepped their own supreme law They have written for this Mastership a constitution designed for the sole purpose of accomplishing the liquidation of the Masterly class and race They have endeavored to force this planetary constitution upon us by threats of force and by a shameful attempt to pervert the fidelity of our chief slaves I will not insult these loyal servitors with this disgusting new name freedmen so that we might a second time be tricked into voting assent to our own undoing But in this they have failed Our chief slaves have warned us of the trap concealed in this constitution written by the Proconsul Count Erskyll My faithful Tchall Hozhet has shown me all the pitfalls in this infamous document Obray Count Erskyll was staring in dismay at the screen Then he began cursing blasphemously the first time he had ever been heard to do so and as he was at least nominally a Pantheist this meant blaspheming the entire infinite universe The rats The dirty treacherous rats We came here to help them and look they ve betrayed us He lost his voice in a wheezing sob and then asked Why did they do it Do they want to go on being slaves Perhaps they did It wasn t for love of their Lords Master he was sure of that Even from the beginning they had found it impossible to disguise their contempt Then he saw Olvir Nikkolon stop short and thrust out his arm pointing directly below the pickup and as he watched something green gray a remote control contragravity lorry came floating into the field of the screen One of the vehicles that had been sent down from the Empress Eulalie for use at the uranium mines As it lifted and advanced toward the center of the room the other Lords Master were springing to their feet Illustration Vann Shatrak also sprang to his feet reaching the controls of the screen and cutting the sound He was just in time to save them from being at least temporarily deafened for no sooner had he silenced the speaker than the lorry vanished in a flash that filled the entire room When the dazzle left their eyes and the smoke and dust began to clear they saw the Convocation Chamber in wreckage showers of plaster and bits of plastiboard still falling from above The gold and onyx bench was broken in a number of places the Chiefs of Management in front of it and the Presidium above had vanished Among the benches lay black clad bodies a few still moving Smoke rose from burning clothing Admiral Shatrak put on the sound again from the screen came screams and cries of pain and fright Then the doors on the two long sides opened and red brown uniforms appeared The soldiers advanced into the Chamber unslinging rifles and submachine guns Unheeding the still falling plaster they moved forward firing as they came A few of them slung their firearms and picked up Masterly dress swords using them to finish the wounded among the benches The screams grew fewer and then stopped Count Erskyll sat frozen staring white faced and horror sick into the screen Some of the others had begun to recover and were babbling excitedly Vann Shatrak was at a communication screen talking to Commodore Patrique Morvill aboard the Empress Eulalie All the Landing Troops and all the crewmen you can spare and arm And every vehicle you have This is only the start of it there ll be a general massacre of Masters next I don t doubt it s started already At another screen Pyairr Ravney was saying to the officer of the day of the Palace Guard No there s no telling what they ll do next Whatever it is be ready for it ten minutes ago He stubbed out his cigarette and rose and as he did Erskyll came out of his daze and onto his feet Commodore Shatrak I mean Admiral he corrected himself We must re impose martial rule I wish I d never talked you into terminating it Look at that He pointed at the screen big dump lorries were already coming in the doors under the pickup with a mob of gowned civil service people crowding in under them They and the soldiers began dragging bodies out from among the seats to be loaded and hauled away There s the planetary government murdered to the last man I m afraid we can t do anything like that he said This seems to be a simple transfer of power by coup d etat rather more extreme than usual but normal political practice on this sort of planet The Empire has no right to interfere Erskyll turned on him indignantly But it s mass murder It s an accomplished fact Whoever ordered this Citizen Chmidd and Citizen Hozhet and Citizen Zhannar and the rest of your good democratic citizens are now the planetary government of Aditya As long as they don t attack us or repudiate the sovereignty of the Emperor you ll have to recognize them as such A bloody handed gang of murderers recognize them All governments have a little blood here and there on their hands you ve seen this by screen instead of reading about it in a history book but that shouldn t make any difference And you ve said yourself that the Masters would have to be eliminated You ve told Chmidd and Hozhet and the others that repeatedly Of course you meant legally by constitutional and democratic means but that seemed just a bit too tedious to them They had them all together in one room where they could be eliminated easily and Lanze see if you can get anything on the Citadel telecast Degbrend put on another communication screen and fiddled for a moment What came on was a view from another angle of the Convocation Chamber A voice was saying not one left alive The People s Labor Police acting on orders of People s Manager of Labor Zhorzh Khouzhik and People s Provost Marshal Yakoop Zhannar are now eliminating the rest of the ci devant Masterly class all of whom are here in Zeggensburg The people are directed to cooperate kill them all men women and children We must allow none of these foul exploiters of the people live to see today s sun go down You mean we sit here while those animals butcher women and children Shatrak demanded looking from the Proconsul to the Ministerial Secretary Well by Ghu I won t If I have to face a court for it all well and good but You won t Admiral I seem to recall some years ago a Commodore Hastings who got a baronetcy for stopping a pogrom on Anath And broadcast an announcement that any of the Masterly class may find asylum here at the Proconsular Palace They re political fugitives scores of precedents for that Erskyll added Shatrak was back at the screen to the Empress Eulalie Patrique get a jam beam focussed on that telecast station at the Citadel get it off the air Then broadcast on the same wavelength announce that anybody claiming sanctuary at the Proconsular Palace will be taken in and protected And start getting troops down and all the spacemen you can spare At the same time Ravney was saying into his own screen Plan Four Variation H three this is a rescue operation This is not repeat underscore not an intervention in planetary government You are to protect members of the Masterly class in danger from mob violence That s anybody with hair on his head Stay away from the Citadel the ones there are all dead Start with the four buildings closest to us and get them cleared out If the shaveheads give you any trouble don t argue with them just shoot them Erskyll after his brief moment of decisiveness was staring at the screen to the Convocation Chamber where bodies were still being heaved into the lorries like black sacks of grain Lanze Degbrend summoned a robot had it pour a highball and gave it to the Proconsul Go ahead Count Erskyll drink it down Medicinal he was saying Believe me you certainly need it Erskyll gulped it down I think I could use another if you please he said handing the glass back to Lanze And a cigarette After he had tasted his second drink and puffed on the cigarette he said I was so proud I thought they were learning democracy We don t any of us have too much to be proud about Degbrend told him They must have been planning and preparing this for a couple of months and we never caught a whisper of it That was correct They had deluded Erskyll into thinking that they were going to let the Masters vote themselves out of power and set up a representative government They had deluded the Masters into believing that they were in favor of the status quo and opposed to Erkyll s democratization and socialization There must be only a few of them in the conspiracy Chmidd and Hozhet and Zhannar and Khouzhik and Schferts and the rest of the Citadel chief slave clique Among them they controlled all the armed force The bickering and rivalries must have been part of the camouflage He supposed that a few of the upper army commanders had been in on it too A communication screen began making noises Somebody flipped the switch and Khreggor Chmidd appeared in it Erskyll swore softly and went to face the screen image of the elephantine ex slave of the ex Lord Master the late Rovard Javasan Citizen Proconsul why is our telecast station which is vitally needed to give information to the people jammed off the air and why are you broadcasting on our wavelength advice to the criminals of the ci devant Masterly class to take refuge in your Proconsular Palace from the just vengeance of the outraged victims of their century long exploitation he began This is a flagrant violation of the Imperial Constitution our Emperor will not be pleased at this unjustified intervention in the affairs and this interference with the planetary authority of the People s Commonwealth of Aditya Obray of Erskyll must have realized for the first time that he was still holding a highball glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other He flung both of them away If the Imperial troops we are sending into the city to rescue women and children in danger from your hoodlums meet with the least resistance you won t be in a position to find out what his Majesty thinks about it because Admiral Shatrak will have you and your accomplices shot in the Convocation Chamber where you massacred the legitimate government of this planet he barked So the real Obray Count Erskyll had at last emerged All the liberalism and socialism and egalitarianism all the Helping Hand Torch of Democracy idealism was merely a surface stucco applied at the university during the last six years For twenty four years before that from the day of his birth he had been taught by his parents his nurse his governess his tutors what it meant to be an Erskyll of Aton and a grandson of Errol Duke of Yorvoy As he watched Khreggor Chmidd in the screen he grew angrier if possible Do you know what you blood thirsty imbeciles have done he demanded You have just murdered along with two thousand men some five billion crowns the money needed to finance all these fine modernization and industrialization plans Or are you crazy enough to think that the Empire is going to indemnify you for being emancipated and pay that money over to you But Citizen Proconsul And don t call me Citizen Proconsul I am a noble of the Galactic Empire and on this pigpen of a planet I represent his Imperial Majesty You will respect and address me accordingly Khreggor Chmidd no longer wore the gorget of servility but as Lanze Degbrend had once remarked it was still tattooed on his soul He gulped Y yes Lord Master Proconsul They were together again in the big conference room which Vann Shatrak had been using through the day as an extemporised Battle Control They slumped wearily in chairs they smoked and drank coffee they anxiously looked from viewscreen to viewscreen wondering when and how soon the trouble would break out again It was dark outside now Floodlights threw a white dazzle from the top of the Proconsular Palace and from the tops of the four buildings around it that Imperial troops had cleared and occupied and from contragravity vehicles above There was light and activity at the Citadel and in the Servile City to the south east the rest of Zeggensburg was dark and quiet I don t think we ll have any more trouble Admiral Shatrak was saying They won t be fools enough to attack us here and all the Masters are dead except for the ones we re sheltering How many did we save Count Erskyll asked Eight hundred odd Shatrak told him Erskyll caught his breath So few Why there were almost twelve thousand of them in the city this morning I m surprised we saved so many Lanze Degbrend said He still wore combat coveralls and a pistol belt lay beside his chair Most of them were killed in the first hour And that had been before the landing craft from the ships had gotten down and there had only been seven hundred men and forty vehicles available He had gone out with them himself it had been the first time he had worn battle dress and helmet or carried a weapon except for sport in almost thirty years It had been an ugly bloody business one he wanted to forget as speedily as possible There had been times after seeing the mutilated bodies of Masterly women and children when he had been forced to remind himself that he had come out to prevent not to participate in a massacre Some of Ravney s men hadn t even tried Atrocity has a horrible facility for begetting atrocity What ll we do with them Erskyll asked We can t turn them loose they d all be murdered in a matter of hours and in any case they d have nowhere to go The Commonwealth he pronounced the name he had himself selected as though it were an obscenity has nationalized all the Masterly property That had been announced almost as soon as the Citadel telecast station had been unjammed and shortly thereafter they had begun encountering bodies of Yakoop Zhannar s soldiers and Zhorzh Khouzhik s police who had been sent out to stop looting and vandalism and occupy the Masterly palaces There had been considerable shooting in the Servile City evidently the ex slaves had to be convinced that they must not pillage or destroy their places of employment Evacuate them off planet Shatrak said As soon as Algol gets here we ll load the lot of them onto Mizar or Canopus and haul them somewhere Ghu only knows how they ll live but Oh they won t be paupers or public charges Admiral he said You know there s an estimated five billion crowns in slave compensation and when I return to Odin I shall represent most strongly that these survivors be paid the whole sum But I shall emphatically not recommend that they be resettled on Odin They won t be at all grateful to us for today s business and on Odin they could easily stir up some very adverse public sentiment My resignation will answer any criticism of the Establishment the public may make Erskyll began Oh rubbish don t talk about resigning Obray You made a few mistakes here though I can t think of a better planet in the Galaxy on which you could have made them But no matter what you did or did not do this would have happened eventually You really think so Obray Count Erskyll was desperately anxious to be assured of that Perhaps if I hadn t been so insistent on this constitution That wouldn t have made a particle of difference We all made this inevitable simply by coming here Before we came it would have been impossible No slave would have been able even to imagine a society without Lords Master you heard Chmidd and Hozhet the first day aboard the Empress Eulalie A slave had to have a Master he simply couldn t belong to nobody at all And until you started talking socialization nobody could have imagined property without a Masterly property owning class And a massacre like this would have been impossible to organize or execute For one thing it required an elaborate conspiratorial organization and until we emancipated them no slave would have dared trust any other slave every one would have betrayed any other to curry favor with his Lord Master We taught them that they didn t need Lords Master or Masterly favor any more And we presented them with a situation their established routines didn t cover and forced them into doing some original thinking which must have hurt like Nifflheim at first And we retrained the army and handed it over to Yakoop Zhannar and inspired Zhorzh Khouzhik to organize the Labor Police and fundamentally no government is anything but armed force Really Obray I can t see that you can be blamed for anything but speeding up an inevitable process slightly You think they ll see it that way at Asgard You mean the Prime Minister and His Majesty That will be the way I shall present it to them That was another reason I wanted to stay on here I anticipated that you might want a credible witness to what was going to happen he said Now you ll be here for not more than five years before you re promoted elsewhere Nobody remains longer than that on a first Proconsular appointment Just keep your eyes and ears and especially your mind open while you are here You will learn many things undreamed of by the political science faculty at the University of Nefertiti You said I made mistakes Erskyll mentioned ready to start learning immediately Yes I pointed one of them out to you some time ago emotional involvement with local groups You began sympathizing with the servile class here almost immediately I don t think either of us learned anything about them that the other didn t yet I found them despicable one and all Why did you think them worthy of your sympathy Why because For a moment that was as far as he could get His motivation had been thalamic rather than cortical and he was having trouble externalizing it verbally They were slaves They were being exploited and oppressed And of course their exploiters were a lot of heartless villains so that made the slaves good and virtuous innocents That was your real fundamental mistake You know Obray the downtrodden and long suffering proletariat aren t at all good or innocent or virtuous They are just incompetent they lack the abilities necessary for overt villainy You saw this afternoon what they were capable of doing when they were given an opportunity You know it s quite all right to give the underdog a hand but only one hand Keep the other hand on your pistol or he ll try to eat the one you gave him As you may have noticed today when underdogs get up they tend to turn out to be wolves What do you think this Commonwealth will develop into under Chmidd and Hozhet and Khouzhik and the rest Lanze Degbrend asked to keep the lecture going Oh a slave state of course look who s running it and whom it will govern Not the kind of a slave state we can do anything about he hastened to add The Commonwealth will be very definite about recognizing that sapient beings cannot be property But all the rest of the property will belong to the Commonwealth Remember that remark of Chmidd s It will belong to everybody but somebody will have to take care of it for everybody That will be you and me Erskyll frowned I remember that I didn t like it at the time It sounded Out of character for a good and virtuous proletarian almost Masterly in fact He continued The Commonwealth will be sole employer as well as sole property owner and anybody who wants to eat will have to work for the Commonwealth on the Commonwealth s terms Chmidd s and Hozhet s and Khouzhik s that is If that isn t substitution of peonage for chattel slavery I don t know what the word peonage means But you ll do nothing to interfere You will see to it that Aditya stays in the empire and adheres to the Constitution and makes no trouble for anybody off planet I fancy you won t find that too difficult They ll be good as long as you deny them the means to be anything else And make sure that they continue to call you Lord Master Proconsul Lecturing he found was dry work He summoned a bartending robot Ho slave Attend your Lord Master Then he had to use his ultraviolet pencil light to bring it to him and dial for the brandy and soda he wanted As long as that was necessary there really wasn t anything to worry about But some of these days they d build robots that would anticipate orders and robots to operate robots and robots to supervise them and No It wouldn t quite come to that A slave is a slave but a robot is only a robot As long as they stuck to robots they were reasonably safe Errata The following typographical errors were corrected Page Error
