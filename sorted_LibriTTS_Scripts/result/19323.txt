COMPLETE INDEX AT THE END OF VOLUME X THE WIT AND HUMOR OF AMERICA THE MARRIAGE OF SIR JOHN SMITH BY PHOEBE CARY Not a sigh was heard nor a funeral tone As the man to his bridal we hurried Not a woman discharged her farewell groan On the spot where the fellow was married We married him just about eight at night Our faces paler turning By the struggling moonbeam s misty light And the gas lamp s steady burning No useless watch chain covered his vest Nor over dressed we found him But he looked like a gentleman wearing his best With a few of his friends around him Few and short were the things we said And we spoke not a word of sorrow But we silently gazed on the man that was wed And we bitterly thought of the morrow We thought as we silently stood about With spite and anger dying How the merest stranger had cut us out With only half our trying Lightly we ll talk of the fellow that s gone And oft for the past upbraid him But little he ll reck if we let him live on In the house where his wife conveyed him But our hearty task at length was done When the clock struck the hour for retiring And we heard the spiteful squib and pun The girls were sullenly firing Slowly and sadly we turned to go We had struggled and we were human We shed not a tear and we spoke not our woe But we left him alone with his woman THE SPRING BEAUTIES BY HELEN AVERY CONE The Puritan Spring Beauties stood freshly clad for church A thrush white breasted o er them sat singing on his perch Happy be for fair are ye the gentle singer told them But presently a buff coat Bee came booming up to scold them Vanity oh vanity Young maids beware of vanity Grumbled out the buff coat Bee Half parson like half soldierly The sweet faced maidens trembled with pretty pinky blushes Convinced that it was wicked to listen to the thrushes And when that shady afternoon I chanced that way to pass They hung their little bonnets down and looked into the grass All because the buff coat Bee Lectured them so solemnly Vanity oh vanity Young maids beware of vanity GOING UP AND COMING DOWN BY MARY F TUCKER This is a simple song tis true My songs are never over nice And yet I ll try and scatter through A little pinch of good advice Then listen pompous friend and learn To never boast of much renown For fortune s wheel is on the turn And some go up and some come down I know a vast amount of stocks A vast amount of pride insures But Fate has picked so many locks I wouldn t like to warrant yours Remember then and never spurn The one whose hand is hard and brown For he is likely to go up And you are likely to come down Another thing you will agree The truth may be as well confessed That Codfish Aristocracy Is but a scaly thing at best And Madame in her robe of lace And Bridget in her faded gown Both represent a goodly race From father Adam handed down Life is uncertain full of change Little we have that will endure And t were a doctrine new and strange That places high are most secure And if the fickle goddess smile Yielding the scepter and the crown Tis only for a little while Then B goes up and A comes down This world for all of us my friend Hath something more than pounds and pence Then let me humbly recommend A little use of common sense Thus lay all pride of place aside And have a care on whom you frown For fear you ll see him going up When you are only coming down THE SET OF CHINA BY ELIZA LESLIE mister Gummage said missus Atmore as she entered a certain drawing school at that time the most fashionable in Philadelphia I have brought you a new pupil my daughter Miss Marianne Atmore Have you a vacancy Why I can t say that I have replied mister Gummage I never have vacancies I am very sorry to hear it said missus Atmore and Miss Marianne a tall handsome girl of fifteen looked disappointed But perhaps I could strain a point and find a place for her resumed mister Gummage who knew very well that he never had the smallest idea of limiting the number of his pupils and that if twenty more were to apply he would take them every one however full his school might be Do pray mister Gummage said missus Atmore do try and make an exertion to admit my daughter I shall regard it as a particular favor Well I believe she may come replied Gummage I suppose I can take her Has she any turn for drawing I don t know answered missus Atmore she has never tried Well madam said mister Gummage what do you wish your daughter to learn figures flowers or landscape Oh all three replied missus Atmore We have been furnishing our new house and I told mister Atmore that he need not get any pictures for the front parlor as I would much prefer having them all painted by Marianne She has been four quarters with Miss Julia and has worked Friendship and Innocence which cost altogether upwards of a hundred dollars Do you know the piece mister Gummage There is a tomb with a weeping willow and two ladies with long hair one dressed in pink the other in blue holding a wreath between them over the top of the urn The ladies are Friendship Then on the right hand of the piece is a cottage and an oak and a little girl dressed in yellow sitting on a green bank and putting a wreath round the neck of a lamb Nothing can be more natural than the lamb s wool It is done entirely in French knots The child and the lamb are Innocence Ay ay said Gummage I know the piece well enough I ve drawn them by dozens Well continued missus Atmore this satin piece hangs over the front parlor mantel It is much prettier and better done than the one Miss Longstitch worked of Charlotte at the tomb of Werter though she did sew silver spangles all over Charlotte s lilac gown and used chenille at a fi penny bit a needleful for all the banks and the large tree Now as the mantel piece is provided for I wish a landscape for each of the recesses and a figure piece to hang on each side of the large looking glass with flower pieces under them all by Marianne Can she do all these in one quarter No that she can t replied Gummage it will take her two quarters hard work and maybe three to get through the whole of them Well I won t stand about a quarter more or less said missus Atmore but what I wish Marianne to do most particularly and indeed the chief reason why I send her to drawing school just now is a pattern for a set of china that we are going to have made in Canton I was told the other day by a New York lady who was quite tired of the queer unmeaning things which are generally put on India ware that she had sent a pattern for a tea set drawn by her daughter and that every article came out with the identical device beautifully done on the china all in the proper colors She said it was talked of all over New York and that people who had never been at the house before came to look at and admire it No doubt it was a great feather in her daughter s cap Possibly madam said Gummage And now resumed missus Atmore since I heard this I have thought of nothing else than having the same thing done in my family only I shall send for a dinner set and a very long one too mister Atmore tells me that the Voltaire one of Stephen Girard s ships sails for Canton early next month and he is well acquainted with the captain who will attend to the order for the china I suppose in the course of a fortnight Marianne will have learned drawing enough to enable her to do the pattern Oh yes madam quite enough replied Gummage suppressing a laugh To cut the matter short said mister Gummage the best thing for the china is a flower piece a basket or a wreath or something of that sort You can have a good cipher in the center and the colors may be as bright as you please India ware is generally painted with one color only but the Chinese are submissive animals and will do just as they are bid It may cost something more to have a variety of colors but I suppose you will not mind that Oh no no exclaimed missus Atmore I shall not care for the price I have set my mind on having this china the wonder of all Philadelphia Our readers will understand that at this period nearly all the porcelain used in America was of Chinese manufacture very little of that elegant article having been as yet imported from France A wreath was selected from the portfolio that contained the engravings and drawings of flowers It was decided that Marianne should first execute it the full size of the model which was as large as nature that she might immediately have a piece to frame and that she was afterwards to make a smaller copy of it as a border for all the articles of the china set the middle to be ornamented with the letter A in gold surrounded by the rays of a golden star Sprigs and tendrils of the flowers were to branch down from the border so as nearly to reach the gilding in the middle The large wreath that was intended to frame was to bear in its center the initials of Marianne Atmore being the letters M A painted in shell gold And so said mister Gummage having a piece to frame and a pattern for your china you ll kill two birds with one stone On the following Monday the young lady came to take her first lesson followed by a mulatto boy carrying a little black morocco trunk that contained a four row box of Reeves s colors with an assortment of camel s hair pencils half a dozen white saucers a water cup a lead pencil and a piece of India rubber mister Gummage immediately supplied her with two bristle brushes and sundry little shallow earthen cups each containing a modicum of some sort of body color massicot flake white et cetera prepared by himself and charged at a quarter of a dollar apiece and which he told her she would want when she came to do landscapes and figures mister Gummage s style was to put in the sky water and distances with opaque paints and the most prominent objects with transparent colors This was probably the reason that his foregrounds seemed always to be sunk in his backgrounds The model was scarcely considered as a guide for he continually told his pupils that they must try to excel it and he helped them to do so by making all his skies deep red fire at the bottom and dark blue smoke at the top and exactly reversing the colors on the water by putting red at the top and the blue at the bottom The distant mountains were lilac and white and the near rocks buff color shaded with purple The castles and abbeys were usually gamboge The trees were dabbed and dotted in with a large bristle brush so that the foliage looked like a green frog The foam of the cascades resembled a concourse of wigs scuffling together and knocking the powder out of each other the spray being always fizzed on with one of the aforesaid bristle brushes All the dark shadows in every part of the picture were done with a mixture of Persian blue and bistre and of these two colors there was consequently a vast consumption in mister Gummage s school At the period of our story many of the best houses in Philadelphia were decorated with these landscapes But for the honor of my townspeople I must say that the taste for such productions is now entirely obsolete We may look forward to the time which we trust is not far distant when the elements of drawing will be taught in every school and considered as indispensable to education as a knowledge of writing It has long been our belief that any child may with proper instruction be made to draw as easily as any child may be made to write We are rejoiced to find that so distinguished an artist as Rembrandt Peale has avowed the same opinion in giving to the world his invaluable little work on Graphics in which he has clearly demonstrated the affinity between drawing and writing and admirably exemplified the leading principles of both Marianne s first attempt at the great wreath was awkward enough After she had spent five or six afternoons at the outline and made it triangular rather than circular and found it impossible to get in the sweet pea and the convolvulus and lost and bewildered herself among the multitude of leaves that formed the cup of the rose mister Gummage snatched the pencil from her hand rubbed out the whole and then drew it himself It must be confessed that his forte lay in flowers and he was extremely clever at them but as he expressed it his scholars chiefly ran upon landscapes After he had sketched the wreath he directed Marianne to rub the colors for her flowers while he put in Miss Smithson s rocks When Marianne had covered all her saucers with colors and wasted ten times as much as was necessary she was eager to commence painting as she called it and in trying to wash the rose with lake she daubed it on of crimson thickness When mister Gummage saw it he gave her a severe reprimand for meddling with her own piece It was with great difficulty that the superabundant color was removed and he charged her to let the flowers alone till he was ready to wash them for her He worked a little at the piece every day forbidding Marianne to touch it and she remained idle while he was putting in skies mountains et cetera for the other young ladies At length the wreath was finished mister Gummage having only sketched it and washed it and given it the last touches It was put into a splendid frame and shown as Miss Marianne Atmore s first attempt at painting and everybody exclaimed What an excellent teacher mister Gummage must be How fast he brings on his pupils In the meantime she undertook at home to make the small copy that was to go to China But she was now at a dead lock and found it utterly impossible to advance a step without mister Gummage It was then thought best that she should do it at school meaning that mister Gummage should do it for her while she looked out the window The whole was at last satisfactorily accomplished even to the gilt star with the A in the center It was taken home and compared with the larger wreath and found still prettier and shone as Marianne s to the envy of all mothers whose daughters could not furnish models for china It was finally given in charge to the captain of the Voltaire with injunctions to order a dinner set exactly according to the pattern and to prevent the possibility of a mistake a written direction accompanied it The ship sailed and Marianne continued three quarters at mister Gummage s school where she nominally affected another flower piece and also perpetrated Kemble in Rolla Edwin and Angelina the Falls of Schuylkill and the Falls of Niagara all of which were duly framed and hung in their appointed places During the year that followed the departure of the ship Voltaire great impatience for her return was manifested by the ladies of the Atmore family anxious to see how the china would look and frequently hoping that the colors would be bright enough and none of the flowers omitted that the gilding would be rich and everything inserted in its proper place exactly according to the pattern missus Atmore s only regret was that she had not sent for a tea set also not that she was in want of one but then it would be so much better to have a dinner set and a tea set precisely alike and Marianne s beautiful wreath on all Why my dear said mister Atmore how often have I heard you say that you would never have another tea set from Canton because the Chinese persist in making the principal articles of such old fashioned awkward shapes For my part I always disliked the tall coffee pots with their straight spouts looking like light houses with bowsprits to them and the short clumsy teapots with their twisted handles and lids that always fall off To be sure said missus Atmore I have been looking forward to the time when we can get a French tea set upon tolerable terms But in the meanwhile I should be very glad to have cups and saucers with Marianne s beautiful wreath and of course when we use them on the table we should always bring forward our silver pots Spring returned and there was much watching of the vanes and great joy when they pointed easterly and the ship news now became the most interesting column of the papers A vessel that had sailed from New York to Canton on the same day the Voltaire departed from Philadelphia had already got in therefore the Voltaire might be hourly expected At length she was reported below and at this period the river Delaware suffered much in comparison with the river Hudson owing to the tediousness of its navigation from the capes to the city At last the Voltaire cast anchor at the foot of Market Street and our ladies could scarcely refrain from walking down to the wharf to see the ship that held the box that held the china But invitations were immediately sent out for a long projected dinner party which missus Atmore had persuaded her husband to defer till they could exhibit the beautiful new porcelain The box was landed and conveyed to the house The whole family were present at the opening which was performed in the dining room by mister Atmore himself all the servants peeping in at the door As soon as a part of the lid was split off and a handful of the straw removed a pile of plates appeared all separately wrapped in India paper Each of the family snatched up a plate and hastily tore off the covering There were the flowers glowing in beautiful colors and the gold star and the gold A admirably executed But under the gold star on every plate dish and tureen were the words THIS IN THE MIDDLE being the direction which the literal and exact Chinese had minutely copied from a crooked line that mister Atmore had hastily scrawled on the pattern with a very bad pen and of course without the slightest fear of its being inserted verbatim beneath the central ornament mister Atmore laughed missus Atmore cried the servants giggled aloud and Marianne cried first and laughed afterwards SUPPRESSED CHAPTERS one BY CAROLYN WELLS Zenobia they tell us was a leader born and bred Of any sort of enterprise she

heart was open as the day His feelings all were true His hair was some inclined to gray He wore it in a queue Whene er he heard the voice of pain His breast with pity burn d The large round head upon his cane From ivory was turn d Kind words he ever had for all He knew no base design His eyes were dark and rather small His nose was aquiline He lived at peace with all mankind In friendship he was true His coat had pocket holes behind His pantaloons were blue Unharm d the sin which earth pollutes He pass d securely o er And never wore a pair of boots For thirty years or more But good old Grimes is now at rest Nor fears misfortune s frown He wore a double breasted vest The stripes ran up and down He modest merit sought to find And pay it its desert He had no malice in his mind No ruffles on his shirt His neighbors he did not abuse Was sociable and gay He wore large buckles on his shoes And changed them every day His knowledge hid from public gaze He did not bring to view Nor made a noise town meeting days As many people do His worldly goods he never threw In trust to fortune s chances But lived as all his brothers do In easy circumstances Thus undisturb d by anxious cares His peaceful moments ran And everybody said he was A fine old gentleman MISS LEGION BY BERT LESTON TAYLOR She is hotfoot after Cultyure She pursues it with a club She breathes a heavy atmosphere Of literary flub

FELLOW BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY Twas a Funny Little Fellow Of the very purest type For he had a heart as mellow As an apple over ripe And the brightest little twinkle When a funny thing occurred And the lightest little tinkle Of a laugh you ever heard His smile was like the glitter Of the sun in tropic lands And his talk a sweeter twitter Than the swallow understands Hear him sing and tell a story Snap a joke ignite a pun Twas a capture rapture glory And explosion all in one Though he hadn t any money That condiment which tends To make a fellow honey For the palate of his friends Sweet simples he compounded Sovereign antidotes for sin Or taint a faith unbounded That his friends were genuine He wasn t honored may be For his songs of praise were slim Yet I never knew a baby That wouldn t crow for him I never knew a mother But urged a kindly claim Upon him as a brother At the mention of his name The sick have ceased their sighing And have even found the grace Of a smile when they were dying As they looked upon his face And I ve seen his eyes of laughter Melt in tears that only ran As though swift dancing after Came the Funny Little Man He laughed away the sorrow And he laughed away the gloom We are all so prone to borrow From the darkness of the tomb And he laughed across the ocean Of a happy life and passed With a laugh of glad emotion Into Paradise at last And I think the Angels knew him And had gathered to await His coming and run to him Through the widely opened Gate With their faces gleaming sunny For his laughter loving sake And thinking What a funny Little Angel he will make MUSICAL REVIEW EXTRAORDINARY BY JOHN PHOENIX SAN DIEGO July tenth eighteen fifty four As your valuable work is not supposed to be so entirely identified with San Franciscan interests as to be careless what takes place in other portions of this great kentry and as it is received and read in San Diego with great interest I have loaned my copy to over four different literary gentlemen most of whom have read some of it I have thought it not improbable that a few critical notices of the musical performances and the drama of this place might be acceptable to you and interest your readers I have been moreover encouraged to this task by the perusal of your interesting musical and theatrical critiques on San Francisco performers and performances as I feel convinced that if you devote so much space to them you will not allow any little feeling of rivalry between the two great cities to prevent your noticing ours which without the slightest feeling of prejudice I must consider as infinitely superior I propose this month to call your attention to the two great events in our theatrical and musical world the appearance of the talented Miss PELICAN and the production of Tarbox s celebrated Ode Symphonie of The Plains The critiques on the former are from the columns of the Vallecetos Sentinel to which they were originally contributed by me appearing on the respective dates of June first and June thirty first From the Vallecetos Sentinel June first MISS PELICAN Never during our dramatic experience has a more exciting event occurred than the sudden bursting upon our theatrical firmament full blazing unparalleled of the bright resplendent and particular star whose honored name shines refulgent at the head of this article Coming among us unheralded almost unknown without claptrap in a wagon drawn by oxen across the plains with no agent to get up a counterfeit enthusiasm in her favor she appeared before us for the first time at the San Diego Lyceum last evening in the trying and difficult character of Ingomar or the Tame Savage We are at a loss to describe our sensations our admiration at her magnificent her super human efforts We do not hesitate to say that she is by far the superior to any living actress and as we believe that to be the perfection of acting we cannot be wrong in the belief that no one hereafter will ever be found to approach her Her conception of the character of Ingomar was perfection itself her playful and ingenuous manner her light girlish laughter in the scene with Sir Peter showed an appreciation of the savage character which nothing but the most arduous study the most elaborate training could produce while her awful change to the stern unyielding uncompromising father in the tragic scene of Duncan s murder was indeed nature itself Miss Pelican is about seventeen years of age of miraculous beauty and most thrilling voice It is needless to say she dresses admirably as in fact we have said all we can say when we called her most truthfully perfection mister John Boots took the part of Parthenia very creditably et cetera et cetera From the Vallecetos Sentinel June thirty first MISS PELICAN As this lady is about to leave us to commence an engagement on the San Francisco stage we should regret exceedingly if anything we have said about her should send with her a prestige which might be found undeserved on trial The fact is Miss Pelican is a very ordinary actress indeed one of the most indifferent ones we have ever happened to see She came here from the Museum at Fort Laramie and we praised her so injudiciously that she became completely spoiled She has performed a round of characters during the last week very miserably though we are bound to confess that her performance of King Lear last evening was superior to anything of the kind we ever saw Miss Pelican is about forty three years of age singularly plain in her personal appearance awkward and embarrassed with a cracked and squeaking voice and really dresses quite outrageously She has much to learn poor thing I take it the above notices are rather ingenious The fact is I m no judge of acting and don t know how Miss Pelican will turn out If well why there s my notice of June the first if ill then June thirty first comes in play and as there is but one copy of the Sentinel printed it s an easy matter to destroy the incorrect one both can t be wrong so I ve made a sure thing of it in any event Here follows my musical critique which I flatter myself is of rather superior order THE PLAINS ODE SYMPHONIE PAR JABEZ TARBOX This glorious composition was produced at the San Diego Odeon on the thirty first of June ult for the first time in this or any other country by a very full orchestra the performance taking place immediately after supper and a chorus composed of the entire Sauer Kraut Verein the Wee Gates Association and choice selections from the Gyascutus and Pike harmonic societies The solos were rendered by Herr Tuden Links the recitations by Herr Von Hyden Schnapps both performers being assisted by Messrs John Smith and Joseph Brown who held their coats fanned them and furnished water during the more overpowering passages The Plains we consider the greatest musical achievement that has been presented to an enraptured public Like Waterloo among battles Napoleon among warriors Niagara among falls and Peck among senators this magnificent composition stands among Oratorios Operas Musical Melodramas and performances of Ethiopian Serenaders peerless and unrivaled Il frappe toute chose parfaitement froid It does not depend for its success upon its plot its theme its school or its master for it has very little if any of them but upon its soul subduing all absorbing high faluting effect upon the audience every member of which it causes to experience the most singular and exquisite sensations Its strains at times remind us of those of the old master of the steamer McKim who never went to sea without being unpleasantly affected a straining after effect he used to term it Blair in his lecture on beauty and Mills in his treatise on logic p thirty one have alluded to the feeling which might be produced in the human mind by something of this transcendentally sublime description but it has remained for M Tarbox in the production of The Plains to call this feeling forth The symphonie opens upon the wide and boundless plains in longitude one hundred fifteen degrees W latitude thirty five degrees twenty one minutes three seconds N and about sixty miles from the west bank of Pitt River These data are beautifully and clearly expressed by a long topographically drawn note from an E flat clarionet The sandy nature of the soil sparsely dotted with bunches of cactus and artemisia the extended view flat and unbroken to the horizon save by the rising smoke in the extreme verge denoting the vicinity of a Pi Utah village are represented by the bass drum A few notes on the piccolo call attention to a solitary antelope picking up mescal beans in the foreground The sun having an altitude of thirty six degrees twenty seven minutes blazes down upon the scene in indescribable majesty Gradually the sounds roll forth in a song of rejoicing to the God of Day Of thy intensity And great immensity Now then we sing Beholding in gratitude Thee in this latitude Curious thing Which swells out into Hey Jim along Jim along Josey then decrescendo mas o menos poco pocita dies away and dries up Suddenly we hear approaching a train from Pike County consisting of seven families with forty six wagons each drawn by thirteen oxen each family consists of a man in butternut colored clothing driving the oxen a wife in butternut colored clothing riding in the wagon holding a butternut baby and seventeen butternut children running promiscuously about the establishment all are barefooted dusty and smell unpleasantly All these circumstances are expressed by pretty rapid fiddling for some minutes winding up with a puff from the orpheclide played by an intoxicated Teuton with an atrocious breath it is impossible to misunderstand the description Now rises o er the plains in mellifluous accents the grand Pike County Chorus Oh we ll soon be thar In the land of gold Through the forest old O er the mounting cold With spirits bold Oh we come we come And we ll soon be thar Gee up Bolly whoo up whoo haw The train now encamp The unpacking of the kettles and mess pans the unyoking of the oxen the gathering about the various camp fires the frizzling of the pork are so clearly expressed by the music that the most untutored savage could readily comprehend it Indeed so vivid and lifelike was the representation that a lady sitting near us involuntarily exclaimed aloud at a certain passage Thar that pork s burning and it was truly interesting to watch the gratified expression of her face when by a few notes of the guitar the pan was removed from the fire and the blazing pork extinguished This is followed by the beautiful aria O marm I want a pancake Followed by that touching recitative Shet up or I will spank you To which succeeds a grand crescendo movement representing the flight of the child with the pancake the pursuit of the mother and the final arrest and summary punishment of the former represented by the rapid and successive strokes of the castanet The turning in for the night follows and the deep and stertorous breathing of the encampment is well given by the bassoon while the sufferings and trials of an unhappy father with an unpleasant infant are touchingly set forth by the cornet a piston Part Second The night attack of the Pi Utahs the fearful cries of the demoniac Indians the shrieks of the females and children the rapid and effective fire of the rifles the stampede of the oxen their recovery and the final repulse the Pi Utahs being routed after a loss of thirty six killed and wounded while the Pikes lose but one scalp from an old fellow who wore a wig and lost it in the scuffle are faithfully given and excite the most intense interest in the minds of the hearers the emotions of fear admiration and delight succeeding each other in their minds with almost painful rapidity Then follows the grand chorus Oh we gin them fits The Ingen Utahs With our six shooters We gin em pertickuler fits After which we have the charming recitative of Herr Tuden Links to the infant which is really one of the most charming gems in the performance Now dern your skin can t you be easy Morning succeeds The sun rises magnificently octavo flute breakfast is eaten in a rapid movement on three sharps the oxen are caught and yoked up with a small drum and triangle the watches purses and other valuables of the conquered Pi Utahs are stored away in a camp kettle to a small movement on the piccolo and the train moves on with the grand chorus We ll soon be thar Gee up Bolly Whoo hup whoo haw The whole concludes with the grand hymn and chorus When we die we ll go to Benton Whup Whoo haw The greatest man that e er land saw Gee Who this little airth was sent on Whup Whoo haw To tell a hawk from a handsaw Gee The immense expense attending the production of this magnificent work the length of time required to prepare the chorus and the incredible number of instruments destroyed at each rehearsal have hitherto prevented M Tarbox from placing it before the American public and it has remained for San Diego to show herself superior to her sister cities of the Union in musical taste and appreciation and in high souled liberality by patronizing this immortal prodigy and enabling its author to bring it forth in accordance with his wishes and its capabilities We trust every citizen of San Diego and Vallecetos will listen to it ere it is withdrawn and if there yet lingers in San Francisco one spark of musical fervor or a remnant of taste for pure harmony we can only say that the Southerner sails from that place once a fortnight and that the passage money is but forty five dollars THE RUNAWAY BOY BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY Wunst I sassed my Pa an he Won t stand that an punished

Hey hey Say you Get out of the way with that dray I won t Get out of the way I say But I stiffen my back and I stay on the track And I won t get out of the way When a gaudy carriage bowls along With a coachman perched on high Solemn and fat a cockade in his hat Just like a big blue fly I swing my leaders across the road And put a stop to his jaunt And the ladies cry John John drive on And I laugh when he says I caun t Oh life to me is a big picnic From the rise to the set of sun The swells that ride in their fancy drags Don t begin to have my fun I m king of the road though I wear no crown As I leisurely move along For I own the streets and I hold them down And I love to hear this song Get out of the way with your dray I won t Get out of the way I say But I stiffen my back and I stay on

delivered before the Lowell Institute of Boston Mass but owing to the unexpected circumstance of the author s receiving no invitation to lecture before that institution they were laid aside shortly after their completion Receiving an invitation from the trustees of the Vallecetos Literary and Scientific Institute during the present summer to deliver a course of Lectures on any popular subject the author withdrew his manuscript from the dusty shelf on which it had long lain neglected and having somewhat revised and enlarged it to suit the capacity of the eminent scholars before whom it was to be displayed repaired to Vallecetos But on arriving at that place he learned with deep regret that the only inhabitant had left a few days previous having availed himself of the opportunity presented by a passing emigrant s horse and that in consequence the opening of the Institute was indefinitely postponed Under these circumstances and yielding with reluctance to the earnest solicitations of many eminent scientific friends he has been induced to place the Lectures before the public in their present form Should they meet with that success which his sanguine friends prognosticate the author may be induced subsequently to publish them in the form of a text book for the use of the higher schools and universities it being his greatest ambition to render himself useful in his day and generation by widely disseminating the information he has acquired among those who less fortunate are yet willing to receive instruction JOHN PHOENIX SAN DIEGO OBSERVATORY September one eighteen fifty four LECTURES ON ASTRONOMY PART I CHAPTER I The term Astronomy is derived from two Latin words Astra a star and onomy a science and literally means the science of the stars It is a science to quote our friend Dick who was no relation at all of Big Dick though the latter occasionally caused individuals to see stars which has in all ages engaged the attention of the poet the philosopher and the divine and been the subject of their study and admiration By the wondrous discoveries of the improved telescopes of modern times we ascertain that upward of several hundred millions of stars exist that are invisible to the naked eye the nearest of which is millions of millions of miles from the Earth and as we have every reason to suppose that every one of this inconceivable number of worlds is peopled like our own a consideration of this fact and that we are undoubtedly as superior to these beings as we are to the rest of mankind is calculated to fill the mind of the American with a due sense of his own importance in the scale of animated creation It is supposed that each of the stars we see in the Heavens in a cloudless night is a sun shining upon its own curvilinear with light of its own manufacture and as it would be absurd to suppose its light and heat were made to be diffused for nothing it is presumed farther that each sun like an old hen is provided with a parcel of little chickens in the way of planets which shining but feebly by its reflected light are to us invisible To this opinion we are led also by reasoning from analogy on considering our own Solar System THE SOLAR SYSTEM is so called not because we believe it to be the sole system of the kind in existence but from its principal body the Sun the Latin name of which is Sol Thus we read of Sol Smith literally meaning the son of Old Smith On a close examination of the Heavens we perceive numerous brilliant stars which shine with a steady light differing from those which surround them which are always twinkling like a dewdrop on a cucumber vine and which moreover do not preserve constantly the same relative distance from the stars near which they are first discovered These are the planets of the SOLAR SYSTEM which have no light of their own of which the Earth on which we reside is one which shine by light reflected from the Sun and which regularly move around that body at different intervals of time and through different ranges in space Up to the time of a gentleman named Copernicus who flourished about the middle of the Fifteenth Century it was supposed by our stupid ancestors that the Earth was the center of all creation being a large flat body resting on a rock which rested on another rock and so on all the way down and that the Sun planets and immovable stars all revolved about it once in twenty four hours This reminds us of the simplicity of a child we once saw in a railroad car who fancied itself perfectly stationary and thought the fences houses and fields were tearing past it at the rate of thirty miles an hour and poking out its head to see where on earth they went to had its hat a very nice one with pink ribbons knocked off and irrecoverably lost But Copernicus who was a son of Daniel Pernicus of the firm of Pernicus company wool dealers and who was named company Pernicus out of respect to his father s partners soon set this matter to rights and started the idea of the present Solar System which greatly improved since his day is occasionally called the Copernican system By this system we learn that the Sun is stationed at one focus not hocus as it is rendered without authority by the philosopher Partington of an ellipse where it slowly grinds on for ever about its own axis while the planets turning about their axes revolve in elliptical orbits of various dimensions and different planes of inclination around it The demonstration of this system in all its perfection was left to Isaac Newton an English Philosopher who seeing an apple tumble down from a tree was led to think thereon with such gravity that he finally discovered the attraction of gravitation which proved to be the great law of Nature that keeps everything in its place Thus we see that as an apple originally brought sin and ignorance into the world the same fruit proved thereafter the cause of vast knowledge and enlightenment and indeed we may doubt whether any other fruit but an apple and a sour one at that would have produced these great results for had the fallen fruit been a pear an orange or a peach there is little doubt that Newton would have eaten it up and thought no more on the subject As in this world you will hardly ever find a man so small but that he has someone else smaller than he to look up to and revolve around him so in the Solar System we find that the majority of the planets have one or more smaller planets revolving about them These small bodies are termed secondaries moons or satellites the planets themselves being called primaries We know at present of eighteen primaries viz Mercury Venus the Earth Mars Flora Vesta Iris Metis Hebe Astrea Juno Ceres Pallas Hygeia Jupiter Saturn Herschel Neptune and another yet unnamed There are distributed among these nineteen secondaries all of which except our Moon are invisible to the naked eye We shall now proceed to consider separately the different bodies composing the Solar System and to make known what little information comparatively speaking science has collected regarding them And first in order as in place we come to THE SUN This glorious orb may be seen almost any clear day by looking intently in its direction through a piece of smoked glass Through this medium it appears about the size of a large orange and of much the same color It is however somewhat larger being in fact eight hundred eighty seven thousand miles in diameter and containing a volume of matter equal to fourteen hundred thousand globes of the size of the Earth which is certainly a matter of no small importance Through the telescope it appears like an enormous globe of fire with many spots upon its surface which unlike those of the leopard are continually changing These spots were first discovered by a gentleman named Galileo in the year sixteen eleven Though the Sun is usually termed and considered the luminary of day it may not be uninteresting to our readers to know that it certainly has been seen in the night A scientific friend of ours from New England mister R W Emerson while traveling through the northern part of Norway with a cargo of tinware on the twenty first of June eighteen thirty six distinctly saw the Sun in all its majesty shining at midnight in fact shining all night Emerson is not what you would call a superstitious man by any means but he left Since that time many persons have observed its nocturnal appearance in that part of the country at the same time of the year This phenomenon has never been witnessed in the latitude of San Diego however and it is very improbable that it ever will be Sacred history informs us that a distinguished military man named Joshua once caused the Sun to stand still how he did it is not mentioned There can of course be no doubt of the fact that he arrested its progress and possibly caused it to stand still but translators are not always perfectly accurate and we are inclined to the opinion that it might have wiggled a very little when Joshua was not looking directly at it The statement however does not appear so very incredible when we reflect that seafaring men are in the habit of actually bringing the Sun down to the horizon every day at twelve Meridian This they effect by means of a tool made of brass glass and silver called a sextant The composition of the Sun has long been a matter of dispute By close and accurate observation with an excellent opera glass we have arrived at the conclusion that its entire surface is covered with water to a very great depth which water being composed by a process known at present only to the Creator of the Universe and mister Paine of Worcester Massachusetts generates carburetted hydrogen gas which being inflamed surrounds the entire body with an ocean of fire from which we and the other planets receive our light and heat The spots upon its surface are glimpses of water obtained through the fire and we call the attention of our old friend and former schoolmate mister Agassiz to this fact as by closely observing one of these spots with a strong refracting telescope he may discover a new species of fish with little fishes inside of them It is possible that the Sun may burn out after a while which would leave this world in a state of darkness quite uncomfortable to contemplate but even under these circumstances it is pleasant to reflect that courting and love making would probably increase to an indefinite extent and that many persons would make large fortunes by the sudden rise in value of coal wood candles and gas which would go to illustrate the truth of the old proverb It s an ill wind that blows nobody any good Upon the whole the Sun is a glorious creation pleasing to gaze upon through smoked glass elevating to think upon and exceedingly comfortable to every created being on a cold day it is the largest the brightest and may be considered by far the most magnificent object in the celestial sphere though with all these attributes it must be confessed that it is occasionally entirely eclipsed by the moon CHAPTER II We shall now proceed to the consideration of the several planets MERCURY This planet with the exception of the asteroids is the smallest of the system It is the nearest to the Sun and in consequence can not be seen on account of the Sun s superior light except at its greatest eastern and western elongations which occur in March and April August and September when it may be seen for a short time immediately after sunset and shortly before sunrise It then appears like a star of the first magnitude having a white twinkling light and resembling somewhat the star Regulus in the constellation Leo The day in Mercury is about ten minutes longer than ours its year is about equal to three of our months It receives six and a half times as much heat from the Sun as we do from which we conclude that the climate must be very similar to that of Fort Yuma on the Colorado River The difficulty of communication with Mercury will probably prevent its ever being selected as a military post though it possesses many advantages for that purpose being extremely inaccessible inconvenient and doubtless singularly uncomfortable It receives its name from the God Mercury in the Heathen Mythology who is the patron and tutelary Divinity of San Diego County VENUS This beautiful planet may be seen either a little after sunset or shortly before sunrise according as it becomes the morning or the evening star but never departing quite forty eight degrees from the Sun Its day is about twenty five minutes shorter than ours its year seven and a half months or thirty two weeks The diameter of Venus is seven thousand seven hundred miles and she receives from the Sun thrice as much light and heat as the Earth An old Dutchman named Schroeter spent more than ten years in observations on this planet and finally discovered a mountain on it twenty two miles in height but he never could discover anything on the mountain not even a mouse and finally died about as wise as when he commenced his studies Venus in Mythology was a Goddess of singular beauty who became the wife of Vulcan the blacksmith and we regret to add behaved in the most immoral manner after her marriage The celebrated case of Vulcan vs Mars and the consequent scandal is probably still fresh in the minds of our readers By a large portion of society however she was considered an ill used and persecuted lady against whose high tone of morals and strictly virtuous conduct not a shadow of suspicion could be cast Vulcan by the same parties was considered a horrid brute and they all agreed that it served him right when he lost his case and had to pay the costs of court Venus still remains the Goddess of Beauty and not a few of her proteges may be found in California THE EARTH The Earth or as the Latins called it Tellus from which originated the expression Do tell us is the third planet in the Solar System and the one on which we subsist with all our important joys and sorrows The San Diego Herald is published weekly on this planet for five dollars per annum payable invariably in advance As the Earth is by no means the most important planet in the system there is no reason to suppose that it is particularly distinguished from the others by being inhabited It is reasonable therefore to conclude that all the other planets of the system are filled with living moving and sentient beings and as some of them are superior to the Earth in size and position it is not improbable that their inhabitants may be superior to us in physical and mental organization But if this were a demonstrable fact instead of a mere hypothesis it would be found a very difficult matter to persuade us of its truth To the inhabitants of Venus the Earth appears like a brilliant star very much in fact as Venus appears to us and reasoning from analogy we are led to believe that the election of mister Pierce the European war or the split in the great Democratic party produced but very little excitement among them To the inhabitants of Jupiter our important globe appears like a small star of the fourth or fifth magnitude We recollect some years ago gazing with astonishment upon the inhabitants of a drop of water developed by the Solar Microscope and secretly wondering whether they were or not reasoning beings with souls to be saved It is not altogether a pleasant reflection that a highly scientific inhabitant of Jupiter armed with a telescope of to us inconceivable form may be pursuing a similar course of inquiry and indulging in similar speculations regarding our Earth and its inhabitants Gazing with curious eye his attention is suddenly attracted by the movements of a grand celebration of Fourth of July in New York or a mighty convention in Baltimore God bless my soul he exclaims I declare they re alive these little creatures do see them wriggle To an inhabitant of the Sun however he of Jupiter is probably quite as insignificant and the Sun man is possibly a mere atom in the opinion of a dweller in Sirius A little reflection on these subjects leads to the opinion that the death of an individual man on this Earth though perhaps as important an event as can occur to himself is calculated to cause no great convulsion of Nature or disturb particularly the great aggregate of created beings The Earth moves round the Sun from west to east in a year and turns on its axis in a day thus moving at the rate of sixty eight thousand miles an hour in its orbit and rolling around at the tolerably rapid rate of ten forty miles per hour As our readers may have seen that when a man is galloping a horse violently over a smooth road if the horse from viciousness or other cause suddenly stops the man keeps on at the same rate over the animal s head so we supposing the Earth to be suddenly arrested on its axis men women children horses cattle and sheep donkeys editors and members of Congress with all our goods and chattels would be thrown off into the air at a speed of one hundred seventy three miles a minute every mother s son of us describing the arc of a parabola which is probably the only description we should ever be able to give of the affair This catastrophe to one sufficiently collected to enjoy it would doubtless be exceedingly amusing but as there would probably be no time for laughing we pray that it may not occur until after our demise when should it take place our monument will probably accompany the movement It is a singular fact that if a man travel round the Earth in an eastwardly direction he will find on returning to the place of departure he has gained one whole day the reverse of this proposition being true also it follows that the Yankees who are constantly traveling to the West do not live as long by a day or two as they would if they had stayed at home and supposing each Yankee s time to be worth one dollar fifty cents per day it may be easily shown that a considerable amount of money is annually lost by their roving dispositions Science is yet but in its infancy with its growth new discoveries of an astounding nature will doubtless be made among which probably will be some method by which the course of the Earth may be altered and it be steered with the same ease and regularity through space and among the stars as a steamboat is now directed through the water It will be a very interesting spectacle to see the Earth rounding to with her head to the air off Jupiter while the Moon is sent off laden with mails and passengers for that planet to bring back the return mails and a large party of rowdy Jupiterians going to attend a grand prize fight in the ring of Saturn Well Christopher Columbus would have been just as much astonished at a revelation of the steamboat and the locomotive engine as we should be to witness the above performance which our intelligent posterity during the ensuing year A D two thousand will possibly look upon as a very ordinary and common place affair Only three days ago we asked a medium where Sir John Franklin was at that time to which he replied he was cruising about officers and crew all well on the interior of the Earth to which he had obtained entrance through SYMMES HOLE With a few remarks upon the Earth s Satellite we conclude the first Lecture on Astronomy the remainder of the course being contained in a second Lecture treating of the planets Mars Jupiter Saturn and Neptune the Asteroids and the fixed stars which last being fixings are according to mister Charles Dickens American property THE MOON This resplendent luminary like a youth on the Fourth of July has its first quarter like a ruined spendthrift its last quarter and like an omnibus is occasionally full and new The evenings on which it appears between these last stages are beautifully illumined by its clear mellow light The Moon revolves in an elliptical orbit about the Earth in twenty nine days twelve hours forty four minutes and three seconds the time which elapses between one new Moon and another It was supposed by the ancient philosophers that the Moon was made of green cheese an opinion still entertained by the credulous and ignorant Kepler and Tyco Brahe however held to the opinion that it was composed of Charlotte Russe the dark portions of its surface being sponge cake the light blanc mange Modern advances in science and the use of Lord Rosse s famous telescope have demonstrated the absurdity of all these speculations by proving conclusively that the Moon is mainly composed of the Ferro sesqui cyanuret of the cyanide of potassium Up to the latest dates from the Atlantic States no one has succeeded in reaching the Moon Should anyone do so hereafter it will probably be a woman as the sex will never cease making an exertion for that purpose as long as there is a man in it Upon the whole we may consider the Moon an excellent institution among the many we enjoy under a free republican form of government and it is a blessed thing to reflect that the President of the United States can not veto it no matter how strong an inclination he may feel from principle or habit to do so It has been ascertained beyond a doubt that the Moon has no air Consequently the common expressions the Moon was gazing down with an air of benevolence or with an air of complacency or with an air of calm superiority are incorrect and objectionable the fact being that the Moon has no air at all The existence of the celebrated Man in the Moon has been frequently questioned by modern philosophers The whole subject is involved in doubt and obscurity The only authority we have for believing that such an individual exists and has been seen and spoken with is a fragment of an old poem composed by an ancient Astronomer of the name of Goose which has been handed down to us as follows The man in the Moon came down too soon To inquire the way to Norwich The man in the South he burned his mouth Eating cold hot porridge The evidence conveyed in this distich is however rejected by the skeptical among modern Astronomers who consider the passage an allegory The man in the South being supposed typical of the late John C Calhoun and the cold hot porridge alluded to the project of nullification

Magazine To those who may obtain such authority it may be well to state that at the close of the Lecture it was the intention of the author to exhibit and explain to the audience an orrery accompanying and interspersing his remarks by a choice selection of popular airs on the hand organ An economical orrery may be constructed by attaching eighteen wires of graduated lengths to the shaft of a candlestick apples of different sizes being placed at their extremities to represent the Planets and a central orange resting on the candlestick representing the Sun An orrery of this description is however liable to the objection that if handed around among the audience for examination it is seldom returned uninjured The author has known an instance in which a child four years of age on an occasion of this kind devoured in succession the planets Jupiter and Herschel and bit a large spot out of the Sun before he could be arrested J P AT AUNTY S HOUSE BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY One time when

and coming toward them along the same path appeared a singularly misshapen figure As they came nearer Dickey saw that it was an old man carrying on his back at each side and in front of him some part or piece of almost every imaginable thing Umbrellas chair bottoms panes of glass knives forks pans dusters tubs spoons and stove lids graters and grind stones saws and samovars Almost everything one could possibly think of said Dickey to himself The moment that the Fantasm caught sight of the strange figure he stopped and Dickey noticed that his face which was tucked securely under his left arm turned quite pale Gracious me he exclaimed in a thoroughly frightened way There s the Itinerant Tinker again Now he added hastily and dolefully I shall have to leave you and run for it Why you re surely not afraid of him Dickey exclaimed incredulously Dickey was really surprised for the old man so far as he could judge from that distance wore an extremely mild and kindly look Why do you have to run he asked Why Why the Fantasm fairly shouted I told you a moment ago that he was the Itinerant Tinker He tries to mend every broken and unbroken thing in Fantasma Land Every time he catches me went on the Fantasm as he edged cautiously away he tries to glue on my head It s very annoying and besides it hurts Good by Dickey he called and disappeared forthwith into the bushes Isn t he a droll person thought Dickey He never stops with me more than ten minutes at a time but what he either loses his head or runs away By that time the Itinerant Tinker had come up to where Dickey stood He sat wearily down on a boulder by the wayside removed some of the heavier merchandise from off his back and proceeded to mop his face vigorously with a great red handkerchief Dickey waited several minutes for the old man to speak but the Itinerant Tinker only regarded him solemnly He did not even smile It s very warm work sir ventured Dickey at last carrying all that stuff isn t it Stuff returned the Itinerant Tinker in a very mild but unmistakably hurt tone of voice Well Dickey hesitated timidly Don t call them stuff please sighed the Itinerant Tinker call them necessary commodities But whatever one does call them Dickey persisted they still make you warm to carry them all about don t they The Itinerant Tinker nodded his head and sighed again Again Dickey waited for a considerable space of time But the old man would have been perfectly content to sit there for ever Dickey thought without speaking I do wish he would talk said he to himself It s awfully annoying to have him sit there and look at one without saying a word What do you mend sir Dickey inquired at last I tried once sighed the Itinerant Tinker sadly to mend the break of day It took me twenty seven hours and eleven minutes to fix it and it broke every twenty four At that rate how long would it take to patch them all together Another distressing silence Have you figured that out whispered the Itinerant Tinker at length I haven t tried Dickey admitted I tried once the Itinerant Tinker said but I ran out of paper and gave it up Then when the night fell he resumed dolefully after another long interval of silence I tried to prop it up But I met with the same difficulty that confronted me in patching up the day and was forced to abandon that too In which direction were you going when I met you Dickey asked The Itinerant Tinker pointed ahead of him along the path and mopped his bald head But where insisted Dickey To the Crypt I was going to the Crypt murmured the Itinerant Tinker to see whether I couldn t get some umbrellas to mend But they don t need umbrellas in the Crypt do they Dickey asked surprised No they don t sighed the Itinerant Tinker and that s the reason I m going there If you don t mind said Dickey I should like to go with you Without a word of reply the Itinerant Tinker rose slowly and painfully to his feet rearranged on his back the merchandise he had laid aside and started off up the hill with Dickey following closely at his heels I tried to mend the Great Dipper once resumed the Itinerant Tinker at length I only succeeded however in crooking the handle but it looks better that way I think How did you manage to reach it asked Dickey a little doubtfully I climbed up the Milky Way replied the Itinerant Tinker sadly In order to reach it after I got there I was obliged to stand on the horn of the moon It was a very perilous undertaking Dickey couldn t believe quite all that the Itinerant Tinker was telling him But his mild and gentle eyes wore such a serious expression that he very much disliked to doubt the old man s word Speaking of the moon went on the Itinerant Tinker after a while I tried once to make her stand up after she had set you know It proved a thankless task She treated me very rudely indeed By the by have you seen the Flighty wight No sir I have not replied Dickey He s always jumping at conclusions you know I jumped at a conclusion once fell into disgrace and was very much cut up over it I tried to patch him up and he called me an old meddler You haven t heard of such ingratitude before I fancy It was very mean of him I think said Dickey sympathetically Oh that s nothing pursued the Itinerant Tinker in a melancholy tone That s nothing I once attempted to solder a new tip on the Wizard s wand He turned me into a rabbit he did Whatever did you do then asked Dickey I protested of course He merely said that he was only making game of me But if there s any one thing that I can do better than another went on the Itinerant Tinker after another embarrassing pause it s piecing together a split infinitive Would you like me to show you how it s done Indeed I should Dickey eagerly answered very much indeed Very well then Just give me time to set down these necessary commodities and I ll show you exactly the manner in which it s done and undone After he had rid himself of his awkward burden the Itinerant Tinker carefully selected a saw from his kit of tools Is that a log over there he asked pointing toward a mound of earth I m a trifle nearsighted you know No Dickey replied But there s one off there just to the other side A big one too The identical thing said the Itinerant Tinker Whereupon he walked over to it and immediately began sawing a thin slab from off its smooth end Now said he after he had finished the rather difficult task oiled his saw and returned it to his kit I proceed to write the word LOVE in the infinitive mood Is that a sad mood asked Dickey It sounds very much like it I think Without heeding the question in the least the Itinerant Tinker turned the slab for Dickey s inspection and he read on it the two words TO LOVE Taking up a wedge the Itinerant Tinker printed the word DEARLY on the flat side of it and then skilfully drove it between the words TO and LOVE When he again held it up for Dickey to see it read TO DEARLY LOVE There exclaimed the Itinerant Tinker holding the slab proudly at arm s length and turning his head slowly from side to side that s what I call a fine bit of ingenuity So that s a split infinitive is it Dickey asked Why you stupid boy the Itinerant Tinker exclaimed didn t you just this minute see me split it Yes sir I did Dickey murmured rather shamefacedly Then if I split it what else could it be but a split infinitive I d like to know Well said Dickey a bit timidly I never heard a block of wood called an infinitive before Oh my sighed the Itinerant Tinker as he sank down on his pile of merchandise How you do weary me He sat looking at the slab of wood for such a long time turning it admiringly now that way now this that poor Dickey began to grow quite nervous Please he ventured at last won t you show me now how you mend it Dickey didn t care in the least to see it done but he imagined that by asking the question he would regain the good will of the old man There you go again There you go exclaimed the Itinerant Tinker He actually shed a tear I knew you d do it I knew it Now what have I done asked Dickey innocently You ve broken the silence said the Itinerant Tinker sadly It ll take me hours and hours to glue that together But first he went on after another long pause I ll show you how neatly this split infinitive can be mended Thereupon he withdrew the wedge dipped a brush into a pot of glue and after distributing the sticky fluid over the split sides brought them carefully and neatly together There he exclaimed triumphantly that s the proper way to bring together a split infinitive Beware my boy of splitting your infinitives but if you do call on the Itinerant Tinker and he ll straighten em out for you Before we move along he resumed after he had loaded himself with his merchandise perhaps you d like to listen to a story I should if it wasn t about split infinitives replied Dickey doubtfully They really make me quite dizzy Well it s not said the Itinerant Tinker smiling vaguely It s the story of the PEDANTIC PEDAGOGUE I saw him sitting sitting there Outside the school house door It was a dismal afternoon The hour was half past four I asked him Sir what is your name His voice came through the fog I have forgotten it kind sir But I m a Pedagogue And I m so absent minded sir I put my clothes to bed And hang myself upon a chair Is not that odd he said And every morning of my life I climb into my tub Then wonder why I m sitting there Ah me man that s the rub He wiped his spectacles and said Kind sir observe this frog I took him in this net when he Was but a pollywog Now it s my wish good sir to seek The seismocosmic state And why this strange amphibian Should slowly gravitate From a mere firmisternial thing To Say I cried please wait I can not understand a word Of that which you relate Now please tell me he said again The sum of the equation Between the harp and hippogriff Define their true relation I can not answer you I said Because I m but a tinker But I can mend your old umbrel Twill be a dime I think sir Just then the frog dived off his hand And swam out to the fence Which was an easy thing to do The vapor was so dense And there he perched upon a post It was a sight to see The way he made grimaces at The Pedagogue and me It vexed us very much to see A frog so impolite I flung a gnarly stick at him Flung it with all my might It floated softly on the fog As softly as a feather The frog jumped on and sailed away Leaving us there together A shaking both our fists at him Till they were sore and numb The bull frog merely blinked at us And sang You ll drown BOTTLE O RUM With that I left the Pedagogue A sitting in the wet He was so absent minded I Dare say he s sitting yet Upon the little school house steps Revolving in his mind The definite relation twixt The cosmos and mankind When the Itinerant Tinker had finished his story he rose wearily to his feet If we don t hurry along he said I doubt whether we shall reach the Crypt in time to take our tea I never He was interrupted at this point by a shrill voice coming it seemed from the direction of the forest Jingle junk jingle junk jingle junk shouted the penetrating voice The Itinerant Tinker stopped instantly An angry frown gathered on his brow I know who that is he muttered It s Wamba son of Witless the Jester of Ivanhoe I ve been trying to catch him for seventy two years and if I do I ll Dickey never heard the end of the sentence for the Itinerant Tinker made for the wood at a surprisingly swift gait The incident had its really amusing side too for he left behind him a trail of pots pans boilers stove lids potato mashers in fact Dickey thought he must have dropped almost all of his necessary commodities by the time he had vanished into the wood THE STRIKE OF ONE BY ELLIOTT FLOWER Danny Burke was discharged A certain distinguished ex President of the United States probably would have said that he was discharged for pernicious activity but the head of the branch messenger office merely said that he was an infernal nuisance Danny was a good union man As a matter of fact he was a boy and a small boy at that but he would have scorned any description that did not put him down as a good union man Danny s environment had been one of uncompromising unionism and that was what ailed him He wanted to advance the union idea To this end he undertook to organize the other messengers in the branch office advancing all the arguments that he had heard his mother and his father use in their discussions The boys thought favorably of the scheme but most of them were inclined to let some one else do the experimenting It might result disastrously Just to encourage them Danny became insolent as he had already become inattentive he told the manager what he would do and what he would not do and positively declined to deliver a message that would carry his work a few minutes beyond quitting time Then Danny was discharged and he laughed Discharge him Well he d show them a thing or two We ll arbitrate he announced Get out ordered the manager You got to arbitrate insisted Danny You got to confer with your men or you re goin to have a strike Danny had heard so much about conferences that he felt he was on safe ground now We can t stand fer no autycrats he added You got to meet your men fair an talk it over A committee Get out repeated the manager rising from his desk near which the waiting boys were seated Men yelled Danny I calls a strike an a boycott Two of the boys rose as if to follow him but the manager was too quick He had Danny by the collar before Danny knew what had happened and the struggling boy was marched to the door and pushed out The boys who had risen promptly subsided Danny was too astonished for words In all his extended hearsay knowledge of strikes he never had heard of anything like this There was nothing heroic in it at all He had expected a conference and instead he was ignominiously handled and thrust into the street Danny sat down on a pile of paving stones to think it over Without reasoning the matter out he now regarded himself as a union The other members had deserted him but he was on a strike and somehow he had absorbed the idea that the men who were striking were always the union men So this being a strike of one he was an entire union It did not take him long to decide that the first thing to do was to picket the plant That was a familiar phrase and he knew the meaning of it Everything was nicely arranged for him too The street was being paved and he was sitting on some paving stones with a pile of gravel beside him He selected fifteen or twenty of the largest stones from the gravel pile A woman was the first victim As she was about to enter the messenger office she was startled by a yell of warning from Danny Hey you he shouted Keep out She backed away hastily and looked up to see if anything were about to fall on her Why should I keep out she asked at last Cause you ll git hit with a rock if you don t was the prompt reply But little boy she began I ain t a little boy asserted Danny I m a union The woman looked puzzled but she finally decided that this was some boyish joke You d better run home she said and turned to enter the messenger office She could not refrain from looking over her shoulder however and she saw that he was poised for a throw Don t do that she cried hastily You might hurt me Sure I ll hurt you was the reply I ll smash your block in if you don t git a move on The woman decided to look for another messenger office and Danny triumphant resumed his seat on the paving stones Then came another messenger returning from a trip What s the matter Danny he asked Got the plant picketed asserted Danny Nobody can t go in or come out I m goin in said the other boy You exclaimed Danny scornfully as he suddenly caught the boy and swung him over on to the stones No I ain t Danny the boy hastened to say for Danny gave every evidence of an intent to batter in his face Sure asked Danny Honest This here s a strike explained Danny Oh I didn t know that apologized the boy I ain t a strike breaker Danny let him up but made him sit on another pile of stones a short distance away He would be all right as long as he kept still Danny explained but no longer While Danny was continuing strike operations with rapidly growing enthusiasm the woman he had first stopped was taking an unexpected part in the little comedy She had gone to another of the branch offices with the message she wished delivered and had told of the trouble she had experienced Thereupon the manager of this office called up the manager of the other on the telephone What s the matter over there he asked Nothing was the surprised reply Who said there was Why a woman has just reported that she was driven away by a boy with a pile of stones The manager hastened to the window and realized at once that something was decidedly wrong On a pile of paving stones directly in front of the door sat the proud and happy Danny At his feet there was a pile of smaller stones and he held a few in his hands On his right was a boy who had started on a trip a short time before and on his left was one who should have reported back A man was gesticulating excitedly a number of others and some boys were laughing and Danny seemed to be intimating that any one who tried to enter would be hurt Jim said the manager to the largest messenger go out there and see what s the matter with Danny Burke Tell him I ll have him arrested if he doesn t get out Danny was a wise general He wanted no prisoners that he could not handle easily and this big boy would be dangerous to have within his lines The big boy was a sort of star messenger who did not fraternize with Danny anyhow Consequently Danny fired a volley the moment he saw who it was and the big boy hastily retreated bearing with him one bump on the forehead That s Jim Danny explained to the increasing crowd He s the biggest next to the boss Watch me nail the boss You re the stuff exclaimed some of the delighted loiterers thus proving that the loiterers are just as anxious to see trouble in a small strike as in a large one Danny picked out a stone considerably larger than the others for he expected the manager to appear next and the manager had incurred his personal enmity In the case of his victims thus far he had acted merely on principle to win his point The manager appeared For his own prestige necessary to maintain discipline the manager had to do something but he felt reasonably sure that the dignity of his official position would make Danny less hasty and strenuous than he had been with others The manager planned to extend the olive branch and at the same time raise the siege by beckoning Danny in so that he might reason with him and show him how surely he would land in a police station if he would not consent to be a good boy This would be quicker and better than summoning an officer But the manager got the big stone in the pit of his stomach just as he had raised his hand to beckon and he and his dignity collapsed together with a most plebeian grunt As he had not closed the door he quickly rolled inside where he lay on the floor with his hands on his stomach and listened to the joyous yelps of the crowd outside This was too much for the manager Call up police headquarters he said still holding his stomach as if fearful that it might become detached and tell them there s a riot here The boy addressed obeyed literally Meanwhile Danny had decided that as victory perched on his banners it was time to state the terms on which he would permit the enemy to surrender but he was too wise to put himself in the enemy s power before these terms were settled Go in Tim was the order he gave to one of his prisoners an tell the guy with the stomick ache that when he recognizes the union an gives me fifty cents more a week an makes a work day end when the clock strikes I m willin to call it off Make him come down handsome advised one of the loiterers I guess I got em on the run said Danny exultingly But Tim went in and failed to come out This was not Tim s fault however for the manager released his hold on his stomach long enough to get a grip on Tim s collar The striker s defiance seemed to displease him and because he could not shake Danny he shook Tim and he said things to Tim that he would have preferred to say to Danny Then his excited harangue was interrupted by the sound of a gong which convinced him that he might again venture to the door Danny was in the grasp of the strong arm of the law A half dozen policemen had valiantly rushed through the crowd and captured the entire besieging party which was Danny What you doin demanded Danny angrily What are you doing retorted the police sergeant in charge This here s a strike asserted Danny I got the plant picketed Run him in ordered the manager from the doorway What s the row asked the sergeant That s the row said the manager pointing to Danny That exclaimed the sergeant scornfully You said it was a riot You don t call that kid a riot do you Well it s assault and battery anyhow insisted the manager He hit me with a rock Where asked the sergeant Where he carries his brains said Danny which made the crowd yelp with joy again Lock him up cried the manager angrily I ll prefer the charge and appear against him The sergeant looked at Danny and then at the manager Say he said at last you ain t got the nerve to charge this kid with assaulting you have you I m going to do it said the manager Oh all right returned the sergeant disgustedly The crowd was disposed to protest but the police were in sufficient force to make resistance unsafe and Danny was lifted into the patrol wagon At the station the captain happened to be present when Danny was brought in escorted by a wagon load of policemen What s the charge asked the captain Assault and battery on a grown man was the scornful reply of the sergeant What did he do persisted the surprised captain Hurt his digestion with a rock explained the sergeant I was on strike said Danny I m a good union man You got no business to touch me I understand said the sergeant that he was discharged and he stationed himself outside with a pile of rocks You ve no right to do that the captain told Danny They all do it asserted Danny This was so near the truth that the captain thought it wise to dodge the subject Of course if no one else will take a man s place he explained the employer will have to take him back or There wasn t nobody tryin to take my place not while I was there asserted Danny belligerently That s no lie either laughed the sergeant He had the office tied up tight Danny swelled with pride at this testimonial to his prowess Then it suddenly occurred to him that the sergeant did not act as he talked What d you butt in for then he demanded It was his duty said the captain Ho exclaimed Danny It s your business to protect the public ain t it Of course admitted the captain Well ain t we the public The captain laughed uneasily His experience as a policeman had left him very much in doubt as to who were the public Both sides to a controversy always claimed that distinction and the law breaker was usually the louder in his claims Danny s inability to see anything but his own side of the case was far from unusual The captain took Danny into his private office and talked to him The captain did not wish to lock up the boy so he sent for Danny s father and also for the manager of the branch messenger office Meanwhile he tried to explain the matter to Danny but Danny was obtuse Why should not he do as his father and his father s friends did When they had a disagreement with the boss they picketed the plant and ensuing incidents sent many people to the hospitals Why was it worse for one boy to do this than it was for some hundreds or thousands of men Danny was confident that he was within his rights Dad knows he said in conclusion Dad ll say I m right You got no business mixin in Dad s coming the captain told him The manager came first The boy ought to be punished said he He hit me with a rock I wish you d seen him said the beaming Danny to the captain for the recollection of that victory made all else seem trivial Say he doubled up like a clown droppin into a barrel If he isn t punished asserted the glowering manager he ll get worse and worse and end by going to the devil Perhaps replied the captain But just stand beside him a moment please Don t dodge Danny He ll go behind the bars if he touches you Stand side by side They did so Now said the captain to the manager how do you think you ll look standing beside him in the police court and accusing him of assault and battery Like a fool replied the manager promptly forced to laugh in spite of himself And what kind of a story illustrated story will it be for the papers persisted the captain Let him go said the manager but he ought to be whaled It was at this point that Dan arrived accompanied by his wife F r why sh u d he be whaled demanded the latter aggressively The matter was explained to her Is that thrue Danny she asked Sure replied the boy Well I d like to see anny wan outside the fam ly whale ye she said with a defiant look at the manager but I ll do it mesilf Danny was astounded In this quarter at least he had expected support He glanced at his father I ll take a lick or two at ye mesilf said Dan The idee of breakin the law an makin all this throuble You ve done it yourself argued Danny Shut up commanded Dan Ye don t know what ye re talkin about A sthrike s wan thing an disordherly conduct s another This was a strike insisted Danny Where s the union demanded Dan I m it replied Danny I was organizin it If ye ll let him go Captain said Dan ignoring his son s reply I ll larrup him good For what wailed Danny I was only doin what you said was right an what mom said was right an what you ve all been talkin for years You ve been a picket yourself an I ve heard you laughin over the way men who wouldn t strike was done up We got to organize Wasn t I organizin We got to enforce our rights Wasn t I enforcin them We got to discourage traitors to the cause of labor Wasn t I discouragin them Didn t the union tie up a plant once when you was discharged What s eatin you dad Danny s own presentation of the case was so strong that it gave him courage But the last question made Dan jump although he was not accustomed to any extraordinary show of respect from his son The lad has no sinse he announced but I ll larrup him plenty Ye get an exthry wan f r that Danny I ll tache ye that ye re not runnin things Makin throuble f r father an mother an th good man that s payin ye wages we need at home added missus Burke Now what do you think of that whimpered Danny as he was led away I m to be licked fer doin what he does Why don t he teach himself the same an stop others from doin what he talks Danny said the commiserating captain you re to be licked for learning your lesson too well and that s the truth But that did not make the situation any the less painful for Danny SIMON

6276-62021-0007	train-other-500	very earnestly engaged at seven up Of course the game was instantly suspended as soon as they spied the old man sixty or seventy yards off striding towards them It was evidently a gone case with Simon and Bill
none	none	 but our hero determined to make the best of it Putting the cards into one pocket he coolly picked up the small coins which constituted the stake and fobbed them in the other remarking Well Bill this game s blocked we d as well quit But Mass Simon remarked the boy half dat money s mine Ain t you gwine to lemme hab em Oh never mind the money Bill the old man s going to take the bark off both of us 
6276-62021-0008	train-other-500	and besides with the hand I helt when we quit I should a beat you and won it all any way Well but Mass Simon we nebber finish de game and de rule
none	none	 Go to the devil with your rule said the impatient Simon 
6276-62021-0009	train-other-500	Don t you see daddy s right down upon us with an armful of hickories I tell you I helt nothin but trumps and could a beat the horns off a billy goat Don t that satisfy you
none	none	 Somehow or another you re d d hard to please 
6276-62021-0010	train-other-500	About this time a thought struck Simon and in a low tone for by this time the Reverend Jedediah was close at hand he continued But may be daddy don t know
6276-62021-0011	train-other-500	right down sure what we ve been doin Let s try him with a lie
none	none	 twon t hurt noway 
6276-62021-0012	train-other-500	let s tell him we ve been playin mumble peg
none	none	 Bill was perforce compelled to submit to this inequitable adjustment of his claim to a share of the stakes and of course agreed to swear to the game of mumble peg 
6276-62021-0013	train-other-500	All this was settled and a pig driven into the ground slyly and hurriedly between Simon s legs as he sat on the ground just as the old man reached the spot
none	none	 He carried under his left arm 
6276-62021-0014	train-other-500	several neatly trimmed sprouts of formidable length while in his left hand he held one which he was intently engaged in divesting of its superfluous twigs
none	none	 Soho youngsters you in the fence corner and the crap in the grass 
6276-62021-0052	train-other-500	What saith the Scriptur
6276-62021-0015	train-other-500	What saith the Scriptur Simon
none	none	 Go to the ant thou sluggard 
6276-62021-0016	train-other-500	and so forth and so on What in the round creation of the yearth have you and that nigger been a doin Bill shook with fear but Simon was cool as a cucumber
6276-62021-0017	train-other-500	and answered his father to the effect that they had been wasting a little time in the game of mumble peg Mumble peg mumble peg repeated old mister Suggs What s that
6276-62021-0018	train-other-500	Simon explained the process of rooting for the peg how the operator got upon his knees keeping his arms stiff by his sides leaned forward and extracted the peg with his teeth
6276-62021-0019	train-other-500	So you git upon your knees do you to pull up that nasty little stick You d better git upon em to ask mercy for your sinful souls and for a dyin world
6276-62021-0020	train-other-500	But let s see one o you git the peg up now The first impulse of our hero was to volunteer to gratify the curiosity of his worthy sire but a glance at the old man s countenance changed his notion
6276-62021-0021	train-other-500	and he remarked that Bill was a long ways the best hand Bill who did not deem Simon s modesty an omen very favorable to himself was inclined to reciprocate compliments with his young master
6276-62021-0022	train-other-500	but a gesture of impatience from the old man set him instantly upon his knees and bending forward he essayed to lay hold with his teeth of the peg
none	none	 which Simon just at that moment 
6276-62021-0023	train-other-500	very wickedly pushed a half inch further down Just as the breeches and hide of the boy were stretched to the uttermost
none	none	 old mister Suggs brought down his longest hickory 
6276-62021-0024	train-other-500	with both hands upon the precise spot where the tension was greatest With a loud yell Bill plunged forward upsetting Simon and rolled in the grass rubbing the castigated part with fearful energy
6276-62021-0025	train-other-500	Simon though overthrown was unhurt and he was mentally complimenting himself upon the sagacity which had prevented his illustrating the game of mumble peg for the paternal amusement
6276-62021-0026	train-other-500	when his attention was arrested by the old man s stooping to pick up something what is it a card upon which Simon had been sitting
6276-62021-0027	train-other-500	and which therefore had not gone with the rest of the pack into his pocket
none	none	 The simple mister Suggs had only a vague idea of the pasteboard abomination called 
6276-62021-0028	train-other-500	cards and though he decidedly inclined to the opinion that this was one he was by no means certain of the fact Had Simon known this he would certainly have escaped
none	none	 but he did not His father assuming the look of extreme sapiency 
6276-62021-0029	train-other-500	which is always worn by the interrogator who does not desire or expect to increase his knowledge by his questions asked What s this Simon The Jack a dimunts promptly responded Simon
none	none	 who gave up all as lost after this faux pas What was it doin down thar Simon my sonny continued mister Suggs 
6276-62021-0030	train-other-500	in an ironically affectionate tone of voice
none	none	 I had it under my leg thar to make it on Bill the first time it come trumps was the ready reply What s trumps asked mister Suggs with a view of arriving at the import of the word 
6276-62021-0031	train-other-500	Nothin ain t trumps now said Simon who misapprehended his father s meaning but clubs was
none	none	 when you come along and busted up the game A part of this answer was Greek to the Reverend mister Suggs but a portion of it was full of meaning 
6276-62021-0032	train-other-500	They had then most unquestionably been throwing cards the scoundrels
none	none	 the oudacious little hellions 
6276-62021-0033	train-other-500	To the mulberry with both on ye in a hurry said the old man sternly But the lads were not disposed to be in a hurry for the mulberry was the scene of all formal punishment administered during work hours in the field
none	none	 Simon followed his father however but made as he went along all manner of faces at the old man s back gesticulated as if he were going to strike him between the shoulders with his fists 
6276-62021-0034	train-other-500	and kicking at him so as almost to touch his coat tail with his shoe In this style they walked on to the mulberry tree in whose shade Simon s brother Ben was resting
6276-62021-0035	train-other-500	It must not be supposed that during the walk to the place of punishment Simon s mind was either inactive or engaged in suggesting the grimaces and contortions wherewith he was pantomimically expressing his irreverent sentiments toward his father
6276-62021-0036	train-other-500	Far from it The movements of his limbs and features were the mere workings of habit the self grinding of the corporeal machine for which his reasoning half was only remotely responsible
6276-62021-0037	train-other-500	For while Simon s person was thus on its own account making game of old Jed diah his wits in view of the anticipated flogging were dashing
6276-62021-0038	train-other-500	springing bounding darting about in hot chase of some expedient suitable to the necessities of the case much after the manner in which puss
6276-62021-0039	train-other-500	when Betty armed with the broom and hotly seeking vengeance for pantry robbed or bed defiled has closed upon her the garret doors and windows attempts all sorts of impossible exits
6276-62021-0040	train-other-500	to come down at last in the corner with panting side and glaring eye exhausted and defenseless Our unfortunate hero
none	none	 could devise nothing by which he could reasonably expect to escape the heavy blows of his father Having arrived at this conclusion and the mulberry about the same time 
6276-62021-0041	train-other-500	he stood with a dogged look awaiting the issue The old man Suggs made no remark to any one while he was sizing up Bill a process which though by no means novel to Simon
6276-62021-0042	train-other-500	seemed to excite in him a sort of painful interest He watched it closely as if endeavoring to learn the precise fashion of his father s knot and when at last Bill was swung up a tiptoe to a limb
6276-62021-0043	train-other-500	and the whipping commenced Simon s eye followed every movement of his father s arm and as each blow descended upon the bare shoulders of his sable friend
none	none	 his own body writhed and wriggled in involuntary sympathy It s the devil it is said Simon to himself to take such a wallopin as that Why the old man looks like he wants to git to the holler if he could rot his old picter It s wuth at the least fifty cents je e miny how that hurt yes it s wuth three quarters of a dollar to take that ere lickin Wonder if I m predestinated as old Jed diah says to git the feller to it Lord how daddy blows I do wish to God he d bust wide open the durned old deer face If twa n t for Ben helpin him I b lieve I d give the old dog a tussel when it comes to my turn It couldn t make the thing no wuss if it didn t make it no better Drot it what do boys have daddies for anyhow Tain t for nuthin but jist to beat em and work em There s some use in mammies I kin poke my finger right in the old oman s eye and keep it thar and if I say it ain t thar she ll say so too 
6276-62021-0044	train-other-500	I wish she was here to hold daddy off
none	none	 If twa n t so fur I d holler for her anyhow 
6276-62021-0045	train-other-500	How she would cling to the old fellow s coat tail
none	none	 mister Jedediah Suggs let down Bill and untied him Approaching Simon whose coat was off Come Simon son said he cross them hands I m gwine to correct you It ain t no use daddy said Simon 
6276-62021-0046	train-other-500	Why so Simon
none	none	 Jist bekase it ain t I m gwine to play cards as long as I live When I go off to myself I m gwine to make my livin by it So what s the use of beatin me about it Old mister Suggs groaned as he was wont to do in the pulpit at this display of Simon s viciousness Simon said he you re a poor ignunt creetur You don t know nothin 
6276-62021-0047	train-other-500	and you ve never been nowhars If I was to turn you off you d starve in a week I wish you d try me said Simon and jist see I d win more money in a week than you can make in a year
6276-62021-0048	train-other-500	There ain t nobody round here kin make seed corn off o me at cards I m rale smart he added with great emphasis Simon Simon
none	none	 you poor unlettered fool Don t you know that all card players and chicken fighters and horse racers go to hell 
6276-62021-0049	train-other-500	You crack brained creetur you And don t you know that them that plays cards always loses their money and Who wins it all then daddy asked Simon Shet your mouth you imperdent slack jawed dog
6276-62021-0050	train-other-500	Your daddy s a tryin to give you some good advice and you a pickin up his words that way I knowed a young man once when I lived in Ogletharp as went down to Augusty and sold a hundred dollars worth of cotton for his daddy
none	none	 and some o them gambollers got him to drinkin 
6276-62021-0051	train-other-500	and the very first night he was with em they got every cent of his money They couldn t get my money in a week said Simon Anybody can git these here green feller s money
none	none	 them s the sort I m a gwine to watch for myself Here s what kin fix the papers jist about as nice as anybody Well it s no use to argify about the matter said old Jed diah What saith the Scriptur He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow 
6276-62021-0053	train-other-500	Hence Simon you re a poor misubble fool so cross your hands You d jist as well not daddy I tell you I m gwine to follow playin cards for a livin and what s the use o bangin a feller about it
none	none	 I m as smart as any of em and Bob Smith says them Augusty fellers can t make rent off o me The Reverend mister Suggs had once in his life gone to Augusta an extent of travel which in those days was a little unusual 
6276-62021-0054	train-other-500	His consideration among his neighbors was considerably increased by the circumstance as he had all the benefit of the popular inference that no man
none	none	 could visit the city of Augusta without acquiring a vast superiority over all his untraveled neighbors in every department of human knowledge mister Suggs then very naturally felt ineffably indignant 
6276-62021-0055	train-other-500	that an individual who had never seen any collection of human habitations larger than a log house village an individual in short no other or better than Bob Smith
6276-62021-0056	train-other-500	should venture to express an opinion concerning the manners customs or anything else appertaining to or in any wise connected with
none	none	 the Ultima Thule of backwoods Georgians 
6276-62021-0057	train-other-500	There were two propositions which witnessed their own truth to the mind of mister Suggs the one was that a man who had never been at Augusta could not know anything about that city
none	none	 or any place or anything else the other that one who had been there must of necessity be not only well informed as to all things connected with the city itself but perfectly 
6276-62021-0058	train-other-500	au fait upon all subjects whatsoever It was therefore in a tone of mingled indignation and contempt that he replied to the last remark of Simon Bob Smith
none	none	 says does he 
6276-62021-0059	train-other-500	And who s Bob Smith Much does Bob Smith know about Augusty He s been thar I reckon Slipped off yerly some mornin when nobody warn t noticin
none	none	 and got back afore night It s only a hundred and fifty mile Oh yes Bob Smith knows all about it I don t know nothin about it I ain t never been to Augusty I couldn t find the road thar I reckon ha ha Bob Sm ith 
6276-62021-0060	train-other-500	If he was only to see one of them fine gentlemen in Augusty with his fine broadcloth and bell crown hat
none	none	 and shoe boots a shinin like silver 
6276-62021-0061	train-other-500	he d take to the woods and kill himself a runnin Bob Smith That s whar all your devilment comes from Simon Bob Smith s as good as anybody else I judge
6276-62021-0062	train-other-500	and a heap smarter than some He showed me how to cut Jack continued Simon and that s more nor some people can do if they have been to Augusty If Bob Smith kin do it said the old man I kin too
none	none	 I don t know it by that name but 
6276-62021-0063	train-other-500	if it s book knowledge or plain sense and Bob kin do it
none	none	 it s reasonable to s pose that old Jed diah Suggs won t be bothered bad 
6276-62021-0064	train-other-500	Is it any ways similyar to the rule of three Simon
none	none	 Pretty similyar daddy but not adzactly said Simon 
6276-62021-0065	train-other-500	drawing a pack from his pocket to explain Now daddy he proceeded
none	none	 you see these here four cards is what we call the Jacks Well now the idee is 
6276-62021-0066	train-other-500	if you ll take the pack and mix em all up together I ll take off a passel from the top and the bottom one of them I take off will be one of the Jacks
6276-62021-0067	train-other-500	Me to mix em fust said old Jed diah Yes And you not to see but the back of the top one when you go to cut as you call it Jist so daddy
none	none	 And the backs all jist as like as kin be said the senior Suggs examining the cards 
6276-62021-0068	train-other-500	More alike nor cow peas said Simon It can t be done Simon observed the old man with great solemnity Bob Smith kin do it and so kin I
none	none	 It s agin nater Simon 
6276-62021-0069	train-other-500	thar ain t a man in Augusty nor on top of the yearth that kin do it Daddy said our hero
none	none	 ef you ll bet me What thundered old mister Suggs 
6276-62021-0070	train-other-500	Bet did you says
none	none	 and he came down with a scorer across Simon s shoulders Me Jed diah Suggs 
6276-62021-0071	train-other-500	that s been in the Lord s sarvice these twenty years me bet you nasty sassy triflin ugly I didn t go to say that daddy that warn t what I meant adzactly
none	none	 I went to say that ef you d let me off from this her maulin you owe me and give me Bunch if I cut Jack 
6276-62021-0072	train-other-500	I d give you all this here silver ef I didn t that s all To be sure I allers knowed you wouldn t bet
none	none	 Old mister Suggs ascertained the exact amount of the silver which his son handed him 
6276-62021-0073	train-other-500	in an old leathern pouch for inspection He also mentally compared that sum with an imaginary one the supposed value of a certain Indian pony called Bunch
none	none	 which he had bought for his old woman s Sunday riding and which had sent the old lady into a fence corner the first and only time she ever mounted him As he weighed the pouch of silver in his hand mister Suggs also endeavored to analyze the character of the transaction proposed by Simon It sartinly can t be nothin but givin no way it kin be twisted 
6276-62021-0074	train-other-500	he murmured to himself
none	none	 I know he can t do it 
6276-62021-0075	train-other-500	so there s no resk What makes bettin The resk It s a one sided business and I ll jist let him give me all his money
none	none	 and that ll put all his wild sportin notions out of his head 
6276-62021-0076	train-other-500	Will you stand it daddy asked Simon by way of waking the old man up
none	none	 You mought as well for the whippin won t do you no good and as for Bunch nobody about the plantation won t ride him but me 
6276-62021-0077	train-other-500	Simon replied the old man I agree to it Your old daddy is in a close place about payin for his land and this here money
6276-62021-0078	train-other-500	it s jist eleven dollars lacking of twenty five cents will help out mightily But mind Simon ef anything s said about this hereafter remember you give me the money Very well daddy
none	none	 and ef the thing works up instid o down I s pose we ll say you give me Bunch eh You won t never be troubled to tell how you come by Bunch the thing s agin nater and can t be done What old Jed diah Suggs knows he knows as good as anybody 
6276-62021-0079	train-other-500	Give me them fix ments Simon Our hero handed the cards to his father who dropping the plow line with which he had intended to tie Simon s hands turned his back to that individual
6276-62021-0080	train-other-500	in order to prevent his witnessing the operation of mixing He then sat down and
none	none	 very leisurely commenced shuffling the cards 
6276-62021-0081	train-other-500	making however an exceedingly awkward job of it Restive kings and queens jumped from his hands or obstinately refused to slide into the company of the rest of the pack
6276-62021-0082	train-other-500	Occasionally a sprightly knave would insist on facing his neighbor or pressing his edge against another s half double himself up and then skip away
none	none	 But Elder Jed diah perseveringly continued his attempts to subdue the refractory 
6276-62021-0083	train-other-500	while heavy drops burst from his forehead and ran down his cheeks All of a sudden an idea quick and penetrating as a rifle ball seemed to have entered the cranium of the old man He chuckled
6276-62021-0084	train-other-500	audibly The devil had suggested to mister Suggs an impromptu stock which would place the chances of Simon already sufficiently slim in the old man s opinion without the range of possibility
none	none	 mister Suggs forthwith proceeded to cut all the picter ones so as to be certain to include the Jacks and place them at the bottom with the evident intention of keeping Simon s fingers above these 
6276-62021-0085	train-other-500	when he should cut Our hero who was quietly looking over his father s shoulders all the time did not seem alarmed by this disposition of the cards on the contrary he smiled
6276-62021-0086	train-other-500	as if he felt perfectly confident of success in spite of it Now daddy said Simon when his father had announced himself ready narry one of us
none	none	 ain t got to look at the cards while I m a cuttin 
6276-62021-0087	train-other-500	if we do it ll spile the conjuration Very well
none	none	 And another thing you ve got to look me right dead in the eye daddy will you 
6276-62021-0088	train-other-500	To be sure to be sure
none	none	 said mister Suggs fire away 
6276-62021-0089	train-other-500	Simon walked up close to his father and placed his hand on the pack
none	none	 Old mister Suggs looked in Simon s eye and Simon returned the look for about three seconds 
6276-62021-0090	train-other-500	during which a close observer might have detected a suspicious working of the wrist of the hand on the cards but
none	none	 the elder Suggs did not remark it 
6276-62021-0091	train-other-500	Wake snakes
none	none	 day s a breakin 
6276-62021-0092	train-other-500	Rise Jack said Simon cutting half a dozen cards from the top of the pack and presenting the face of the bottom one for the inspection of his father It was the Jack of hearts
none	none	 Old mister Suggs staggered back several steps with uplifted eyes and hands Marciful master he exclaimed ef the boy hain t 
6276-62021-0093	train-other-500	Well how in the round creation of the Ben did you ever
none	none	 To be sure and sartain Satan has power on this yearth 
6276-62021-0094	train-other-500	and mister Suggs groaned in very bitterness You never seed nothin like that in Augusty did ye daddy asked Simon with a malicious wink at Ben Simon how
none	none	 did you do it queried the old man without noticing his son s question 
6276-62021-0095	train-other-500	Do it daddy Do it Tain t nothin
none	none	 I done it jist as easy as shootin Whether this explanation was entirely or in any degree satisfactory to the perplexed mind of Elder Jed diah Suggs can not after the lapse of the time which has intervened be sufficiently ascertained It is certain however that he pressed the investigation no farther but merely requested his son Benjamin to witness the fact that in consideration of his love and affection for his son Simon and in order to furnish the donee with the means of leaving that portion of the State of Georgia 
6276-62021-0096	train-other-500	he bestowed upon him the impracticable pony Bunch Jist so daddy jist so I ll witness that
none	none	 But it minds me mightily of the way mammy give old Trailler the side of bacon last week She a sweepin up the h a th the meat on the table 
6276-62021-0097	train-other-500	old Trailler jumps up gethers the bacon and darts
none	none	 Mammy arter him with the broom stick as fur as the door but seein the dog has got the start she shakes the stick at him and hollers You sassy aigsukkin roguish gnatty flop eared varmint take it along take it along I only wish twas full of a snic and ox vomit and blue vitrul 
6276-62021-0098	train-other-500	so as twould cut your interls into chitlins That s about the way you give Bunch to Simon Oh shuh Ben remarked Simon I wouldn t run on that way Daddy couldn t help it it was predestinated Whom he hath he will you know
6276-62021-0099	train-other-500	and the rascal pulled down the under lid of his left eye at his brother Then addressing his father he asked War n t it daddy To be sure to be sure all fixed aforehand
none	none	 was old mister Suggs reply 
6276-62021-0100	train-other-500	Didn t I tell you so Ben said Simon I knowed it was all fixed aforehand and he laughed until he was purple in the face What s in ye
none	none	 What are ye laughin about asked the old man wrothily 
6276-62021-0101	train-other-500	Oh it s so funny
none	none	 that it could all a been fixed aforehand said Simon and laughed louder than before The obtusity of the Reverend mister Suggs however 
6276-62021-0102	train-other-500	prevented his making any discoveries He fell into a brown study and no further allusion was made to the matter It was evident to our hero that his father intended he should remain but
6276-62021-0103	train-other-500	one more night beneath the paternal roof What mattered it to Simon He went home at night curried and fed Bunch
none	none	 whispered confidentially in his ear that 
6276-62021-0104	train-other-500	he was the fastest piece of hossflesh accordin to size that ever shaded the yearth and then busied himself in preparing for an early start on the morrow
6276-62021-0105	train-other-500	Old mister Suggs big red rooster had hardly ceased crowing in announcement of the coming dawn when Simon mounted the intractable Bunch Both were in high spirits
6276-62021-0106	train-other-500	our hero at the idea of unrestrained license in future
none	none	 and Bunch from a mesmerical transmission to himself 
6276-62021-0107	train-other-500	of a portion of his master s deviltry Simon raised himself in the stirrups yelled a tolerably fair imitation of the Creek war whoop and shouted I m off old stud
6276-62021-0108	train-other-500	Remember the Jack a hearts Bunch shook his little head tucked down his tail ran sideways as if going to fall
none	none	 and then suddenly reared squealed and struck off at a brisk gallop A PIANO IN ARKANSAS BY THOMAS BANGS THORPE We shall never forget the excitement which seized upon the inhabitants of the little village of Hardscrabble as the report spread through the community that a real piano had actually arrived within its precincts Speculation was afloat as to its appearance and its use The name was familiar to everybody but what it precisely meant no one could tell That it had legs was certain for a stray volume of some literary traveler was one of the most conspicuous works in the floating library of Hardscrabble and said traveler stated that he had seen a piano somewhere in New England with pantalets on also an old foreign paper was brought forward in which there was an advertisement headed Soiree which informed the citizens generally that mister Bobolink would preside at the piano This was presumed by several wiseacres who had been to a menagerie to mean that mister Bobolink stirred the piano with a long pole in the same way that the showman did the lions and rhi no ce rus So public opinion was in favor of its being an animal though a harmless one for there had been a land speculator through the village a few weeks previously who distributed circulars of a Female Academy for the accomplishment of young ladies These circulars distinctly stated the use of the piano to be one dollar per month One knowing old chap said if they would tell him what so i ree meant he would tell them what a piano was and no mistake The owner of this strange instrument was no less than a very quiet and very respectable late merchant of a little town somewhere north who having failed at home had emigrated into the new and hospitable country of Arkansas for the purpose of bettering his fortune and escaping the heartless sympathy of his more lucky neighbors who seemed to consider him a very bad and degraded man because he had become honestly poor The new comers were strangers of course The house in which they were setting up their furniture was too little arranged to admit of calls and as the family seemed very little disposed to court society all prospects of immediately solving the mystery that hung about the piano seemed hopeless In the meantime public opinion was rife The depository of this strange thing was looked upon by the passers by with indefinable awe and as noises unfamiliar sometimes reached the street it was presumed that the piano made them and the excitement rose higher than ever In the midst of it one or two old ladies presuming upon their age and respectability called upon the strangers and inquired after their health and offered their services and friendship meantime everything in the house was eyed with great intensity but seeing nothing strange a hint was given about the piano One of the new family observed carelessly that it had been much injured by bringing out that the damp had affected its tones and that one of its legs was so injured that it would not stand up and for the present it would not ornament the parlor Here was an explanation indeed injured in bringing out damp affecting its tones leg broken Poor thing ejaculated the old ladies with real sympathy as they proceeded homeward traveling has evidently fatigued it the Mass is sip fogs has given it a cold poor thing and they wished to see it with increased curiosity The village agreed that if Moses Mercer familiarly called Mo Mercer was in town they would have a description of the piano and the uses to which it was put and fortunately in the midst of the excitement Mo arrived he having been temporarily absent on a hunting expedition Moses Mercer was the only son of old Mercer who was and had been in the State Senate ever since Arkansas was admitted into the Union Mo from this fact received great glory of course his father s greatness alone would have stamped him with superiority but his having been twice in the Capitol when the legislature was in session stamped his claims to pre eminence over all competitors Mo Mercer was the oracle of the renowned village of Hardscrabble Mo knew everything he had all the consequence and complacency of a man who had never seen his equal and never expected to Mo bragged extensively upon his having been to the Capitol twice of his there having been in the most fashionable society of having seen the world His return to town was therefore received with a shout The arrival of the piano was announced to him and he alone of all the community was not astonished at the news His insensibility was considered wonderful He treated the piano as a thing that he was used to and went on among other things to say that he had seen more pianos in the Capitol than he had ever seen woodchucks and that it was not an animal but a musical instrument played upon by the ladies and he wound up his description by saying that the way the dear creatures could pull music out of it was a caution to hoarse owls The new turn given to the piano excitement in Hardscrabble by Mo Mercer was like pouring oil on fire to extinguish it for it blazed out with more vigor than ever That it was a musical instrument made it a rarer thing in that wild country than if it had been an animal and people of all sizes colors and degrees were dying to see and hear it Jim Cash was Mo Mercer s right hand man in the language of refined society he was Mo s toady in the language of Hardscrabble he was Mo s wheel horse Cash believed in Mo Mercer with an abandonment that was perfectly ridiculous mister Cash was dying to see the piano and the first opportunity he had alone with his Quixote he expressed the desire that was consuming his vitals We ll go at once and see it said Mercer Strangers echoed the frightened Cash Humbug Do you think I have visited the Capitol twice and don t know how to treat fashionable society Come along at once Cash said Mercer Off the pair started Mercer all confidence and Cash all fears as to the propriety of the visit These fears Cash frankly expressed but Mercer repeated for the thousandth time his experience in the fashionable society of the Capitol and pianos which he said was synonymous and he finally told Cash to comfort him that however abashed and ashamed he might be in the presence of the ladies he needn t fear of sticking for he would pull him through A few minutes walk brought the parties on the broad galleries of the house that contained the object of so much curiosity The doors and windows were closed and a suspicious look was on everything Do they always keep a house closed up this way that has a piano in it asked Cash mysteriously Certainly replied Mercer the damp would destroy its tones Repeated knocks at the doors and finally at the windows satisfied both Cash and Mercer that nobody was at home In the midst of their disappointment Cash discovered a singular machine at the end of the gallery crossed by bars and rollers and surmounted with an enormous crank Cash approached it on tiptoe he had a presentiment that he beheld the object of his curiosity and as its intricate character unfolded itself he gazed with distended eyes and asked Mercer with breathless anxiety what that strange and incomprehensible box was Mercer turned to the thing as coolly as a north wind to an icicle and said that was it That it exclaimed Cash opening his eyes still wider and then recovering himself he asked to see the tone Mercer pointed to the cross bars and rollers With trembling hands with a resolution that would enable a man to be scalped without winking Cash reached out his hand and seized the handle of the crank Cash at heart was a brave and fearless man He gave it a turn the machinery grated harshly and seemed to clamor for something to be put in its maw What delicious sounds said Cash Beautiful observed the complacent Mercer at the same time seizing Cash s arm and asking him to desist for fear of breaking the instrument or getting it out of tune The simple caution was sufficient and Cash in the joy of the moment at what he had done and seen looked as conceited as Mo Mercer himself Busy indeed was Cash from this time forward in explaining to gaping crowds the exact appearance of the piano how he had actually taken hold of it and as his friend Mo Mercer observed pulled music out of it The curiosity of the village was thus allayed and consequently died comparatively away Cash however having risen to almost as much importance as Mo Mercer for having seen and handled the thing Our Northern family knew little or nothing of all this excitement they received meanwhile the visits and congratulations of the hospitable villagers and resolved to give a grand party to return some of the kindness they had received and the piano was for the first time moved into the parlor No invitation on this occasion was neglected early at the post was every visitor for it was rumored that Miss Patience Doolittle would in the course of the evening perform on the piano The excitement was immense The supper was passed over with a contempt rivaling that which is cast upon an excellent farce played preparatory to a dull tragedy in which the star is to appear The furniture was all critically examined but nothing could be discovered answering Cash s description An enormously thick leafed table with a spread upon it attracted little attention timber being so very cheap in a new country and so everybody expected soon to see the piano brought in Mercer of course was the hero of the evening he talked much and loudly Cash as well as several young ladies went into hysterics at his wit Mercer as the evening wore away grew exceedingly conceited even for him and he graciously asserted that the company present reminded him of his two visits to the Capitol and other associations equally exclusive and peculiar The evening wore on apace and still no piano That hope deferred which maketh the heart sick was felt by some elderly ladies and by a few younger ones and Mercer was solicited to ask Miss Patience Doolittle to favor the company with the presence of the piano Certainly said Mercer and with the grace of a city dandy he called upon the lady to gratify all present with a little music prefacing his request with the remark that if she was fatigued his friend Cash would give the machine a turn Miss Patience smiled and looked at Cash Cash s knees trembled All eyes in the room turned upon him Cash trembled all over Miss Patience said she was gratified to hear that mister Cash was a musician she admired people who had a musical taste Whereupon Cash fell into a chair as he afterward observed chawed up Oh that Beau Brummel or any of his admirers could have seen Mo Mercer all this while Calm as a summer morning complacent as a newly painted sign he smiled and patronized and was the only unexcited person in the room Miss Patience rose A sigh escaped from all present the piano was evidently to be brought in She approached the thick leafed table and removed the covering throwing it carelessly and gracefully aside opened the instrument and presented the beautiful arrangement of dark and white keys Mo Mercer at this for the first time in his life looked confused he was Cash s authority in his descriptions of the appearance of the piano while Cash himself began to recover the moment that he ceased to be an object of attention Many a whisper now ran through the room as to the tones and more particularly the crank none could see them Miss Patience took her seat ran her fingers over a few octaves and if Moses in Egypt was not perfectly executed Moses in Hardscrabble was The dulcet sound ceased Miss said Cash the moment that he could express himself so entranced was he by the music Miss Doolittle what was the instrument Mo Mercer showed me in your gallery once it went by a crank and had rollers in it It was now the time for Miss Patience to blush so away went the blood from confusion to her cheeks She hesitated stammered and said if mister Cash must know it was a a a Yankee washing machine The name grated on Mo Mercer s ears as if rusty nails had been thrust into them the heretofore invulnerable Mercer s knees trembled the sweat started to his brow as he heard the taunting whispers of visiting the Capitol twice and seeing pianos as plenty as woodchucks The fashionable vices of envy and maliciousness were that moment sown in the village of Hardscrabble and Mo Mercer the great the confident the happy and self possessed surprising as it may seem was the first victim sacrificed to their influence Time wore on and pianos became common and Mo Mercer less popular and he finally disappeared altogether on the evening of the day on which a Yankee peddler of notions sold to the highest bidder six patent warranted and improved Mo Mercer pianos WHAR DEM SINFUL APPLES GROW BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON Ol Adam he live in de Gyardin uv Eden Way down yonner He didn know writin an he didn

culture refinement and social manners can only be found in the Old World but if it be true what an extraordinary anomaly it is that women old and young ugly and handsome can travel alone from one end of this great country to the other receiving only such attention as is acceptable Having journeyed up and down the land to the extent of twenty thousand miles I am persuaded that a woman can go anywhere and do anything provided she conducts herself properly Of course it would be absurd to deny that it is not infinitely more agreeable to be accompanied by the tyrant called man but when there is no tyrant to come to lovely woman s rescue it is astonishing how well lovely woman can rescue herself if she exerts the brain and muscle given her thousands of years ago and not entirely annihilated by long disuse I have been nowhere that I have not been treated with greater consideration than if I had belonged to the other sex There is not a country in Europe of which this can be said and if a nation s civilization is gauged as the wise declare by its treatment of women then America rough as it may be badly dressed as it is tobacco chewing as it often is stands head shoulders and heart above all the rest of the world The Frenchwoman was right in declaring America to be le paradis des dames and those women who exalt European gallantry above American honesty are as blind to their own interests as an owl at high noon There is no royal railroad to lecturing At best it is hard work but lecture committees do their possible as the Italians say to lessen the weight and that possible is heartily appreciated by such of us as inwardly long for a natural bridge between stations and hotels A woman is never so forlorn as when getting out of a car or entering a strange hotel However there never was a rule without its exception and though courtesy has marked the majority of lecture committees for its own a lecturer may occasionally find himself stranded upon a desert of indifference and languish for the comforts of a home not twenty miles distant Thus it happened that once upon arriving at my destination when the shades of evening were falling fast and glancing about for the customary smiling gentlemen who smooth out the rough places by carrying bags superintending the transportation of luggage and driving you to your abiding place in the best carriage of the period I found no gentlemen smiling or otherwise to deliver me from my own ignorance Carriage ma am screamed a Jehu in top boots ornamented with a grotesque tracery of mud Well yes I would take a carriage so up I clambered and sat down upon what in the darkness I supposed was a seat but what gave such palpable evidences of animation in howls and attempts at assault and battery as to prove its right to be called a boy An sure the lady didn t mane to hurt ye Jimmy expostulated something that turned out to be the boy s mother whereupon a baby and a small sister of the small boy sent forth their voices in unison with that of their extinguished brother Driver let me get out I said pathetically Certainly ma am but where will you go to There ain t no other carriage left True and I remained and when I was asked where I wanted to stop I really did not know Was there a hotel Yes Was there more than one hotel No I breathed more freely and said I would go to the hotel The driver evidently entertained a poor opinion of my mental capacity for he mumbled to himself that people who didn t know where they was agoin had nuff sight better stay at home and deposited me at the hotel with a caution against pickpockets This was sufficiently humiliating yet were there lower depths Entering the parlor I found it monopolized by a young lady in green silk and red ribbons and a pink young man with his hair parted in the middle and his shirt bosom resplendent with brilliants of the last water They were at the piano singing Days of Absence in a manner calculated to depress the most buoyant spirits I rang the bell and the green young lady and pink young man began on the second verse No answer Again I rang the bell and the songsters began on the third verse No answer Once more I rang the bell and the green young lady and pink young man piped upon the touching lay of No one to love Little cared those two souls with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one for the third heart and soul victim of misplaced confidence Ring I rang that bell until I ached to be a man for one brief moment Does a man ever endure such torture No He puts on his hat walks into the hotel office gives somebody a piece of his mind and demands the satisfaction of a gentleman But a woman can go to no office She must remain up stairs and cultivate patience on hunger and thirst and a general mortification of the senses Victory or destruction to the bell I said at last and pulled the rope with the desperation of a maniac Did you ring asked a mild clerk entering on the tips of his toes as if there were not enough of him to warrant so extravagant an expenditure as the use of his whole sole Did I ring I who had been doing nothing else for half an hour I who had but forty five minutes in which to eat my supper and dress for the lecture Presenting my card I desired the mild clerk to show me to my room The mild clerk was exceedingly sorry but the committee had left no order and there was not a vacant room in the house What am I to do I asked in agony of spirit I must have a room Must is an overpowering word Only say must with all the emphasis of which it is capable and longings are likely to be realized Well the mild clerk didn t know but as how he might turn out and let me have his room Blessed man Had I been pope he should have been canonized on the spot Following him up several steep flights of stairs lighted by a kerosene lamp that perfumed the air as only kerosene can I was at last ushered into a room where sat a young girl knitting She seemed to be no more astonished at my appearance than were the chairs and table merely remarking when we were left alone That s my father I suppose you won t have any objections to my staying here as long as I please How could I an interloper say no to the rightful proprietor of that room I smiled feebly and the damsel pursued her knitting with her fingers and me with her eyes until everything in the room seemed to turn into eyes The frightful thought came o er me that perhaps my companion was our own correspondent for the Daily Slasher a thought that sent my supper down the wrong way deprived me of appetite and made me thankful that my back hair did not come off The damsel sat and sat knitted and knitted until she had superintended every preparation and then like an Arab silently stole away What next Why the committee called for me at the appointed hour seemed blandly ignorant of the fact that they had not done their whole duty to woman and maintained that walking was much better than driving The wind blew dust sought shelter within the recesses of eyes and ears and nose but patient Griselda could not have behaved better than I In fact a woman who lectures must endure quietly what a singer or actress would stoutly protest against for the reason that lecturing brings down upon her the taunt of being strong minded and any assertion of rights or exhibition of temper is sure to be misconstrued into violent hatred of men and an insane desire to be President of the United States This can hardly be called logic but it is truth Logic is an unknown quantity in the ordinary public estimation of women lecturers Inwardly cross and outwardly cold I delivered my lecture and went back to that much populated room thinking that at least I should obtain a few hours sleep before starting off at five o clock in the morning a nice hour to sing about but a horrible one at which to get up I approached the bed Shade of that virtue which is next to godliness the linen was was yes it was second hand and calmly reposing on a pillow of doubtful color my startled vision beheld an ugly creepin blastit wonner Detested shunn d by saunt an sinner That I should come to this I sought for a bell Alas there was none Should I scream No that might bring out the fire engines Should I go in search of the housekeeper How to find her at that hour of the night No rather than wander about a strange house in a strange place I would sit up Of course there was a rocking chair in that I took refuge and there I sat with a quaint old fashioned clock for company with such stout lungs as to render sleep an impossibility No fairy godmother came in at the key hole to transform my chair into a couch and that talkative clock into a handmaiden No ghosts beguiled the weary hours Eleven twelve one two three four As the clock struck this last hour a porter pounded on the door and not long after I was being driven through the cold dark morning to a railroad station My Jehu was he of the previous day and a very nice fellow he turned out to be I didn t know it was you yesterday you see miss or I wouldn t have said nothing about pickpockets You don t look like a lecturer you see and that s what s the matter Indeed and how ought a lecturer to look Well I don t exactly know but I always supposed they didn t look like you Reckon you don t enjoy staying around here in the dark so I ll just wait here till the train comes and there that good creature remained until the belated train snatched me up and whisked off to the city When the express agent passed through the car to take the baggage checks it was as good as a play to see the different ways in which people woke up Some turned over and wouldn t wake up at all others sat bolt upright and blinked some were very cross and wondered why they could not be let alone others again rubbed their eyes scratched their heads said All right and would have gone to sleep again had not the agent shaken them into consciousness Where do you go asked the agent of a quiet old gentleman sitting before me who had previously given up his checks Yes exactly that s my name replied the old gentleman Where do you go again asked the agent in a somewhat louder tone Exactly I told you so And the old gentleman put a pocket handkerchief over his face as a preliminary to sleep Well I never exclaimed the agent who returned to the charge I asked you where you wanted to go Precisely that s my name Confound your name muttered the agent You re either deaf or insane and I guess you re deaf So putting his mouth to the old gentleman s ear he shouted Where do you want to go O really the House was the mild answer to a question that so startled everybody else as to cause one man to jump up and cry Fire very much to the gratification of his fellow passengers There is nothing more pleasing to human beings than to see somebody else make himself ridiculous and the amusement extracted from the contemplation of that car load of men and women almost compensated me for the previous experience I have since traveled in the far West but have never looked upon the counterpart of that New England hotel ROLLO LEARNING TO PLAY BY ROBERT J BURDETTE Early in the afternoon of the same day mister Holliday came home bearing a large package in his arms Not only seldom but rarely did anything come into the Holliday homestead that did not afford the head of the family a text for sermonic instruction if not indeed rational discourse Depositing the package upon a hall table he called to his son in a mandatory manner Rollo come to me Rollo approached but started with reluctant steps He became reminiscently aware as he hastily reviewed the events of the day that in carrying out one or two measures for the good of the house he had laid himself open to an investigation by a strictly partisan committee and the possibility of such an inquiry with its subsequent report grieved him However he hoped for the worst so that in any event he would not be disagreeably disappointed and came running to his father calling Yes sir in his cheeriest tones This is the correct form in which to meet any possible adversity which is not yet in sight Because if it should not meet you you are happy anyhow and if it should meet you you have been happy before the collision See Now Rollo said his father you are too large and strong to be spending your leisure time playing baby games with your little brother Thanny It is time for you to begin to be athletic What is athletic asked Rollo Well replied his father who was an alumnus pronounced ahloomnoose himself in a general way it means to wear a pair of pantaloons either eighteen inches too short or six inches too long for you and stand around and yell while other men do your playing for you The reputation for being an athlete may also be acquired by wearing a golf suit to church or carrying a tennis racket to your meals However as I was about to say I do not wish you to work all the time like a woman or even a small part of the time like a hired man I wish you to adopt for your recreation games of sport and pastime Rollo interrupted his father to say that indeed he preferred games of that description to games of toil and labor but as he concluded little Thanny who was sitting on the porch step with his book suddenly read aloud in a staccato measure I be lieve you my boy re plied the man heart i ly Read to yourself Thanny said his father kindly and do not speak your syllables in that jerky manner Thanny subsided into silence after making two or three strange gurgling noises in his throat which Rollo after several efforts succeeded in imitating quite well Being older than Thanny Rollo of course could not invent so many new noises every day as his little brother But he could take Thanny s noises they being unprotected by copyright and not only reproduce them but even improve upon them This shows the advantage of the higher education A little learning is a dangerous thing It is well for every boy to learn that dynamite is an explosive of great power after which it is still better for him to learn of how great power Then he will not hit a cartridge with a hammer in order to find out and when he dines in good society he can still lift his pie gracefully in his hand and will not be compelled to harpoon it with an iron hook at the end of his fore arm Rollo s father looked at the two boys attentively as they swallowed their noises and then said Now Rollo there is no sense in learning to play a man s game with a toy outfit Here are the implements of a game which is called base ball and which I am going to teach you to play So saying he opened the package and handed Rollo a bat a wagon tongue terror that would knock the leather off a planet and Rollo s eyes danced as he balanced it and pronounced it a la la It is a bat his father said sternly a base ball bat Is that a base ball bat exclaimed Rollo innocently Yes my son replied his father and here is a protector for the hand Rollo took the large leather pillow and said That s an infielder It is a mitt his father said and here is the ball As Rollo took the ball in his hands he danced with glee That s a peach he cried It is a base ball his father said that is what you play base ball with Is it exclaimed Rollo inquiringly Now said mister Holliday as they went into the back yard followed by Thanny I will go to bat first and I will let you pitch so that I may teach you how I will stand here at the end of the barn then when you miss my bat with the ball as you may sometimes do for you do not yet know how to pitch accurately the barn will prevent the ball from going too far That s the back stop said Rollo Do not try to be funny my son replied his father in this great republic only a President of the United States is permitted to coin phrases which nobody can understand Now observe me when you are at bat you stand in this manner And mister Holliday assumed the attitude of a timid man who has just stepped on the tail of a strange and irascible dog and is holding his legs so that the animal if he can pull his tail out can escape without biting either of them He then held the bat up before his face as though he was carrying a banner Now Rollo you must pitch the ball directly toward the end of my bat Do not pitch too hard at first or you will tire yourself out before we begin Rollo held the ball in his hands and gazed at it thoughtfully for a moment he turned and looked at the kitchen windows as though he had half a mind to break one of them then wheeling suddenly he sent the ball whizzing through the air like a bullet It passed so close to mister Holliday s face that he dropped the bat and his grammar in his nervousness and shouted Whata you throw nat That s no way to pitch a ball Pitch it as though you were playing a gentleman s game not as though you were trying to kill a cat Now pitch it right here right at this place on my bat And pitch more gently the first thing you know you ll sprain your wrist and have to go to bed Now try again This time Rollo kneaded the ball gently as though he suspected it had been pulled before it was ripe He made an offer as though he would throw it to Thanny Thanny made a rush back to an imaginary first and Rollo turning quickly fired the ball in the general direction of mister Holliday It passed about ten feet to his right but none the less he made what Thanny called a swipe at it that turned him around three times before he could steady himself It then hit the end of the barn with a resounding crash that made Cotton Mather the horse snort with terror in his lonely stall Thanny called out in nasal sing song tone Strike one Thanny said his father severely do not let me hear a repetition of such language from you If you wish to join our game you may do so if you will play in a gentlemanly manner But I will not permit the use of slang about this house Now Rollo that was better much better But you must aim more accurately and pitch less violently You will never learn anything until you acquire it unless you pay attention while giving your mind to it Now play ball as we say This time Rollo stooped and rubbed the ball in the dirt until his father sharply reprimanded him saying You untidy boy that ball will not be fit to play with Then Rollo looked about him over the surrounding country as though admiring the pleasant view and with the same startling abruptness as before faced his father and shot the ball in so swiftly that Thanny said he could see it smoke It passed about six feet to the left of the batsman but mister Holliday judging that it was coming dead for him dodged and the ball struck his high silk hat with a boom like a drum carrying it on to the back stop in its wild career Take your base shouted Thanny but suddenly checked himself remembering the new rules on the subject of his umpiring Rollo exclaimed his father why do you not follow my instructions more carefully That was a little better but still the ball was badly aimed You must not stare around all over creation when you are playing ball How can you throw straight when you look at everything in the world except at the bat you are trying to hit You must aim right at the bat try to hit it that s what the pitcher does And Thanny let me say to you and for the last time that I will not permit the slang of the slums to be used about this house Now Rollo try again and be more careful and more deliberate Father said Rollo did you ever play base ball when you were a young man Did I play base ball repeated his father did I play ball Well say I belonged to the Sacred Nine out in old Peoria and I was a holy terror on third now I tell you One day But just at this point in the history it occurred to Rollo to send the ball over the plate mister Holliday saw it coming he shut both eyes and dodged for his life but the ball hit his bat and went spinning straight up in the air Thanny shouted Foul ran under it reached up took it out of the atmosphere and cried Out Thanny said his father sternly another word and you shall go straight to bed If you do not improve in your habit of language I will send you to the reform school Now Rollo he continued kindly that was a great deal better very much better I hit that ball with almost no difficulty You are learning But you will learn more rapidly if you do not expend so much unnecessary strength in throwing the ball Once more now and gently I do not wish you to injure your arm Rollo leaned forward and tossed the ball toward his father very gently indeed much as his sister Mary would have done only of course in a more direct line mister Holliday s eyes lit up with their old fire as he saw the on coming sphere He swept his bat around his head in a fierce semi circle caught the ball fair on the end of it and sent it over Rollo s head crashing into the kitchen window amid a jingle of glass and a crash of crockery wild shrieks from the invisible maid servant and delighted howls from Rollo and Thanny of Good boy You own the town All the way round mister Holliday was a man whose nervous organism was so sensitive that he could not endure the lightest shock of excitement The confusion and general uproar distracted him Thanny he shouted go into the house Go into the house and go right to bed Thanny said Rollo in a low tone you re suspended that s what you get for jollying the umpire Rollo said his father I will not have you quarreling with Thanny I can correct him without your interference And besides you have wrought enough mischief for one day Just see what you have done with your careless throwing You have broken the window and I do not know how many things on the kitchen table You careless inattentive boy I would do right if I should make you pay for all this damage out of your own pocket money And I would if you had any I may do so nevertheless And there is Jane bathing her eye at the pump You have probably put it out by your wild pitching If she dies I will make you wash the dishes until she returns I thought all boys could throw straight naturally without any training You discourage me Now come here and take this bat and I will show you how to pitch a ball without breaking all the glass in the township And see if you can learn to bat any better than you can pitch Rollo took the bat poised himself lightly and kept up a gentle oscillation of the stick while he waited Hold it still yelled his father whose nerves were sorely shaken How can I pitch a ball to you when you keep flourishing that club like an anarchist in procession Hold it still I tell you Rollo dropped the bat to an easy slant over his shoulder and looked attentively at his father The ball came in Rollo caught it right on the nose of the bat and sent it whizzing directly at the pitcher mister Holliday held his hands straight out before him and spread his fingers I ve got her he shouted And then the ball hit his hands scattered them and passed on against his chest with a jolt that shook his system to its foundations A melancholy howl rent the air as he doubled up and tried to rub his chest and knead all his fingers on both hands at the same time Rollo he gasped you go to bed too Go to bed and stay there six weeks And when you get up put on one of your sister s dresses and play golf You ll never learn to play ball if you practice a thousand years I never saw such a boy You have probably broken my lung And I do not suppose I shall ever use my hands again You can t play tiddle de winks Oh dear oh dear Rollo sadly laid away the bat and the ball and went to bed where he and Thanny sparred with pillows until tea time when they were bailed out of prison by their mother mister Holliday had recovered his good humor His fingers were multifariously bandaged and he smelled of arnica like a drug store But he was reminiscent and animated He talked of the old times and the old days and of Peoria and Hinman s as was his wont oft as he felt boyish And town ball he said good old town ball There was no limit to the number on a side The ring was anywhere from three hundred feet to a mile in circumference according to whether we played on a vacant Pingree lot or out on the open prairie We tossed up a bat wet or dry for first choice and then chose the whole school on the sides The bat was a board about the general shape of a Roman galley oar and not quite so wide as a barn door The ball was of solid India rubber a little fellow could hit it a hundred yards and a big boy with a hickory club could send it clear over the bluffs or

ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON One day the children s mother told them that she was going to spend a few days at a plantation some miles away taking with her Aunt Nancy who was anxious to pay a little visit to a daughter living in that neighborhood Aunt Phrony she told them had promised to come and look after them during her absence Oh please mamma they begged let Aunt Phrony take us nutting She told us one day that she knew where there were just lots and lots of walnuts So it was arranged that they should take a luncheon with them and make a day of it Aunt Phrony being perfectly willing for her Indian blood showed itself not only in her appearance but in her love for a free out of door life and her fondness for tramping She would readily give up a day s work at any time to discharge some wholly insignificant errand which involved a walk of many miles The day was a bright and beautiful one in October warm yet with a faint nip of last night s frost lingering in the air They made a fine little procession through the woods Aunt Phrony leading followed by children a darky with baskets her grandson Wi yum and lastly the dogs frisking and frolicking and darting away every now and then in pursuit of small game A very weary and hungry little party gathered about the baskets at one o clock and three little pairs of white hands were stained almost as brown as those of Aunt Phrony and William But everybody was happy and there was a nice pile of walnuts to go back in the large bag which William had brought for the purpose The dogs sat around and looked longingly on a squirrel frisked hastily across a log near by the birds chattered in the trees high above and looked curiously down on the intruders and presently a foolish hare went scurrying across the path so near the dogs that they sat still amazed at his presumption and forbore to chase him Hi there goes ol Hyar shouted Ned I m going to see if I can t catch him But he soon gave up the hopeless chase Was that your ol

husband dared deny Twould life and labor simplify One gardener the ten decreed Was all the neighborhood would need To plant and trim and rake and weed The money saved they could invest As vagrant fancy might suggest And each could then be better dressed So well this worked that on the whole It seemed to them extremely droll To pay so much for handling coal One man all work then undertook And former methods they forsook Deciding even on one cook One dining room was next in line Where free from care they all could dine At less expense as you ll divine Two maids they said could quickly flit From home to home so why permit Expense that brings no benefit Economy of cash and care Became a hobby of the fair Until their husbands sought a share Although the latter said all goes For luxuries and costly clothes The method still advantage shows While we ve not gained we apprehend Good Fortune will on us attend If we continue to the end If you ve succeeded why should we From constant toil be never free One income should sufficient be And taking turns in earning that We ll have the leisure to wax fat And spend much time in idle chat So let us see the matter through And in this line it must be true One house for all will surely do And if one house means less of strife To gain the comforts of this life Why further progress means one wife Ten women now their acts attest Prefer ten homes and deem it best To let cooeperation rest Footnote two Lippincott s Magazine A COMMITTEE FROM KELLY S BY J V Z BELDEN Katherine give it up dear The man looked down into the earnest eyes of the girl as she sat in the shadow of a palm in the conservatory at the Morrison s Strains of music from the ball room fell on unheeding ears and she sighed as she looked up at him I can not turn back now Everett she said Ever since that day I spent down on the east side I have looked at life from a different standpoint A message came to me then and I must listen For a year I have been preparing myself to take my part in this work To morrow I take possession of what is called a model flat and I hope to teach those poor little children something besides the three R s To tell them how to take a little sunshine into their dismal homes She looked like some fair saint with her face illumined with love of humanity Might I venture to suggest that there is plenty of room for sunshine in an old house up the Avenue said the man wistfully The girl looked up quickly Don t Everett give me six months to see what I can do then I will answer the question you asked me last night Oh my dear my dear he said you do not know how I hate to have you go down there My sympathy with the great unwashed is not deep enough for me to be willing to have you mingle with them Then to be quite honest I have found them rather a happy lot Listen Everett said the girl Come down to me a month from to night and I will show you that I am right and you are wrong A whole month the man protested Yes a whole month The sun was shining into the front windows of a room on the first floor of a high tenement down on the east side A snow white bed stood far enough from the wall to allow it to be made up with perfect ease In front of it stood a screen covered with pretty chintz white muslin curtains hung at the windows everything was spotless from the kalsomined ceiling to the oiled floors where a few bright colored rugs made walking possible As Katherine Anderson explained to some scoffing friends who came down to take luncheon with her Everything is clean and in its proper place and the object lesson is invaluable to these poor children If you go into their homes you will find that the bed is a bundle of rags in some dark closet while the front room is kept for company Here I show them how easily this sunny room is made into a sitting room by putting that screen in front of the bed and then there is a healthful place to sleep You may think that I am over enthusiastic but I enjoy my classes and I assure you they are all day long for besides the usual schoolroom work we have cooking classes physical culture nature classes and little talks about all sorts of things I have one girl who I know is going to be a great novelist she has such an imagination said Katherine Her big sister always has a duplicate of anything of mine the child happens to admire and the other day she came rushing in with the tale that burglars had broken into their house the night before and stolen twenty bottles of ketchup and some preserts Had they asked the guest What peculiar taste in burglary No laughed Katherine she has no big sister and their house is one back room four flights up Four weeks had passed since the Morrison dinner and Katherine was tired Then too she was not altogether sure that her mission was a success Was she wishing for the fleshpots of upper Fifth Avenue or was it just physical weariness that would pass with the night She had sent off a note in the morning MY DEAR EVERETT The work of the model flat is still in existence and it is almost a month a whole month On Saturday afternoon I am expecting some of the mothers to come and tell me what they think of the work we are doing for their children They will probably be gone by five o clock and if you care to come down at that time I might be induced to go out to dinner with you Don t bother about a chaperon As I feel now I could chaperon a chorus girl myself Cordially KATHERINE Whether the meeting at missus Kelly s had been called together by engraved cards by postals or simply by shrieking from one window to another I do not know but there was evidently some excitement some deep feeling which needed expression among the little crowd of women in the fourth floor back I tell ye shouted missus Kelly to make herself heard above the din of many voices I tell ye we must organize an Tim Kelly himself says it Only last Satady night an him swearin wid hunger an me faintin wid the big wash I had up the Avenoo what did we come home to but hull wheat bred an ags olla Beckymell There stood my Katy wid her han s on her hips a sayin as teacher said them things was nourishiner than b iled cabbage Well Tim was that mad he broke every plate on the table an then went and drank hisself stiff in Casey s saloon And what do ye think cried missus McGinniss as missus Kelly stopped for breath the other night when me an some frinds was comin in for a quiet avenin we found my Ellen Addy had hauled the bed into the front room an she an the young ones was all asleep an up to the winders was my best petticut cut in two When I waked her up she whined Teacher says it ain t healthy to sleep in back Did ye ever hear the like of that an every blessed one of them kids born there Now wha d ye think o that murmured the crowd missus Kelly caught her breath and began again I ve axed ye to come here because teacher sent word that she d like the mothers to come of a Satady and tell her how they liked what she was doin for the young ones Tim says as they sends a committee from men s meetings and I think if missus McGinniss missus McGraw and me was to riprisint this gatherin we could tell her how we all feels It was Saturday afternoon and the model flat was in perfect order while the little servant called friend by Miss Anderson waited in her spotless apron to answer the bell Another object lesson for the mothers who were expected The bell rang and three women walked soberly into the little hall I am so glad to see you missus Kelly and you missus McGinniss She hesitated at the third name Tis missus McGraw said missus Kelly Bring the tea Louisa said Miss Anderson and then I want to show you how pleasant my home is here missus Kelly gave a sniff Hum yessum it s sunny but I ve seen your home up town and it s beyond the likes of me to see why you re down here at all at all Yes said missus McGinniss an I ve come to say that you d better stay up there an stop teachin my childer about their insides I m tired of hearin I can t eat this an I can t eat that cause teacher says there ain t no food walue An there s missus Polinski down the street says she ll have no more foolishness missus Kelly had caught her breath again Her Rebecca come home only yestidy an cut all the stitches in Ikey s clo es an him sewed up for the winter Just then a woman with a shawl over her head came in without knocking With a nod to the three women she faced the teacher Now I d like to know one thing she said you sent my Josie home this morning to wash the patchouly offen her hair now I want to know just one thing does she come here to be smelt or to be learnt There s another thing too said missus Kelly I want that physical torture business stopped The young ones are tearin all their clo es off an it s got to be stopped Katherine looked a little dazed and her voice trembled a bit as she said Wouldn t you like to look at the flat No Miss we wouldn t said missus Kelly You re a nice young woman and you don t mean no harm but it s the sinse av the committee that you re buttin in Good day to ye And they filed slowly out Katherine with cheeks aflame turned toward the door There was a twinkle in Landon s eyes as he said Are you quite ready for dinner dear There was a little break in her voice and she gave him both her hands Quite ready for for anything Everett QUIT YO WORRYIN BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON Nigger

spoke in accents low For life with perils is beset And friends oft quickly go But she was right he d gone in debt To back a burlesque show Footnote three Lippincott s Magazine ESPECIALLY MEN BY GEORGE RANDOLPH CHESTER The tantalizing stream on the other side of the hedge seemed to the hot and tired young man to lead the way straight into the heart of Paradise itself Six weary miles of white highway wavering with heat and misty with hovering dust clouds still lay between himself and the railroad that would whisk him away to the city Behind him conquered at fatiguing cost were six more miles stretching back to the village where not even a team could be hired on Sunday Rather than spend the day in that dismal abode of Puritanism he had fled on foot his business done and this little creek mocking alluring irresistible was the only cheerful thing on which his eyes had rested in that whole stifling journey Even this had a drawback He glanced up again with a puzzled frown at the queer sign glaring down at him from the hedge It was the third one of the sort in the past quarter of a mile TRESPASSERS Are warned from these premises under penalty of the law ESPECIALLY MEN He turned away impatiently Dust dust dust He could feel it pasty on his tongue gritty on his lips grimy on his face It had stiffened his hair clogged his nostrils sifted through his clothing settled into his shoes It was everywhere and all pervading The forbidden creek in the very refinement of derision suddenly bubbled into a bar of clinking song a perfect ecstasy of crystal notes then as suddenly died down babbling and gurgling and flowed smoothly on whispering and murmuring to itself of the delights to come in the heart of the cool woods Just here with a swift sweep between mossy curved banks the stream turned its back to him and hurried away among the trees with a coy invitation that was well nigh maddening He remembered just such a creek as that where as a boy he had used to go with his companions after school How delightful those boyish swims had been In fancy he could still feel the chill shock as he had plunged in the sharp catching of his breath the resounding splash the shower of icy drops the soft yielding of the water then the delicious buoyancy that had pervaded his limbs He wondered with a whimsical smile how long he could stay under and if he could hold his eyes open while he dived and if he could still swim dog fashion and back handed on his back and if he could float and tread water and turtle How cool and shady and restful it looked in there Just before the creek turned behind a clump of dogwood a patch of sunlight lay on it shooting down through the misty twilight of broad oak trees and the surface of the water dimpled and glinted and laughed and flirted at him before it slipped away into leaf dimmed sylvan solitudes in a way that was not to be longer resisted He gave one more glance of distaste at the white hot road and gave up the struggle Here goes the especial man he said looking up at the sign in smiling defiance and forced his way through the hedge What a coquettish little stream that was It leaped merrily down tiny boulder strewn inclines to show him how light hearted and care free it could be it flowed sedately between narrow banks of turf to display its perfect propriety it coyly hid behind walls of graceful slender willows it danced impudently into the open and dashed across clear spaces in frantic haste to escape him it spread out clear and limpid upon little bars of golden sand pretending frankly to reveal its pure inmost depths then raced on again ever beckoning ever enticing ever cajoling until at last it plunged straight at a wall of dense tangled underbrush and with a vixenish gurgle of delight at its own blandishing duplicity vanished underneath the low sweeping mass of leaves without even so much as a good by The pursuer was not to be daunted Doggedly he fought his way around and through the swampy underbrush and presently stood blinking his delighted eyes in a little natural clearing that was a glorious climax to all the tantalizing coquetry of the creek Encircled by drooping long leaved willows that were themselves enringed by stately trees lay a broad deep pool clear as crystal one side carpeted with velvety turf and screened with leafy draperies and the whole canopied by the smiling blue sky With a cry of pleasure the young man hastily threw off his clothing and as he undressed a school boy taunt whimsically recurred to him Last one in s a nigger he shouted to the squirrel that he caught peering at him from the far side of a limb and plunged into the pool One by one he gleefully tried all the old boyish tricks until at last tiring of them he lay floating peacefully on his back looking up at the sky and covering the entire visible surface of it with air castles as young men will There was no dusty road no broiling hot sun no six miles of weary distance yet to cover There was a rustle and a patter among the trees Two dogs came bounding to the edge of the water and barked at the bather in friendly fashion They were bouncing big saint Bernards but scarcely more than puppies and they capered and danced in awkward delight when he splashed water at them As a further evidence of their friendly feeling they suddenly pounced upon his clothing Hey there cried the bather and scrambled out to rescue his apparel It was kind of him the dogs thought to take so much interest in the game and not to be outdone in heartiness they scampered off through the woods taking the clothes with them All they left behind was his hat his shoes and one sock his collar and cuffs and tie He threw sticks and stones after them and had started to chase them when a new and dreadful sound smote on his ear It was the voices of women There was but one safe hiding place the pool With rare presence of mind he concealed the pathetic remnant of his belongings and plunged just in time diving under a clump of low hanging willows where a friendly root gave support to his arms and breast Two elderly ladies of severe and forbidding aspect came slowly within his range of vision One was tall and thin and the other was short and thin while both wore plain skimp black gowns and had their hair parted in the center and smoothed down flatly over their ears They were silent with some vexed and weighty problem as they drew near but as they came just opposite to him the taller of the two suddenly burst out with Men men men Nothing but men morning noon and night Please explain Sister Ann Where did Adnah during my brief absence get her sudden curiosity about the despicable sex It was the recent visit of Doctor Laura Phelps Sister Sarah meekly replied the smaller woman She lost a magazine while here and Adnah found it The publication contained several love stories so called an illustrated article on Young Captains of Industry and another on Handsome Young Men of the Stage I burned the pernicious thing as soon as it came into my hands but alas the damage had been done Damage indeed Sister Ann snapped the other Since the age of five poor Sister Jane s orphan has never been permitted to see a man Big country girls have even been hired to do our farm work And this this is the end of fourteen years of self sacrificing care The young man in the pool cautiously ducked his head under the water A mosquito had settled back of his ear and was driving him mad Dreadful moaned Sister Ann Adnah goes about sighing all the day and looks over long in the mirror and takes unseemly pains with her dressing and does up her hair with flowers and has feverishly pink cheeks and likes to sit in a corner and brood and takes long walks by herself and especially especially seems fond of moonlight A snake slid down off the bushes into the water near the young man and he wanted out but he stayed Moonlight sniffed Sarah Moonlight There is no language to express the disdain with which she spoke this word of philandering and frivolity Moonlight is very pretty ventured the other I rather like it myself At your time of life retorted Sister Sarah You are too sentimental Sister Ann as well as too careless Thank Heaven they were going The young man waited until their voices died in the distance then crept cautiously to the bank He had to find those dogs and in a hurry He had just seated himself to put on his shoes for the search when he again heard the voices of women and once more plunged into the pool like a monster yellow frog as he reflected he must seem to the squirrel in the tree But Aunt Matilda how do you know he heard as he came up under the willows This new voice sweet and limpid belonged to a girl of such striking appearance that the young man was on the point of forgetting his dilemma until that infernal mosquito settled down back of his ear again My dear Adnah said a jerky little voice in answer your aunts remember were all young once and considered great beauties in their day There was a world of gentle pride in Aunt Matilda s voice as she said this and it sounded so well that she said it over again Great beauties in their day In consequence they all had their experiences with men and know that there is not one to be trusted Not one my child not one Believe your aunts It seems impossible aunty declared the soft voice of Adnah Why in that magazine were the pictures of some of the most noble looking creatures Tut tut child those are the very worst kind hastily interrupted Aunt Matilda The more handsome they are the more dangerous Since you remain so incredulous however I suppose I shall have to tell you what we know about them The young man in the pool felt his circulation stopping The two women were calmly sitting down on the bank to talk confidences and from what he knew of the sex they were as likely as not to sit there until doomsday compelling him to appear before the angel Gabriel without even a shroud He was conscious of the beginning of a cramp in his left leg and his shoulders were becoming icy He had to be motionless too and that was another hardship The least movement might betray him for the women sat quite near and Adnah was facing him Thanks to the thickness of his leafy hiding place she could not see him but he could see her quite plainly and she was well worth looking at She too wore a plain skimp black dress and her brown hair was parted in the center and smoothed down over her ears but there the resemblance to Aunt Matilda and the others ended for her hair was wavy in spite of the severely straight brushing and it glinted gold where little flecks of sunlight filtered through the branches of the tall trees to caress it In the hair too was a single red rose caught into place with a natural grace that it seemed a pity to waste on three spinster aunts and two dogs and the same note of color was repeated in another rebellious blossom at the throat The young face was plump and oval and the cheeks were pink the brown eyes were wide and sparkling and Oh well the young man in the pool stopped cataloguing her attractions and simply summed her up as a stunningly pretty girl Then he tried once more to get rid of that maddening mosquito and wished to high Heaven that they would go When our dear mother died we four girls were all quite young began Aunt Matilda pausing primly to smooth down her skirts and the young man in the watery prison gave up in despair She was starting out like the old fashioned story books which never arrived any place and never knew how to get back if they did Your Aunt Sarah was eighteen years old your Aunt Ann and myself sixteen and your poor deluded mother fourteen Our father child married again within the year and so you see our acquaintance with the duplicity of men began at a very early age Of course we refused to live with a stepmother or to allow her to occupy our own dear mother s house Left then upon our own responsibilities at so tender a period of our lives it behooved us to conduct ourselves with the strictest of propriety and I am most happy to say that we came triumphantly through the ordeal Naturally we being great beauties in those days my child great beauties many gay young men fluttered about us and some of them really made quite favorable impressions upon us There was one in particular Aunt Matilda paused for a sigh and fixed her eyes in sad reminiscence upon a little clump of ferns that full of conceit were waving incessant salutes at their dainty reflections in the water Hang the story of her life muttered the miserable youth in the pool His teeth were beginning to chatter Do go on aunty cried the eager Adnah Well child they were all alike Having insinuated their way into our confidences by agreeable manners and by their really indisputable attractiveness having aroused the beginnings of tender emotions what did these young men do one and all Why instead of waiting until the acquaintance had ripened into mutual undying affection and then falling gracefully to their knees with honorable proposals of marriage they one and all chose what seemed to be favorable moments and strove by cajolery or stealth or even force to kiss us To kiss us Gracious exclaimed Adnah There was a moment s silence The young man in the pool could feel the goose flesh pimpling between his shoulder blades After all though it might not have been so very dreadful finally commented Adnah after a thoughtful sigh Adnah cried the horrified Aunt Matilda I am astounded I can t help it aunty said Adnah I can t make it seem so terrible no matter how hard I try In fact it it seems to me that it would have been well rather nice Adnah But aunty didn t it ever seem that way to you sometimes Aunt Matilda was shocked and silent for a moment then over her pale cheeks crept a pink flush I ll not deny she presently confessed in a hesitant voice that if we had not had each other to rely upon for firmness we might perhaps have been deluded by some of these young scapegraces They were truly quite appealing at times There was one in particular Again Aunt Matilda became lost in meditation The young man in the pool swore softly even though he perceived the tear that trembled upon the lady s eyelash It was impossible to be sympathetic while a leech was fastened to his ankle My mother must have thought the way I do I am sure persisted Adnah The remark brought Aunt Matilda out of the past with a jerk Your poor mother had the most pitiful experience of all child she replied She married Shortly after you were born she died fortunately spared all knowledge of your father s faithless fickleness Adnah he too married again You Adnah was too young to protect yourself from a stepmother but we came to your rescue Your great uncle Peter had just died and left us this fine estate and here we are trying to shield you from the wiles of the destroyer man Some men must be nice or so many many girls would not want them commented Adnah still unconvinced I ll not deny dear that some of them seem quite nice admitted the other with a sigh There was one in particular The dogs interrupted at this moment with a racing struggle for some red and brown object Now what has Castor got cried Adnah jumping up to give chase in a healthy and delightful burst of speed The youth in the pool dismally realized that Castor had his missing sock a brown lisle affair with a quaint red pattern in it at a dollar a pair His teeth were pounding together like castanets now so loudly that he feared Aunt Matilda must surely hear them Adnah presently returned flushed rosy red by the exercise and more charming than ever I couldn t catch them she panted Gracious but I am warm There is plenty of time for a plunge before dinner Just wait Aunt Mattie until I run for the bathing suits and she flashed away again Great Caesar s ghost The hidden youth grew so warm with apprehension that the goose flesh disappeared and the chattering of his teeth stopped His dilemma was unspeakable and unsolvable seemingly but suddenly it was solved for him The dogs came back The sock had been shredded and they sought fresh diversion After a cordially barked invitation for the young man to come out and play they went in after him There was a tremendous splashing struggle Suddenly the willows were pulled down by a muscular bare arm and the face of a young man appeared above it to the astounded gaze of Aunt Matilda Excuse me madam he began lunging viciously at Castor and Pollux with his feet Please call off your dogs Aunt Matilda pale but determined whipped an antiquated monster of a pistol from her pocket though she held it far off from her and to one side with no intention past present or future of ever firing it It got its effectiveness from size alone and was built for pure moral suasion if ever a pistol was Hold perfectly still or I shall shoot she quaveringly warned him You are a male trespasser sir I sincerely regret it madam replied the culprit slapping viciously at the mosquito behind his ear He got it that time You probably will freezingly retorted Aunt Matilda I shall telephone for the sheriff immediately and if you are still here when he arrives you shall receive the full penalty of the law The young man did some quick thinking It was necessary Madam your dogs have stolen my clothing and my money and I can not leave until I get them back he presently declared with lucky inspiration If you have me arrested for trespass I shall bring suit for the recovery of property Aunt Matilda was sufficiently perplexed to lower her pistol and allow him to explain while she coaxed the dogs out of the water He was a splendid talker and had fine honest looking blue eyes There was a rush of swift footsteps among the trees Hide she commanded in sudden panic He promptly hid and when Adnah arrived with the bathing suits that young lady found her aunt calmly seated on the ground holding Castor and Pollux each by a dripping collar Leave my suit and return to the house at once with these dogs directed Aunt Matilda without turning her head Why Aunt Mattie what s the matter Nothing snapped Aunt Matilda in desperation Go back to the house and stay until I come Ask no questions Adnah searched the scene in mystification for a moment Yes aunty she suddenly said and walked away in a flutter of excitement She had caught the gleam of a bright eye peering at her from among the willows She burst into a spontaneous rhapsody of song as she went trilling and warbling in sweet untaught cadences unconsciously like a bird singing to its mate in the springtime She had a wonderful voice The young man was sorry when she was out of hearing but glad too for the water was beginning to pucker his cuticle in hard ridges like a wash board Now young man said Aunt Matilda I shall leave this bathing suit here for your use I shall expect you to put it on and retire from the premises as quickly as possible I must remain until nightfall was the firm reply I must find my money and clothes I should feel ridiculous to be seen in such clothing as that You yourself would scarcely care to have me seen emerging from your premises on Sunday especially in such outlandish garments That last argument told Aunt Matilda visibly weakened Very well then she grudgingly agreed but at dusk Mercy young man how your teeth do chatter Are you getting a chill I ll bring you a bowl of boneset tea and some dinner right away and she hurried off in much concern The young man lost no time in getting into that bathing suit for the chill of the water was upon him The suit consisted merely of a pair of blue bloomers that came just below his knees and a blue blouse that split down the back and at the armpits the moment he buttoned it in front still he was very grateful for it grateful for the warm glow that began to pervade him the moment he had donned it He put on his one sock and his shoes his hat collar tie and cuffs to keep the dogs from getting them and was quite comfortable when Aunt Matilda came bustling back with a bowl of steaming tea and a tray loaded with good things to eat She sat by admiring his appetite until he had finished then she made him drink the boneset tea to the last drop He talked admirably all through the dinner and it was with a sigh of almost regret that she started away with the empty dishes She came back presently You will find our summer cottage up in that direction she pointed out We shall expect you to to keep out of range during the day but to report at the kitchen door at dusk when you will be escorted to the road I shall follow your instructions to the letter he assured her and she again slowly walked away To save her the man hater could not think of another reasonable excuse for prolonging the interview He was a most gentlemanly young man and he had splendid eyes The male trespasser spent the next hour in hunting clothes and anathematizing dogs His finds were confined strictly to rags and pairless arms and sleeves and finally he gave up with everything accounted for but worthless Discovering a high grassy plot near the creek screened from the woods by a thick copse of hazel bushes he lay down to think matters over and promptly fell asleep Perhaps half an hour later he slowly opened his eyes with the feeling that he was being compelled to awaken and found Adnah seated quietly beside him keeping the mosquitoes away from him with a gracefully waved hazel branch Just sleep right on she gently urged I often sleep for hours on hot afternoons in this very place How did you come here he demanded sitting up startled I hunted you she confessed with a delighted little laugh I m so glad you re awake at last and don t want to sleep any more I felt just sure that your eyes were blue And they are Her delight at this fact was so obvious that he felt uneasy You see I listened outside the window while Aunt Mattie told Aunts Ann and Sarah all about you she confidingly went on Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ann were for telephoning for the sheriff anyhow but Aunt Mattie wouldn t let them She likes you So do I Oh said the astonished young man For the first time in his life conversation had failed him Of course said the girl simply Well I waited until they all lay down for their after dinner naps and climbed out of my window so as not to disturb them They do enjoy their naps so much you know I didn t find you at the pool but I just hunted until I did find you I ve been sitting here a long time watching you You look so nice when you are asleep Now what should he say With any ordinary girl he could have found the answer but this one had him floored But you look ever so much nicer when you are awake she further informed him with a clear eyed straightforwardness that was worse than disconcerting In desperation he answered with her own frankness that she was nice looking herself He meant it too I m so glad you think so she contentedly sighed I just knew we should like each other as soon as I saw you lying there asleep It was he who blushed not the girl She partly raised up to recapture her hazel branch and when she sat down again her shoulder remained lightly touching his arm An electric thrill ran through him and tingled out at his fingertips but he never moved a muscle She looked up at him in peaceful happiness and he somehow felt very mean and unworthy Her eyes made him uncomfortable The whole trouble was that she was so honest had never been taught to conceal her thoughts by the thousand and one spoken and unspoken lies of ordinary social intercourse She was neither timid nor bold but merely natural with never a suspicion that conventionality demanded a man and a maid to leave a mutual liking unconfessed It was rather rough on the young man He was not used to having the truth fly around in such reckless fashion in his conversations with girls and it bothered him I m not a bit afraid of you she presently told him I knew all the time that Aunt Mattie was wrong She told me that all men were dreadful and that the first thing they did was to to kiss a girl they liked She knows nothing about it he replied rather crossly For some unaccountable reason he was angry with himself and with her Indeed she doesn t she agreed eying him thoughtfully Presently she added I do not believe though that I should have minded it so much if she had been right Shade of Plato He looked down at the tempting curve of her red lips They were round and full and soft as the petals of a half blown rosebud warm and tender and sweet with just the least trace of puckering to indicate how they could meet the pressure of other lips He felt his heart come pounding up into the region of his Adam s apple and he trembled as he had not done since his first attack of puppy love at the age of fourteen His breath came and went with a painful flutter but he made no movement If it had been any sort of a girl under the sun especially if so attractive as this one she would have been kissed until she gasped for breath but he just couldn t do it However if she went so far as to ask him to kiss her by George he didn t see how he was to get out of it I should really like to kiss you he admitted with a martyr like sigh and a further echo of her own frankness but I shan t Under the circumstances it would not be right He reflected grinning that mother would be proud if she could see him now then he thought grinning harder of the boys at the club If they only knew There didn t I say so she triumphantly exclaimed I told Aunt Matilda that there certainly must be some good men in the world Good He winced as certain memories of his careless youth began to do cake walks up and down his conscience Then he changed the subject She snuggled up closely to him by and by confidingly and unsuspicious and just talked and talked and talked It was very pleasant to have her there at his side babbling innocently away in that sweet musical voice How pretty she was how artless and trusting how honest and how heart whole It came to him that his family and friends had for a long time been telling him that he ought to get married and he began to see that they were right How delightful it would be to stay on forever in this enchanted grove with her He presently found himself fervently saying it though he had not intended such words to pass his lips She took the wish as a matter of course She had confidently expected him to feel that way about it and if he felt that way to say so Adnah Eggleson They jumped like juvenile jam thieves caught red handed Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ann and Aunt Matilda rigidly confronted them having stolen upon them unseen unheard unthought of and they stood now in grim horror merciless and implacable They advanced in a swooping body after one moment of agonizing suspense and snatched Adnah into their midst glaring three kinds of loathing scorn upon the interloping serpent Has this person kissed you or attempted to do so hissed Aunt Sarah Not yet meekly answered poor Adnah I assure you ladies began the serpent but Aunt Sarah cut him short Silence sir she commanded We wish no explanations from you whatsoever Thus crushing him the little company wheeled and marched away bearing Adnah an unwilling and impenitent captive two of them ingeniously keeping behind her so that she should have no opportunity of even exchanging a backward glance with the serpent Left to himself the serpent moodily kicked holes in the turf He had an intense desire to do something violent to smash something no matter what He was furious with the trio of aunts It was a shame he told himself to bury alive a beautiful and noble young woman like that through a warped and mistaken notion of the world What right had they to condemn a sweet and affectionate creature such as she to a starved and morbid spinsterhood It was his duty to rescue her from the colorless fate that hung over her and he would do his duty He was unconsciously flexing his biceps as he said it Would he How Should he get out a search warrant or a writ of replevin This whimsical view of the case only exasperated him the more as it presented the utter hopelessness of approaching her of ever seeing her again and when the dogs came chasing an utterly inconsequential and useless butterfly in his direction he pelted them with stones until they yelped Hang the dogs anyhow It was all their fault Next he blamed himself If he had only resisted that creek like a man he wouldn t have been a hundred miles from home without clothes or money and silly about a girl he had never seen until that day Then he blamed the girl Why why was she such a confiding and altogether artless and bewitching little fool She wasn t He remembered her eyes and abjectly apologized to the memory of her She was everything that was sweet and pure and womanly everything that was desirable in every sense well bred well schooled unspoiled of the world without guile or subterfuge beautiful healthy honest That had been the only startling thing about her just honesty It spoke ill for himself and the world in which he lived that this should have seemed startling What a wonderful creature she was By the Eternal she belonged to him and he meant to have her She loved him too He sat down on the bank to think over this phase of the question He had known her several years in the minute and a half since noon and it was time this foolishness came to an end Time flies when youth listens to the fancied strains of Mendelssohn s Spring Song He was surprised presently to note a strange hush settling down over the woods A chill vapor seemed to arise from the water There was a melancholy note in the tweet of the low flitting birds The rustling trees softened their murmur to a continuous whisper soothing and caressing The tinkle of the creek became more metallic and pronounced Near by down the stream a sudden chorus of frogs burst into croaking their isolated notes blended by the chirping undertone of the crickets and tree toads There were other sounds mysterious untraceable but all musical in greater or lesser degree He understood at last These sounds the rustling leaves the flitting birds the tinkling creek the frogs tree toads and crickets and those other intangible cadences these were the instruments of nature s vast orchestra playing their lullaby languorous and sweet for the drowsy day It was dusk and he was desperately in love with Adnah and he had on a fool bloomer bath suit and no money and he had to go back into civilization just as he was Woe woe woe and anathema At the house he found a table set under a big oak tree back of the kitchen Supper for one was illumined by the rays of a solitary lantern Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ann each with a pistol in her lap sat grimly to one side Adnah nor Aunt Matilda were anywhere to be seen and he divined with a thrill that Aunt Matilda was acting as jailer to the young woman until he should be safely off the premises Evidently she had been hard to manage Bless the little girl He took off his hat as he approached and bowed respectfully I should like you to know who I am he began You will please to eat your supper without conversation Aunt Sarah sternly interrupted I wish to pay my addresses to your niece he protested but the two ladies finding rudeness necessary clasped their hands to their ears Kindly eat said Aunt Sarah without removing her hands He sat down and glared at the food in despair He thought he heard Adnah s voice and the sounds of a scuffle in the house and it gave him inspiration He arose and leaning his hands on the edge of the table shouted as loudly as he could I am John Melton of Philadelphia I will give you as many references as you like I wish your permission to write to your niece and later on to call upon her May I do so Are you going to eat your supper inquired Aunt Sarah He gave up He could not as a gentleman take Aunt Sarah s hands from her ears and make her listen to what he had to say He turned sadly away from the table The armed escort also arose Please lead the way requested Aunt Sarah The path leads directly from the front of the cottage to the road He had stalked in dismal silence almost half way down the winding avenue of trees moodily watching the gigantic shadows of his limbs leaping jerkily among the shrubbery when it occurred to him that the women could scarcely carry the lantern and pistols and still hold their ears I am John Melton of Philadelphia he shouted and looked back to address them more directly Alas the pistols reposed in the pockets of the two prim aprons the lantern smoked askew at Aunt Sarah s waist and both women were holding their hands to their ears He could not know that they had been whispering about him however and really for man haters their remarks had been very complimentary Not even that ridiculous costume could hide his athletic figure his good carriage and pleasant address They were nearing the road when they heard a woman s voice shrieking for them to wait and presently Aunt Matilda came running after them breathless and excited You must come back to the house at once all of you she panted Adnah is wildly hysterical She insists that she must have this young man monster or no monster that she will die without him I truly believe that she would Nonsense exclaimed Aunt Sarah Come on then It was Aunt Sarah who swiftly and anxiously led the way At the door of the parlor she paused and confronted the young man Remember she warned that however impulsive our poor misguided niece may appear you must not kiss her Without waiting for reply she opened the door for him Adnah smiling happily through the last of her tears sprang to meet him and seizing his hand drew him down on the couch beside her I m going to keep you here always now she declared with pretty authority as she locked her arm in his and interlaced their fingers He looked around at the aunts and suddenly longed for his own clothes They had drawn their chairs in a close semi circle about the couch and were helplessly staring He felt the hot blood burning in his cheeks on his temples down the back of his neck You will stay won t you Adnah anxiously asked him I think I shall take you with me instead he replied smiling down at her in an attempt to conquer his embarrassment Adnah rapturously sighed The spectators suddenly arose retiring to the far corner of the room where they held an excited whispered consultation Presently they came back and sat down in the same solemn half circle Aunt Sarah ceremoniously cleared her throat You will please to unclasp your hands and sit farther apart she directed This obeyed she proceeded Now mister Nelson Melton if you please corrected the young man producing a business card that he had rescued Oh exclaimed the aunts exchanging wondering glances We understood that it was Nelson murmured Aunt Matilda It seemed that the hands had not been so tightly clasped over the ears as he had thought Aunt Sarah gravely adjusted her glasses John Melton junior she read Representing Melton and Melton Administrators and Real Estate Dealers General John A Melton John Melton junior There was a suppressed flutter of excitement and again the three aunts exchanged surprised glances I think I may safely say may I not Sisters Ann and Matilda that this quite alters the case was Aunt Sarah s strange query Quite so indeed agreed Aunt Matilda complacently smoothing her apron Very much so added Aunt Ann Decidedly resumed Aunt Sarah Your father young man handled the estate of our deceased Uncle Peter in a most upright and satisfactory fashion for a man So far much is in your favor since our unfortunate niece will not be contented without some sort of a husband Your personal qualifications have yet to be proved however We presume that you can offer documentary evidence as to your own worth sir Not for a day or so unfortunately confessed the young man The dogs destroyed all my papers The only thing I could find was a portion of a brief note from my mother The three aunts as by one electric impulse bent forward with shining eyes From your mother hungrily repeated Aunt Sarah Let us see it if you will please He produced it reluctantly It was not exactly the sort of letter a young man cares to parade My beloved son Aunt Sarah read aloud pausing to bestow a softened glance upon him I can not wait for your return to say how proud I am of you Your noble and generous action in regard to the aged widow Crane s property has just come to my ears through a laughing complaint of your father about your unbusinesslike methods in dealing with those who have been unfortunate In spite of his whimsically expressed disapproval he feels that you are an honor to him Your sister Nellie cried in her pride and love of you when she heard The rest of the letter had been lost but this was enough Adnah had gradually hitched closer to him and now her hand unreproved stole affectionately to his shoulder Aunt Matilda was wiping her eyes Aunt Ann openly sniffled Aunt Sarah cleared her throat most violently Your references are all that we could wish young man she presently admitted in a businesslike tone We shall waive in your favor our objections to men in general If we must have one in the family we are to be congratulated upon having one whose mother is proud of him Coming from Aunt Sarah this was a marvelous concession The young man bowed his head in pleased acknowledgment and by and by crossed his legs in comfort as a home like feeling began to settle down upon him Suddenly observing their bloomered exposure however he tried to poke his legs under the couch and twiddled his thumbs instead And when do our young people expect to be married meek Sister Ann presently ventured to inquire As quickly as possible promptly answered the young man smiling triumphantly down at the girl by his side He was astonished and rather pleased too to find her suddenly embarrassed and blushing prettily I believe then announced Aunt Sarah after due deliberation that you may now kiss our niece may he not Sisters Ann and Matilda He may eagerly assented the others Very well then proceed commanded Aunt Sarah folding her arms The young man hastily braced himself to meet this new shock then gazed down at the girl again She was still blushing in her newly found self conscious femininity but she trustingly held up her pretty lips to him looking full into his eyes with the steady flame of her love burning unveiled and he kissed her Ah h h h sighed the three man hating spinsters in ecstatic unison A LETTER FROM A SELF MADE MERCHANT TO HIS SON BY GEORGE HORACE LORIMER From John Graham at the London House of Graham company to his son Pierrepont at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago mister Pierrepont is worried over rumors that the old man is a bear on lard and that the longs are about to make him climb a tree LONDON October twenty seven one hundred eighty nine Dear Pierrepont Yours of the twenty first inst to hand and I note the inclosed clippings You needn t pay any special attention to this newspaper talk about the Comstock crowd having caught me short a big line of November lard I never sell goods without knowing where I can find them when I want them and if these fellows try to put their forefeet in the trough or start any shoving and crowding they re going to find me forgetting my table manners too For when it comes to funny business I m something of a humorist myself And while I m too old to run I m young enough to stand and fight First and last a good many men have gone gunning for me but they ve always planned the obsequies before they caught the deceased I reckon there hasn t been a time in twenty years when there wasn t a nice Gates Ajar piece all made up and ready for me in some office near the Board of Trade But the first essential of a quiet funeral is a willing corpse And I m still sitting up and taking nourishment There are two things you never want to pay any attention to abuse and flattery The first can t harm you and the second can t help you Some men are like yellow dogs when you re coming toward them they ll jump up and try to lick your hands and when you re walking away from them they ll sneak up behind and snap at your heels Last year when I was bulling the market the longs all said that I was a kindhearted old philanthropist who was laying awake nights scheming to get the farmers a top price for their hogs and the shorts allowed that I was an infamous old robber who was stealing the pork out of the workingman s pot As long as you can t please both sides in this world there s nothing like pleasing your own side There are mighty few people who can see any side to a thing except their own side I remember once I had a vacant lot out on the Avenue and a lady came in to my office and in a soothing sirupy way asked if I would lend it to her as she wanted to build a creche on it I hesitated a little because I had never heard of a creche before and someways it sounded sort of foreign and frisky though the woman looked like a good safe reliable old heifer But she explained that a creche was a baby farm where old maids went to wash and feed and stick pins in other people s children while their mothers were off at work Of course there was nothing in that to get our pastor or the police after me so I told her to go ahead She went off happy but about a week later she dropped in again looking sort of dissatisfied to find out if I wouldn t build the creche itself It seemed like a worthy object so I sent some carpenters over to knock together a long frame pavilion She was mighty grateful you bet and I didn t see her again for a fortnight Then she called by to say that so long as I was in the business and they didn t cost me anything special would I mind giving her a few cows She had a surprised and grieved expression on her face as she talked and the way she put it made me feel that I ought to be ashamed of myself for not having thought of the live stock myself So I threw in a half dozen cows to provide the refreshments I thought that was pretty good measure but the carpenters hadn t more than finished with the pavilion before the woman telephoned a sharp message to ask why I hadn t had it painted I was too busy that morning to quarrel so I sent word that I would fix it up and when I was driving by there next day the painters were hard at work on it There was a sixty foot frontage of that shed on the Avenue and I saw right off that it was just a natural signboard So I called over the boss painter and between us we cooked up a nice little ad that ran something like this Graham s Extract It Makes the Weak Strong Well sir when she saw the ad next morning that old hen just scratched gravel Went all around town saying that I had given a five hundred dollar shed to charity and painted a thousand dollar ad on it Allowed I ought to send my check for that amount to the creche fund Kept at it till I began to think there might be something in it after all and sent her the money Then I found a fellow who wanted to build in that neighborhood sold him the lot cheap and got out of the creche industry I ve put a good deal more than work into my business and I ve drawn a good deal more than money out of it but the only thing I ve ever put into it which didn t draw dividends in fun or dollars was worry That is a branch of the trade which you want to leave to our competitors I ve always found worrying a blamed sight more uncertain than horse racing it s harder to pick a winner at it You go home worrying because you re afraid that your fool new clerk forgot to lock the safe after you and during the night the lard refinery burns down you spend a year fretting because you think Bill Jones is going to cut you out with your best girl and then you spend ten worrying because he didn t you worry over Charlie at college because he s a little wild and he writes you that he s been elected president of the Y M C A and you worry over William because he s so pious that you re afraid he s going to throw up everything and go to China as a missionary and he draws on you for a hundred you worry because you re afraid your business is going to smash and your health busts up instead Worrying is the one game in which if you guess right you don t get any satisfaction out of your smartness A busy man has no time to bother with it He can always find plenty of old women in skirts or trousers to spend their days worrying over their own troubles and to sit up nights waking his Speaking of handing over your worries to others naturally calls to mind the Widow Williams and her son Bud who was a playmate of mine when I was a boy Bud was the youngest of the Widow s troubles and she was a woman whose troubles seldom came singly Had fourteen altogether and four pair of em were twins Used to turn em loose in the morning when she let out her cows and pigs to browse along the street and then she d shed all worry over them for the rest of the day Allowed that if they got hurt the neighbors would bring them home and that if they got hungry they d come home And someways the whole drove always showed up safe and dirty about meal time I ve no doubt she thought a lot of Bud but when a woman has fourteen it sort of unsettles her mind so that she can t focus her affections or play any favorites And so when Bud s clothes were found at the swimming hole one day and no Bud inside them she didn t take on up to the expectations of the neighbors who had brought the news and who were standing around waiting for her to go off into something special in the way of high strikes She allowed that they were Bud s clothes all right but she wanted to know where the remains were Hinted that there d be no funeral or such like expensive goings on until some one produced the deceased Take her by and large she was a pretty cool calm cucumber But if she showed a little too much Christian resignation the rest of the town was mightily stirred up over Bud s death and every one just quit work to tell each other what a noble little fellow he was and how his mother hadn t deserved to have such a bright little sunbeam in her home and to drag the river between talks But they couldn t get a rise Through all the worry and excitement the Widow was the only one who didn t show any special interest except to ask for results But finally at the end of a week when they d strained the whole river through their drags and hadn t anything to show for it but a collection of tin cans and dead catfish she threw a shawl over her head and went down the street to the cabin of Louisiana Clytemnestra an old yellow woman who would go into a trance for four bits and find a fortune for you for a dollar I reckon she d have called herself a clairvoyant nowadays but then she was just a voodoo woman Well the Widow said she reckoned that boys ought to be let out as well as in for half price and so she laid down two bits allowing that she wanted a few minutes private conversation with her Bud Clytie said she d do her best but that spirits were mighty snifty and high toned even when they d only been poor white trash on earth and it might make them mad to be called away from their high jinks if they were taking a little recreation or from their high priced New York customers if they were working to tend to cut rate business Still she d have a try and she did But after having convulsions for half an hour she gave it up Reckoned that Bud was up to some cussedness off somewhere and that he wouldn t answer for any two bits The Widow was badly disappointed but she allowed that that was just like Bud He d always been a boy that never could be found when any one wanted him So she went off saying that she d had her money s worth in seeing Clytie throw those fancy fits But next day she came again and paid down four bits and Clytie reckoned that that ought to fetch Bud sure Someways though she didn t have any luck and finally the Widow suggested that she call up Bud s father Buck Williams had been dead a matter of ten years and the old man responded promptly Where s Bud asked the Widow Hadn t laid eyes on him Didn t know he d come across Had he joined the church before he started No Then he d have to look downstairs for him Clytie told the Widow to call again and they d get him sure So she came back next day and laid down a dollar That fetched old Buck Williams ghost On the jump you bet but he said he hadn t laid eyes on Bud yet They hauled the Sweet By and By with a drag net but they couldn t get a rap from him Clytie trotted out George Washington and Napoleon and Billy Patterson and Ben Franklin and Captain Kidd just to show that there was no deception but they couldn t get a whisper even from Bud I reckon Clytie had been stringing the old lady along intending to produce Bud s spook as a sort of red fire calcium light grand march of the Amazons climax but she didn t get a chance For right there the old lady got up with a mighty set expression around her lips and marched out muttering that it was just as she had thought all along Bud wasn t there And when the neighbors dropped in that afternoon to plan out a memorial service for her lost lamb she chased them off the lot with a broom Said that they had looked in the river for him and that she had looked beyond the river for him and that they would just stand pat now and wait for him to make the next move Allowed that if she could once get her hands in that lost lamb s wool there might be an opening for a funeral when she got through with him but there wouldn t be till then Altogether it looked as if there was a heap of trouble coming to Bud if he had made any mistake and was still alive The Widow found her lost lamb hiding behind a rain barrel when she opened up the house next morning and there was a mighty touching and affecting scene In fact the Widow must have touched him at least a hundred times and every time he was affected to tears for she was using a bed slat which is a powerfully strong moral agent for making a boy see the error of his ways And it was a month after that before Bud could go down Main Street without some man who had called him a noble little fellow or a bright manly little chap while he was drowned reaching out and fetching him a clip on the ear for having come back and put the laugh on him No one except the Widow ever really got at the straight of Bud s conduct but it appeared that he left home to get a few Indians scalps and that he came back for a little bacon and corn pone I simply mention the Widow in passing as an example of the fact that the time to do your worrying is when a thing is all over and that the way to do it is to leave it to the neighbors I sail for home to morrow Your

BY MAY McHENRY Melinda was dejected She told herself that she was groping in the vale of despair that life was a vast gray echoing void She decided that ambition was dead a case of starvation that friendship had slipped through too eagerly grasping fingers that love ah love You d better take a dose of blue mass her aunt suggested when she had sighed seven times dolefully at the tea table Not blue mass Any other kind of mass you please but not blue Melinda shuddered absently No she was not physically ill the trouble was deeper soul sickness acute threatening to become chronic that defied allopathic doses of favorite and other philosophers that would not yield even to hourly repetition of the formula handed down from her grandmother If you can not have what you want try to want what you have Yet she could lay her finger on no bleeding heart wound on no definite cause It was true that the deeply analytical painstakingly interesting historical novel on which she had worked all winter had been sent back from the publishers with a briefly polite note of thanks and regrets but as she had never expected anything else that could not depress her Also the slump in G C Copper stock had forced her to give up her long planned southern trip and even to forego the consolatory purchase of a spring gown but she had a mind that could soar above flesh pot disappointments Then the Reverend John Graham but what John Graham did or said was nothing absolutely nothing to her So Melinda clenched her hands and moaned in the same key with the east wind and told the four walls of her room that she could not endure it she must do something Then it was that in a flash of inspiration it came to her she would write a humorous story The artistic fitness of the idea pleased her She had always understood that humorists were marked by a deep dyed melancholy that the height of unhappiness was a vantage ground from which to view the joke of existence She would test the dictum now if ever she would write humorously The material was at hand seething and crowding in her mind in fact the monumental dullness and complacent narrowness of the villagers the egoism the conceit the bland shepherd of his flock pomposity of John Graham What more could a humorist desire Yes she would write Thoughts came quick and fast words flowed in a fiery stream like lava that glows and rushes and curls and leaps down the mountain sweeping all obstacles aside The figure did not wholly please Melinda for everybody knows how dull and gray and uninteresting lava is when it cools but she had no time to bother with another She felt the exultation the joy and uplifting of spirit that is the reward usually alas the sole reward of the writer in the work of creation Then before the lava had time to cool she sent the story to the first magazine on her list with a name beginning with A It was her custom to send them that way though sometimes with a desire to be impartial she commenced at Z and went up the list At the end of two weeks the wind had ceased blowing from the east Melinda decided that though life for her must be gray echoing void yet would she make an effort for the joy of others She would lift herself above the depression that enfolded her even as the buoyant hyacinths were cleaving their dark husks and lifting up the beauty and fragrance of their hearts to solace passers by Therefore she ceased parting her hair in the middle and ordered a simple little frock from D s hyacinth blue voile with a lining that should whisper and rustle like the glad winds whisking away last year s leaves Then the day came when she strolled carelessly and unexpectantly down the village street to the post office and there received a letter that bore on the upper left hand corner of the envelope the name of the magazine first on her list beginning with A A chill passed along Melinda s spine That humorous story Could this mean It was too horrible to contemplate She took a short cut through the orchard and as she walked she tore off a corner and peeped into the envelope Yes there was a pale blue slip of paper with serrated edges She leaned against a Baldwin apple tree to think How true it is that one should be prepared for the unexpected Melinda had sent out many manuscripts freighted with tingling hopes and eager aspirations and with the postage stamps that insured their prompt return how was she to know by what process of reasoning could she infer that this that had been offered simply from force of habit would be retained in exchange for an aesthetically tinted check She anathematized the magazine editor That seems the proper thing to do with editors She wanted to know what business he had to keep that story after having led her to believe that it was his unbreakable custom to send them back It was deception she told the swelling Baldwin buds base deep dyed subtle deception After baiting her on with his little pink printed rejection slips he suddenly sprung a wicked trap It was some time before Melinda grew calm enough to read the editorial letter It ran Dear Madam We are glad to have your tender and delicately sympathetic picture of village life There is a note of true sentiment and a generous appreciation of homely virtue marking this story for which we desire to add an especial word of praise Check enclosed Very truly yours The Editor of A Melinda sank limply on the bleached last year s grass at the foot of the tree Tender and delicately sympathetic picture Generous appreciation She laughed feebly The editor was pleased to be facetious Having a fine sense of humor himself he showed his realization of the story by acknowledging it in the same vein of subtle satire She reread the letter and unfolded the slip of paper with serrated edges with changing emotions After all it was not such a very bad story She permitted herself to recall how humorous it was how cleverly and keenly it laid bare the ridiculous the unexpected how it scintillated with wit and abounded in droll and subtle distinctions and descriptions all all at the expense of her nearest relatives and her dearest friends Melinda thought she would return the check and demand that her story be sent back to her or destroyed but reflecting that Punch s advice is applicable to other things than matrimony and suicide she didn t She resolutely put her literary Frankenstein behind her She reasoned that in all probability the story would not be published during the lifetime of any of the originals of the characters that even if the worst came to the worst Mossdale was likely to remain in ignorance that would be blissful The villagers were not wont to waste time on the printed word in fact such was the profundity of their unenlightenment few of them had heard of the magazine with a name beginning with A Even John Graham paid little attention to the secular periodicals besides if absolutely necessary John s attention might be diverted So Melinda went away on a visit Her health demanded it The doctor was unable to name her malady but she herself diagnosed it as magazinitis Toward fall Melinda entirely recovered returned to Mossdale Entirely recovered yet she turned cold unseeing eyes on the newsboy when he passed through the car with his towering load of varicolored periodicals and rather than be forced to the final resort of the unaccompanied traveler she welcomed the advent of an acquaintance possessed of volubility of an ejaculatory eruptive variety After many gentle jets and spurts of gossip much remained to be told as the lady hastily gathered up her impedimenta preparatory to alighting at her home station How like me in the joy of seeing you to forget What a sweet clever story And to think of you having something published in A I never was more surprised than when mister Ferguson brought home the magazine Those delicious Mossdale people I could not endure that the dear things should not see and know at once The lovely hamlet is so so remote and I knew you were traveling What a pleasure to send them half a dozen copies that very evening Yes porter that too Do run down to see me soon dear Now do Good by Melinda summoned the newsboy and bought the latest number of the magazine with a name beginning with A She turned to the list of Contents with feverish anxiety then the book slid from her nerveless fingers Her humorous story had been given to an eager public She leaned back and gazed out at the flying telegraph poles and fields Even the worthiest the gravest the finest she reflected has a face that if seen in a certain light will flash out the ignus fatuus of the ridiculous but it is not usually considered the office of friendship to turn on the betraying light Oh well her relatives would forgive in time Relatives have to forgive It was unfortunate that John Graham was not a relative One thing I know now how much missus Ferguson cares because I got those six votes ahead of her for the Thursday Club presidency Half a dozen copies Melinda said aloud as she caught sight of the spire of the Mossdale Church Her Uncle Joe met her at the station and kissed her for the first time since she had put on long dresses Notwithstanding a foolish prejudice against tobacco juice Melinda received the salute in a meek and contrite spirit Notice how many citizens were hanging around underfoot on the depot platform so as you kinder had to stop and shake hands to get em out o the way Uncle Joe queried as he turned the colts heads toward home Melinda had noticed I suppose they came out to see the train come in she suggested Nope not exactly Uncle Joe explained Looking out for automo biles and flying airships have made trains of cars seem mighty common up this way Nope the folks was out on account of you a comin Me Having a guilty conscience Melinda glanced backward apprehensively and made a motion as though to dodge a missile Yep and you ll find a lot of the relations at the house a waitin for you Why what Now look here Uncle Joe there is no occasion to be foolish about a little Foolish Now mebby some would call it foolish but us folks up the creek here we can t help feelin set up some over findin out we have a second Milton or a missus Stowe in the fambly Melinda looked at her relative s concave profile in sick suspicion Was the trail of the serpent over them all But no Uncle Joe was beaming mildly with the satisfaction of having shown that although the literary hemisphere was the unknown land he had heard of a mountain and a minor elevation or two he was as she had always believed incapable of satire For once Melinda was speechless But Uncle Joe was likely to be fluent when he got started He cleared his throat and turned mild suffused half shamed blue eyes on his shrinking niece Yes your piece has come out in the paper Melinda and your folks are all fired pleased with you I told Lucy this morning I wisht your poor Pap could come back to earth for just this one day Ah h Melinda took a firm grip on the side of the buggy But I guess you ll have to write another right off There is some jealousy amongst them that aren t in it Uncle Joe went on I told em you couldn t put the whole connection in or it would read like a list of them present at a surprise party Your Aunt Lucy she s just as tickled as a hen with three chickens The old man chuckled There it is all down in black and white just like it happened only different about her spasm of economy when she was cleanin away Mary Emmeline s medicine bottles and couldn t bear to throw away what was left over but up and took it all herself in one powerful mixed dose to save it and had to have the doctor with a stomach pump to cure her of spasms what wasn t so economical after all It s her picture tickles her most Oh said Melinda Yes you know the picture is as slim as a girl in her first pair o cossets a standin on a chair a reachin bottles off a top shelf and your Aunt Lucy s that hefty she hain t stood on a chair for ten years for fear twould break down and she s had to trust the top shelf to the hired girl I guess when she goes to Heaven she ll want to stop on the way up and fix that top shelf to suit her So she just sits and looks at that picture and smiles and smiles She likes my whiskers too Yes she s always wanted me to wear whiskers ever since we was married but we never was a whiskery fambly and they wouldn t seem to grow thicker than your Uncle Josh s corn when he planted it one grain to the hill But there I am in the picture in the paper with real biblical whiskers reachin to the bottom o my vest Uncle Joe cleared his throat and glanced sideways at his niece again I want to tell you Melindy that I am real obleeged to you for makin me one of the main ones in the piece with a lot to say Your Aunt Lucy says twas only right and proper me bein your nighest kin and you livin with us but I told her there was so many others that was smarter and more the story paper kind that I thought it showed real good feelin on your part yes I did G up there Ginger Then I kind o thought I d warn you too Melindy that they all are just a dyin to hear you say who The Preacher is He s the only one we couldn t quite place Melinda took the little bottle of smelling salts from her bag and held it to her nose Yes Uncle Joe went on the others was easy identified because you had named the names but him you just called The Preacher all the way through Some says it s the Reverend Graham kind of toned down and trimmed up like things you see in the moonlight on a summer night But I told them the Reverend Graham is a nice enough chap but that that extra fine way up preacher fellow in the story must be some stranger you knew from off and didn t give his name because you didn t rightly know what it was I thought even if you was so soft on Reverend Graham as to see him in that illusory moony light that about the stranger from off was the right and proper thing for me being your uncle to say any way So if you want to keep it dark about The Preacher you can just talk about a stranger from off I will Uncle Joe dear Uncle Joe Melinda exclaimed gratefully as they stopped in front of the gate Melinda greeted her relatives with a warmth and enthusiasm that embarrassed and made them suspicious She was not usually so complacent so solicitous for the health and progress of offspring above all she was not usually so loth to talk about herself She acted as though she had never written a story yet three copies of it were spread open under her nose one on the piano one on the parlor table one on the sideboard all open at the passage about The Preacher The relatives retired in disgust With the departure of the last one Melinda seized a magazine and fled to the orchard She would read that story herself As she turned the leaves she caught sight of a manly form carefully climbing the fence She dropped the periodical and stood on it gazing up pensively into the well laden boughs of the Baldwin The Reverend Graham took her hands in a strong ministerial squeeze It is very good of you to come to see me so soon after my return she faltered Good Melinda Do you think I could help coming he ejaculated I can not tell you words are inadequate to express what I feel he went on the deep gratitude the humility the wonder the triumph the determination with God s aid to live up to the high ideal you have set forth in your wonderful story You have seen the latent qualities the nobler potentialities you have shown me to myself Melinda Do not think that I do not appreciate the difficulties of this hour for you I know how your heart is shrinking how your delicate maidenly modesty is up in arms But Melinda you know you know Dear Melinda I am glad you understand me John Understand you The Reverend Graham could restrain himself no longer He swept her into his arms appropriating his own Melinda remained there quiescently leaning against his shoulder because there seemed nothing else to do also because it was a broad and comfortable shoulder against which to lean I am done for she reflected Now I will never dare to confess that I was trying to be humorous Then she reached up a hand and touched the Preacher s face timidly His cheek was wet Why John John she whispered ABOU BEN BUTLER BY JOHN PAUL Abou Ben Butler may his tribe be less Awoke one night from a deep bottledness And saw by the rich radiance of the moon Which shone and shimmered like a silver spoon A stranger writing on a golden slate Exceeding store had Ben of spoons and plate And to the stranger in his tent he said Your little game The stranger turned his head And with a look made all of innocence Replied I write the name of Presidents And is mine one Not if this court doth know Itself replied the stranger Ben said Oh And Ah but spoke again Just name your price To write me up as one that may be Vice The stranger up and vanished The next night He came again and showed a

Fair insect that with thread like legs spread out And blood extracting bill and filmy wing Dost murmur as thou slowly sail saint about In pitiless ears fall many a plaintive thing And tell how little our large veins should bleed Would we but yield them to thy bitter need Unwillingly I own and what is worse Full angrily men listen to thy plaint Thou gettest many a brush and many a curse For saying thou art gaunt and starved and faint Even the old beggar while he asks for food Would kill thee hapless stranger if he could I call thee stranger for the town I ween Has not the honor of so proud a birth Thou com saint from Jersey meadows fresh and green The offspring of the gods though born on earth For Titan was thy sire and fair was she The ocean nymph that nursed thy infancy Beneath the rushes was they cradle swung And when at length thy gauzy wings grew strong Abroad to gentle airs their folds were flung Rose in the sky and bore thee soft along The south wind breathed to waft thee on thy way And danced and shone beneath the billowy bay Calm rose afar the city spires and thence Came the deep murmur of its throng of men And as its grateful odors met thy sense They seemed the perfumes of thy native fen Fair lay its crowded streets and at the sight Thy tiny song grew shriller with delight At length thy pinion fluttered in Broadway Ah there were fairy steps and white necks kissed By wanton airs and eyes whose killing ray Shone through the snowy veils like stars through mist And fresh as morn on many a cheek and chin Bloomed the bright blood through the transparent skin Sure these were sights to tempt an anchorite What do I hear thy slender voice complain Thou wailest when I talk of beauty s light As if it brought the memory of pain Thou art a wayward being well come

Famine dwell Try some plump alderman and suck the blood Enriched by generous wine and costly meat On well filled skins sleek as thy native mud Fix thy light pump and press thy freckled feet Go to the

FIRST CIGAR BY ROBERT J BURDETTE Twas just behind the woodshed One glorious summer day Far o er the hills the sinking sun Pursued his westward way And in my safe seclusion Removed from all the jar And din of earth s confusion I smoked my first cigar It was my first cigar It was the worst cigar Raw green and dank hide bound and rank It was my first cigar Ah bright the boyish fancies Wrapped in the smoke wreaths blue My eyes grew dim my head was light The woodshed round me flew Dark night closed in around me Black night without a star Grim death methought had found me And spoiled my first cigar It was my first cigar A six for five cigar No viler torch the air could scorch It was my first cigar All pallid was my beaded brow The reeling night was late My startled mother cried in fear My child what have you ate I heard my father s smothered laugh It seemed so strange and far I knew he knew I knew he knew I d smoked my first cigar It was my first cigar A give away cigar I could not die I knew not why It was my first cigar Since then I ve stood in reckless ways I ve dared what men can dare I ve mocked at danger walked with death I ve laughed at pain and care I do not dread what may befall Neath my malignant star No frowning fate again can make Me smoke my first cigar I ve smoked my first cigar My first and worst cigar Fate has no terrors for the man Who s smoked his first cigar A BULLY BOAT AND A BRAG CAPTAIN A Story of Steamboat Life on the Mississippi BY SOL SMITH Does any one remember the Caravan She was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera Her regular trips from New Orleans to Natchez were usually made in from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable 
5456_62043_000000_000003	train-clean-100	A voyage from New Orleans to Vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month s wages 
none	none	Whether the Caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the Falls Louisville I have never learned if she did she must have had a time of it 
5456_62043_000001_000000	train-clean-100	It was my fate to take passage in this boat 
none	none	The Captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag 
5456_62043_000001_000002	train-clean-100	We had been out a little more than five days and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of Natchez on the next day 
none	none	Our wood was getting low and night coming on The pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the Captain who went it strong on three kings sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord The worthy Captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck where he soon discovered by the landmarks that we were about half a mile from a woodyard which he said was situated right round yonder point But muttered the Captain I don t much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there s no other chance The boat was pushed to her utmost and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile
5456_62043_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 Hallo Colonel 
none	none	How d ye sell your wood this time A yellow faced old gentleman with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copperas colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered Why Capting we must charge you three and a quarter THIS time The d l replied the Captain captains did swear a little in those days what s the odd quarter for I should like to know You only charged me three as I went down Why Captaing drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of leer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold wood s riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop going down when you re going up you re sometimes obleeged to give me a call becaze the current s aginst you and there s no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fooel why Well well interrupted the Captain we ll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag In about half an hour we felt the Caravan commence paddling again Supper was over and I retired to my upper berth situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the Captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent 
5456_62043_000008_000001	train-clean-100	We jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate 
5456_62043_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 How does that wood burn inquired the Captain of the mate who was looking on at the game 
none	none	Tisn t of much account I reckon answered the mate it s cottonwood and most of it green at that Well Thompson Three aces again stranger I ll take that X and the small change if you please 
5456_62043_000011_000001	train-clean-100	It s your deal Thompson I say we d better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can t be more than six miles from here Two aces and a bragger with the age 
none	none	Hand over those V s 
5456_62043_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The game went on and the paddles kept moving 
5456_62043_000012_000001	train-clean-100	At eleven o clock it was reported to the Captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty 
none	none	Head her in shore then and take in six cords if it s good see to it Thompson I can t very well leave the game now it s getting right warm 
5456_62043_000013_000001	train-clean-100	This pilot s beating us all to smash 
5456_62043_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The wooding completed we paddled on again 
none	none	The Captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard three and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game From my upper berth there were no state rooms then I could observe the movements of the players All the contention appeared to be between the Captain and the pilots the latter personages took it turn and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties They were anxious to learn the game and they did learn it Once in a while indeed seeing they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bet of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the Captain or pilot or if they did venture to call out on two bullits and a bragger they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable 
5456_62043_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Still with all these disadvantages they continued playing they wanted to learn the game 
none	none	At two o clock the Captain asked the mate how we were getting on Oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising 
5456_62043_000017_000001	train-clean-100	This wood seems rather better than that we took in at Yellow Face s but we re nearly out again and must be looking out for more 
5456_62043_000017_000002	train-clean-100	I saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail 
none	none	Yes yes replied the Captain ring the bell and ask em
5456_62043_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 what s the price of wood 
none	none	up here I ve got you again here s double kings I heard the bell and the pilot s hail What s your price for wood A youthful voice on the shore answered Three and a quarter D net ejaculated the Captain who had just lost the price of two cords to the pilot the strangers suffering some at the same time three and a quarter again Are we never to get to a cheaper country
5456_62043_000021_000002	train-clean-100	 Deal sir if you please better luck next time 
none	none	The other pilot s voice was again heard on deck How much have you
5456_62043_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Only about ten cords sir was the reply of the youthful salesman 
5456_62043_000025_000000	train-clean-100	The Captain here told Thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game 
5456_62043_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The pilots here changed places 
none	none	When did they sleep Wood taken in the Caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual 
5456_62043_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Day at length dawned 
none	none	The brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation the Captain s bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning must have made at least sixty miles and would have made many more if he could have procured good wood
