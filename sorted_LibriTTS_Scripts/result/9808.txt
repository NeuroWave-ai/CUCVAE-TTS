Lord Loudwater was paying attention neither to his breakfast nor to the cat Melchisidec Absorbed in a leader in The Times newspaper now and again he tugged at his red brown beard in order to quicken his comprehension of the weighty phrases of the leader writer now and again he made noises chiefly with his nose expressive of disgust Lady Loudwater paid no attention to these noises She did not even raise her eyes to her husband s face She ate her breakfast with a thoughtful air her brow puckered by a faint frown She also paid no attention to her favourite Melchisidec Melchisidec unduly excited by the smell of grilled sole came to Lord Loudwater rose on his hind legs laid his paws on his trousers and stuck some claws into his thigh It was no more than gentle arresting pricks but the tender nobleman sprang from his chair with a short howl kicked with futile violence a portion of the empty air which Melchisidec had just vacated staggered and nearly fell Lady Loudwater did not laugh but she did cough Her husband his face a furious crimson glared at her with reddish eyes and swore violently at her and the cat Lady Loudwater rose her face flushed her lips trembling picked up Melchisidec and walked out of the room Lord Loudwater scowled at the closed door sat down and went on with his breakfast James Hutchings the butler came quietly into the room took one of the smaller dishes from the sideboard and Lady Loudwater s teapot from the table He went quietly out of the room pausing at the door to scowl at his master s back Lady Loudwater finished her breakfast in the sitting room of her suite of rooms on the first floor She was no longer inattentive to Melchisidec During her breakfast she put all consideration of her husband s behaviour out of her mind As she smoked a cigarette after breakfast she considered it for a little while She often had to consider it She came to the conclusion to which she had often come before that she owed him nothing whatever She came to the further conclusion that she detested him She had far too good a brow not to be able to see a fact clearly She wished more heartily than ever that she had never married him It had been a grievous mistake and it seemed likely to last a life time her life time The last five ancestors of her husband had lived to be eighty His father would doubtless have lived to be eighty too had he not broken his neck in the hunting field at the age of fifty four On the other hand none of the Quaintons her own family had reached the age of sixty Lord Loudwater was thirty five she was twenty two he would therefore survive her by at least seven years She would certainly be bowed down all her life under this grievous burden It was an odd calculation for a young married woman to make but Lady Loudwater came of an uncommon family which had produced more brilliant irresponsible and passably unscrupulous men than any other of the leading families in England Her father had been one of them She took after him Moreover Lord Loudwater would have induced odd reveries in any wife He had been intolerable since the second week of their honeymoon Wholly without power of self restraint the furious outbursts of his vile temper had been consistently revolting She once more told herself that something would have to be done about it not on the instant however At the moment there appeared to her to be months to do it in She dropped her cigarette end into the ash tray and with it any further consideration of the manners and disposition of Lord Loudwater She lit another cigarette and let her thoughts turn to that far more appealing subject Colonel Antony Grey They turned to him readily and wholly In less than three minutes she was seeing his face and hearing certain tones in his voice with amazing clearness Once she looked at the clock impatiently It was half past ten She would not see him till three four and a half hours It seemed a long while to her However she could go on thinking about him She did While she considered her ill tempered husband her eyes had been hard and almost shallow While she considered Colonel Grey they grew soft and deep Her lips had been set and almost thin now they grew most kissable Lord Loudwater finished his breakfast the scowl on his face fading slowly to a frown He lit a cigar and with a moody air went to his smoking room The criminal carelessness of the cat Melchisidec still rankled As he entered the room half office and half smoking room mister Herbert Manley his secretary bade him good morning Lord Loudwater returned his greeting with a scowl mister Herbert Manley had one of those faces which begin well and end badly He had a fine forehead lofty and broad a well cut gently curving nose a slack thick lipped mouth always a little open a heavy animal jaw and the chin of an eagle His fine black hair was thin on the temples His moustache was thin and straggled His black eyes were as good as his brow intelligent observant and alert It was plain that had his lips been thinner and his chin larger he would not have been the secretary of Lord Loudwater or of any one else He would have been a masterless man The success of two one act plays on the stage of the music halls had given him the firm hope of one day becoming a masterless man as a successful dramatist His post gave him the leisure to write plays But for the fact that it brought him into such frequent contact with the Lord Loudwater it would have been a really pleasant post the food was excellent the wine was good the library was passable and the servants with the exception of James Hutchings liked and respected him He had the art of making himself valued at far more than his real worth said his enemies and his air of importance continuously impressed them With a patient air he began to discuss the morning s letters and ask for instructions Lord Loudwater was as often happened uncommonly captious about the letters He had not recovered from the shock the inconsiderate Melchisidec had given his nerves The instructions he gave were somewhat muddled and when mister Manley tried to get them clearer his employer swore at him for an idiot mister Manley persisted firmly through much abuse till he did get them clear He had come to consider his employer s furies an unfortunate weakness which had to be endured by the holder of the post he found so advantageous He endured them with what stoicism he might Lord Loudwater in a bad temper always produced a strong impression of redness for a man whose colouring was merely red brown Owing to the fact that his fierce protruding blue eyes were red rimmed and somewhat bloodshot in moments of emotion they shone with a curious red glint and his florid face flushed a deeper red In these moments mister Manley had a feeling that he was dealing with a bad tempered red bull His employer made very much the same impression on other people but few of them had the impression of bullness so clear and so complete as did mister Manley Lady Loudwater on the other hand felt always whether her husband was ramping or quiet that she was dealing with a bad tempered bull Presently they came to the end of the letters Lord Loudwater lit another cigar and scowled thoughtfully mister Manley gazed at his scowling face and wondered idly whether he would ever light on another human being whom he would detest so heartily as he detested his employer He thought it indeed unlikely Still when he became a successful dramatist there might be an actor manager Then Lord Loudwater said Did you tell missus Truslove that after September her allowance would be reduced to three hundred a year Yes said mister Manley What did she say mister Manley hesitated then he said diplomatically She did not seem to like it What did she say cried Lord Loudwater in a sudden startling bellow and his eyes shone red mister Manley winced and said quickly She said it was just like you Just like me Hey And what did she mean by that cried Lord Loudwater loudly and angrily mister Manley expressed utter ignorance by looking blank and shrugging his shoulders The jade She s had six hundred a year for more than two years Did she think it would go on for ever cried his employer No said mister Manley And why didn t she think it would go on for ever Hey said Lord Loudwater in a challenging tone Because there wasn t an actual deed of settlement said mister Manley The ungrateful jade I ve a good mind to stop it altogether cried his employer mister Manley said nothing His face was blank it neither approved nor disapproved the suggestion Lord Loudwater scowled at him and said I expect she said she wished she d never had anything to do with me No said mister Manley I ll bet that s what she thinks growled Lord Loudwater mister Manley let the suggestion pass without comment His face was blank And what s she going to do about it said Lord Loudwater in a tone of challenge She s going to see you about it I m damned if she is cried Lord Loudwater hastily in a much less assured tone mister Manley permitted a faint sceptical smile to wreathe his lips What are you grinning at If you think she ll gain anything by doing that she won t said Lord Loudwater with a blustering truculence mister Manley wondered Helena Truslove was a lady of considerable force of character He suspected that if Lord Loudwater had ever been afraid of a fellow creature he must at times have been afraid of Helena Truslove He fancied that now he was not nearly as fearless as he sounded He did not say so His employer was silent buried in scowling reflection mister Manley gazed at him without any great intentness and came to the conclusion that he did not merely detest him he loathed him Presently he said There s a cheque from Hanbury and Johnson for twelve thousand and forty six pounds for the rubber shares your lordship sold It wants endorsing He handed the cheque across the table to Lord Loudwater Lord Loudwater dipped his pen in the ink transfixed a struggling bluebottle and drew it out Why the devil don t you see that the ink is fresh he roared It is fresh The bluebottle must have just fallen into it said mister Manley in an unruffled tone Lord Loudwater cursed the bluebottle restored it to the ink pot endorsed the cheque and tossed it across the table to mister Manley By the way said mister Manley with some hesitation there s another anonymous letter Why didn t you burn it I told you to burn em all snapped his employer This one is not about you It s about Hutchings said mister Manley in an explanatory tone Hutchings What about Hutchings You d better read it said mister Manley handing him the letter It seems to be from some spiteful woman The letter was indeed written in female handwriting and it accused the butler wordily enough of having received a commission from Lord Loudwater s wine merchants on a purchase of fifty dozen of champagne which he had bought from them a month before It further stated that he had received a like commission on many other such purchases Lord Loudwater read it scowling sprang up from his chair with his eyes protruding further than usual and cried The scoundrel The blackguard I ll teach him I ll gaol him He dashed at the electric bell by the fireplace set his thumb on it and kept it there Holloway the second footman came running The servants knew their master s ring They always ran to answer it after some discussion as to which of them should go He entered and said Yes m lord Send that scoundrel Hutchings to me Send him at once roared his master Yes m lord said Holloway and hurried away He found James Hutchings in his pantry told him that their master wanted him and added that he was in a tearing rage Hutchings who never expected his sanguine and irascible master to be in any other mood finished the paragraph of the article in the Daily Telegraph he was reading put on his coat and went to the study His delay gave Lord Loudwater s wrath full time to mature When the butler entered his master shook his fist at him and roared You scoundrel You infernal scoundrel You ve been robbing me You ve been robbing me for years you blackguard James Hutchings met the charge with complete calm He shook his head and said in a surly tone No I haven t done anything of the kind m lord The flat denial infuriated his master yet more He spluttered and was for a while incoherent Then he became again articulate and said You have you rogue You took a commission a secret commission on that fifty dozen of champagne I bought last month You ve been doing it for years James Hutchings surly face was transformed It grew malignant his fierce protruding red rimmed blue eyes sparkled balefully and he flushed to a redness as deep as that of his master He knew at once who had betrayed him and he was furious at the betrayal At the same time he was not greatly alarmed he had never received a cheque from the wine merchants all their payments to him had been in cash and he had always cherished a warm contempt for his master I haven t he said fiercely And if I had it would be quite regular only a perquisite For the hundredth time mister Manley remarked the likeness between Lord Loudwater and his butler They had the same fierce protruding red rimmed blue eyes the same narrow low forehead the same large ears Hutchings hair was a darker brown than Lord Loudwater s and his lips were thinner But mister Manley was sure that had he worn a beard instead of whiskers it would have been difficult for many people to be sure which was Lord Loudwater and which his butler Lord Loudwater again spluttered then he roared A perquisite What about the Corrupt Practices Act It was passed for rogues like you I ll show you all about perquisites You ll find yourself in gaol inside of a month I shan t There isn t a word of truth in it or a scrap of evidence said Hutchings fiercely Evidence I ll find evidence all right cried his master And if I don t I ll anyhow discharge you without a character I ll get you one way or another my fine fellow I ll teach you to rob me I haven t robbed your lordship said Hutchings in a less surly tone He was much more moved by the threat of discharge than the threat of prosecution I tell you you have And you can clear out of this I ll wire to town at once for another butler an honest butler You ll clear out the moment he comes Pack up and be ready to go And when you do go I ll give you twenty four hours to clear out of the country before I put the police on your track cried Lord Loudwater mister Manley observed that it was exactly like him to take no risk in spite of his fury of any loss of comfort from the lack of a butler The instinct of self protection was indeed strong in him Not a bit of it You ve told me to go and I m going at once this very day The police will find me at my father s for the next fortnight said Hutchings with a sneer And when I go to London I ll leave my address A lot of good your going to London will do you I ll see you never get another place in this country snarled Lord Loudwater Hutchings gave him a look of vindictive malignity so intense that it made mister Manley quite uncomfortable turned and went out of the room Lord Loudwater said I ll teach the scoundrel to rob me Write at once for a new butler He took some lumps of sugar from a jar on the mantelpiece and went through the door which opened into the library In the library he stopped and shouted back If Morton comes about the timber I shall be in the stables Then he went through one of the long windows of the library into the garden and took his way to the stables As he drew near them the scowl cleared from his face But it remained a formidable face it did not grow pleasant None the less he spent a pleasant hour in the stables petting his horses He was fond of horses not of cats and he never bullied and seldom abused his horses as he abused and bullied his fellow men and women This was the result of his experience He had learnt from it that he might bully and abuse his human dependents with impunity As a boy he had also bullied and abused his horses But in his eighteenth year he had been savaged by a young horse he had maltreated and the lesson had stuck in his mind It was a simple obtuse mind but it had formed the theory that he got more out of human beings more deference and service by bullying them and more out of horses by treating them kindly Besides he liked horses mister Manley did not set about answering the letters at once He reflected for a while on the likeness between Hutchings and his master He thought the physical likeness of little interest There was a whole clan of Hutchingses in the villages and woods round the castle the bulk of them gamekeepers and there had been for generations mister Manley was much more interested in the resemblance in character between Hutchings and Lord Loudwater Hutchings probably under the pressure of circumstances was much less of a bore than his master but quite as much of a bully Also he was more intelligent and consequently more dangerous mister Manley would on no account have had him look at him with the intense malignity with which he had looked at his master Doubtless the butler had far greater self control than Lord Loudwater but if ever he did lose it it would be uncommonly bad for Lord Loudwater It would be interesting to find in the Loudwater archives the common ancestor to whom they both cast so directly back He fancied that it must be the third Baron At any rate both had his protruding blue eyes softened in his portrait doubtless by the natural politeness of the fashionable painter Was it worth his while to look up the record of the third Lord Loudwater He decided that if he found himself at sufficient leisure he would Then he decided that he was glad that Hutchins was going the butler had shown him but little civility Then he set about answering the letters When he had finished them he took up the stockbroker s cheque and considered it with a thoughtful frown He had never before seen a cheque for so large a sum and it interested him Then he wrote a short note of instructions to Lord Loudwater s bankers The ink in his fountain pen ran out as he came to the end of it and he signed it with the pen with which Lord Loudwater had endorsed the cheque He put the cheque into the envelope he had already addressed put stamps on all the letters carried them to the post box on a table in the hall went through the library out into the garden and smoked a cigarette with a somewhat languid air Then he went into the library and took up his task of cataloguing the books at the point at which he had stopped the day before He often paused to dip at length into a book before entering it in the catalogue He did not believe in hasty work CHAPTER II Lord Loudwater came to lunch in a better temper than that in which he had left the breakfast table He had ridden eight miles round and about his estate and the ride had soothed that seat of the evil humours his liver Lady Loudwater had been careful to shut Melchisidec in her boudoir James Hutchings had no desire in the world to see his master s florid face or square back and had instructed Wilkins and Holloway the first and second footmen to wait at table Lord Loudwater therefore could without any ruffling of his sensibilities give all his thought to his food and he did The cooking at the castle was always excellent If it was not he sent for the chef and spoke to him about it There was little conversation at lunch Lady Loudwater never spoke to her husband first save on rare occasions about a matter of importance It was not that she perceived any glamour of royalty about him she did not wish to hear his voice Besides she had never found a conversational opening so harmless that he could not contrive were it his whim to be offensive about it Besides she had at the moment nothing to say to him In truth owing to the fact that she took so many practically silent meals with him she was becoming rather a gourmet The food naturally the most important fact had become really the most important fact at the meals they took together She had come to realize this It was the only advantage she had ever derived from her intercourse with her husband At this lunch however she did not pay as much attention to the food as usual not indeed as much as it deserved Her mind would stray from it to Colonel Grey She wondered what he would tell her about herself that afternoon He was always discovering possibilities in her which she had never discovered for herself She only perceived their existence when he pointed them out to her Then they became obvious Also he was always discovering fresh facts attractive facts about her about her eyes and lips and hair and figure He imparted each discovery to her as he made it without delay and with the genuine enthusiasm of a discoverer Of course he should not have done this It was indeed wrong But he had assured her that he could not help it that he was always blurting things out Since it was a habit of long standing now probably ingrained it was useless to reproach him with any great severity for his frankness She did not do so For his part the Lord Loudwater had but little to say to his wife She was fond of Melchisidec and indifferent to horses For the greater part of the meal he was hardly aware that she was at the other end of the table Immersed in his food and its deglutition he was hardly sensible of the outside world at all Once disturbed by Holloway s removing his empty plate he told her that he had seen a dog fox on Windy Ridge again when Holloway handed the cheese straws to him he told her that Merry Belle s black colt had a cold Her two replies Oh did you and Has he appeared to fall on deaf ears He did not continue either conversation Then Lord Loudwater broke into an eloquent monologue Wilkins had poured out a glass of port for both of them to drink with their cheese straws Lord Loudwater finished his cheese straws took a long sip from his glass rolled it lovingly over his tongue gulped it down with a hideous grimace banged down his fist on the table and roared in a terrible anguished voice It s corked It s corked It s that scoundrel Hutchings This is his way of taking it out of me for sacking him He s done it on purpose the scoundrel Now I will gaol him Hanged if I don t I ll get another bottle m lord said Wilkins catching up the decanter and hurrying towards the door Get it And be quick about it And tell that scoundrel I ll gaol him cried Lord Loudwater Wilkins rushed from the room bearing in his hand the decanter of offending port Holloway followed him to help Lady Loudwater sipped a little port from her glass She was rather inclined to take no one s word for anything which she could herself verify Then she took another sip Then she said Are you sure this wine s corked Corked wine at the end of a really good meal is a bitter blow to any man an exceedingly bitter blow to a man of Lord Loudwater s sensitiveness in such matters Am I sure Hey Am I sure Yes I am sure you little fool he bellowed What do you know about wine Talk about things you understand Lady Loudwater s face was twisted by a faint spasm of hate which left it flushed She would never grow used to being bellowed at for a fool Once more her husband s refusal to let her take her meals apart from him seemed monstrous Hardly ever did she rise from one at which she had not been abused and insulted She realized indeed that she had been foolish to ask the question But why should she sit tongue tied before the brute She took another sip and said quietly It isn t corked Then she turned cold with fright Lord Loudwater could not believe his ears It could not be that his wife had contradicted him flatly It could not be He was still incredulous breathing heavily when the door opened and James Hutchings appeared on the threshold In his right hand he held the decanter of offending port in his left a sound cork He said firmly This wine isn t corked m lord Its flavour is perfect Besides a cork like this couldn t cork it A less sensitive man than Lord Loudwater might have risen to the double emergency Lord Loudwater could not He sat perfectly still But his eyes rolled so horribly that the Lady Loudwater started from her chair uttered a faint scream and fairly ran through the long window into the garden James Hutchings advanced to the table thumped the decanter down on it no way to treat an old vintage port at Lord Loudwater s right hand walked out of the room and shut the door firmly behind him In the great hall he smiled a triumphant malevolent smile Then he called Wilkins and Holloway who stood together in the middle of it cowardly dogs and shirkers and strode past them to the door to the servants quarters A few moments later Lord Loudwater rose to his feet and staggered dizzily along to the other end of the table He picked up his wife s half emptied glass and sipped the port It was not corked It was incredible He would never forgive her He rang the bell Both Wilkins and Holloway answered it He bade them tell Hutchings to pack his belongings and go at once If he were not out of the castle by four o clock they were to kick him out Then he went still scowling to the stables mister Manley had already finished his lunch Halfway through his after lunch pipe he rose took his hat and stick and set out to pay a visit to missus Truslove As he came out of the park gates he came upon the reverend George Stebbing the locum tenens in charge of the parish for the vicar was away on a holiday enjoying a respite from his perpetual struggle with the patron of the living Lord Loudwater They fell into step and for a while discussed the local weather and local affairs Then mister Manley who had been gifted by Heaven with a lively imagination wholly untrammelled by any straining passion for exactitude entertained mister Stebbing with a vivid account of his experiences as leader of the first Great Push mister Manley was one of the many rather stout soft men who in different parts of Great Britain will till their dying days entertain acquaintances with vivid accounts of their experiences as leaders of the Great Pushes Like that of most of them his war experience before his weak heart had procured him his discharge from the army had consisted wholly of office work in England His account of his strenuous fighting lacked nothing of fire or picturesqueness on that account He was too modest to say in so many words that but for his martial qualities there would have been no Great Push at all and that any success it had had was due to those martial qualities but that was the impression he left on mister Stebbing s simple and rather plastic mind When therefore they parted at the crossroads mister Manley went on his way in a pleasant content at having once more made himself valued and mister Stebbing went on his way feeling thankful that he had been brought into friendly contact with a really able hero Both of them were the happier for their chance meeting mister Manley found Helena Truslove in her drawing room and when the door closed behind the maid who had ushered him into it he embraced her with affectionate warmth Then he held her out at arm s length and for the several hundredth time admired her handsome clear skinned high coloured gipsy face her black rather wild eyes and the black hair wreathed round her head in so heavy a mass It has been an awful long time between the kisses he said She sighed a sigh of content and laughed softly Then she said I sometimes think that you must have had a great deal of practice No said mister Manley firmly I have never had occasion to be in love before He put her back into the chair from which he had lifted her sat down facing her and gazed at her with adoring eyes He was truly very much in love with her They were excellent complements the one of the other If mister Manley had the brains for two indeed he had the brains for half a dozen she had the character for two Her chin was very unlike the chin of an eagle She was not indeed lacking in brains Her brow forbade the supposition But hers was rather the practical intelligence his the creative That she had the force of character on occasion the fierceness which he lacked was no small source of her attraction for him And how was the hog this morning she said ready to be soothing The hog was their pet name for Lord Loudwater Beastly He s an utterly loathsome fellow said mister Manley with conviction Oh no not utterly at any rate not if you re independent of him she protested Does he ever come into contact with any one who is not dependent on him I believe he shuns them like the pest Not into close contact she said at any rate nowadays But I ve known him to do good natured things and then he s very fond of his horses That makes the way he treats every human being who is in any way dependent on him all the more disgusting said mister Manley firmly Oh I don t know It s something to be fond of animals she said tolerantly This morning he had a devil of a row with Hutchings the butler you know and discharged him That was a silly thing to do Hutchings is not at all a good person to have a row with she said quickly I should say that he was a far more dangerous brute than Loudwater and much more intelligent Still I don t know what he could do What was the row about Some woman sent Loudwater an anonymous letter accusing Hutchings of having received commissions from the wine merchants That would be Elizabeth Twitcher s mother Elizabeth and Hutchings were engaged and about ten days ago he jilted her said missus Truslove I suppose that when he was in love with her he bragged about these commissions to her and she told her mother Her mother has certainly taken it out of him for jilting her daughter But what an unsavoury place the castle is said mister Manley With such a master what can you expect said missus Truslove Did the hog say anything more about halving my allowance mister Manley frowned A few days before he had been greatly surprised to learn from Lord Loudwater that the bulk of Helena Truslove s income was an allowance from him The matter had greatly exercised his mind Why should his employer allow her six hundred a year It was a matter which should be cleared up He said slowly Yes he did He asked what you said when I told you that he was going to halve it and he did not seem to like the idea of your seeing him about it He ll like my seeing him about it even less than the idea of it said missus Truslove firmly and there was a sudden gleam in her wild black eyes mister Manley looked at her frowning faintly Then he said in a rather hesitating manner I ve never asked you about it But why does the hog make you this allowance That s my dark past she said in a teasing tone smiling at him I suppose that as we re going to be married so soon I ought to make a clean breast of it if you really want to know Just as you like said mister Manley his face clearing a little at her careless tone Well the hog treated me badly not really badly because I didn t care enough about him to make it possible for him to treat me really badly but just as badly as he could For when he and I first met I was on the way to get engaged to a man named Hardwicke a rich city man rather a bore but a man who would make an excellent husband Loudwater knew that Hardwicke was ready and eager to marry me and I suppose that that helped to make him keen on me At any rate he made love to me not nearly so badly as you d think and persuaded me to promise to marry him I can t think how you could have done it cried mister Manley How was I to know what a hog he was at home At Trouville he was quite nice as I tell you Besides there was the title I thought I should like to be Lady Loudwater You know I do have strong impulses and I act on them Well after all you didn t marry him said mister Manley in a tone of relief What did happen We were engaged for about two months Then about a month before the date fixed for our marriage he met Olivia Quainton fell in love with her and broke off our engagement a week before our wedding day Well of all the caddish tricks cried mister Manley You can imagine how furious I was And I wasn t going to stand it not from Loudwater at any rate I had learnt a good deal more about him in the eleven weeks we were engaged and naturally I wasn t pleased with what I had learnt I set out to make myself very disagreeable I saw him and did make myself very disagreeable I told him a good many unpleasant things about himself which made him much more furious than I was myself I m glad some of it got through his thick skin said mister Manley A good deal of it did Then I made it clear to him that he had robbed me of John Hardwicke and an excellent settlement in life and told him that I was going to bring an action for breach of promise against him That certainly got through his thick skin for it s very painful to him to spend money on any one but himself But he made terms at once gave me this house furnished and promised to allow me six hundred a year for life You don t think I was wrong to take it she added anxiously Certainly not said mister Manley quickly and firmly Her face cleared and she said So many people would say that it was not nice my taking money for an injury like that Rubbish It wasn t as if you d been in love with him said mister Manley with the firmest conviction That s the exact point You do see things she said smiling at him gratefully If I had been it would have been quite different And how else were you to score off him except by hitting him in the pocket That and his stomach are his only vulnerable points said mister Manley viciously He was ignorant of Melchisidec s discovery of another They are And he certainly had robbed me of an income It was only fair that he should make up for it she said rather plaintively Absolutely fair Well those were the terms The house is mine all right it was properly made over to me But stupidly I didn t have a proper deed drawn up about the money I had his promise One supposes that one can take the word of an English Peer But I think that it s really all right I have his letters about it There s no saying You d better see a lawyer about it and find out But this isn t a very dark past he said and rose and came to her and kissed her He was indeed relieved and reassured In these circumstances the six hundred a year was not an allowance at all It was merely the payment of a debt a just debt But it won t be nearly so nice for us if the hog does manage to cut the six hundred down to three hundred My husband only left me a hundred a year she said frowning To be with you will be perfection whatever our income is said mister Manley with ringing conviction and he kissed her again She smiled happily and said He shan t cut it down I ll see that he doesn t When I ve had a talk with him he ll be glad enough to leave it as it is It s very likely that he s only trying it on It s the kind of thing he would do But you ll find it difficult to get that talk He s bent on shirking it said mister Manley I ll see that he doesn t get the chance of shirking it she said and her eyes gleamed again I believe you re the only person in the world he s afraid of he said in a tone of admiration I shouldn t wonder she said At any rate I seem to be the only person in the world to whom he s always been civil At least I ve never heard of any one else I m afraid he won t be civil when you get that talk with him if ever you do get it said mister Manley frowning rather anxiously That ll be all the worse for him she said dauntlessly But after all if I did fail to make him leave my income at six hundred we should still have this house and four hundred a year We should still be quite comfortable Besides you could keep on as his secretary and that would be another two hundred a year I can t do that It s out of the question cried mister Manley I m getting so to loathe the brute that I shall soon be quite unable to stand him As it is I sometimes have a violent desire to wring his neck Now that I know that he played this measly trick on you it will be more violent than ever Besides we must have a flat in town It s really necessary to my work I can do my actual writing down here fairly well But what I really need is to get in touch with the right people with the people who are really stimulating Besides I m gregarious I like mixing with people Yes You re right We must have a flat in town Therefore I must make the hog keep to his bargain and I will she said firmly I believe you may he said gazing at her determined face with admiring eyes There was a pause Then she said carelessly When are we going to tell people that we re engaged Not yet awhile said mister Manley quickly At least I don t want the people about here to know about it And if you come to think of it things being as they are Loudwater would probably make himself more infernally disagreeable to me than he does at present He d not only try to take it out of me to annoy you but it s just as likely as not that he would consider my getting engaged to you as poaching on his preserves infernal cheek He s the most hopelessly vain and unreasonable sweep in the British Isles I shouldn t be a bit surprised if he did He couldn t possibly help being a dog in the manger she said thoughtfully And there s another thing It has just occurred to me that if he tries to halve my income for nothing at all he might try to stop it altogether if I got married No I must get that matter settled for good and all I ll have that talk with him at once If you can get it said mister Manley doubtfully I can get it she said confidently You must remember that having lived here for nearly two years I know all about his habits I shall take him by surprise But we ve talked enough about these dull things let s talk about something interesting How s the play going They talked about the play he was writing and then they talked about one another They had their afternoon tea soon after four for mister Manley had to return to the Castle to deal with any letters that the five o clock post might bring At twenty minutes to five he left missus Truslove and walked back to the Castle He was truly in love with Helena She was intelligent and appreciative She was of his own class with his own practical outlook on life born of having belonged to a middle class family of moderate means like himself She was the daughter of a country architect He could nowhere have found a more suitable wife He was relieved about the matter of the reason why she received an allowance from Lord Loudwater but he was not relieved about the matter of its being halved Seven hundred a year had been an excellent income for the wife of a struggling playwright to enjoy It had promised him the full social life in which his genius would most rapidly develop He had regarded that income with great pleasure Ever since Lord Loudwater had bidden him inform Helena of his intention of halving her allowance he had been bitterly angered by this barefaced attempt to rob her and consequently her future husband In the light of her story the attempt had grown yet more disgraceful and he resented it yet more bitterly The further danger that Lord Loudwater might attempt to stop her income altogether if she married though he perceived that it was a real even imminent danger did not greatly trouble him He was full of resentment not fear He felt that he loathed his employer more than ever and with more reason Holloway brought the post bag to the library and waited while mister Manley sorted the letters that he might take those addressed to Lady Loudwater to her rooms and those addressed to the servants to the housekeeper s room As mister Manley inverted the bag and poured its contents on to the table the footman said Utchings as gone sir We must bear up said mister Manley in a tone wholly void of any sympathy with Hutchings in his misfortune He was that furious The things e said e d do to his lordship said Holloway in a deeply impressed tone Threatened men live long said mister Manley carelessly CHAPTER III There is in the collection of the Earl of Ellesmere a picture of the head of a girl which the connoisseurs of the nineteenth century ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci The connoisseurs of the twentieth century ascribe it to Luini But for the colour of the hair it might have been a portrait of Lady Loudwater a faded portrait It might also very well be a portrait of one of her actual ancestresses for her grandmother was a lady of an old Tuscan family Be that as it may Lady Loudwater had the soft dark dreamy eyes set rather wide apart the straight delicate nose the alluring lips promising all the kisses the broad well moulded forehead and the faint exactly curving eyebrows of the girl in the picture Above all when Lord Loudwater was not present the mysterious enchanting lingering smile which is perhaps the chief charm of Luini s women rested nearly always on her face But while the hair of the girl in the picture is a deep dull red the hair of Olivia was dark brown with glimmers of gold in it Also her colouring was warmer than that of the girl in the picture and her alluring charm stronger At a quarter to three that afternoon she came out on to the East lawn in a silk frock and hat of a green rather sombre for the summer day She had been bidden by a fashionable fortune teller never to wear green for it was her unlucky colour But that tint had so given her colouring its full values and her dark liquid eyes so deep a depth that she had paid no heed to the warning There was a bright light of expectation in her eyes and the alluring smile lingered on her face She walked quickly across the lawn with the easy graceful gait proper to the accomplished golfer she was into the shrubbery on the other side of it A few feet along the path through it she looked sharply back over her shoulder She saw no one at those windows of the East wing which looked on to the lawn and shrubbery but a movement on the lawn itself caught her eye The cat Melchisidec was following her She did not slacken her pace but for a moment the smile faded from her face at the remembrance of her husband s outburst at breakfast Then the smile returned subtile and expectant She did not wait for Melchisidec She knew his way of pretending to follow her like a dog she knew that if she displayed any interest in him even showed that she was aware of his presence he would probably come no further She went on at the same brisk pace till she came to the gate in the East wood She went through it shut it gently paused and again looked back All of the path through the shrubbery that she could see was empty She turned and walked briskly along the narrow path through the wood and came into the long turf paved aisle which ran at right angles to it The middle of the aisle was deeply rutted by the wheels of the carts which had carried away the timber from the spring thinning of the wood She turned to the left and sauntered slowly up the smooth turf along the side of the aisle a brighter light of expectation in her eyes her smile even more mysterious and alluring She had not gone fifty yards up the aisle when Colonel Grey came limping out of the entrance of a path on the other side of it and quickened his pace as he crossed it She stood still flushing faintly gazing at him with her lips parted a little He looked as he was very young to be a Lieutenant Colonel and uncommonly fragile for a V C At any time he would look delicate and he was the paler for the fact that at times he still suffered considerable pain from his wound But there was force in his delicate distinguished face His sensitive lips could set very firm his chin was square his nose had a rather heavy bridge and usually his grey eyes were cold and very keen He gave the impression of being wrought of finely tempered steel His eyes were shining so brightly at the moment that they had lost their keenness with their coldness He marked joyfully the flush on her face and did not know that he was flushing himself About five feet away he stopped gazing or rather staring at her and said in a tone of fervent conviction Heavens Olivia What a beautiful and entrancing creature you are She smiled flushing more deeply He stepped forward took her hand and held it very tightly Goodness But I have been impatient for you to come he cried I m not late she said in her low sweet rather drawling voice He let go of her hand and said I don t know how it is but I ve been as restless as a cat all the morning I m never sure that you will be able to come and the uncertainty worries me But you saw me for three hours yesterday she said moving forward Yesterday he said falling into step with her Yesterday is a thousand years away I wasn t sure that you d come today Why shouldn t I come she said Loudwater might have got to know of it and stopped you coming Fortunately he doesn t take enough interest in my doings Of course if I didn t turn up at a meal he d make a fuss though why he should make such a point of our having all our meals together I can t conceive I should certainly enjoy mine much more if I had them in my sitting room she said in a dispassionate tone for all the world as if she were discussing the case of some one else I am so worried about you he said with a harassed air Ever since that evening I heard him bullying you I ve been simply worried to death about it It was nice of you to interfere but it was a pity she said gently It didn t do any good as far as his behaviour is concerned and we saw so much more of one another when you could come to the Castle Then you do want to see more of me he said eagerly Lady Loudwater lost her smiling air she became demureness itself and she said Well you see thanks to Egbert s vile temper we have so few friends Grey frowned she was always quick to elude him Then he growled What a name Egbert He can t help that It was given him Besides it s a family name she said in a tone of fine impartiality It would be Hogbert said Grey contemptuously missus Truslove and mister Manley were not the only people to ignore the essential bullness of Lord Loudwater They went on a few steps in silence then she said Besides I don t mind his outbursts I m used to them I don t believe it You re much too delicate and sensitive he cried But I am getting used to them she protested You never will Has he been bullying you again he said looking anxiously into her eyes Not more than usual she said in a wholly indifferent tone Then it is usual I was afraid it was he said in a miserable voice What on earth is to be done about it Why there s nothing to be done except just grin and bear it she said bravely enough and with the conviction of one who has thought a matter out thoroughly Then it s monstrous Just monstrous that the most charming and loveliest creature in the world should be bullied by that infernal brute he cried and put his arm around her The Countess was on the very point of slipping out of it when the cat Melchisidec came out of the bushes a dozen yards ahead of them and with Melchisidec came a very distinct vision of Lord Loudwater s flushed distorted and revolting face as he swore at her at breakfast that morning She did not slip out of the encircling arm and Grey bent his head and kissed her lightly on the lips It was the gentlest lightest kiss the kiss he might have given a pretty child just a natural tribute to beauty and charm But the harm was done The population of Great Britain cannot really be more than one and a half persons to the acre and the great majority of them live thousands to the acre in towns yet it is indeed difficult to kiss a girl during the daytime in any given acre however thickly wooded without being seen by some superfluous sojourner on that acre and whether or no it was that the green frock and hat brought the Countess the bad luck the fortuneteller had foretold there was a witness to that kiss Undoubtedly too it was not the right kind of witness If it had been an indulgent elder not given to gossip or a chivalrous young man not averse himself from kisses all might have been well But William Roper under gamekeeper was a young man without a spark of chivalry in him and he had been soured in the matter of kisses by the steadfast resolve of the young women of the village to suffer none from him He was an unattractive young man not unlike the ferrets he kept at his cottage He was the last young man in the world or at any rate in the neighbourhood to keep silent about what he had seen Even so no great harm might have been done He might have blabbed about the matter in the village and the whole village and the servants of the Castle might have talked about it for weeks and months or even years without it reaching the ears of Lord Loudwater But William Roper saw in that kiss his royal road to Fortune Ambitious in the grain he was not content with his post of under gamekeeper he desired to oust William Hutchings from the post of head gamekeeper and though there were two under gamekeepers senior to him with a greater claim on that post occupy it himself Here was the way to it his lordship could not but be grateful to the man who informed him of such goings on he could not but promote him to the post of his desire He wholly misjudged his lordship Ordinary gratitude was not one of his attributes Olivia slipped out of Grey s arm and they walked on up the aisle But they walked on changed creatures trembling a little bemused William Roper the ill favoured minister of Nemesis followed them At the top of the aisle they came to the pavilion a small white marble building in the Classic style standing in the middle of a broad glade As they went into it Olivia said wistfully It s a pity I couldn t have tea sent here I did At least I brought it said Grey waving his hand towards a basket which stood on the table I knew you d be happier for tea No one has ever been so thoughtful of me as you are she said gazing at him with grateful troubled eyes Let s hope that your luck is changing he said gravely gazing at her with eyes no less troubled Then Melchisidec scratched at the door and mewed Olivia let him in Purring in the friendliest way he rubbed his head against Grey s leg He never treated Lord Loudwater with such friendliness William Roper chose a tree about forty yards from the pavilion and set his gun against the trunk Then he filled and lit his pipe leaned back comfortably against the trunk hidden by the fringe of undergrowth and with his eyes on the door of the pavilion waited For Grey and Olivia never dreaming of this patient watcher the minutes flew they had so many things to tell one another so many questions to ask At least Grey had Olivia for the most part listened without comment unless the flush which waxed and waned should be considered comment to the things he told her about herself and the many ways in which she affected him For William Roper the minutes dragged he was eager to start briskly up the royal road to Fortune He was a slow smoker and he smoked a strong slow burning twist but he had nearly emptied the screw of paper which held it before they came out of the door of the pavilion It was a still evening but some drift of air had carried the rank smoke from William Roper s pipe into the glade and it hung there Colonel Grey had not taken five steps before his nostrils were assailed by it Damn he said softly What s the matter said Olivia She was too deeply absorbed in Grey for her senses to be alert and the reek of William Roper s twist had reached her nostrils but not her brain There s some one about he said Can t you smell his vile tobacco Bother said Olivia softly and she frowned They walked quietly on Grey was careful not to look about him with any show of earnestness for there was nothing to be gained by letting the watcher know that they had perceived his presence Indeed he would have seen nothing for the undergrowth between him and the glade was too thin to form a good screen and William Roper was now behind the tree trunk Thirty yards down the broad aisle Grey said in a low voice This is an infernal nuisance Why said Olivia If it comes to Loudwater s ears he ll make himself devilishly unpleasant to you He can t make himself more unpleasant than he does she said in a tone of quiet certitude and utter indifference But why shouldn t I have tea with you in the pavilion It s what it s there for All the same Loudwater will make an infernal fuss about it if it gets to his ears He ll bully you worse than ever he said in an unhappy tone frowning heavily What do I care about Loudwater now she said smiling at him and she brushed her fingertips across the back of his hand He caught her fingers and held them for a moment but the frown did not lift The nuisance is that whoever it was he had been there a long time he said gravely The glade was full of the reek of his vile tobacco Suppose he saw me kiss you in the drive here and then followed us Well if you will do such wicked things in the open air she said smiling It isn t a laughing matter I m afraid he said rather heavily and frowning Well I should have to consider your reputation and say that you didn t It would be very bad for your career if it became known that you did such things and Egbert would never rest till he had done everything he could do to injure you I should certainly declare that you didn t and you d have to do the same Oh leave me out of it Hogbert can t touch me It s you I m thinking about he said But there s no need to worry about me I m not afraid of Egbert any longer she said and her eyes full of confidence and courage met his steadily Then resolved to clear the anxiety away from his mind she went on It s no use meeting trouble half way If some one did see us Egbert may not get to hear of it for days or weeks perhaps never She did not know that they had to reckon with the ambition of William Roper Lord how I want to kiss you again he cried You ll have to wait till tomorrow she said It was as well that he did not kiss her again for fifty yards behind them stealing through the wood came William Roper all eyes And he had already quite enough to tell Grey walked with her through the rest of the wood and nearly to the end of the path through the shrubbery She spared no effort to set his mind at ease protesting that she did not care a rap how furiously her husband abused her A few yards from the edge of the East lawn they stopped but they lingered over their parting She promised to meet him in the East wood at three on the morrow She walked slowly across the lawn and up to her suite of rooms thinking of Grey She changed into a peignoir lit a cigarette lay down on a couch and went on thinking about him She gave no thought to the matter of whether they had been watched Lord Loudwater had become of less interest than ever to her his furies seemed trivial She had a feeling that he had become a mere shadow in her life As she lay smoking that cigarette William Roper was telling his story to Lord Loudwater He had waited in the wood till Colonel Grey had gone back through it then he had walked briskly to the back door of the Castle and asked to see his lordship Mary Hutchings the second housemaid who had answered his knock took him to the servants hall and told Holloway what he asked Both of them regarded him curiously they themselves never wanted to see his lordship though seeing him was part of their jobs and one who could go out of his way to see him must indeed be remarkable William Roper was hardly remarkable He was merely somewhat repulsive Holloway said that he would inquire whether his lordship would see him and went As he went out of the door William Roper said with an air of great importance Tell is lordship as it s very partic ler Mary Hutchings curiosity was aroused and she tried to discover what it was All she gained by doing so was an acute irritation of her curiosity William Roper grew mysterious to the very limits of aggravation but he told her nothing Her irritation was not alleviated when he said darkly You ll ear all about these goings on in time She wished to hear all about them then and there Holloway came back presently looking rather sulky and said that his lordship would see William Roper Though why e should curse me because you want to see im very partic ler I can t see he added with an aggrieved air He led the way and for the first time in his life William Roper found himself entering the presence of the head of the House of Loudwater without any sense of trepidation He carried himself unusually upright with an air of conscious rectitude Lord Loudwater was in the smoking room in which he had that morning dealt with his letters with mister Manley It was his favourite room his smoking room his reading room and his office He had been for a long ride and was now lying back in an easy chair with a long whisky and soda by his side reading the Pall Mall Gazette In literature his taste was blameless Holloway ushering William Roper into the room said William Roper m lord and withdrew Lord Loudwater went on reading the paragraph he had just begun William Roper gazed at him without any weakening of his courage so strong was his conviction of the nobility of the duty he was discharging and cleared his throat Lord Loudwater finished the paragraph scowled at the interrupter and said Well what is it Hey What do you want It s about er ladyship your lordship I thought your lordship oughter be told about it its not being at all the sort of thing as your lordship would be likely to old with There are noblemen who would on the instant have bidden William Roper go to the devil Lord Loudwater was not of these He set the newspaper down beside the whisky and soda leaned forward and said in a hushed voice What the devil are you talking about Hey I seed Colonel Grey the gentleman as is staying at the Cart and Orses kiss er in the East wood said William Roper The first emotion of Lord Loudwater was incredulous amazement It was his very strong conviction that his wife was a cold blooded passionless creature incapable of inspiring or feeling any warm emotion He had forgotten that he had married her for love violent love You infernal liar he said in a rather breathless voice It ain t no lie your lordship What for should I go telling lies about er said William Roper in an injured tone Lord Loudwater stared at him The fellow was telling the truth And what did she do Hey Did she smack his face for him he cried No She let im do it your lordship She did bellowed his lordship Yes She didn t seem a bit put out your lordship said William Roper simply And what happened then bellowed Lord Loudwater and he got to his feet They walked on to the pavilion your lordship An they had their tea there Leastways I seed er ladyship come to the door an empty hot water out of a tea pot Tea Tea said Lord Loudwater in the tone of one saying Arson Arson Then in all his black wrath he perceived that he must have himself in hand to deal with the matter He took a long draught of whisky and soda rose walked across the room and back again grinding his teeth rolling his eyes and snapping the middle finger and thumb of his right hand Never had the flush of rage been so deep in his face It was almost purple Never had his eyes protruded so far from his head He stopped and said thickly How long were they in the pavilion In the pavilion your lordship They were there a longish while an hour and a half maybe said William Roper with quiet pride in the impression his information had made on his employer His employer looked at him as if it was the dearest wish of his heart to shake the life out of him then and there It was the dearest wish of his heart But he refrained It would be a senseless act to slay the goose which lay these golden eggs of information All right Get out And keep your tongue between your teeth or I ll cut it out for you Do you understand Hey he roared approaching William Roper with an air so menacing that the conscientious fellow backed against the door with his arm up to shield his face I ain t a going to say a word to no one he cried You d better not Get out snarled his employer William Roper got out Trembling and perspiring freely he walked straight through the Castle and out of the back door without pausing to say a word to any one though he heard the voice of Holloway discussing his mysterious errand with Mary Hutchings in the servants hall He had walked nearly a mile before he succeeded in convincing himself that his feet were firmly set on the royal road to Fortune His conviction was ill founded CHAPTER IV For a good three minutes after the departure of William Roper the Lord Loudwater walked up and down the smoking room His redly glinting eyes still rolled in a terrifying fashion and still every few seconds he snapped his fingers in the throes of an effort to make up his raging mind whether to begin by an attack on his wife or on Colonel Grey He could not remember ever having been so angry in his life now and again his red eyes saw red Then of a sudden he made up his mind that he was at the moment angrier with Colonel Grey He would deal with him first Olivia could wait He hurried out to the stables and bellowed for a horse with such violence that two startled grooms saddled one for him in little more than a minute He made no attempt to think what he would say to Colonel Grey He was too angry He galloped the two miles to the Cart and Horses at Bellingham where Colonel Grey was staying in order to restore his health and to fish At the door of the inn he bellowed Ostler Ostler Then without waiting to see whether an ostler came he threw the reins on his horse s neck left it to its own devices strode into the tap room and bellowed to the affrighted landlady missus Turnbull to take him straight to Colonel Grey Trembling she led him upstairs to Grey s sitting room on the first floor Before she could knock he opened the door bounced through it and slammed it Grey was sitting at the other side of the table looking through a book of flies He appeared to be quite unmoved by the sudden entry of the infuriated nobleman or by his raucous bellow So here you are you infernal scoundrel He looked at him with a cold distasteful eye and said in a clear very unpleasant voice Another time knock before you come into my room Lord Loudwater had not expected to be received in this fashion dimly he had seen Grey cowering He paused then said less loudly Knock Hey Knock Knock at the door of an infernal scoundrel like you His voice began to gather volume again Likely I should take the trouble I know all about your scoundrelly game Colonel Grey remembered that Olivia had said that she proposed to deny the kiss and his course was quite clear to him I don t know whether you re drunk or mad he said in a quiet contemptuous voice This again was not what Lord Loudwater had expected But Grey was a strong believer in the theory that the attacker has the advantage and he had an even stronger belief that an enemy in a fury is far less dangerous than an enemy calm You re lying You know I m neither bellowed Lord Loudwater You kissed Olivia Lady Loudwater in the East wood You know you did You were seen doing it You re raving man said Colonel Grey quietly in a yet more unpleasant tone The interview was not going as Lord Loudwater had seen it He had to swallow violently before he could say You were seen doing it Seen By one of my gamekeepers You must have paid him to say so said Colonel Grey with quiet conviction Lord Loudwater was a little staggered by the accusation He gasped and stuttered D D Damn your impudence P P Paid to say it Yes paid said Colonel Grey without raising his voice You happened to hear that we had tea in the pavilion in the wood probably from Lady Loudwater herself and you made up this stupid lie and paid your gamekeeper to tell it in order to score off her It s exactly the dog s trick a bullying ruffian like you would play a woman D D Dog s trick Me stammered Lord Loudwater gasping He was used to saying things of this kind to other people not to have them said to him Yes you You know that you re a wretched bully and cad said Colonel Grey with just a little more warmth in his tone Had Lord Loudwater s belief that William Roper had told him the truth about the kiss been weaker it might have been shaken by the whole hearted thoroughness of Grey s attack But William Roper had impressed that belief on him deeply He was sure that Grey had kissed Lady Loudwater The certainty spurred him to a fresh effort and he cried It s no good your trying to humbug me none at all I ve got evidence plenty of evidence And I m going to act on it too I m going to hound you out of the Army and that jade of a wife of mine out of decent society Do you think because I don t spend four or five months every year in that rotten hole London I haven t got any influence Hey If you do you re damn well wrong I ve got more than enough twice over to clear a scoundrel like you out of the Army Don t talk absurd nonsense said Grey calmly Nonsense Hey Absurd nonsense howled Lord Loudwater on a new note of exasperation Yes nonsense A disreputable cad like you can t hurt me in any way and well you know it said Grey with painstaking distinctness Not hurt you Hey I can t hurt the corespondent in a divorce case Hey said Lord Loudwater rather breathlessly As if a man who has abused and bullied his wife as you have could get a divorce said Grey and he laughed a gentle contemptuous laugh galling beyond words It galled Lord Loudwater surely enough he snapped his fingers four times and gibbered I tell you what it is I ve had enough of your manners said Grey What you want is a lesson And if I hear that you ve been bullying Lady Loudwater about this simple matter of my having had tea with her I ll give it you with a horsewhip You ll give me a lesson You whispered Lord Loudwater and he danced a little frantically Yes I ll give you the soundest thrashing any man hereabouts has had for the last twenty years if I have to begin by knocking your ugly head off your shoulders said Grey raising his clear voice so that for the first time missus Turnbull trembling but thrilled on the landing heard what was being said The enunciation of Lord Loudwater had been thick his words had been slurred You You thrash me he howled Yes me Now get out Lord Loudwater gnashed his teeth at him and again snapped his fingers He burned to rush round the table and hammer the life out of Grey but he could not do it violent words not violent deeds were his accomplishment Moreover there was something daunting in Grey s cold and steady eye He snapped his fingers again and pouring out a stream of furious abuse turned to the door and flung out of it missus Turnbull scuttled aside into Grey s bedroom Half way down the stairs Lord Loudwater paused to bellow I ll ruin you yet you scoundrel Mark my word I will hound you out of the Army He flung out of the house and found that the ostler had taken his horse round to the stable removed its bridle and given it a feed of corn He cursed him heartily Grey rose shut the door and laughed gently Then he frowned Of a sudden he perceived that natural as had been his manner of dealing with Lord Loudwater he had handled him badly At least it was possible that he had handled him badly It would have been wiser perhaps to have been suave and firm rather than firm and provoking But it was not likely that suavity would have been of much use the brute would probably have regarded it as weakness But for Olivia s sake he ought probably to have tried to soothe him As it was the brute had gone raging off and would vent his fury on her What had he better do He was not long perceiving that there was nothing that he could do The natural thing was to go to the Castle and prevent her husband by force if need be from abusing and bullying Olivia That was what his strongest instincts bade him do It was quite impossible It would compromise her beyond repair He had done her harm enough by his impulsive indiscretion in the wood His face slowly settled into a set scowl as he cudgelled his brains to find a way of coming effectually to her help It seemed a vain effort but a way had to be found Lord Loudwater galloped half way to the Castle in a furious haste to punish Olivia for allowing Grey to make love to her and even more for the contemptuous way in which Grey had treated him He had hopes also of bullying her into a confession of the truth of William Roper s story But Grey had excited him to a height of fury at which not even he could remain without exhaustion In a reaction he reined in his horse to a canter then to a trot and then to a walk He found that he was feeling tired He continued however to chafe at his injuries but with less vehemence and he was still resolved to make a strong effort to draw the confession from Olivia On reaching the Castle he did not go to her at once He sat down in an easy chair in his smoking room and drank two whiskies and sodas In the background of Olivia s mind meditating pleasantly on her pleasant afternoon there had been a patient and resigned expectation that presently her conscience would begin to reproach her for allowing Grey to make love to her But the minutes slipped by and she did not begin to feel that she had been wicked The meditation remained pleasant At last she realized suddenly that she was not going to feel wicked She was surprised and even a trifle horror stricken by her insensibility Then fairly faced by it she came to the conclusion that in a woman cursed with such a brute of a husband such insensibility was not only natural it was even proper Her woman s craving to be loved and to love was the strongest of her emotions and it had gone unsatisfied for so long Her husband had killed or rather extirpated her fondness for him before they had been married a month She was inclined to believe that she had never really loved him at all He had certainly ceased to love her before they had been married a fortnight if indeed he had ever loved her at all She had no child she was an orphan without sisters or brothers Her husband let her see but little of the friends who were fond of her She began to suspect that her conscience did not reproach her because she had merely acted on her natural right to love and be loved This conclusion brought her mind again to the consideration of Antony Grey and again she let her thoughts dwell on him The gong informing her that it was time to dress for dinner interrupted this pleasant occupation She had her bath put herself into the hands of her maid Elizabeth Twitcher and resumed her meditation She was at once so deeply absorbed in it that she did not observe her maid s sullen and depressed air She was presently interrupted again and in a manner far more violent and startling than the summons of the gong The door was jerked open and her refreshed husband strode into the room I know all about your little game madam he cried You ve been letting that blackguard Grey make love to you You kissed him in the East wood this afternoon The mysterious smile faded from the face of Olivia and an expression of the most natural astonishment took its place I sometimes think that you are quite mad Egbert she said in her slow musical voice Elizabeth Twitcher continued her deft manipulation of a thick strand of hair without any change in her sullen and depressed air To all seeming she was uninterested or deaf Lord Loudwater had expected in the face of Olivia s gentleness to have to work himself up to a proper height of indignant fury by degrees The echo of Grey s accusation from the mouth of his wife raised him to it on the instant and without an effort Don t lie to me he bellowed It s no good whatever I tell you I know Olivia was surprised to find herself wholly free from her old fear of him The fact that she was in love with Grey and he with her had already worked a change in her These were the only things in the world of any real importance That clear knowledge gave her a new confidence and a new strength Her husband had been able to frighten her nearly out of her wits Now he could not and she could use them I m not lying at all I really do believe you re mad often she said very distinctly Once more Lord Loudwater was compelled to grind his teeth Then he laughed a harsh barking laugh and cried It s no good I ve just had a short interview with that scoundrel Grey And I put the fear of God into him I can tell you I made him admit that you d kissed him in the East wood For a breath Olivia was taken aback Then she perceived clearly that it was a lie He could not put the fear of God into Grey Besides Grey had kissed her not she him It s you who are lying she said quickly and with spirit How could Colonel Grey admit a thing that never happened Lord Loudwater perceived that it was going to be harder to wring the confession from her than he had expected Checked he paused Then Elizabeth Twitcher caught his attention Here you clear out he said Elizabeth Twitcher caught her mistress s eye in the glass Olivia made no sign I can t leave her ladyship s hair in this state your lordship said Elizabeth Twitcher with sullen firmness You do as you re told and clear out bellowed his lordship I don t want to be half an hour late for dinner said Olivia accepting the diversion and ready to make the most of it Elizabeth Twitcher looked at Lord Loudwater saw more clearly than ever his likeness to the loathed James Hutchings and made up her mind to do nothing that he bade her do She went on dressing her mistress s hair sullenly Are you going Or am I to throw you out of the room cried Lord Loudwater in a blustering voice Don t be silly Egbert said Olivia sharply From the height of her new emotional experience she felt that her husband was merely a noisy and obnoxious boy This was indeed quite plain to her She felt years older than he and very much wiser Lord Loudwater with a quite unusual glimmer of intelligence perceived that bringing Elizabeth Twitcher into the matter had been a mistake It had weakened his main action In a less violent but more malevolent voice he said Silly Hey I ll show you all about that you little jade You clear out of this first thing to morrow morning My lawyers will settle your hash for you I ll deal with that blackguard Grey myself I ll hound him out of the Army inside of a month Perhaps it ll be a consolation to you to know that you ve done him in as well as yourself He turned on his heel left the room with a positively melodramatic stride and slammed the door behind him Olivia was stricken by a sudden panic She had lost all fear of her husband as far as she herself was concerned He had become a mere offensive windbag She did not care whether he did or did not try to divorce her Even on the terms of so great a scandal it would be a cheap deliverance But Antony was another matter She could not bear that he should be ruined on her account It was intolerable not to be thought of She must find some way of preventing it She began to cudgel her brains for that way of preventing it but in vain She could devise no plan The more she considered the matter the worse it grew She could not bear to be associated in Antony s mind with disaster she desired most keenly to stand for everything that was pleasant and delightful in his life She would not let her brute of a husband spoil both their lives He had already spoiled enough of hers After his injunction to her to leave the Castle first thing next morning she took it that they would hardly dine together and told Elizabeth Twitcher to tell Wilkins to serve her dinner in her boudoir Also she refused to put on an evening gown saying that the peignoir she was wearing was more comfortable on such a hot night Last of all she told her to pack some of her clothes that night Elizabeth Twitcher stirred somewhat out of her brooding on her own troubles by this trouble of her mistress looked at her thoughtfully and said I shouldn t go m lady It ll look as if you agreed with what his lordship said And it s only William Roper as has been telling these lies He asked to see his lordship about something very partic ler before his lordship went out And who s going to pay any heed to William Roper William Roper Who is William Roper What kind of a man is he said Olivia quickly He s an under gamekeeper m lady and the biggest little beast on the estate Everybody hates William Roper said Elizabeth with conviction This was satisfactory as far as it went The worse her husband s evidence was the freer it left her to take her own course of action But it was no great comfort for she was but little concerned about the harm he could do her Indeed she was only concerned about the harm he could do Antony She returned to her search for a method of preventing that harm during her dinner and after her dinner she continued that search without any success This injury to Antony for her the central fact of the situation weighed on her spirit more and more heavily The longer she pondered it the more harassed she grew The most fantastic schemes for baulking her husband and saving Antony came thronging into her mind She rose and walked restlessly up and down the room working herself up into a veritable fever mister Manley having dealt with the letters which had come by the five o clock post read half a dozen chapters of the last published novel of Artzybachev with the pleasure he never failed to draw from the works of that author Then he dressed and set forth in a very cheerful spirit to dine with Helena Truslove His cheerful expectations were wholly fulfilled She had divined that he was endowed not only with a romantic spirit but with a hearty and discriminating appetite and was careful to give him good food and wine and plenty of both With his coffee he smoked one of Lord Loudwater s favourite cigars Expanding naturally he talked with spirit and intelligence during dinner and made love to her after dinner with even more spirit and intelligence As a rule he stayed on the nights he dined with her till a quarter to eleven But that night she dismissed him at ten o clock saying that she was feeling tired and wished to go to bed early Smoking another of Lord Loudwater s favourite cigars he walked briskly back to the Castle more firmly convinced than ever that every possible step must be taken to prevent any diminution of the income of a woman of such excellent taste in food and wine It would be little short of a crime to discourage the exercise of her fine natural gift for stimulating the genius of a promising dramatist He was not in the habit of going to bed early and having put on slippers and an old and comfortable coat he once more turned to the novel by Artzybachev He read two more chapters smoking a pipe and then he became aware that he was thirsty He could have mixed himself a whisky and soda then and there for he had both in the cupboard in his sitting room But he was a stickler for the proprieties he had drunk red wine Burgundy with his dinner and port after it and after red wine brandy is the proper spirit There would be brandy in the tantalus in the small dining room He went quietly down the stairs The big hall lighted by a single electric bulb was very dim and he took it that as was their habit the servants had already gone to bed As he came to the bottom of the stairs the door at the back of the hall opened James Hutchings came through the doorway and shut the door quietly behind him mister Manley stood still James Hutchings came very quietly down the hall saw him and started Good evening Hutchings I thought you d left us said mister Manley in a rather unpleasant tone You may take your oath to it said James Hutchings truculently in a much more unpleasant tone than mister Manley had used I just came back to get a box of cigarettes I left in the cupboard of my pantry I don t want any help in smoking them from any one here He opened the library door gently went quietly through it and drew it to behind him leaving mister Manley frowning at it It was a fact that Hutchings carried a packet which might very well have been cigarettes but mister Manley did not believe his story of his errand He took it that he was leaving the Castle by one of the library windows Well it was no business of his At a few minutes past eight the next morning he was roused from the deep dreamless sleep which follows good food and good wine well digested by a loud knocking on his door It was not the loud steady and prolonged knocking which the third housemaid found necessary to wake him It was more vigorous and more staccato and jerkier Also a voice was calling loudly mister Manley sir mister Manley mister Manley For all the noise and insistence of the calling mister Manley did not awake quickly It took him a good minute to realize that he was Herbert Manley and in bed and half a minute longer to gather that the knocking and calling were unusual and uncommonly urgent He sat up in bed and yawned terrifically Then he slipped out of bed the knocking and calling still continued unlocked the door and found Holloway the second footman on the threshold looking scared and horror stricken Please sir his lordship s dead he cried He s bin murdered Stabbed through the eart CHAPTER V Murdered Lord Loudwater said mister Manley with another terrific yawn and he rubbed his eyes Then he awoke completely and said Send a groom for Black the constable at once Yes and tell Wilkins to telephone the news to the Chief Inspector at Low Wycombe Hurry up I ll get dressed and be down in a few minutes Hurry up Holloway turned to go Stop said mister Manley Tell Wilkins to see that no one disturbs Lady Loudwater I ll break the news myself when she is dressed Yes sir said Holloway and ran down the corridor mister Manley was much quicker than usual making his toilet but thorough He foresaw a hard and trying day before him and he wished to start it fresh and clean He would come into contact with new people he saw himself playing an important role in a most important affair he would naturally and as usual make himself valued A slovenly air did not conduce to that It seemed fitting to put on his darkest tweed suit and a black necktie When he came briskly for him downstairs he found a group of women servants in the hall outside the door of the smoking room three of them snivelling and Wilkins and Holloway in the smoking room itself standing and staring with a wholly helpless air at the body of Lord Loudwater huddled in the easy chair in which he had been wont to sleep after dinner every evening He s been stabbed sir There s that knife which was in the inkstand on the library table stickin in is eart said Wilkins in a dismal voice mister Manley glanced at the dead man He looked to have been stabbed as he slept His body had sagged down in the chair and his head was sunk between his shoulders so that he appeared almost neckless His once so florid face was of an even dead yellowish pallor mister Manley s glance at the dead man was brief Then he saw that the door between the smoking room and the library was ajar He could not see the library windows without crossing the smoking room That he would not do He was a stickler for correctness in all matters and he knew that the scene of a crime must be left untrampled He turned and said We will leave everything just as it is till the police come And telephone at once to Doctor Thornhill and ask him to come If he is out tell them to get word to him Wilkins Wilkins and Holloway filed out of the room before him he followed them out locked the door and put the key in his pocket Then he opened the door from the hall into the library The long window nearest the smoking room door was open The group of servants were all watching him never had he moved or acted with an air of graver or greater importance His portliness gave it weight Has any of you opened the windows of the library this morning he said No one answered Then missus Carruthers the housekeeper said Clarke does the library every morning Have you done it this morning Clarke No mum I hadn t finished the green droring room when mister Holloway brought the sad news said one of the housemaids mister Manley locked the library door and put that key also in his pocket Then he said in a tone of authority I think missus Carruthers that the sooner we all have breakfast the better I for one am going to have a hard day and I shall need all my strength We all shall Certainly mister Manley You re quite right We shall all need our strength You shall have your breakfast at once I ll have it sent to the little dining room You would like to be on the spot Come along girls Wilkins and you Holloway get on with your work as quickly as you can said missus Carruthers driving her flock before her towards the servants quarters Thank you And will you see that no one wakes Lady Loudwater before her usual hour or tells her what has happened I will tell her myself and try to break the news with as little of a shock as possible said mister Manley Twitcher hasn t bin downstairs yet She doesn t know anything about it said one of the maids Send her straight to me to the terrace when she does come down said mister Manley walking towards the hall door He felt that after the sight of the dead man s face the fresh morning air would do him good There came a sudden burst of excited chatter from the women as they passed beyond the door into the back of the Castle All their tongues seemed to be loosed at once mister Manley went out of the Castle door crossed the drive and walked up and down the lawn He took long breaths through his nostrils the sight of the dead man s yellowish face had been unpleasant indeed to a man of his sensibility In about five minutes Elizabeth Twitcher came out of the big door and across the lawn to him She was looking startled and scared missus Carruthers said you wished to speak to me sir she said quickly Yes I propose to break the news of this very shocking affair to Lady Loudwater myself She s rather fragile I fancy And I think that it needs doing with the greatest possible tact so as to lessen the shock said mister Manley in an impressive voice Elizabeth Twitcher gazed at him with a growing suspicion in her eyes Then she said It isn t it isn t a trap A trap What kind of a trap What on earth do you mean said mister Manley in a not unnatural bewilderment at the odd suggestion You might be trying to take her off her guard said Elizabeth Twitcher in a tone of deep suspicion Her guard against what said mister Manley still bewildered Elizabeth s Twitcher s eyes lost some of their suspicion and he heard her breathe a faint sigh of relief I thought as ow as how some of them might have told you what his lordship was going to do to her and that she she stuck that knife into him so as to stop it she said What on earth are you talking about What was his lordship going to do to her cried mister Manley in a tone of yet greater bewilderment He was going to divorce her ladyship He told her so last night when I was doing her hair for dinner said Elizabeth Twitcher She paused and stared at him frowning Then she went on And like a fool I went and talked about it to some one else mister Manley glared at her in a momentary speechlessness then found his voice and cried But gracious heavens You don t suspect her ladyship of having murdered Lord Loudwater No I don t But there ll be plenty as will said Elizabeth Twitcher with conviction It s absurd cried mister Manley Elizabeth Twitcher shook her head You must allow as she had reason enough for a lady that is He was always swearing at her and abusing her and it isn t at all the kind of thing a lady can stand And this divorce coming on the top of it all she said in a dispassionate tone You mustn t talk like this There s no saying what trouble you may make cried mister Manley in a tone of stern severity I m not going to talk like that only to you sir You re a gentleman and it s safe What I m afraid of is that I ve talked too much already last night that is she said despondently Well don t make it worse by talking any more And let me know when your mistress is dressed and I ll come up and break the news of this shocking affair to her Very good sir said Elizabeth and with a gloomy face and depressed air she went back into the Castle She had scarcely disappeared when Holloway came out to tell mister Manley that his breakfast was ready for him in the little dining room mister Manley set about it with the firmness of a man preparing himself against a strenuous day The frown with which Elizabeth Twitcher s suggestion had puckered his brow faded from it slowly as the excellence of the chop he was eating soothed him Holloway waited on him and mister Manley asked him whether any of the servants had heard anything suspicious in the night Holloway assured him that none of them had mister Manley had just helped himself a second time to eggs and bacon when Wilkins brought in Robert Black the village constable mister Manley had seen him in the village often enough a portly grave man who regarded his position and work with the proper official seriousness mister Manley told him that he had locked the door of the smoking room and of the library in order that the scene of the crime might be left undisturbed for examination by the Low Wycombe police Robert Black did not appear pleased by this precaution He would have liked to demonstrate his importance by making some preliminary investigations himself mister Manley did not offer to hand the keys over to him He intended to have the credit of the precautions he had taken with the constable s superiors He said I suppose you would like to question the servants to begin with Take the constable to the servants hall give him a glass of beer and let him get to work Wilkins He spoke in the imperative tone proper to a man in charge of such an important affair and Robert Black went mister Manley could not see that the grave fellow could do any harm by his questions or for that matter any good He finished his breakfast and lighted his pipe Elizabeth Twitcher came to tell him that Lady Loudwater was dressed He told her to tell her that he would like to see her and followed her up the stairs The maid went into Lady Loudwater s sitting room came out and ushered him into it His strong sense of the fitness of things caused him to enter the room slowly with an air grave to solemnity Olivia greeted him with a faint rather forced smile He thought that she was paler than usual and lacked something of her wonted charm She seemed rather nervous She thought that he had come from her husband with an unpleasant and probably most insulting message He cleared his throat and said in the deep grave voice he felt appropriate I ve come on a very painful errand Lady Loudwater a very painful errand Indeed she said and looked at him with uneasy anxious eyes I m sorry to tell you that Lord Loudwater has had an accident a very bad accident he said An accident Egbert she cried in a tone of surprise that sounded genuine enough It gave mister Manley to understand that she had expected some other kind of painful communication doubtless about the divorce Lord Loudwater had threatened But he had composed a series of phrases leading up by a nice gradation to the final announcement and he went on Yes There is very little likelihood of his recovering from it Olivia looked at him queerly hesitating Then she said Do you mean that he s going to be a cripple for life I mean that he will not live to be a cripple said mister Manley pleased to insert a further phrase into his series Is it as bad as that she said in a tone which again gave mister Manley the impression that she was thinking of something else and had not realized the seriousness of his words I m sorry to say that it s worse than that Lord Loudwater is dead he said in his deepest most sympathetic voice Dead she said in a shocked tone which sounded to him rather forced Murdered he said Murdered cried Olivia and mister Manley had the feeling that there was less surprise than relief in her tone I have sent for doctor Thornhill and the police from Low Wycombe he said They ought to have been here before this And I am going to telegraph to Lord Loudwater s solicitors You would like to have their help as soon as possible I suppose There seems nothing else to be done at the moment Then you don t know who did it said Olivia Her tone did not display a very lively interest in the matter or any great dismay and mister Manley felt somewhat disappointed He had expected much more emotion from her than she was displaying even though the death of her ill tempered husband must be a considerable relief He had expected her to be shocked and horror stricken at first before she realized that she had been relieved of a painful burden But she seemed to him to be really less moved by the murder of her husband than she would have been had the Lord Loudwater carried out his not infrequent threat of shooting or hanging or drowning the cat Melchisidec No one so far seems to be able to throw any light at all on the crime said mister Manley Olivia frowned thoughtfully but seemed to have no more to say on the matter Well then I ll telegraph to Paley and Carrington and ask mister Carrington to come down said mister Manley Please said Olivia mister Manley hesitated then he said And I suppose that I d better be getting some one to make arrangements about the funeral Please do everything you think necessary said Olivia In fact you d better manage everything till mister Carrington comes A man is much better at arranging important matters like this than a woman You may rely on me said mister Manley with a reassuring air and greatly pleased by this recognition of his capacity And allow me to assure you of my sincerest sympathy Thank you said Olivia and then with more animation and interest she added And I suppose I shall want some black clothes Shall I write to your dressmaker said mister Manley No thank you I shall be able to tell her what I want better myself mister Manley withdrew in a pleasant temper It was true that as a student of dramatic emotion he had been disappointed by the calmness with which Olivia had received the news of the murder but she had instructed him to do everything he thought fit He saw his way to controlling the situation and ruling the Castle till some one with a better right should supersede him He was halfway along the corridor before he realized that Olivia had asked no single question about the circumstance of the crime Indifference could go no further But he paused considering was it indifference Could she could she have known already As he came down the stairs Wilkins opened the door of the big hall and a man of medium height wearing a tweed suit and carrying a soft hat and a heavy malacca cane entered briskly He looked about thirty On his heels came a tall thin police inspector in uniform mister Manley came forward and the man in the tweed suit said My name is Flexen George Flexen I m acting as Chief Constable Major Arbuthnot is away for a month I happened to be at the police station at Low Wycombe when your news came and I thought it best to come myself This is Inspector Perkins mister Manley introduced himself as the secretary of the murdered man and with an air of quiet importance told mister Flexen that Lady Loudwater had put him in charge of the Castle till her lawyer came Then he took the keys of the smoking room and the library door from his pocket and said I locked up the room in which the dead body is and the library through which there is also access to it leaving everything just as it was when the body was found I do not think that any traces which the criminal has left if that is he has left any can have been obliterated He spoke with the quiet pride of a man who has done the right thing in an emergency That s good said mister Flexen in a tone of warm approval It isn t often that we get a clear start like that We ll examine these rooms at once mister Manley went to the door of the smoking room and was about to unlock it when doctor Thornhill a big bluff man of fifty five bustled in mister Manley introduced him to mister Flexen then he unlocked the door and opened it The doctor was leading the way into the smoking room when mister Flexen stepped smartly in front of him and said Please stay outside all of you I ll make the examination myself first He spoke quietly but in the tone of a man used to command But for anything we know his lordship may still be alive said doctor Thornhill in a somewhat blustering tone and pushing forward As his medical adviser it s my duty to make sure at once I ll tell you whether Lord Loudwater is alive or not Don t let any one cross the threshold Perkins said mister Flexen with quiet decision Perkins laid a hand on the doctor s arm and the doctor said A nice way of doing things Arbuthnot would have given his first attention to his lordship I m going to said mister Flexen quietly He went to the dead man looked in his pale face lifted his hand let it fall and said Been dead hours Then he examined carefully the position of the knife He was more than a minute over it Then he drew it gingerly from the wound by the ring at the end of it It was one of these Swedish knives the blades of which are slipped into the handle when they are not being used I think that s the knife that lay open in the big ink stand in the library We used it as a paper knife and to cut string with said mister Manley who was watching him with most careful attention It may have some evidence on the handle said mister Flexen still holding it by the ring and he drove the point of it into the pad of blotting paper on which mister Manley had been wont to write letters at the murdered man s dictation And how am I to tell whether the wound was self inflicted or not cried the doctor in an aggrieved tone If you will get some of the servants you can remove the body to any room convenient and make your examination It s a clean stab into the heart and it looks to me as if the person who used that knife had some knowledge of anatomy Most people who strike for the heart get the middle of the left lung said mister Flexen So saying he gently drew the easy chair in which the body was huddled nearer the door by its back mister Manley bade Holloway fetch Wilkins and two of the grooms and then eager for hints of the actions of a detective so useful to a dramatist gave all his attention again to the proceedings of mister Flexen who was down on one knee on the spot in which the chair had stood studying the carpet round it He rose and walked slowly towards the door which opened into the library paused on the threshold to bid Perkins examine the chair and the clothes of the murdered man and went into the library He was still in it when the footman and the grooms lifted the body of Lord Loudwater out of the chair and carried it up to his bedroom mister Manley stayed on the threshold of the smoking room His interest in the doings of mister Flexen forbade him leaving it to superintend decorously the removal of the body Presently mister Flexen came back and as he walked round the room examining the rest of it especially the carpet mister Manley studied the man himself the detective type He was about five feet eight broad shouldered out of proportion to that height but thin He had an uncommonly good forehead a square strong chin a hooked nose and thin set lips which gave him a rather predatory air belied rather by his pleasant blue eyes The sun wrinkles round their corners and his sallow complexion gave mister Manley the impression that he had spent some years in the tropics and suffered for it When mister Flexen had examined the room though Inspector Perkins had already done so he felt round the cushions of the easy chair in which Lord Loudwater had been stabbed found nothing and stood beside it in quiet thought Then he looked at mister Manley and said The murderer must have been some one with whom Lord Loudwater was so familiar that he took no notice of his or her movements for he came up to him from the front or walked round the chair to the front of him and stabbed him with a quite straightforward thrust Lord Loudwater should have actually seen the knife unless by any chance he was asleep He was sure to be asleep said mister Manley quickly He always did sleep in the evening generally from the time he finished his cigar till he went to bed I think he acquired the habit from coming back from hunting tired and sleepy Besides I came down for a drink between eleven and twelve and I m almost sure I heard him snore He snored like the devil Slept every evening did he That puts a different complexion on the business said mister Flexen The murderer need not have been any one with whom he was familiar No He need not But are you quite sure that the wound wasn t self inflicted that it wasn t a case of suicide said mister Manley No I m not and I don t think that that doctor what s his name Thornhill can be sure either But why should Lord Loudwater have committed suicide Well he had found out or thought he had found out something about Lady Loudwater and was threatening to start an action against her for divorce At least so her maid told me this morning And as he wholly lacked balance he might in a fury of jealousy have made away with himself said mister Manley thoughtfully Was he so fond of Lady Loudwater said mister Flexen in a somewhat doubtful tone He had heard stories about Lord Loudwater s treatment of his wife He didn t show any great fondness for her I m bound to say In fact he was always bullying her But he wouldn t need to be very fond of any one to go crazy with jealousy about her He was a man of strong passions and quite unbalanced I suppose he had been so utterly spoilt as a child a boy and a young man that he never acquired any power of self control at all M m I should have thought that in that case he d have been more likely to murder the man said mister Flexen He was said mister Manley in ready agreement But the other s always possible Yes one has to bear every possibility in mind said mister Flexen I ve heard that he was a bad tempered man He was the most unpleasant brute I ever came across in my life said mister Manley with heartfelt conviction Then he had enemies said mister Flexen Scores I should think But of course I don t know Only I can t conceive his having had a friend said mister Manley in a tone of some bitterness Then it s certainly a case with possibilities said mister Flexen in a pleased tone But I expect that the solution will be quite simple It generally is He said it rather sadly as if he would have much preferred the solution to be difficult Let s hope so A big newspaper fuss will be detestable for Lady Loudwater She s a charming creature said mister Manley So I ve heard Do you know who the man was that Loudwater was making a fuss about I haven t the slightest idea Probably the maid Elizabeth Twitcher will be able to tell you said mister Manley mister Flexen walked across the room and drew the knife out of the pad of blotting paper by the ring in its handle and studied it I suppose this is the knife that was in the library They re pretty common he said mister Manley came to him looked at it earnestly and said That s it all right I tried to sharpen it a day or two ago so that it would sharpen a pencil I generally leave my penknife in the waist coat I m not wearing But I couldn t get it sharp enough It s rotten steel All of them are but good enough for a stab said mister Flexen CHAPTER VI Olivia had very little appetite for breakfast It is to be doubted indeed whether she was aware of what she was eating Elizabeth Twitcher hovered about her solicitous pressing her to eat more She was fond of her mistress and very uneasy lest she should have harmed her seriously by her careless gossiping the night before But she was surprised by the exceedingly anxious and worried expression which dwelt on Olivia s face Her air grew more and more harassed The murder of her husband had doubtless been a shock but he had been such a husband Elizabeth Twitcher had expected her mistress to cry a little about his death and then grow serene as she realized what a good riddance it was But Olivia had not cried and she showed no likelihood whatever of becoming serene At the end of her short breakfast she lit a cigarette and began to pace up and down her sitting room with a jerky nervous gait quite unlike her wonted graceful easy swinging walk She had to relight her cigarette and as she did so Elizabeth Twitcher who was clearing away the breakfast perceived that her hands were shaking There was plainly more in the matter than Elizabeth Twitcher had supposed and she wondered growing more and more uneasy When she went downstairs with the tray she learned that doctor Thornhill was examining the wound which had caused the Lord Loudwater s death and that mister Flexen and Inspector Perkins were questioning Wilkins Talking to the other servants she found of a sudden that she had reason for anxiety herself and hurried back in a panic to her mistress s boudoir She found Olivia still walking nervously up and down The inspector and the gentleman who is acting Chief Constable are questioning the servants m lady said Elizabeth Olivia stopped short and stared at her with rather scared eyes Then she said sharply Go down and learn what the servants have told them all the servants everything Her mistress s plainly greater anxiety eased a little Elizabeth Twitcher s own panic in the matter of James Hutchings and she went down again to the servants quarters mister Flexen and Inspector Perkins learnt nothing of importance from Wilkins but he made it clearer to mister Flexen that the temper of the murdered man had indeed been abominable Holloway on the other hand proved far more enlightening From him they learnt that Hatchings had been discharged the day before without notice and that he had uttered violent threats against his employer before he went Also they learnt that Hatchings who had left about four o clock in the afternoon had come back to the Castle at night Jane Pittaway an under house maid had heard him talking to Elizabeth Twitcher in the blue drawing room between eleven and half past mister Flexen questioned Holloway at length and learned that James Hatchings was a man of uncommonly violent temper that it had been a matter of debate in the servants hall whether his furies or those of their dead master were the worse Then he dismissed Holloway and sent for Jane Pittaway A small sharp eyed sharp featured young woman she was quite clear in her story About eleven the night before she had gone into the great hall to bring away two vases full of flowers to be emptied and washed next morning and coming past the door of the blue drawing room had heard voices She had listened and recognized the voices of Hutchings and Elizabeth Twitcher No she had not heard what they were saying The door was too thick But he seemed to be arguing with her Yes she had been surprised to find him in the house after he had gone off like that Besides everybody thought that he had jilted Elizabeth Twitcher and was keeping company with Mabel Evans who had come home on a holiday from her place in London to her mother s in the village No she did not know how long he stayed She minded her own business but if any one asked her she must say that he was more likely to murder some one than any one she knew for he had a worse temper than his lordship even and bullied every one he came near worse than his lordship In fact she had never been able to understand how Elizabeth Twitcher could stand him though of course every one knew that Elizabeth could always give as good as she got When mister Flexen thanked her and said that she might go she displayed a desire to remain and give them her further views on the matter But Inspector Perkins shooed her out of the room Then Wilkins came to say that doctor Thornhill had finished his examination and would like to see them He came in with a somewhat dissatisfied air sat down heavily in the chair the inspector pushed forward for him and said in a dissatisfied tone The blade pierced the left ventricle about the middle a good inch and a half Death was practically instantaneous of course I took it that it must have been The collapse had been so complete I suppose the blade stopped the heart dead said mister Flexen Absolutely dead said the doctor But the thing is that I can t swear to it that the wound was not self inflicted Knowing Lord Loudwater I could swear to it morally There isn t the ghost of a chance that he took his own life But physically his right hand might have driven that blade into his heart I thought so myself though of course I m no expert said mister Flexen And I agree with you when you say that you are morally certain that the wound was not self inflicted Those bad tempered brutes may murder other people but themselves never Well I ve not your experience in crime but I should say that you were right said the doctor All the same the fact that you cannot swear that the wound was not self inflicted will be of great help to the murderer unless we get an absolute case against him said mister Flexen Well I m sure I hope you will Lord Loudwater had a bad temper an infernal temper in fact But that s no excuse for murdering him said doctor Thornhill None whatever said mister Flexen What about the inquest I suppose we d better have it as soon as possible Yes Tomorrow morning if you can said the doctor rising Very good Send word to the coroner at once Perkins Don t go yourself I shall want you here said mister Flexen He shook hands with the doctor and bade him good day As Inspector Perkins went out of the room to send word to the coroner he bade him send Elizabeth Twitcher to him She was not long coming for in obedience to Olivia s injunction she was engaged in learning what the other servants knew or thought they knew about the murder When she came into the dining room mister Flexen s keen eyes examined her with greater care than he had given to the other servants On Jane Pittaway s showing she should prove an important witness Now Elizabeth Twitcher was an uncommonly pretty girl dark eyed and dark haired and her forehead and chin and the way her eyes were set in her head showed considerable character mister Flexen made up his mind on the instant that he was going to learn from Elizabeth Twitcher exactly what Elizabeth Twitcher thought fit to tell him and no more for all that he perceived that she was badly scared He did not beat about the bush he said You had a conversation with James Hutchings last night about eleven o clock in the blue drawing room Did you let him in Elizabeth Twitcher s cheeks lost some more of their colour while he was speaking and her eyes grew more scared She hesitated for a moment then she said Yes I let him in at the side door He had not missed her hesitation he was sure that she was not telling the truth How did you know he was at the side door he said She hesitated again Then she said He whistled to me under my window just as I was going to bed Again he did not believe her Did you let him out of the Castle he said No I didn t He let himself out she said quickly Out of the side door How else would he go out she snapped You don t know that he went out by the side door said mister Flexen Elizabeth hesitated again Then she said sullenly No I don t I left him in the blue drawing room In a very bad temper said mister Flexen I don t know what kind of a temper he was in she said mister Flexen paused looking at her thoughtfully Then he said I m told that you and he were engaged to be married and that he broke the engagement off I broke it off said Elizabeth angrily and she drew herself up very stiff and frowning It was mister Flexen s turn to hesitate Then he made a shot and said I see He wanted you to become engaged to him again and you wouldn t Elizabeth looked at him with an air of surprise and respect and said It wasn t quite like that sir I didn t say as I wouldn t be his fioncy again I said I d see how he behaved himself Then he wasn t in a good temper said mister Flexen He was in a better temper than he d any right to expect to be said Elizabeth with some heat That s true said mister Flexen smiling at her But after the trouble he had had with Lord Loudwater he couldn t be in a very good temper He was too used to his lordship s tantrums to take much notice of them He was too much that way himself said Elizabeth quickly I see said mister Flexen What time was it when he left you I can t rightly say But it wasn t half past eleven she said He perceived that that was true At the moment there was no more to be learned from her If she could throw any more light on the doings of James Hutchings she was on her guard and would not But he had learned that James Hutchings had not entered the Castle by the side door Had he entered it and left it by the library window He asked Elizabeth a few more unimportant questions and dismissed her Inspector Perkins having sent a groom to inform the coroner of the murder and of the need for an early inquest into it came back to him They discussed the matter of James Hutchings and decided to have him watched and arrest him on suspicion should he try to leave the neighbourhood The inspector telephoned to Low Wycombe for two of his detectives mister Flexen questioned the rest of the servants and learned nothing new from them By the time he had finished the two detectives from Low Wycombe arrived and he sent them out to make inquiries in the village though he thought it unlikely that anything was to be learnt there unless Hutchings had been talking again He had risen and was about to go to the smoking room to look round it again on the chance that something had escaped his eye when missus Carruthers the housekeeper entered the room None of the servants had mentioned her to him and it had not occurred to him that there would of course be a housekeeper Good morning mister Flexen I m missus Carruthers the housekeeper she said You didn t send for me But I thought I ought to see you for I know something which may be important and I thought you ought to know it too Of course I can t know too much about an affair like this said mister Flexen quickly Well there was a woman or rather I should say a lady with his lordship in the smoking room last night about eleven o clock Indeed said mister Flexen Won t you sit down A lady you say Yes she was a lady though she seemed very angry and excited and was talking in a very high voice I didn t recognize it so I can t tell you who it was You see I don t belong to the neighbourhood I ve only been here six weeks And how long did this interview last said mister Flexen I can t tell you It was no business of mine I was making my round last thing to see that the servants had left nothing about I always do You know how careless they are I went round the hall and then I went to bed But of course I wondered about it said missus Carruthers mister Flexen looked at her refined rather delicate face and he did not wonder how she had repressed her natural curiosity Can you tell me whether the French window in the library the end one was open at that time he said I can t she said in a tone of regret I couldn t very well open the library door If the door between the library and the smoking room was open I should have been certain to hear something that was not meant for my ears And it generally is open in summer time But I should think it very likely that the lady came in by that window It s always open in summer time In fact his lordship always went out into the garden through it going from his smoking room And what time was it that you heard this he said A few minutes past eleven I looked round the drawing room and the two dining rooms and it was a quarter past eleven when I came into my room That s the first exact time I ve got from any one yet said mister Flexen in a tone of satisfaction And that s all you heard She hesitated and a look of distress came over her face Then she said You have questioned Elizabeth Twitcher Did she tell you anything about his lordship s last quarrel with her ladyship She did not said mister Flexen mister Manley told me that she had told him about the quarrel But I did not question her about it I left it till later missus Carruthers hesitated then she said It s so difficult to see what one s duty is in a case like this Well one s obvious duty is to make no secret of anything that may throw a light on the crime Was it anything out of the way in the way of quarrels Wasn t Lord Loudwater always quarrelling with Lady Loudwater I ve been told that he was always insulting and bullying her Well this one was rather out of the common said missus Carruthers reluctantly He accused her of having kissed Colonel Grey in the East wood and declared that he would divorce her It was Colonel Grey was it said mister Flexen That is what Elizabeth Twitcher told me after supper last night It seems that his lordship burst in upon them when she was dressing her ladyship s hair for dinner and blurted it out before her I ve no doubt she was telling the truth Twitcher is a truthful girl Moderately truthful said mister Flexen in a somewhat ironical tone Of course she may have exaggerated Servants do said missus Carruthers And how did Lady Loudwater take it said mister Flexen Twitcher said that she denied everything and did not appear at all upset about it Of course she was used to Lord Loudwater s making scenes He had a most dreadful temper M m said mister Flexen and he played a tune on the table with his finger tips frowning thoughtfully Was Colonel Grey I suppose it is Colonel Antony Grey the V C who has been staying down here Yes said missus Carruthers He s at the Cart and Horses at Bellingham Was he on good terms with Lord Loudwater They were quite friendly up to about a fortnight ago The Colonel used to play billiards with his lordship and stay on to dinner two or three times a week Then they had a quarrel about the way his lordship treated her ladyship Holloway the footman heard it and the Colonel told his lordship that he was a cad and a blackguard and he hasn t been here since But he met Lady Loudwater in the wood So his lordship declared said missus Carruthers in a non committal tone Do you know how Lord Loudwater came to hear of their meeting Twitcher said that he must have had it from one of the under gamekeepers a young fellow called William Roper Roper asked to see his lordship that evening and was very mysterious about his errand so that it looks as if she might be right None of the servants ever went near his lordship if they could help it It had to be something very important to induce William Roper to go to him of his own accord I see said mister Flexen thoughtfully Well I m glad you told me about this Do you suppose that this Twitcher girl has talked to any one but you about it That I can t say at all But she has a bedroom to herself said missus Carruthers Besides if she had talked to any of the others they would have told you about it Yes there is that I think it would be a good thing if you were to give her a hint to keep it to herself It may have no bearing whatever on the crime It s not probable that it has But it s the kind of thing to set people talking and do both Lady Loudwater and Colonel Grey a lot of harm I will give her a hint at once said missus Carruthers rising But the unfortunate thing is that if Twitcher doesn t talk this young fellow Roper will And really Lord Loudwater gave her ladyship quite enough trouble and unhappiness when he was alive without giving her more now that he s dead I may be able to induce William Roper to hold his tongue said mister Flexen dryly Certainly his talking cannot do any good in any case And I have gathered that Lady Loudwater has suffered quite enough already from her husband I m sure she has and I do hope you will be able to keep that young man quiet said missus Carruthers moving towards the door As she opened it she paused and said Will you be here to lunch mister Flexen To lunch and probably all the afternoon He hesitated and added It would be rather an advantage if I could sleep here too I do not think that I shall need to look much further than the Castle for the solution of this problem though there s no telling At any rate I should like to have exhausted all the possibilities of the Castle before I leave it And if I m on the spot I shall probably exhaust them much more quickly Oh that can easily be arranged I ll see her ladyship about it at once said missus Carruthers quickly And would you ask her if she feels equal to seeing me yet Certainly mister Flexen and if she does I ll let you know at once she said and went through the door mister Flexen was considering the new facts she had given him when about three minutes later Inspector Perkins returned and mister Flexen bade him find William Roper and bring him to him without delay The inspector departed briskly He was not used to having the inquiry into a crime conducted by the Chief Constable himself but mister Flexen had impressed the conviction on him that it was work which he thoroughly understood Moreover he had been appointed acting Chief Constable of the district during the absence of Major Arbuthnot on the ground of his many years experience in the Indian Police Also the inspector realized that this was indeed an exceptional case worthy of the personal effort of any Chief Constable He could not remember a case of the murder of a peer they had always seemed to him a class immune from anything more serious than ordinary assault He was pleased that mister Flexen was conducting the inquiry himself for he did not wish Scotland Yard to deal with it Not only would that cast a slur on the capacity of the police of the district but he was sure that he himself would get much more credit for his work if he and mister Flexen were successful in discovering the murderer than he would get if a detective inspector from Scotland Yard were in charge of the case Such a detective inspector might or might not earn all the credit but he would certainly know how to get it and probably insist on having it He had not been gone a minute when Elizabeth Twitcher came into the dining room said that her ladyship would be pleased to see mister Flexen and led him upstairs to her sitting room He found Olivia paler than her wont but quite composed She had lost her nervous air for she had perceived very clearly that it would be dangerous indeed to display the anxiety which was harassing her It was only natural that she should appear upset by the shock but not that she should appear in any way fearful mister Flexen had been told that Lady Loudwater was pretty but he had not been prepared to find her as charming a creature as Olivia He made up his mind at once to do the best he could to save her from the trouble that the gossip about her and Colonel Grey would surely bring upon her if always he were satisfied that neither of them had a hand in the crime Looking at Olivia nothing seemed more unlikely than that she should be in any way connected with it But he preserved an open mind As such reasons go she was not without reasons substantial reasons for getting rid of her husband and she appeared to him to be a creature of sufficiently delicate sensibilities to feel that husband s brutality more than most women At the same time he found it hard to conceive of her using that fatal knife herself Yet the knife is most frequently the womanly weapon For her part Olivia liked his face but she had an uneasy feeling that he would go further than most men in solving any problem with which he set his mind to grapple They greeted one another he sat down in a chair facing the light though he would have preferred that Olivia should have faced it and expressed his concern at the trouble which had befallen her Then he said I came to see you Lady Loudwater in the hope that you might be able to throw some light on this deplorable event I don t think I can said Olivia gently But of course if I can do anything to help you find out about it I shall be very pleased to try She looked at him with steady candid eyes that deepened his feeling that she had had no hand in the crime And of course I ll make it as little distressing for you as I can he said Do you know whether your husband had anything worrying him any serious trouble of any kind which would make him likely to commit suicide Suicide Egbert cried Olivia in a tone of such astonishment that as far as mister Flexen was concerned the hypothesis of suicide received its death blow No I don t know of anything which would have made him commit suicide Of course he had no money troubles but were there any domestic troubles which might have unhinged his mind to that extent said mister Flexen He wished to be able to deal with the hypothesis of suicide should it be put forward Olivia did not answer immediately She was thinking hard The possibility that her husband had committed suicide or that any one could suppose that he had committed suicide had never entered her head She perceived however that it was a supposition worth encouraging At the same time she must not seem eager to encourage it But they told me that he d been murdered she said We cannot exclude any possibility from a matter like this and the possibility of suicide must be taken into account said mister Flexen quickly You don t know of any domestic trouble which might have induced Lord Loudwater to make an end of himself No I don t know of one said Olivia firmly But of course he was sometimes quite mad Mad said mister Flexen Yes quite I told him so last night just before dinner He was quite mad He said that I had kissed a friend of ours at least he was a friend of both of us till he quarrelled with my husband some weeks ago in the East wood He raged about it and declared he was going to start a divorce action But I didn t take much notice of it He was always falling into dreadful rages There was one at breakfast about my cat and another at lunch about the wine He fancied it was corked Olivia had perceived clearly that since Elizabeth Twitcher had been a witness of her husband s outburst about Grey it would be merely foolish not to be frank about it But the last matter was very much more serious than the matter of the cat or the wine said mister Flexen You don t think that your husband brooded on it for the rest of the evening and worked himself up into a dangerous frame of mind Olivia hesitated She was quite sure that her husband had done nothing of the kind for if he had worked himself up into a dangerous frame of mind he would assuredly have made some effort to get at her and give some violent expression to it But she said That I can t say I wish I d gone down to dinner now But I was too much annoyed I dined in my boudoir I d had quite enough unpleasantness for one day Perhaps one of the servants could tell you They may have noticed something unusual in him perhaps that he was brooding Wilkins did say that Lord Loudwater seemed upset at dinner and that he was frowning most of the meal said mister Flexen That wasn t unusual said Olivia somewhat pathetically Besides She stopped short on the very verge of saying that she was sure that those frowns cleared from her husband s face before the sweets for he would never take afternoon tea in order to have a better appetite for dinner and consequently was wont to begin that meal in a tetchy humour Such an explanation would have gone no way to support the hypothesis of suicide Instead of making it she said Of course he did seem frightfully upset But you don t think that he was sufficiently upset to do himself an injury said mister Flexen Olivia had formed a strong impression that her husband would not in any circumstance do himself an injury it was his part to injure others But she said I can t say He might have gone on working himself up all the evening I didn t see him after he left my dressing room It was there he made the row while I was dressing for dinner mister Flexen paused then he said mister Manley tells me that Lord Loudwater used to sleep every evening after dinner Do you think that he was too upset to go to sleep last night Oh dear no I ve known him go to sleep in his smoking room after a much worse row than that cried Olivia With you said mister Flexen quickly No with Hutchings the butler said Olivia But that wouldn t be such a serious matter not one to brood upon said mister Flexen I suppose not said Olivia readily mister Flexen paused again then he said in a somewhat reluctant tone There s another matter I must go into Have you any reason to believe that there was any other woman in Lord Loudwater s life anything in the nature of an intrigue It s not a pleasant question to have to ask but it s really important Oh I don t expect any pleasantness where Lord Loudwater is concerned said Olivia with a sudden almost petulant impatience for this inquisition was a much more severe strain on her than mister Flexen perceived Do you mean now or before we were married Now said mister Flexen I haven t the slightest idea said Olivia Do you think it likely said mister Flexen No I don t not very I don t see how he could have got another woman in He was always about always Of course he rode a good deal though He did did he said mister Flexen quickly Every afternoon and most mornings That was important mister Flexen thought that he might not have to go very far afield to find the woman who had been quarrelling with Lord Loudwater at a few minutes past eleven the night before She probably lived within an easy ride of the Castle I m very much obliged to you for helping me so readily in such distressing circumstances he said in a grateful voice as he rose If anything further occurs to you that may throw any light on the matter you might let me hear it with as little delay as possible I will said Olivia By the way missus Carruthers told me that you would like to stay here while you were making your inquiry please do and please make any use of the servants and the cars you like My husband s heir is still in Mesopotamia and I expect that I shall have to run the Castle till he comes back Thank you To stay here will be very convenient and useful said mister Flexen gratefully and left her He came down the stairs thoughtfully It seemed to him quite unlikely that she had had anything to do with the crime or knew anything more about it than she had told him Nevertheless there was this business of Colonel Grey and her murdered husband s threat to divorce her They must be borne in mind He would have been surprised intrigued and somewhat shaken in his conviction that she had been in no way connected with the murder had he heard the gasp of intense relief which burst from Olivia s lips when the door closed behind him and seen her huddle up in her chair and begin to cry weakly in the reaction from the strain of his inquisition CHAPTER VII mister Flexen found Inspector Perkins waiting for him in the dining room with the information that James Hutchings was at his father s cottage in the West wood and that he had set one of his detectives to watch him Also he told him that he had learned that Hutchings was generally disliked in the village as well as at the Castle as a violent bad tempered man with a habit of fixing quarrels on any one who would quarrel with him and as often as not on mild and inoffensive persons quite incapable of bearing themselves in a quarrel with any unpleasant effectiveness mister Flexen discussed with the inspector the question of taking out a warrant for the arrest of Hutchings and they decided that there was no need to take the step at any rate at the moment it was enough to have him watched He would learn doubtless that it was known that he had been in the Castle late the night before If on learning it he took fright and bolted it would rather simplify the case Then mister Flexen sent again for Elizabeth Twitcher and questioned her at length about Lord Loudwater s onslaught on Lady Loudwater the night before and about the condition in which he had been at the end of it Elizabeth was somewhat sulky in her manner for she felt that she was to blame for that onslaught having come to mister Flexen s ears She was the more careful to make it plain that however violently Lord Loudwater may have been affected Olivia had taken the business lightly enough and decided to ignore his injunction to her to leave the Castle mister Flexen did not miss the point that Lord Loudwater had threatened to hound Colonel Grey out of the Army but at the moment he did not attach importance to it It was the kind of threat that an angry man would be pretty sure to make in the circumstances Having dismissed Elizabeth Twitcher he came to lunch with the impression strong on him that he had made as much progress as could be expected in one morning towards the solution of the problem He was quite undecided whether Hutchings presence in the Castle at so late an hour and the probability that he had entered and left it by the library window or the matter of the woman who had had the stormy interview with the murdered man was the more important It must be his early task to discover who that woman was He found mister Manley awaiting him in the little dining room ready to play host Over their soup and fish they talked about ordinary topics and a little about themselves mister Manley learned that mister Flexen had been in the Indian Police for over seven years and had been forced to resign his post by the breaking down of his health that during the war he had twice acted as Chief Constable and three times as stipendiary magistrate in different districts mister Flexen gathered that mister Manley had fought in France with a brilliant intrepidity which had not met with the public recognition it deserved and learned that he had been invalided out of the Army owing to the weakness of his heart This common failure of health was a bond of sympathy between them and made them well disposed to one another There came a pause in this personal talk and either of them addressed himself to the consumption of the wing of a chicken with a certain absorption in the occupation It was not uncharacteristic of mister Manley that his high sense of the fitness of things had not prevailed on him to accord the liver wing to the guest He was firmly eating it himself Then mister Flexen said I suppose you came across Hutchings the butler pretty often What kind of a fellow was he He was rather more like his master than if he had been his twin brother except that he wore whiskers and not a beard said mister Manley in a tone of hearty dislike He does not appear to have been at all popular with the other servants said mister Flexen He certainly wasn t popular with me said mister Manley dryly What did Lord Loudwater discharge him for A matter of a commission on the purchase of some wine said mister Manley Then in a more earnest tone he added Look here the trenches knock a good deal of the nonsense out of one and I tell you frankly that if I could help you in any way to discover the criminal I wouldn t My feeling is that if ever any one wanted putting out of the way Lord Loudwater did and as he was put out of the way quite painlessly probably it was a valuble action whatever its motive I expect that a good many people have come back from the trenches with very different ideas about justice said mister Flexen in an indulgent tone The Indian Police also changes your ideas about it But it s my duty to see that justice is done and I shall Besides I m very keen on solving this problem if I can It seems that Hutchings was in the Castle last night about eleven o clock and as you said something about coming down for a drink about that time I thought you might possibly know something about his movements Well as it happens said mister Manley and stopped short paused and went on You seem to have made up your mind that it was a murder and not a suicide So you do know something about the movements of Hutchings said mister Flexen smiling You ll be subpoenaed you know if he is charged with the murder That would of course be quite a different matter said mister Manley gravely As to its being a murder I ve pretty well made up my mind that it was said mister Flexen mister Manley looked at him gravely You have have you he said Then he added About that knife and the finger prints on it if it happens to have recorded any I ve been thinking that you may find yourself suffering from an embarrassment of riches I know that mine will be on it and Lady Loudwater s who used it to cut the leaves of a volume of poetry the day before yesterday and Hutchings who cut the string of a parcel of books with it yesterday and very likely the fingerprints of Lord Loudwater You know how it is with a knife like that which lies open and handy Every one uses it I ve seen Lady Loudwater use it to cut flowers and Lord Loudwater to cut the end off a cigar cursing of course because he couldn t lay his hands on a cigar cutter and the knife was blunt and I ve cut all kinds of things with it myself Yes but the finger prints of the murderer if it does record them will be on the top of all those others I shall simply take prints from all of you and eliminate them Of course you can get at it that way said mister Manley They were silent while Holloway set the cheese straws on the table When he had left the room mister Flexen said in a casual tone You don t happen to know whether Lord Loudwater was mixed up with any woman in the neighbourhood mister Manley paused then laughed and said It s no use at all When I told you that I would throw no light on the matter if I could help it I really meant it At the same time I don t mind saying that with his reputation for brutality I should think it very unlikely You can never tell about women So many of them seem to prefer brutes And after all a peer is a peer said mister Flexen There is that said mister Manley in thoughtful agreement But he was frowning faintly as he cudgelled his brains in the effort to think what had set mister Flexen on the track of Helena Truslove for it must be Helena I expect I shall be able to find out from his lawyers said mister Flexen This promises to be interesting the intervention of Romance said mister Manley in a tone of livelier interest I took it that the murder if it was a murder would be a sordid business in keeping with Lord Loudwater himself But if you re going to introduce a lady into the case it promises to be more fruitful in interest for the dramatist I m writing plays But mister Flexen was not going to divulge the curious fact that about the time of his murder Lord Loudwater had had a violent quarrel with a lady He had no doubt that missus Carruthers would keep it to herself Oh one has to look out for every possible factor in a problem like this you know he said carelessly The faint frown lingered on mister Manley s brow mister Flexen supposed that it was the result of his refraining from gratifying his appetite for the dramatic They were silent a while When are you going to take our finger prints said mister Manley presently Not till I ve learned whether there are any on the handle of the knife said mister Flexen Perkins has already sent it off to Scotland Yard I never thought of that It would be rather a waste of time to take them before knowing that said mister Manley Holloway brought the coffee mister Manley gave mister Flexen an excellent cigar and they talked about the war mister Flexen drank his coffee quickly said that he must get back to his work and added that he hoped that he would enjoy the company of mister Manley at dinner mister Manley had been going to dine with Helena Truslove but after mister Flexen s question whether Lord Loudwater had been entangled with any woman in the neighbourhood he thought that he had better dine with him He might learn something useful if he could induce mister Flexen to expand under the relaxing influence of dinner He resolved to use his authority to have the most engaging wine the cellar held He was determined to make every endeavour to keep Helena s name out of the affair and he thought that he would succeed mister Flexen left him He finished his coffee the second cup slowly wondering about mister Flexen s question about Lord Loudwater and a woman Then since he had done all the work he could think of in the way of making arrangements for the funeral during the morning he set out briskly to Helena s house hoping that she would be able to throw some light on it He greeted her with his usual warmth and then when he came to look at her at his leisure it was plain to him that the murder had been a much greater shock to her than he had expected He was surprised at it for she had assured him that she had never been really in love with Lord Loudwater and he had believed her But there was no doubt that she had been greatly upset by the news of his death Her high colouring was dimmed she wore a harassed air and she was uncommonly nervous and ill at ease He thought it strange that she should be so deeply affected by the death of a man she had such good reason to detest But of course there was no telling how a woman would take anything Lady Loudwater s distress had fallen as far short of what he had expected as Helena s had exceeded it To mister Manley s credit it must be admitted that in less than twenty minutes Helena Truslove was looking another creature her face had recovered all its colour the harassed air had vanished from it and she was sitting on his knee in a condition of the most pleasant repose It was his theory that a woman was never too ill or too ill at ease or too unhappy to be made love to He had acted on it When he had thus restored her peace of mind he told her that mister Flexen had asked him whether the late Lord Loudwater had been mixed up with any lady in the neighbourhood and asked her if she could suggest any reason for his having asked the question She appeared greatly startled to hear of it But she could not suggest any reason for his having asked the question He then asked her about the manner in which the allowance had been paid to her and was pleased to learn that there was little likelihood of mister Flexen s learning that she had received such an allowance from Lord Loudwater for it had been paid her through a young lawyer of the name of Shepherd at Low Wycombe the lawyer who had dealt with the matter of the transference of the house they were in to her from the rents of some houses Lord Loudwater owned in that town and that lawyer was somewhere in Mesopotamia his practice in abeyance She was in entire accord with mister Manley about the advantage of her name not being connected in any way with the tragedy at the Castle She pointed out that it was also an advantage that she had just been paid her allowance for the present quarter and there would not be another payment for three months By that time it was probable that the murder would have passed out of people s minds and mister Flexen be busy with other work It seemed to mister Manley that mister Flexen would not easily learn about the allowance unless mister Carrington also knew it which seemed unlikely though it was always possible that there was some record of it among the Lord Loudwater s papers at the Castle Soon after seven he left her to walk back to dine with mister Flexen mister Flexen had had a considerable surprise that afternoon He had told Robert Black to find William Roper and bring him to him He wished to hear the story he had told Lord Loudwater the evening before for it might be of a triviality to make the hypothesis that Lord Loudwater had committed suicide yet less worthy of serious consideration Black was a long while finding William Roper for he was at work in the woods Indeed he had not yet heard that Lord Loudwater had been murdered for he had been up most of the night risen late got his own breakfast in his out of the way cottage in the depths of the West wood and gone out on his rounds The constable found him at the cottage in the act of preparing his dinner or rather his tea and dinner at a quarter to four William Roper was startled indeed to hear of the murder and then bitterly annoyed All the while on his rounds he had been congratulating himself on his coming promotion and reckoning up the many advantages which would accrue from it not the least of which was a wider prospect of finding a wife The cup was dashed from his lips He had acquired no merit in the eyes of the new Lord Loudwater and he had most probably made the present Lady Loudwater his enemy if the murdered man had divulged the source of his knowledge of her goings on with Colonel Grey He ate his mixed meal very sulkily listening to the constable s account of the circumstances of the crime Slowly however his face grew brighter as he listened the new information he had obtained for his murdered employer might very well have an important bearing on the crime itself He might yet establish himself as the benefactor of the family On the way to the Castle he was so mysterious with Robert Black that the stout constable became a prey to mingled curiosity and doubt He could not make up his mind whether William Roper really knew something of importance or was merely vapouring William Roper neither gratified his curiosity nor banished his doubt He was alive to the advantage of reserving his information for the most important ear so as to gain the greatest possible credit for it At the first sight of him mister Flexen felt that he had before him an important witness for he took a violent dislike to him and he had observed in the course of his many years experience in the detection of crime that the most important witness in hounding down a criminal was very often of a repulsive type the nark type William Roper was of that type but his story was indeed startling He first told how he had seen Colonel Grey kiss Lady Loudwater in the afternoon mister Flexen noted that Lord Loudwater had accused her of kissing Grey and of their spending most of the afternoon in the pavilion in the East wood The time of his watching had already lengthened in William Roper s memory There was nothing new in these facts and mister Flexen saw no reason to suppose that they had any bearing on the crime But William Roper went on to say that soon after ten in the evening he had been on his round in the East wood when he saw Colonel Grey walking in the direction of the Castle His curiosity had been aroused by what he had seen in the afternoon and thinking it not unlikely that he was on his way to another meeting with the Lady Loudwater and that it was the duty of a faithful retainer to make sure about it with a view to informing his master should his surmise prove correct he followed him The Colonel went straight through the wood into the Castle garden walked round the Castle keeping in its shadow as he went till he stood under the window of Lady Loudwater s suite of rooms There he appeared to suffer a check There was a light in the room on the ground floor under her boudoir The Colonel had waited quite a while then he had walked round the Castle and into it by the library window William greatly surprised by the Colonel s audacity had taken up his position in a clump of tall rhododendrons opposite the library window from which he could keep watch on it What time would this be said mister Flexen It couldn t have been more than twenty minutes past ten sir said William Roper And what happened then said mister Flexen Nothing appened for a good ten minutes Then James Hutchings the butler come across the gardens from the south gate as if e d come from the village and e went in through the libery winder the same winder mister Flexen had thought it not unlikely that Hatchings had entered the Castle by that entrance He was pleased to have his guess corroborated That would be about half past ten he said Could you see into the library at all Only a very little way sir You couldn t see whether Colonel Grey and then James Hutchings went straight through it into the hall or whether either of them went into the smoking room No I couldn t see so far in as that though there was a light burning in the libery said William Roper That was a new fact Any one passing through the library would be able to see the open knife lying in the big inkstand Go on said mister Flexen What happened next Nothing appened for a long while twenty minutes I should think and then there come a woman round the right and corner of the Castle wall and along it and into the libery winder At first I thought it was missus Carruthers or one of the maids she were too tall for her ladyship but it warn t Are you quite sure said mister Flexen Quite sir I should have known er if she had been Besides she was all muffled up like You couldn t see er face Did she hesitate before going through the library window said mister Flexen Not as I noticed She seemed to go straight in As if she were used to going into the Castle that way said mister Flexen William Roper scratched his head Then he said cautiously She seemed to know that way in all right sir And how was she dressed said mister Flexen She wasn t in black It wasn t as dull as black but it was dullish It might have been grey and again it might not It might have been blue or brown You see there was a fair moon sir but it was be ind the Castle an I never seed er in the full moonlight as you may say seeing as coming and going she come along the wall and went round the right and corner of it in the shadder And which of these three people came away first said mister Flexen She did She wasn t in the Castle more nor twenty minutes if that Did she seem to be in a hurry when she came out Did she run or walk quickly No I can t say as she did She went away just about as she came in no purtic ler urry said William Roper mister Flexen paused considering then he said And who was the next to leave The Colonel e come out next in about ten minutes Did he seem in a hurry E walked pretty brisk and e was frowning like as if e was in a rage E passed me close so I ad a good look at im Yes I should say e was fair boilen e was said William Roper in a solemn pleased tone of one giving damning evidence mister Flexen did not press the matter He said So James Hutchings came away last Yes about five minutes after the Colonel And e was in a pretty fair to do too Leastways he was frowning and a muttering of to imself He passed me close Did he seem in any hurry said mister Flexen E was walkin fairly fast said William Roper mister Flexen paused again pondering He thought that William Roper had thrown all the light on the matter he could and he had certainly revealed a number of facts which looked uncommonly important And that was all you saw he said That was all except er ladyship said William Roper Her ladyship said mister Flexen sharply Yes You see there was no urry for me to go back to the woods sir an I sat down on one of them garden seats along the edge of the Wellin tonia shrubbery to smoke a pipe and think it ou I felt it was my dooty like to let is lordship know about these goings on never thinking as ow e was sitting there all the time with a knife in im I should think it was twenty minutes arter that I saw er ladyship come out Of course I was farther away from the window but I saw er quite plain And where did she go said mister Flexen She didn t go nowhere so to speak She just walked up an down the gravel path like as if she d come out for a breath of fresh air Then she went in She wasn t out more nor ten minutes or a quarter of an hour mister Flexen was silent in frowning thought then he looked earnestly at William Roper for a good minute then he said Well this may be important or it may not But it is very important that you should keep it to yourself He looked hard again at William decided that an appeal to his vanity would be best and added You re pretty shrewd I fancy and you can see that it is most important not to put the criminal on his guard if it was a crime I suppose I shall ave to tell what I know at the inquest said William Roper with an air of importance mister Flexen gazed at him thoughtfully weighing the matter Here were a number of facts which might or might not have an important bearing on the murder but which would give rise to a great deal of painful and harmful scandal if they were given to the world at this juncture Besides the publication of them might force his hand and he preferred to have a free hand in this matter as he had been used to have a free hand in India There he had dealt with more than one case in such a manner as to secure substantial justice rather than the exact execution of the law It might be that in this case justice would be best secured by leaving the murderer to his or her conscience rather than by causing several people great unhappiness by bringing about a conviction He was inclined to think with mister Manley that the murderer might have performed a public service by removing Lord Loudwater from the world he had so ill adorned At any rate he was resolved to have a free hand to deal with the case and most certainly he was not going to allow this noxious young fellow to hamper his freedom of action and final decision Your evidence seems to me of much too great importance to be given at the inquest It must be reserved for the trial he said in an impressive tone But if it gets abroad that you have seen what you have told me the criminal will be prepared to upset your evidence and it will probably become quite worthless You must not breathe a word about what you saw to a soul till we have your evidence supported beyond all possibility of its being refuted Do you understand For a moment William Roper looked disappointed He had looked to become famous that very day But he realized his great importance in the affair and his face cleared I understands sir he said with a dark solemnity Not a word said mister Flexen yet more impressively CHAPTER VIII That morning Olivia went to meet Grey in a mood very different from that of the afternoon before Then she had moved on light feet in high spirits expectant even excited She had not known what was coming but the prospect had been full of possibilities and thanks to the sudden appearance of the cat Melchisidec at the crucial moment she had not been disappointed Today she would have gone to meet the man who loved her in yet higher spirits for there is no blinking the fact that she was wholly unable to grieve for her husband He had with such thoroughness extirpated the girlish fondness she had felt for him when she married him that she could not without hypocrisy make even a show of grieving for him His death had merely removed the barrier between her and the man she loved But today she did not go to her tryst in spirits higher for the removal of that barrier She went more slowly on heavier lingering feet Her eyes were downcast and her forehead was furrowed by an anxious brooding frown The sight of Colonel Grey waiting for her at the door of the Pavilion smoothed the furrows from her forehead and quickened her steps When the door closed behind them he caught her in his arms and kissed her It was early in her widowhood to be kissed but she made no protest She did not feel a widow she felt a free woman again It is even to be feared that her lips were responsive Antony too was changed He was paler and almost careworn There was no doubt of his joy at her coming no doubt that it was greater than the day before But it was qualified by some other troubling emotion Now and again he looked at her with different eyes eyes from which the joy had of a sudden faded rather fearful eyes that looked a question which could not be asked Her eyes rather shrank from his and when they did look into them it was with a like question But they were too deeply in love with one another for any other emotion to hold them for long at a time Presently in the joy of being together looking at one another touching one another the fearfulness and the question passed from their eyes There was nothing rustic about the Pavilion inside or out It was of white marble brought from Carrara for the fifth Baron Loudwater at the end of the eighteenth century and a whim of her murdered husband had led him to replace the original delicate rather severe furniture by a most comfortable broad couch two no less comfortable chairs with arms a small red lacquer table and a dozen cushions He had hung on each wall a drawing of dancing girls by Degas Since the coverings of the couch and the cushions were of Chinese silken embroideries the interior appeared a somewhat bizarre mixture of the Oriental and the French Antony had been in some doubt that Olivia would come But he had thought it natural that she should come to him in such an hour of distress for he knew the simple directness of her nature Therefore he had taken no chance He had gone to High Wycombe ransacked its simple provision shops and brought away a lunch basket She was for returning to the Castle to lunch But he persuaded her to stay She needed no great pressing she had a feeling that every hour was precious that it was unsafe to lose a single one of them a foreboding that she and Antony might not be together long It almost seemed that a like foreboding weighed on him At times they seemed almost feverish in their desire to wring the last drop of sweetness out of the swiftly flying hour After lunch again the thought came to her that she ought to go back to the Castle that she might be needed and missed but it found no expression She could not tear herself away She had been denied joy too long and it was intoxicating It was five o clock before she left the Pavilion She walked briskly with her wonted easy swinging gait back to the Castle in a dream her anxiety and fear for the while forgotten On her way up to her suite of rooms she met no one She was quick to take off her hat and ring for her tea Elizabeth Twitcher brought it to her and from her Olivia learned that only mister Manley had asked for her She realized that after all thanks to her dead husband she was but an inconspicuous person in the Castle No one had been used to consult her in any matter She was glad of it At the moment all she desired was freedom of action freedom to be with Antony and the fact that the life of the Castle moved smoothly along in the capable hands of missus Carruthers and mister Manley gave her that freedom After her tea she went out into the rose garden and was strolling up and down it when mister Flexen pondering the information which he had obtained from William Roper saw her and came out to her He thought that she shrank a little at the sight of him but assured himself that it must be fancy surely there could be no reason why she should shrink from him I m told Lady Loudwater that you went out through the library window into the garden for a stroll about a quarter to twelve last night Did you by any chance as you went in or came out hear Lord Loudwater snore I want to fix the latest hour at which he was certainly alive You see how important it may prove She hesitated wrinkling her brow as she weighed the importance of her answer Then she looked at him with limpid eyes and said Yes He knew the sixth sense of the criminal investigator told him that she lied and he was taken aback Why should she lie What did she know What had she to hide Did you hear him snore going out or coming in he said Both said Olivia firmly mister Flexen hesitated He did not believe her Then he said How long did Lord Loudwater sleep after dinner as a rule What time did he go to bed It varied a good deal Generally he awoke and went to bed before twelve But sometimes it was nearer one especially if he was disturbed and went to sleep again Thank you said mister Flexen and he left her and went back into the Castle Lord Loudwater had certainly been disturbed by the woman with whom he had quarrelled He might have slept on late But why had Lady Loudwater lied about the snoring What did she know What on earth was she hiding Whom was she screening Could it be Colonel Grey Was he mixed up in the actual murder mister Flexen decided that he must have more information about Colonel Grey that he would get into touch with him and that soon He had information about him sooner than he expected and without seeking it Inspector Perkins was awaiting him with missus Turnbull the landlady of the Cart and Horses The inspector had learned from her that the Lord Loudwater had paid a visit to her lodger the evening before and that they had quarrelled fiercely mister Flexen heard her story and questioned her The important point in it seemed to him to be Lord Loudwater s threats to hound Colonel Grey out of the Army missus Turnbull left him plenty to ponder mister Manley had told him that the handle of the famous knife would probably provide him with an embarrassment of riches in the way of finger prints It seemed to him that the stories of William Roper missus Carruthers and missus Turnbull had provided him with an embarrassment of riches in the way of possible murderers It grew clearer than ever to him that the inquest must be conducted with the greatest discretion that as few facts as possible must be revealed at it It was also clear to him that unless the handle of the knife told a plain story he would get nothing but circumstantial evidence and so far he had gotten too much of it He made up his mind that it would be best to see Colonel Grey at once and form his impression as to the likelihood of his having had a hand in the crime He was loth to believe that a V C would murder in cold blood even as detestable a bully as the Lord Loudwater appeared to have been But he had seen stranger things Moreover it depended on the type of V C Colonel Grey was V C s varied mister Flexen lost no time It was nearly six o clock It was likely that the Colonel would be back at his inn after his fishing missus Turnbull was sure that he had as usual gone fishing for when he set out in the morning he had taken his rod with him Antony Grey was not the man to omit a simple precaution like that Therefore mister Flexen ordered a car to be brought round and was at the Cart and Horses by twenty past six He found that Colonel Grey had indeed returned He sent up his card the maid came back and at once took him up to the Colonel s sitting room Grey received him with an air of inquiry which grew yet more inquiring when mister Flexen told him that he was engaged in investigating the affair of Lord Loudwater s death Therefore mister Flexen came to the point at once I have been informed that Lord Loudwater paid you a visit last night and that a violent quarrel ensued Colonel Grey he said Pardon me but the violence was all on Lord Loudwater s part said Colonel Grey in an exceedingly unpleasant tone I merely made myself nasty in a quiet way Violence is not in my line unless I m absolutely driven to it and any one less likely to drive any one to violence than that obnoxious and noisy jackass I ve never come across The fellow was all words abusive words He d no fight in him I gave him every reason I could think of to go for me because I particularly wanted to hammer him But he hadn t got it in him Grey spoke quietly without raising his voice but there was a rasp in his tone that impressed mister Flexen If a man could give such an impression of dangerousness with his voice what would he be like in action He realized that here was a quite uncommon type of V C He realized too that Lord Loudwater had made the mistake of a lifetime in his attempt to bully him Moreover he had a strong feeling that if it had seemed to Colonel Grey that Lord Loudwater was better out of the way and a favourable opportunity had presented itself he might very well have displayed little hesitation in putting him out of the way He felt that the obnoxious peer would have been little more than a dangerous dog to him He did not speak at once He looked into Colonel Grey s grey eyes and cold and hard they were weighing him Then he said Lord Loudwater threatened to hound you out of the Army I m told Among other things said Grey carelessly mister Flexen guessed that the other things were threats to divorce Lady Loudwater That would have been a very serious blow to you he said You re quite right said Colonel Grey mister Flexen could have sworn that he had started to say You re quite wrong and changed his mind The Colonel seemed to hesitate for words then he went on It would have been a very heavy blow indeed You can see that for a man who enlisted in the Artists Rifles in nineteen fourteen and fought his way up to the command of a regiment nothing could be more painful It would have been heartbreaking I should have been years getting over it The rasp had gone out of his voice He was speaking in a pleasant confidential tone and mister Flexen did not believe a word he said At the least he was exaggerating the distress he would have felt at leaving the Army but mister Flexen had the strongest feeling that he would have felt next to no distress at all Again he was astonished Colonel Grey was lying to him just as Lady Loudwater had lied What could be their reason What on earth had they done He kept his astonishment out of his face and said in a sympathetic voice Yes I can see that And then again it would have been painful and very unpleasant to feel that your thoughtlessness had landed Lady Loudwater in the Divorce Court Oh Lord no said Colonel Grey quickly There was no chance of any divorce proceedings Even for a divorce case at any rate one brought by the husband there must be some grounds he must have some evidence The cock and bull story of a gamekeeper is hardly enough to found a divorce case on is it Oh I don t know The gamekeeper might convince a jury You know what juries are You can never tell what form their stupidity will take said mister Flexen But apart from the lack of evidence there was no chance of a divorce case I tell you Loudwater hadn t got it in him said Grey confidently He d have threatened and been abusive He d have gone on throwing that cock and bull story at Lady Loudwater for as long as she continued to stick to him but it would have stopped at that His infernal temper never went any deeper than his lungs Lady Loudwater had nothing to fear Yet you think that he would have done his best to hound you out of the Army said mister Flexen finding this conception of Lord Loudwater as a harmless if violent vapourer somewhat inconsistent That s quite another matter said Grey quickly It merely meant using his influence behind my back with some scurvy politician There wouldn t have been any publicity attached to that any exposure of his bullying He d have done that all right I should have thought that a man of Lord Loudwater s violent temper would rather have sought an open row mister Flexen persisted Of course if he d been really violent But he wasn t I tell you He was only a blustering bully where women and servants were concerned people he could cow I tell you I made it quite clear that he crumpled up directly you stood up to him Why hang it all Any man with the soul of a mouse who really believed that I had been making love to his wife couldn t have taken the things I told him without going for me at any risk And as I m still rather crocked up and he knew it there must have seemed precious little risk about it I tell you that he was just a blustering ruffian mister Flexen had a strong impression that Colonel Grey was unused to being as expansive as this that he was talking for talking s sake possibly to put him off asking some question which would be difficult or dangerous to answer He could not for the life of him think what that question could be I daresay you re right he said carelessly Bullies aren t over fond of a real scrap But I am told that you paid a visit to the Castle last night and came away about a quarter past eleven Did you Colonel Grey showed no faintest disquiet on hearing that his visit to Olivia the night before was known But he did not give mister Flexen time to finish the sentence He interrupted him saying quickly Yes I went to see Lady Loudwater I thought it likely that she would attach a good deal more importance to Loudwater s silly threats than they deserved and might be worrying It would have been quite natural I wanted to talk it over with her and set her mind at rest about it It didn t take very long to do that partly because it was a long time since he had really frightened her She had got used to his tantrums and bullying and even this new game had not disturbed her very much We both came to the conclusion that he was just blustering again and wouldn t do anything As a matter of fact I don t think she cared very much what he did She had got so fed up with him that she didn t care whether they separated or not mister Flexen felt more sure than ever that this garrulity was unusual in Colonel Grey He was talking with a purpose apparently to induce him to believe that both he and Lady Loudwater had taken her husband s threat of divorce proceedings lightly He began to think that they had not taken it lightly at all or at any rate one or other of them had not Yes he said That s what always happens with those blustering fellows In the end no one takes them seriously But what I came to ask you was Did you as you came through the library or went out through it hear Lord Loudwater snore Colonel Grey hesitated just as Lady Loudwater had hesitated over that question Plainly he was weighing the effect of his answer Then he said No mister Flexen s instinct assured him that Colonel Grey had lied just as Lady Loudwater had lied Are you sure that nothing in the nature of a snore came to your ears as you came out Did you hear any sound from the room You can see how important it is to fix as near as we possibly can the hour of Lord Loudwater s death he said earnestly No I heard nothing said Colonel Grey firmly Bother said mister Flexen It s very important Possibly I shall be able to find out from some one else I hope you will said Grey politely mister Flexen bade him good night cordially enough and drove back to the Castle in a considerable perplexity Both Colonel Grey and Lady Loudwater were behaving in an uncommonly odd not to say suspicious manner He was quite sure that both of them had lied about the dead man s snoring But it was plain that either had lied with a different object Lady Loudwater had lied to make it appear that her husband had been alive at midnight Colonel Grey had lied to make it appear that he was dead at a quarter past eleven But mister Flexen was sure that Colonel Grey had heard Lord Loudwater snore and that Lady Loudwater had not What did they know What had they done Or what had one of them done CHAPTER IX When mister Flexen reached the Castle Wilkins took him to a bedroom in the west wing He found that his portmanteau had arrived had been unpacked and that his dress clothes were laid out ready for him on the bed As he dressed he cudgelled his brains for the reason why Lady Loudwater and Colonel Grey had lied Then an idea came to him were they lying to shield the unknown woman with whom Lord Loudwater had had that violent quarrel The longer he considered this hypothesis the more possible it grew He must find that unknown woman and at once Possibly mister Carrington as Lord Loudwater s legal adviser would be able to put him on her track He came to dinner still perplexed to find mister Manley waiting to bear him company They talked for a while about public affairs and the weather Then mister Flexen said Was Lord Loudwater the kind of man to confide in his lawyers Not if he could help it said mister Manley with conviction mister Flexen hoped that Lord Loudwater had not been able to help confiding in his lawyers about this unknown woman Then he said By the way do you know Colonel Grey Oh yes He was here a lot up to a little while ago Then he had a row the inevitable row with Lord Loudwater and he hasn t been here since He dropped on to Lord Loudwater for bullying Lady Loudwater and he didn t drop on him lightly either Hell I fancy was what he gave him Yes I gathered that something of the kind had taken place What kind of a man is the Colonel said mister Flexen carelessly The best man in the world not to have a row with He s a cold terror said mister Manley in a tone of enthusiastic conviction He always seems rather cooler than a cucumber But my belief is that that coolness is just the mask of really violent emotions I saw them working once I came in on the end of his row with Loudwater just the end of it my goodness From my point of view the dramatist s you know he s the most interesting person in the county bar Lady Loudwater of course I should never have thought him a terror said mister Flexen in a tone of somewhat incredulous surprise I had a talk with him this evening about Lord Loudwater s death and he seemed to me to be a pleasant enough fellow and an excellent soldier I take it that he s very keen on his career in the Army Not a bit of it The war is merely a side issue with him said mister Manley in an assured tone I know from what he told me himself We were talking over our experiences But hang it all he s a V C cried mister Flexen Yes he s a V C all right But that s because he s one of those men who have the knack of taking an interest in everything they turn their hands to and doing it well But his two passions are Chinese art and women said mister Manley Women said mister Flexen He didn t strike me as being that kind of man at all He seemed a quite simple straightforward soldier Simplicity and a passion for Chinese art don t go together at least not what is usually called simplicity said mister Manley dryly A friend of mine who knows all about him told me that he had had more really serious love affairs than any other man in London He seems to be one of those men who fall in love hard every time they fall in love He said that it was one of the mysteries of the polite world how he had kept out of the Divorce Court Sounds an odd type said mister Flexen storing up the information and marking how little it agreed with his own observation of Colonel Grey And you say that Lady Loudwater is interesting too Oh come Are you pumping me or merely pulling my leg said mister Manley Surely you can see that Lady Loudwater is pure Italian Renaissance She is one of those subtle mysterious creatures that Leonardo and Luini were always painting compact of emotion It s so long since I was at Balliol and then I was doing Indian Civil work the languages you know I ve forgotten all I knew about the Renaissance in Italy and I don t look at many pictures All the same I think you re wrong your dramatic imagination you know My own idea is that Lady Loudwater at any rate is a quite simple creature It isn t mine said mister Manley firmly She s a great deal too intelligent to be simple and she comes of far too intelligent a family What family said mister Flexen She s a Quainton with Italian blood in her veins The deuce she is cried mister Flexen and half a dozen stories of the Quaintons rose in his mind He must amend his impressions of Lady Loudwater And she has a keener sense of humour than any woman I ever came across said mister Manley driving his contention home Has she said mister Flexen There was a pause Then mister Manley said in a musing tone Do you suppose that Colonel Grey finds her simple What You don t think that there is really anything serious between them said mister Flexen quickly No not really serious at any rate on Colonel Grey s part You can hardly expect a man recovering very slowly from three bad wounds and still crocked up to fall in love can you Especially a man who when he does fall in love falls in love with the violence with which Grey is charged said mister Manley There is that said mister Flexen But that wouldn t prevent Lady Loudwater from falling in love with Colonel Grey And after the way her husband treated her she must have needed something in the way of affection badly It s no good a woman falling in love with a man unless he falls in love with her said mister Manley in the tone of a philosopher Besides women don t fall in love with men who are so feeble from illness as the Colonel seems to be How can there be the attraction She might of course want to mother him very keenly But that s quite a different thing He paused then added in a tone of some anxiety I say you re not trying to mix her up with the murder if it was a murder I m not trying to mix anybody up in it said mister Flexen slowly But I don t mind telling you that it is growing quite a pretty problem and to solve a problem you must have every factor in it You see that the strong point about both Lady Loudwater and Colonel Grey is on your own showing that they are uncommonly clever and only stupid people commit murder except of course once in a blue moon But what about these gangs of criminals we sometimes read about with extraordinarily clever men at the head of them Don t they exist said mister Manley in a tone of surprise They exist but they don t commit murders not in Europe at any rate said mister Flexen In the East and in the United States it s different perhaps Murder is always as much of a blunder as a crime It makes people so keen after the criminal No no really intelligent criminal commits murder Of course that s true said mister Manley readily He paused then added in a thoughtful tone I wonder whether the war has weakened our conception of the sanctity of human life I shouldn t wonder said mister Flexen and their talk drifted into a discussion of generalities He was glad that he was staying at the Castle His talk with mister Manley had been illuminating Olivia dined in her sitting room and with a poor appetite Away from Grey she had fallen back into her anxiety and fearfulness Wilkins was waiting on her an insensible block of a fellow but even he perceived that she was very little aware of what she was eating and now and again paused and in some worrying train of thought forgot that she was dining at all After dinner however her mood changed The fearfulness and anxiety at times vanished from her face and a pleasant eager expectancy took their place At a quarter to nine she took a dark wrap from her wardrobe went quietly down the stairs and slipped out of the side door across the east lawn and into the path through the shrubbery unseen Grey had suggested that he should come to the Castle after dinner to spend the evening with her but they had decided that it would be wiser to meet in the pavilion There would be talk if he spent the evening with her so soon after her husband s death with his body still unburied in the house This was the only mention they made of him all the time they spent together Besides both of them found the pavilion in the wood a far more delightful meeting place than the Castle In the pavilion they felt that they were out of the world Grey too anxious and restless to await her at the pavilion had come down the wood and into the end of the path through the shrubbery It startled her to come upon him so suddenly But when they came out of the shrubbery into the moonlit aisle of the wood the fearfulness and anxiety and restlessness had vanished utterly from their faces both of them were smiling They walked slowly saying little touching now and again as they swayed in their walk along the turf It seemed wiser not to light the candles in the pavilion The moonlight shining through the high windows gave them light enough to see one another s eyes It was all they needed The time passed quickly in the ineffable confidences of lovers They had a hundred things to tell one another a hundred things to ask one another in their effort to attain that oneness which is the aim of all true love But in their joy in being together in the joy of both of them there was a feverishness a sense that it was a menaced joy which must needs be brief Again they were striving to wring the most out of the hour which was so swiftly passing At times the sense of danger which hung over them was so strong that they clung to one another like frightened children in the dark Though mister Flexen had at the time shown himself somewhat unbelieving in the matter of mister Manley s conclusions about the character and temperament of Grey and Olivia the impression they had made on him grew stronger He was too good a judge of men not to perceive that the budding dramatist had the intelligent imagination which makes for real shrewdness and he was not disposed to underrate the value of the imagination in forming judgments of men and women Probably Colonel Grey was a man of less intensity of emotion than mister Manley had declared and Lady Loudwater less subtile and intelligent But after making these reductions he had here possible actors in a drama of passion and though it was his experience that money not passion is the most frequent motive of murder he must take the probability of Lord Loudwater s murder being a crime of passion into account though of course the violent Hutchings threatened with ruin would undoubtedly benefit from a monetary point of view by the murder At the same time Hutchings had just had an interview which had gone better probably than he had expected with an uncommonly pretty girl mister Carrington arrived soon after breakfast next morning and mister Flexen at once discussed the matter of the inquest with him and the Coroner He found the lawyer chiefly eager to have as little scandal as possible and the Coroner took his cue from the lawyer This suited mister Flexen admirably He had no wish to show his hand so early He foresaw that if the story of William Roper were told and the story of Lord Loudwater s quarrel with Colonel Grey at the Cart and Horses there would be a painful scandal The majority of the people of the neighbourhood would at once believe and declare that Lady Loudwater or Colonel Grey or both had murdered Lord Loudwater Such a scandal would in no way serve his purpose It might rather hamper him Pressure might be put on him which might force him to take steps before the time was ripe for them There was no difficulty in their having exactly the kind of inquest they wanted for it was wholly in the hands of mister Flexen and the Coroner After careful discussion they decided to limit it to doctor Thornhill s evidence and that of the servants with regard to the dead nobleman s mood on the night of his death mister Carrington urged strongly that full prominence should be given to the fact that the wound might have been self inflicted and the Coroner promised that this should be done When the Coroner had left them the lawyer said to mister Flexen In the case of a man like the late Lord Loudwater you can t be too careful you know Really it would be better if the jury brought in a verdict of suicide A suicide in a family is always better than a murder H m You could hardly expect me to rest content with such a verdict said mister Flexen Not I mean on the evidence Oh no I shouldn t said mister Carrington All I want to avoid is a lot of quite unnecessary painful scandal which won t lead to anything of use to you about innocent people connected with my late client You won t act without something pretty definite to go upon while the scandalmongers will talk on no grounds at all Lord Loudwater was a queer customer and goodness knows what will come to light for of course you ll investigate the affair thoroughly The inquest accordingly was conducted on these lines Only doctor Thornhill Wilkins and Holloway were called as witnesses and the Coroner directed the jury to bring in a verdict to the effect that Lord Loudwater had died of a knife wound and that there was no evidence to show whether it was self inflicted or not But in this he failed The jury muddle headed obstinate country folk had made up their minds that Lord Loudwater was the kind of man to be murdered and that therefore he had been murdered They brought in the verdict that Lord Loudwater had been murdered by some person or persons unknown mister Flexen mister Carrington and the Coroner were annoyed but they had had too wide an experience of juries to be surprised This will let loose a horde of reporters on us said mister Carrington very gloomily It will said mister Flexen The pet sleuths of the Wire and the Planet will leave London in about an hour Well they ll have to be dealt with said mister Carrington Oh they re all right I probably know them I ll get them to work with me They must be treated very nicely said mister Flexen cheerfully They re always a confounded nuisance said mister Carrington frowning Not if they re kindly treated Indeed I shall very likely find them really useful said mister Flexen But you might give the servants a hint to be careful of what they say The hint will come best from you and be much more effective than if it came from any one else You represent the family I ll see about it said mister Carrington and he went to Olivia s boudoir to confer with her about the invitations to the funeral mister Flexen was indeed little disturbed by the prospect of the coming of the newspaper men A popular member of the chief literary and journalistic club in London he would probably know them or they would know of him and he would find them ready enough to work with him Besides even if they discovered that the quarrel between Colonel Grey and Lord Loudwater had its origin in Lady Loudwater in the present state of mind of the country they would have to move very cautiously indeed in the case of a V C He did not indeed think it likely that they would discover the cause of the quarrel for some time possibly not before their papers had tired of the business and sent them on other errands missus Turnbull only knew of Lord Loudwater s threat to hound Colonel Grey out of the Army she did not know the reason of his fury and his threat Elizabeth Twitcher would certainly hold her tongue about Lord Loudwater s subsequent quarrel with Lady Loudwater and his accusations and threats missus Carruthers was even more unlikely to tell of it It was unlikely that William Roper would come within the ken of the newspaper men No one could tell them that he was the great repository of facts in the case and mister Flexen believed that he had given him good cause to keep his mouth shut till he called on him to open it Taking one thing with another he thought it more than likely that the newspaper men would not hinder him in his purpose of dealing with the affair in his own way On the other hand they might very well be used to help him discover the unknown woman who had had the furious quarrel with Lord Loudwater at about eleven o clock Indeed he regarded the information about that quarrel as a sop to be thrown to them She afforded just the element of melodrama in the case which would be most grateful to their different newspapers and provide them with plenty of the kind of headlines which best sold them It was certain that James Hutchings would also occupy their attention The fact that he had been discharged with contumely and threats that he had departed uttering violent threats against the dead man and that he had returned to visit Elizabeth Twitcher late that night were doubtless being discussed by the whole neighbourhood However only himself and William Roper knew at present that James Hutchings had come and gone by the library window had actually passed twice within a few feet of his sleeping or dead master That fact also mister Flexen proposed to keep to himself till he saw reason to divulge it His next business must be to question Hutchings It was quite likely that there lay the solution of the mystery CHAPTER X It would have been easy enough for mister Flexen to send for Hutchings to the Castle and question him there But he did not In the first place he did not think it fair to a man who had already prejudiced himself so seriously by his threats against the murdered man Besides he would be at a disadvantage under a greater strain at the Castle and mister Flexen wanted him where he would be at his best for he wished to be able to form an exact judgment of the likelihood of his being the murderer Indeed it must be a very careful and exact judgment for he felt that he was moving in deep waters that it was a case in which it was possible even easy to go hopelessly wrong Also he was fully alive to the fact that if threatened men live long the men who threaten are to blame for it and that threats such as Hutchings are the commonest things in the world and as a rule of very little importance But there was always the chance that Hutchings was the unusual threatener and if he were he had assuredly been in circumstances most favourable to the carrying out of his threats Accordingly he learnt from Inspector Perkins the way to the gamekeeper s cottage in the West Wood where Hutchings was staying with his father and drove the car to it himself Hutchings was alone in the cottage for his father was out on his rounds He invited mister Flexen to come in mister Flexen came in sat down in an arm chair and examined Hutchings face He saw that the man was plainly very anxious and ill at ease It was natural enough He must perceive quite clearly how black against him things looked He was forced also to admit to himself that Hutchings had not a pleasant face It was choleric and truculent and in spite of the man s evident anxiety there was a sullen fierceness on it which gave him no little of the air of a wild beast trapped mister Flexen wasted no time beating about the bush but said to him When you visited Elizabeth Twitcher last night you entered and left the Castle by the library window You got that from that young blighter Manley said Hutchings bitterly Not at all I did not know that mister Manley knew it said mister Flexen So you did Yes sir I did I always went to the village that way in the summer time It s the shortest Besides his lordship was nearly always asleep and if he wasn t and did ear me there was always something I could be doing in the library sir He spoke with eager rather humble civility Well did you as you went through the library coming or going hear Lord Loudwater snore Hutchings knitted his brow thinking then he said I can t call to mind as I did sir But then I wasn t giving him any attention I was thinking about other things altogether Of course I went out quietly enough But that was habit That sounds as if you had not heard him snore as if you thought that he was awake said mister Flexen I don t think I thought about him at all sir at the moment I was thinking about other things said Hutchings You say that mister Manley saw you go out Yes sir I passed him in the hall and went into the library We had a few words and I told him I had come to fetch some cigarettes as I d left behind Do you know what the time was said mister Flexen No sir not exactly But it must have been nearly half past eleven I should think It is very important to fix the time at which Lord Loudwater died said mister Flexen You can t tell me nearer than that No sir It was nearly ten to twelve when I got home and I reckon it s about twenty minutes walk from the Castle to the cottage here And all you went to the Castle for was to speak to Elizabeth Twitcher said mister Flexen That was all I went for every single thing And it was all I did there every mortal thing I did there sir Hatchings asseverated and he wiped his brow H m said mister Flexen As you passed through the library did you happen to notice whether the knife was in its place in the big inkstand Hutchings hesitated and his lips twitched Then he said Yes I did sir It was in the big inkstand mister Flexen could not make up his mind whether he was telling the truth or not He thought that he was not But he did not attach much importance to the matter People who knew themselves to be suspected of a crime had often told him quite stupid and unnecessary lies and been proved innocent after all I should have thought that your mind was too full of other things to notice a thing like that he said in a somewhat incredulous tone Then there came an outburst mister Flexen had thought that Hutchings was worked up to a high degree of nervous tension and he was He cried out that he knew that every one believed that he had done it but he hadn t He d never thought of it He was damned if he didn t wish he had done it He might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb anyhow He broke off to curse Lord Loudwater at length He had been a curse to every one who came into contact with him while he was alive and now he was getting people into trouble when he was dead Yes he wished it had occurred to him to stick that knife into him He d have done it like a shot and he d have done the right thing The world was well rid of a swine like that His face was contorted and his eyes kept gleaming red as he talked and he came to the end of his outburst trembling and panting mister Flexen was unmoved and unenlightened It was merely the outburst of a badly frightened man lacking in self control and told him nothing It left it equally likely that Hutchings had or had not committed the crime There s nothing to get so frantic about he said quietly to the panting man It doesn t do any good It s all very well to talk like that sir said Hutchings in a shaky voice But I know what people are saying It s enough to make any one lose their temper I should think that yours was pretty easy to lose said mister Flexen dryly I know it It is very short sir It always was and I can t help it said Hutchings in an apologetic voice Then you d better set about learning to help it my man said mister Flexen He took out his pipe and filled it slowly The flush faded a little from Hutchings face mister Flexen lighted his pipe and rose Then as he went to the door he said I should advise you to get that stupid temper well in hand It makes a bad impression Good afternoon mister Flexen drove back to the Castle considering Hutchings carefully There was no doubt that he was indeed badly frightened but he had reason to be mister Flexen could not decide whether he had worn the air of a guilty man or an innocent He could not decide whether the butler had been too deeply absorbed in his own affairs to hear the snoring of Lord Loudwater as he went through the library It was possible that Lord Loudwater was alive asleep and yet not snoring at the time Snoring is often intermittent He considered Hutchings violent outburst Certainly such an outburst showed the man uncommonly unbalanced it might indeed on occasion take the form of uncontrollable murderous fury But it seemed to him that an actual meeting with Lord Loudwater would have been necessary to provoke that But Lord Loudwater had been sitting in his chair when he died and if he had not killed himself he had been killed in his sleep At any rate there was probably sufficient evidence seeing what juries are to convict Hatchings If he had been one of those not uncommon ministers of the law whose only desire is to secure a conviction he would doubtless arrest him at once But it was not his only desire to secure a conviction it was his very keen desire to find the right solution of the problem He could not see where any more evidence against Hutchings was to come from What mister Manley had told him about the knife that it had been in general use and that he had seen Hutchings cut string with it the day before the murder greatly lessened its value as evidence even if Hutchings finger prints were thick on it He decided to dismiss Hutchings from his mind for the time being and devote all his energies to discovering the mysterious woman with whom Lord Loudwater had had the furious quarrel between eleven and a quarter past With this end in view on his return to the Castle he went straight to the library where mister Carrington was engaged along with mister Manley in an examination of the murdered man s papers They were uncommonly few and mister Manley had already set them in order Lord Loudwater seemed to have kept but few letters and the papers consisted chiefly of receipted and unreceipted bills When he found that mister Flexen had come to confer with the lawyer mister Manley assumed an air of extraordinary discretion and softly withdrew I want to know it is most important whether there was any entanglement between Lord Loudwater and a woman said mister Flexen I should think it very unlikely said mister Carrington without hesitation At least I have never heard of anything of the kind and so far I have come across no trace of anything of the kind among his papers mister Flexen frowned considering then he said Do you happen to know whether he employed any one besides your firm to do legal work for him As to that I can t say But I should not think it likely It was always a business to get him to attend to anything that wanted doing and he always made a fuss about it I can t see him employing another firm too But he may have done The only thing is that I ought to have found either their bills or the receipts for them among those papers except that my late client does not appear to have taken the trouble to keep many receipts The thing is that I ve learnt that Lord Loudwater had a furious quarrel with some unknown woman between eleven and a quarter past on the night of his death and I want to find her You can see how important it is It may be that she stabbed him or it may be that she provided him with the motive to commit suicide not that that seems likely But you can t tell she might have been able to threaten him with some exposure Those people without any self control are always doing the most senseless things bigamy for instance is often one of their weaknesses Loudwater was certainly without self control but I hardly think that he was the man to commit bigamy said the lawyer It would very much simplify matters if he had said mister Flexen in a dissatisfied tone I wonder whether Manley would know anything about it He might said mister Carrington mister Flexen went through the library window to find mister Manley strolling up and down the lawn with every appearance of enjoying his pipe and the respite from perusing papers mister Carrington tells me that you were in Lord Loudwater s confidence said mister Flexen Wholly said mister Manley with more promptness than his actual knowledge of the facts warranted It seemed to him fitting that a secretary of his intelligence and discretion should have been wholly in the confidence of any nobleman who employed him Therefore he himself must have been Then perhaps you can tell me whether he was entangled with a woman said mister Flexen Entangled In what way said mister Manley in a tone of surprise In the usual way I suppose Was he engaged in a love affair with any woman or had he been He certainly did not tell me anything about it if he was said mister Manley But that is the kind of thing he might very well not confide to his secretary You don t happen to know if he was making any payments to a woman an allowance for example said mister Flexen mister Manley was well on his guard by now These questions must surely refer to Helena He never told me anything about it he said with perfect readiness Not of course that I would tell you if he had he added in his most amiable voice I ve told you that I thought that he made enough trouble while he was alive I won t help him to make trouble now that he s dead mister Flexen thought that the asseveration was unnecessary since mister Manley had not the knowledge which would make the trouble He returned to the lawyer and told him that mister Manley had no information to give It seems a very important point in the affair said the lawyer It is said mister Flexen frowning I wonder if there was an intrigue with a country girl or woman some one in the neighbourhood There might have been Lord Loudwater rode a great deal He was hours in the saddle every day He had time and opportunity for that kind of thing On the other hand there s no need for it to have been any one in the neighbourhood at all To say nothing of the train it s a short enough motor drive from London and it was a moonlight night said mister Flexen Then you may be able to find traces of the car The woman must have left it somewhere while she had the interview with Lord Loudwater said mister Carrington I ll try said mister Flexen not very hopefully But there are so few people about at night nowadays Five out of the eight gamekeepers are still abroad In ordinary times there would have been four at least of them about the roads and woods On that night there was only one There s the further difficulty that Lord Loudwater had so few friends That will make it harder to find out anything about an affair of this kind if he had one said mister Carrington It will indeed said mister Flexen and paused frowning Then he added gravely I m sure that there was such an affair and I ve got to find the woman CHAPTER XI mister Manley did not lunch with mister Flexen and the lawyer In cultivating mister Flexen he had been forced to see less than usual of Helena and interesting a companion as mister Flexen was mister Manley very much preferred her society He found her less nervous than she had been the day before but she still wore a sufficiently anxious air and was still restless She seemed more pleased to see him than usual and the warmth of her welcome gave him a sudden sense that she was even fonder of him than he had thought or hoped It stirred him to an admirable response At lunch she questioned him with uncommon particularity about the proceedings of mister Flexen the discoveries he had made the lines on which he was making his investigation Her interest seemed natural enough and he told her all that he knew which was little She seemed much disappointed by his lack of information He was careful not to tell her that mister Flexen had inquired of him whether he knew of any entanglement between Lord Loudwater and a woman Thanks to his imagination he was a young man of uncommon discretion and it was plain that she was suffering anxiety enough At the end of her fruitless questioning she sighed and said Of course the whole affair is of no great interest to you really It isn t of very great interest to me said mister Manley You see the victim of the crime if it was a crime was such an uninteresting creature Nature as I ve told you before intended him for a bull changed her mind when it was too late to make a satisfactory alteration and botched it You must admit that the bull man is a very dull kind of creature unless he can make things lively for you by prodding you with his horns When he is dead he is certainly done with I wish he was done with she said with a sigh Well as far as you are concerned he is done with surely he said in some surprise Of course of course she said quickly But still he seems likely to give a great deal of trouble to somebody and if there is a trial how am I to know that my name won t be brought up I don t think there s a chance of it he said How should it be brought up One never knows she said with a note of nervous dread in her voice Well as far as I m concerned he ll get no help in making a posthumous nuisance of himself from me and I m inclined to think that as things are going he ll need my help to do that he said in a tone of quiet satisfaction A posthumous nuisance you do have phrases And how you do dislike him she said The moderately civilized man with a gentle disposition like mine always does hate the bull man Also he despises him said mister Manley calmly She was silent a while thinking then she said What did you mean by saying If it was a crime What else could it have been A suicide The evidence was that the wound might have been self inflicted said mister Manley Absurd Lord Loudwater was the last man in the world to commit suicide she cried That s purely a matter of individual opinion I am of the opinion that a man of his uncontrollable temper was quite likely to commit suicide he said firmly As for its being absurd if there is any attempt to prove any one guilty of murdering him on purely circumstantial evidence that person won t find anything absurd in the theory at all In fact he ll work it for all it s worth I think myself that with doctor Thornhill s evidence in mind the police or the Public Prosecutor or the Treasury or whoever it is that decides those things will never attempt in this case to bring any one to trial for the murder on merely circumstantial evidence Do you think not she said in a tone of relief I m sure of it said mister Manley But why do we waste our time talking about the tiresome fellow when there are things a thousand times more interesting to talk about Your eyes now mister Flexen instructed Inspector Perkins and his men to make inquiries about the rides of Lord Loudwater and to try to learn whether any one had seen a strange car or indeed a car of any kind in the neighbourhood of the Castle about eleven o clock on the night of the murder Also he could see his way to using the newspaper men to help him to discover whether there had been any entanglement known to the club gossips or the people of the neighbourhood between Lord Loudwater and a lady in London It was not unlikely that he had talked of it to some one for if they quarrelled so furiously he must need sympathy and if he had not talked the lady probably had though it might very well be that she was not in the circle in which the Loudwaters moved in London He had some doubt however that she was a London woman at all She had shown too intimate a knowledge of Lord Loudwater s habits at Loudwater and of the Castle itself for it was clear from William Roper s story that she had gone straight to the library window and through it in the evident expectation of finding Lord Loudwater asleep as usual in his smoking room It was this doubt which prevented him from appealing to Scotland Yard for help in clearing up this particular point He wished to make sure first that the woman did not belong to the neighbourhood On the other hand she might always be some one who had been a guest at the Castle He was about to go in search of Lady Loudwater to question her about their friends and acquaintances who might have this knowledge of the Castle and the habits of her husband when the sleuth from the Wire and the sleuth from the Planet arrived together in all amity and the same vexation at being prevented by this errand from spending the afternoon at the same bridge table The sleuth of the Wire was a very solemn looking young man with a round simple face The sleuth of the Planet was a tall dark man with an impatient and slightly worried air who looked uncommonly like an irritable actor manager Both of them greeted mister Flexen with affectionate warmth and Douglas the tall sleuth of the Planet at once deplored with considerable bitterness the fact that he had been robbed of his afternoon s bridge Gregg the sleuth of the Wire preserved a gently blinking sympathetic silence mister Flexen at once sent for whisky soda and cigars and over them took his two friends into his confidence He told them that it was very doubtful whether it was a case of murder or suicide that the jury s verdict was not in accordance with the directions of the Coroner but just a piece of natural pig headed stupidity This produced another bitter outcry from Douglas about the loss of his afternoon mister Flexen did not soothe him at all by pointing out that he was in a beautiful country on a beautiful day Then he told them about the coming of the mysterious woman and her violent quarrel with the Lord Loudwater just about the probable time of his death Douglas at once lost his irritated air and displayed a lively interest in the matter Gregg listened and blinked mister Flexen told them also of Hutchings his threats and his visit to the Castle That was as far as his confidences went But they were enough He had given them the very things they wanted and they both assured him that they would at once inform him of any discoveries they might make themselves They left him feeling sure that he might safely leave the servants and the villagers to them and the policemen If any one in the neighbourhood knew anything about the mysterious woman they would probably ferret it out What was far more important was that tomorrow s Wire and Planet would contain such an advertisement of her that any one in London or the country who knew of her relations with the dead man would learn at once the value of that knowledge When they had gone he sent for missus Carruthers and learned to his annoyance that none of the upper servants except Elizabeth Twitcher had been in service at the Castle for more than four months She could only say that during the six weeks that she had been housekeeper there had been very few visitors and they had been merely callers except when Colonel Grey had been coming to the Castle and there had been small tennis parties She had heard nothing from the servants about his lordship s being on particularly friendly terms with any lady in the neighbourhood Hutchings would be the most likely person to know a thing like that He had been in service at the Castle all his life Of course her ladyship too she might know mister Flexen made up his mind to seek out Hutchings at once and question him on the matter but missus Carruthers had only just left him when he saw Olivia come into the rose garden with Colonel Grey He watched them idly and perceived that for the time being at any rate Olivia had lost her strained and anxious air She was plainly enough absorbed wholly absorbed in Grey She had eyes only for him and mister Flexen suspected that her ears were at the moment deaf to everything but the sound of his voice They did look a well matched pair It occurred to him that he might as well again question Olivia about her husband s possible intrigue with another woman and be done with it There could be no harm in Colonel Grey s hearing the questions As for interrupting their pleasant converse he thought that they would soon recover from the interruption Accordingly he went out to the rose garden Absorbed in one another they did not see him till he was right on them and then he saw a curious happening At the sight of him a sudden simultaneous apprehension filled both their faces and they drew closer together But he had an odd fancy that they did not draw together for mutual protection but mutually to protect Then almost on the instant they were gazing at him with politely inquiring eyes Lady Loudwater smiling He felt that they were intensely on their guard It was uncommonly puzzling He changed his mind about questioning Lady Loudwater in the presence of Grey and asked if she could spare him a minute or two to answer a few questions Oh yes I m sure Colonel Grey will excuse me she said readily But why shouldn t you question Lady Loudwater before me said Colonel Grey coolly but he slapped his thigh nervously with the pair of gloves he was carrying It s always as well for a woman to have a man at hand in an awkward affair like this which may lead to a good deal of unpleasantness if anything goes wrong I m a friend of Lady Loudwater and I don t suppose you fear that anything you discuss before me will go any further mister Flexen He was cool enough but mister Flexen did not miss the note of anxiety in his voice I don t mind at all if Lady Loudwater would like it he said readily But it s rather a delicate matter Oh I should like Colonel Grey to hear everything said Olivia quickly It s about the matter of an entanglement between Lord Loudwater and some lady Are you quite sure there was nothing of the kind before his marriage if not after it said mister Flexen I don t know for certain said Olivia readily But two or three times Lord Loudwater did talk about other women in a boasting sort of way Only it was when he was trying to annoy me so I didn t pay much attention to it And you never tried to find out whether it was the truth or not said mister Flexen No never You see I didn t particularly care said Olivia with unexpected frankness If I d cared I expect it would have been very different And did Lord Loudwater never mention the name of any lady when he was boasting said mister Flexen No Never It was just general boasting And he certainly gave me to understand that it was two or three not one said Olivia Have you any suspicion that he had any particular lady in mind any of your common friends for example some one who has stayed at the Castle said mister Flexen None at all I haven t the slightest idea who it could have been It must have been some one I don t know or I should have been nearly sure to notice something said Olivia Can you tell me any one who might know Olivia shook her head and said No I don t know any friend of my husband well enough to say He never told me who his chief friends were It never occurred to me that he had an intimate friend I always thought he hadn t in fact I tell you what you might inquire of Outhwaite you know the man I mean the man who used always to be getting fined for furious driving He was a friend of Loudwater the only friend I ever heard him mention indeed If he ever confided in any one that would be the most likely man said Colonel Grey Thank you That s an idea I ll certainly try him said mister Flexen and he turned as if to go But Olivia stopped him saying Do you think then that a woman did it mister Flexen Well there is a certain amount of evidence which lends some colour to that theory but I don t want any one to know that said mister Flexen And then he could have sworn that he heard Olivia breathe a faint sigh of relief But Colonel Grey broke in in a tone of some acerbity and more anxiety It s nonsense to talk of any one having done it in face of the medical evidence any one that is but Loudwater himself He committed suicide You think him a likely man to have committed suicide do you said mister Flexen Yes A man of his utterly uncontrollable temper is the very man to commit suicide said Colonel Grey firmly It is of course always possible that he committed suicide said mister Flexen in a non committal tone It s most probable said Colonel Grey curtly What do you think Lady Loudwater said Flexen Why I haven t thought much about it I always I but now I do think about it I I think it s not unlikely said Olivia in a tone of no great conviction And he was so frightfully upset too that night not that he had any reason to be but he was Ah well my duty is to investigate the matter till there isn t a shadow of doubt left said mister Flexen in a pleasant voice I daresay that I shall get to the bottom of it With that he left them and went back into the Castle At the sight of his back Olivia breathed so deep a sigh of relief that Grey winced at it If only it could be proved that Egbert did commit suicide she said wistfully I don t see any chance of it said Colonel Grey gloomily Then he added in a tone of but faint hope Unless he wrote to one of his friends that he intended to commit suicide Olivia shook her head and said Egbert wouldn t do that He hated letter writing Besides if he had we should have heard of it by now said Grey The friend might be away said Olivia I know that mister Outhwaite was in France That s hoping too much said Grey They strolled on in silence his eyes on her thoughtful face which under mister Flexen s questioning had again grown anxious Then he said This sun is awfully hot Let s stroll through the wood to the pavilion It will be delightful there Very well said Olivia smiling at him mister Flexen went back to his room rang for Holloway and bade him find mister Manley if he were in and ask him to come to him Holloway went and presently returned to say that mister Manley had gone out to lunch but left word that he would be back to dinner mister Flexen therefore gave his mind to the consideration of his talk with Colonel Grey and Olivia and the longer he considered it the more their attitude intrigued and puzzled him They certainly knew something about the murder something of the first importance What could it be Again he asked himself could either or both of them have actually had a hand in it It seemed improbable but he was used to the improbable happening He could not believe that either of them would have dreamt of committing murder to gain a personal end to save themselves for example from the injuries with which Lord Loudwater had threatened them But would they commit murder to save some one else one to save the other for example from such an injury Murder was indeed a violent measure but mister Flexen was inclined to think that either of them might take it mister Manley s confident declaration that they were both creatures of strong emotions had impressed him He felt that Colonel Grey under the impulse to save Lady Loudwater would stick at very little and he was used to violence and to hold human life cheap On the other hand Lady Loudwater would go a long way a very long way if any one she loved were threatened The fact that she had good Italian blood in her veins was very present in his mind Again it would be a matter of sudden impulse not of grave deliberation The irritating sound of Lord Loudwater s snores and the sight of the gleaming knife blade on the library table coming together after their painful and moving discussion of their dangers might awake the impulse to be rid of him at any cost in full strength He was not disposed to underrate the suggestion of that naked knife blade on them when they were strung to such a height of emotion Again he asked himself had either of them murdered Lord Loudwater to save the other At any rate they knew who had committed the murder Of that he was sure Could they be shielding a third person If so who was that third person CHAPTER XII mister Flexen sat pondering this question of a third person for a good twenty minutes It could not be Hutchings There would be no reason to shield Hutchings unless they had instigated or employed him to commit the murder and that was out of the question He was not sure indeed that Hutchings was not the murderer the snores and the knife were as likely to have excited the murderous impulse in him as in them He was quite sure that if doctor Thornhill had been able to swear that the wound was not self inflicted he could have secured the conviction of Hutchings But it was incredible that Lady Loudwater or Colonel Grey had employed him to commit the murder No if they were shielding a third person it must be the mysterious unknown woman who had come with such swift secrecy and so wholly disappeared It grew clearer and clearer that there most probably lay that solution of the problem If that woman herself had not murdered Lord Loudwater as seemed most likely she might very well give him the clue for which he was groping He must find her and of course sooner or later he would find her But the sooner he found her the sooner would the problem be solved and his work done Till he found her he would not find its solution It still seemed to him probable that somewhere among Lord Loudwater s papers there was information which would lead to her discovery and he went into the library to confer again with mister Carrington on the matter He found him discussing the arrangements for tomorrow s funeral with missus Carruthers and Wilkins When they had gone he said Did you come across any information about that mysterious woman in the rest of the papers Not a word said mister Carrington I ve been thinking that you might come across traces of her in his pass books payments or an allowance I thought of that But there s only one passbook the one in use Lord Loudwater doesn t seem to have kept them after they were filled And Manley knows all about this one he wrote out every cheque in it for Loudwater and he is quite sure that there were no cheques of any size for a woman among them That s disappointing said mister Flexen What about the cheques to Self Are there any large ones among them No They re all on the small side distinctly on the small side cheques for ten pounds and very few of them It is queer that it should be so difficult to find any information about a woman who played such an important part in his life said mister Flexen gloomily It s not so very uncommon said the lawyer Well let s hope that the advertisement she ll get from my newspaper friends will bring her to light said mister Flexen It would be a pleasant surprise to me to find them serving some useful purpose said mister Carrington grimly mister Flexen laughed and said You re prejudiced It s about time to dress for dinner mister Carrington rose with alacrity and said anxiously I hope to goodness Loudwater didn t quarrel with his chef I ve no reason to think so The food s excellent said mister Flexen mister Manley joined them at dinner wearing his best air of a discreet and indulgent man of the world and confident of making himself valued He was in very good spirits for he had persuaded Helena to marry him that day month and was rejoicing in his success He did not tell mister Flexen or mister Carrington of his good fortune He felt that it would hardly interest them since neither of them knew Helena or was intimate with himself But inspired by this success he took the lead in the conversation and showed himself inclined to be somewhat patronizing to two men outside the sphere of imaginative literature It was mister Flexen who broached the subject of the murder After they had talked of the usual topics for a while he said By the way Manley did you hear Lord Loudwater snore after Hutchings went into the library or before So you know that I saw Hutchings in the hall that night said mister Manley It s wonderful how you find things out I didn t tell you and I should have thought that I was the only person awake in the front part of the Castle I suppose that some one saw him getting his cigarettes from the butler s pantry So that was the reason he gave you for being in the Castle said mister Flexen Well was it after or before you spoke to him that you heard Lord Loudwater snore mister Manley hesitated thinking then he said I can t remember at the moment You see I was downstairs some little time I found an evening paper in the dining room and looked through it there I might have heard him from there You can t remember said mister Flexen in a tone of disappointment Not at the moment said mister Manley Is it important Yes very important It would probably help me to fix the time of Lord Loudwater s death I see A lot may turn on that said mister Manley thoughtfully Yes You can see how immensely it helps to have a fact like that fixed said mister Flexen Yes of course said mister Manley Well I must try to remember I daresay I shall if I keep the fact in my mind gently and do not try to wrench the recollection out of it You know how hard it is to remember a thing if it hasn t caught your attention fairly when it happened Yes said mister Flexen But I hope to goodness you ll remember it quickly It may be of the greatest use to me Ah yes I must said mister Manley giving him a queer look I was forgetting said mister Flexen understanding the thought behind the queer look You d hardly believe it mister Carrington but mister Manley told me at the very beginning of this business that he was not going to help in any way to discover the murderer of Lord Loudwater because he considered that murderer a benefactor of society But I never heard of such a thing cried the lawyer in a tone of astonished disapproval Such a course might be possible in the case of some minor crime or in a person intimately connected with the criminal in the case of a major crime But for an outsider to pursue such a course in the case of a murder is unheard of absolutely unheard of I daresay it isn t common said mister Manley in a tone of modest satisfaction But I am modern I claim the right of private judgment in all matters of morality Oh that won t do that won t do at all cried the shocked lawyer There would be hopeless confusion in fact if everybody did that the law might easily become a dead letter absolutely a dead letter But there s no fear of everybody doing anything of the kind The ruck of men have no private judgment to claim the right of They take whatever s given them in the way of morals by their pastors and masters Only exceptional people have ideas of their own to carry out and there are not enough exceptional people to make much difference said mister Manley calmly But all the same such principles are subversive of society absolutely subversive of society said mister Carrington warmly and his square massive face was growing redder I daresay said mister Manley amiably But if any one chooses to have them and act on them what are you going to do about it For example if I happened to know who had murdered Lord Loudwater and did not choose to tell how could you make me If there were many people with such principles about society would soon find out a way of protecting itself said the lawyer in the accents of one whose tenderest sensibilities are being outraged It would have to have recourse to torture then said mister Manley cheerfully But let me remind you that it is a crime to be an accessory before or after the fact to murder said the lawyer in a tone of some triumph Oh I m not going as far as that said mister Manley A man might very well approve of a murder without being willing to further it mister Flexen laughed and said I understand mister Manley s point of view Sometimes I have felt inclined to be judge as well as investigator especially in the East And you followed your inclination said mister Manley with amiable certainty Perhaps perhaps not said mister Flexen smiling at him The war has upset everything I never heard such ideas before the war grumbled the lawyer There was a silence as Holloway brought in the coffee and cigars When he had gone mister Flexen said in an almost fretful tone It s an extraordinary thing that Lord Loudwater kept so few papers I don t know said mister Manley carelessly During the six months I ve been here we were never stuck for want of a paper He seemed to me to have kept all that were necessary It s the destroying of his pass books that seems so odd to me said the lawyer A man must often want to know how he spent his money in a given year I m sure I never want to said mister Manley And certainly pass books are unattractive looking objects to have about All the same they might have proved very useful in this case said mister Flexen Of course they wouldn t tell us anything we shall not find out eventually But they might have saved us a lot of time and trouble They might put us on to the track of another firm of lawyers who did certain business for Lord Loudwater Well no one but mister Carrington s firm did any business for him during the last six months said mister Manley rising I feel inclined to take advantage of the moonlight and go for a stroll So I will leave you to go on working on the murder Good bye for the present He sauntered out of the room and when the door closed behind him the lawyer said earnestly I do hate a crank The words came from his heart Oh I don t think he s a crank said mister Flexen in an indulgent tone He s too intelligent that s all There s nothing so dangerous as too much intelligence It s always a nuisance to other people said the lawyer Do you think he really knows anything He knows something nothing of real importance I think said mister Flexen But as I expect you ve noticed he likes to feel himself of importance And whatever knowledge he has helps him to feel important It s a harmless hobby By the way is there anything in the way of insanity in Lady Loudwater s family No I never heard of any and I should have been almost certain to hear if there were any said the lawyer in some surprise That s all right said mister Flexen By the way how did you get on with the newspaper men said the lawyer I put them in the way of making themselves very useful to me and at the same time I gave them exactly the kind of thing they wanted I think too that when they ve run the story I gave them for all it s worth they ll very likely drop the case unless that is we ve really got it cleared up I was careful to point out to them that the verdict of the coroner s jury was a piece of pig headed idiocy and they ll see the unlikelihood of securing a conviction for murder with the medical evidence as it is unless we have an absolutely clear case But all the same there s going to be a tremendous fuss in the papers said mister Carrington in the tone of dissatisfaction of the lawyer who is always doing his best to keep tremendous fusses out of the papers Oh yes That was necessary It s out of that fuss that I hope to get the evidence which will settle once and for all in my mind at any rate the question whether Lord Loudwater was murdered or not But surely you haven t any doubt about that said the lawyer sharply Just a trifle and I may as well get rid of it said mister Flexen mister Manley took his hat and stick and went leisurely out of the front door of the Castle He paused on the steps for half a minute to admire the moonlit night and murmur a few lines from Keats Then he strolled down the drive whistling the tune of an American coon song But presently the whistle died on his lips as he considered mister Flexen s keen desire to discover the other firm of lawyers who had done business for Lord Loudwater He could not but think when he put this keenness of mister Flexen beside Helena s strange anxiety that she had done something of which she had not told him something that might have drawn suspicion on her He did not see what she could have done but there it was He had a feeling an intuition that it was she whom mister Flexen was seeking and he prided himself on his intuition Well the longer they were finding Shepherd the lawyer who had handled the business of her allowance the better he would be pleased He had certainly done his best to block their way At the same time they might at any moment learn who he was It was fortunate therefore that Shepherd had a job in Mesopotamia and that his business was closed down for the present If they did learn who he was they would still be a long while before they obtained any information about Helena from him mister Manley s keen desire was that the first excitement about the murder should have died down before they did get it He was a firm believer in the soothing effect of time The discovery of Helena s allowance if it were made now might cause her considerable annoyance if not actual trouble Coming in six weeks time or even a month s time it would be far less likely to make that trouble He wondered what it could be that she had done to bring herself under suspicion Remembering what she had said of her determination to discuss the halving of her allowance with the dead man and her remark that she had such a knowledge of his habits that she could make sure of having an interview with him to discuss it it seemed not unlikely that she had gone to see him on the very night of his murder and that some one had seen her If it were so he hoped that she would tell him so that they might together devise some way of preventing harm coming from the accident that the interview had occurred at such an unfortunate hour He felt sure that he would be able to devise such a way He never blinked the fact of his extreme ingenuity He found her strolling in her garden with the anxious frown which had awakened his uneasiness still on her brow Her face grew brighter at the sight of him and presently he had smoothed the frown quite away Again he realized that the murder of Lord Loudwater had had a softening effect on her Before it they had been much more on equality now she rather clung to him He found it pleasing much more the natural attitude of a woman towards a man of his imagination and knowledge of life He was properly gracious and protective with her The next morning the Daily Wire opened his eyes and confirmed his apprehensions The murder of a nobleman is an uncommon occurrence and the editor of that paper showed every intention of making the most of it The visit of the unknown woman to Lord Loudwater and their quarrel treated with the nervous picturesqueness of which mister Gregg was so famous a master formed the main and interesting part of the article When he came to the end of it mister Manley whistled ruefully He had no difficulty whatever in picturing to himself the indignant and violent wrath of Helena and he could not conceive for a moment that Lord Loudwater had been able to withstand it Of course he would be violent too but with a much less impressive violence Lord Loudwater had been lavish in the matter of newspapers he was a rich man and they had been his only reading mister Manley read the report of the inquest in all the chief London dailies and found in the Daily Planet another nervously picturesque article on the visit of the mysterious woman from the nervously picturesque pen of mister Douglas Here was certainly a pretty kettle of fish He could not doubt that the woman was Helena It explained Flexen s questioning him whether he had any knowledge of an entanglement between Lord Loudwater and a woman and Flexen s keen desire to find some other firm of lawyers who might have been called in to deal with such an entanglement But he could not for a moment bring himself to believe that there could have ever been any need for Helena to have recourse to the knife He could not see Lord Loudwater resisting her when she became really angry he must have given way None the less he did not underestimate the awkwardness the danger even of her having paid that visit and had that quarrel at such an unfortunate hour He had matter enough for earnest thought during the funeral It was a large funeral though there were not many funeral guests Five ladies an aunt and four cousins of Lord Loudwater s own generation came down from London The younger generation was either on its way back from the war or too busy with its work to find the time to attend the funeral of a distant relation whom if they had chanced to meet him they neither liked nor respected But there was a show of carriages from all the big houses within a radius of nine miles which more than made up for the fewness of the guests Also there was a crowd of middle and lower class spectators who considered the funeral of a murdered nobleman a spectacle indeed worth attending It was composed of women children old men and a few wounded private soldiers Olivia attended the funeral wearing a composed but rather pathetic air owing to the fact that her brow was most of the time knitted in a pondering troubled frown Lady Croxley Lord Loudwater s aged aunt rode with her in the first coach She was a loquacious soul and whiled away the journey to and from the church which is over a mile from the Castle with a panegyric on her dead nephew and an astonished dissertation on the strange fact that Olivia had not had a woman with her during this sad time She ascribed her abstinence from this stimulant to her desire to be alone with her grief Olivia encouraged her harmless babble by a vague murmur at the right points and continued to look pathetic It was all her aunt by marriage needed and it left Olivia free to think her own thoughts She gave but few of them to her dead husband the living claimed her attention mister Manley wore an air of gloom far deeper than his sense of the fitness of things would in the ordinary course of events have demanded It was the result of the nervously picturesque English which had flowed with such ease from the forceful pens of mister Douglas and mister Gregg mister Carrington who rode with him and from attending the funerals of many clients had acquired as good a funeral air as any man in his profession found his gloom exaggerated He was all the more scandalized therefore when as they were nearing the Castle mister Manley suddenly cried By Jove and rubbed his hands together with a face uncommonly radiant He had had the cheering thought that he had the Loudwater case if ever it should come to a trial wholly in his hands He had but to remember having heard Lord Loudwater snore at say a few minutes to twelve to break it down He did not conceive that he would encounter any difficulty in remembering that if it should be necessary The solemnity of the funeral and mister Carrington s conversation in the coach he had talked about the weather had not weakened his resolve that if he could help it no one should swing for the murder This realization of his position of vantage made him eager to go to Helena to set her mind at rest should she as he thought most likely be greatly troubled by the fact that her untimely visit to the murdered man was known But he had to lunch at the Castle with the funeral guests They were interested beyond measure in the murder and full of questions He talked to them with a darkly mysterious air and made a deep impression of discreet sagacity on their simple minds He observed that Olivia appeared to have been afflicted more deeply by the funeral than he had expected She looked harassed and seemed to find the lunch rather a strain He observed also that she did not as did her guests who were so slightly acquainted with him pay any tribute to the character of her dead husband mister Flexen was not lunching with them He had spent an expectant morning waiting for the local effects of the story in the Wire and Planet and in having that story spread far and wide by Inspector Perkins and his two men among the villagers who only saw a paper in the public houses of the neighbourhood on a Sunday He hoped if it had been a local affair to have information about it in the course of the day Up to lunchtime the newspaper advertisement of the mysterious woman had proved as fruitless as the earlier private inquiries But he remained hopeful It was past three before mister Manley escaped from the funeral guests and betook himself at a brisk pace to Helena s house As he went he made up his mind that the quality most fitting the occasion was discretion He had better not let it appear that he was sure that she was the mysterious woman of the Daily Wire He must make his announcement that in the event of any one being brought to trial for the murder of Lord Loudwater his evidence could break down any case for the prosecution and that he would see that it did break it down appear as casual as possible But at the same time he must make it quite clear to her that he could secure her safety He felt that though she might think his firm resolve that no one should swing for the murder quixotic she would perceive that it was only in keeping with his generous nature He had expected to find her much more disturbed by the nervously picturesque articles of mister Gregg and mister Douglas than she appeared Indeed she seemed to him much less under a strain much less nervous than she had been the night before None the less he was careful to reassure her wholly by the announcement of his discovery of the important nature of the evidence he could give before he said anything about those articles When he did tell her that he could break down any case for the prosecution she did not at once confess that she was the woman of whose visit to Lord Loudwater those stories told they did not even discuss the question which had seemed so important to the Daily Wire who that woman was They contented themselves with discussing the question who could have seen her He admired her spirit in not telling him her readiness to forgo his comfort and support before the absolute need for them was upon her Her force of character was what he most admired in her and this was a striking example of it His own character he knew was rather subtile and delicate than strong He was more than ever alive to the advantage of having her to lean upon in the difficult career that lay before him mister Flexen was disappointed that the advertisement of the mysterious woman in the Wire and the Planet brought no information about her during the morning After lunch mister Carrington returned to London At half past three mister Flexen telegraphed to Scotland Yard to ask if any one had given them information about the woman he was seeking No one had Then he realized that he was unreasonably impatient Whoever had the information would probably think the matter over and perhaps confer with friends before coming forward In the meantime he would make inquiries of James Hutchings He drove to the gamekeeper s cottage to find James Hutchings sitting on a chair outside it and reading the Planet He perceived that he looked puzzled Also he perceived that he still wore a strained hunted air more strained and hunted by far than at their last talk He walked briskly up to him and said Good afternoon I see that you re reading the story of Lord Loudwater s murder in the Planet It occurred to me that you might very likely be able to tell me who the lady who visited Lord Loudwater on the night of his murder was At any rate you can probably make a guess at who she was Hutchings shook his head and said gloomily No sir I can t I don t know who it was and I can t guess I wish I could I d tell you like a shot That s odd said mister Flexen again disappointed I should have thought it impossible for your master to have been on intimate terms with a lady without your coming to hear of it You ve always been his butler Yes sir But this is the kind of thing as a valet gets to know about more than a butler letters left about or in pockets you know sir But his lordship never could keep a valet long enough for him to learn anything He was worse with valets than with any one I see said mister Flexen in a vexed tone But still I should have thought you d have heard something from some one even if the matter had not come under your own eyes Gossip moves pretty widely about the countryside Oh this didn t happen in the country sir not in this part of the country anyhow It must have been a London woman said Hutchings with conviction If she d lived about here I must have heard about it It was a lady you must know The papers do not bring that fact out My informant is quite sure that it was a lady said mister Flexen That s no elp sir said Hutchings despondently She must have come down by train and gone away by train She would have probably been noticed at the station But she wasn t Besides she could not have walked back to the station in time to catch the last train I m sure of it Then she must have come in a car sir That is always possible said mister Flexen There was a pause Then Hutchings burst out You may depend on it that she did it sir There isn t a shadow of a doubt You get her and you ll get the murderess He spoke with the feverish unbalanced vehemence of a man whose nerves are on edge You think so do you said mister Flexen I m sure of it dead certain cried Hutchings It s a long way from visiting a gentleman late at night and quarrelling with him to murdering him said mister Flexen And she went it You mark my words sir She went it I don t say that she came to do it But she saw that knife lying handy on the library table and she did it said Hutchings with the same vehemence Any one who passed through the library would see that knife said mister Flexen carelessly but his eyes were very keen on Hutchings face Hutchings was pale and he went paler He tried to stammer something but his voice died in his throat Well I m sorry you can t give me any information about this lady Good afternoon said mister Flexen and he turned on his heel and went back to the car He was impressed by Hutchings air and manner Of course believing himself to be suspected the man was under a strain But would the strain on him be so heavy as it plainly was if he knew himself to be innocent And then his eagerness to fasten the crime on the mysterious woman It had been astonishingly intense almost hysterical When he reached the Castle he found Inspector Perkins awaiting him with a small package which had come by special messenger from Scotland Yard It contained enlarged photographs of the fingerprints on the handle of the knife They were all curiously blurred The murderer had worn a glove CHAPTER XIII mister Flexen studied the photographs and the report which stated this fact with a lively interest and a growing sense of its great importance For one thing it settled the question of suicide for good and all Lord Loudwater had worn no glove Also it strengthened the case against the mysterious woman She had come apparently from a distance and probably in a motor car If she had driven herself down she would be wearing gloves Also only a woman would be likely to be wearing gloves on a warm summer night Indeed coming from a distance by train or car she would certainly wear gloves She would not dream of coming to an interview with a man with whom she had been intimate and whom she wished to bend to her will with hands dirtied by a journey If that gloved hand had not been the hand of the mysterious woman then the murder had been premeditated and the murderer or murderess had put on gloves with the deliberate purpose of leaving no finger prints It was the woman In all probability it was the woman Then mister Flexen s sub conscious mind began to jog his intellect Somewhere in his memory there was a fact he had noted about gloves and that fact was now important in its bearing on the case He set about trying to recall it to his mind He was not long about it Of a sudden he remembered that he had been a trifle surprised to perceive that Colonel Grey had been carrying gloves when he had found him in the rose garden with Lady Loudwater His surprise had passed quickly enough He had decided that the life in the trenches had not weakened Colonel Grey s habit as a fastidious man about town of taking care of his hands He remembered too that at his first interview with him he had observed that his hands were uncommonly well shaped and well kept He did not suppose that Colonel Grey had come to the Castle on the night of the murder wearing gloves with the deliberate intention of killing Lord Loudwater without leaving finger prints But suppose that as he came away from a distressing interview with Lady Loudwater the knife on the library table had caught his eye and his gloves had been in his pocket mister Flexen took out his pipe lit it and moved to an easy chair to let his brain work more easily He tabulated his facts Colonel Grey had gone through the library window at about twenty minutes past ten Hutchings had gone through the library window at half past ten The mysterious woman had gone through the library window at about ten minutes to eleven She came out of the library window at about a quarter past eleven after a violent quarrel with Lord Loudwater Colonel Grey came out of the library window at about twenty five minutes past eleven after a distressing interview with Lady Loudwater apparently in a very bad temper James Hutchings had come out of the library window at about half past eleven also if William Roper might be believed furious Lady Loudwater had come through the library window at a quarter to twelve and gone back through it at five minutes to twelve Each of the last three had passed within fifteen feet of Lord Loudwater dead or alive both on entering and on coming out of the Castle The mysterious woman had actually been in the smoking room with him If Lady Loudwater s statement that she heard her husband snoring at five minutes to twelve were to be accepted neither Colonel Grey Hutchings nor the mysterious woman could have committed the murder unless always one of them had returned later and committed it That possibility must be borne in mind But mister Flexen did not accept her statement If he were to accept it she herself at once became the most likely person to have committed the crime It was always possible that she had She certainly had the best reasons of any one as far as he knew for committing it The evidence of mister Manley about the time at which he heard Lord Loudwater snore was of the first importance But how to get it out of him mister Flexen had a strong feeling that not only would mister Manley afford no help to bring the murderer of Lord Loudwater to justice but that owing to the vein of Quixotry in his nature he was capable of helping the murderer to escape That he could do He had only to declare that he heard Lord Loudwater snore at twelve o clock to break down the case against any one of the four persons between whom the crime obviously lay mister Flexen had a shrewd suspicion that mister Manley would fail to remember at what time he had last heard Lord Loudwater s snores till the police had set about securing the conviction of one of the possible murderers Then when the case of the police against the murderer was revealed he would come forward and break it down He had decided that mister Manley was a sentimentalist and he knew well the difficulty of dealing with sentimentalists Moreover mister Manley was animated by a grudge against the murdered man mister Flexen could quite conceive that he might presently be regarding perjury as a duty he had had experience of the queer way in which the mind of the sentimentalist works It appeared to him that everything depended on his finding the mysterious woman That afternoon Elizabeth Twitcher determined to go to see James Hutchings She had not seen him since their interview on the night of the murder In the ordinary course she would not have dreamt of going to him after that interview for it had left them on such a footing that further advances repentant advances must come from him But there were pressing reasons why she should not wait for him to make the advances which he would in ordinary circumstances have made after his sulkiness had abated All her fellow servants and all the villagers who were not members of the Hutchings family were assured that he had murdered Lord Loudwater Three of the maids who were jealous of her greater prettiness had with ill dissembled spitefulness congratulated her on having dismissed him before the murder her mother had also congratulated her on that fact Elizabeth Twitcher was the last girl in the world to desert a man in misfortune and considering James Hutchings temper she could only consider the murder a misfortune Besides she had been very fond of him she was very fond of him still and the fact that he was in great trouble was making him dearer to her Moreover every one who spoke to her about him told her that he was looking miserable beyond words Her heart went out to him None the less she did not go to see him without a struggle She felt that he ought to come to her However her pride had been beaten in that struggle by her fondness and her pity even more by her pity When she knocked at the door of his father s cottage James Hutchings himself opened it and his harassed hang dog air settled in her mind for good and all the question of his guilt She was not daunted indeed a sudden anger against Lord Loudwater for having brought about his own murder flamed up in her Like every one else who had known him she could feel no pity for him James Hutchings showed no pleasure whatever at the sight of her Indeed he scowled at her Come to gloat over me have you he growled bitterly Don t be silly she said sharply What should I want to do a thing like that for Is your father in No he isn t said James Hutchings sulkily but his eyes gazed at her hungrily He showed no intention of inviting her to enter Therefore she pushed past him walked across the kitchen sat down in the window seat and surveyed him He shut the door turned and gazed at her scowling uncertainly Then she said gently You re looking very poorly Jim I didn t think you d be the one to tell of my being in the Castle that night he cried bitterly It wasn t me she said quietly It was that little beast Jane Pittaway She heard us talking in the drawing room Oh that was it was it he said more gently Then scowling again he cried fiercely I ll wring her neck That s enough of that she said sharply You ve talked a lot too much about wringing people s necks And a lot of good it s done you Oh I know you believe I did it just like everybody else But I tell you I didn t I swear I didn t he cried loudly with a vehemence which did not convince her Of course you didn t she said in a soothing voice But what are you going to do if they try to make out that you did What are you going to tell them He gazed at her with miserable eyes and said in a miserable voice God knows what I m to tell them It isn t a matter of telling them It s how to make em believe it These people never believe anything the police never do She gazed at him thoughtfully with eyes compassionate and full of tenderness They were a balm to his unhappy spirit The hardness slowly vanished from his face It became merely troubled He walked quickly across the room dropped into the seat beside her and put an arm round her You re a damned sight too good for me Lizzie he said in a gentler voice than she had ever heard him use before and he kissed her Poor Jim she said And again Poor Jim He trembled breathing quickly and held her tight After a while he regained control of himself and sat upright But he still held her tightly to him with his right arm They began to discuss his plight and how he might best defend himself She was fully as fearful as he But she did not show it She must cheer him up and she kept insisting that the police could not fix the murder on him that they had nothing to go upon If they had they would have already arrested him Certainly they knew what the servants and the village people were saying But that was just talk There wasn t any evidence there couldn t be any evidence Her support and encouragement put a new spirit into him He had been so alone against the world His own family though they had loudly and fiercely protested his innocence to their friends and enemies in the village had not expressed this faith in him to him Indeed his father had expressed their real belief when he said to him gloomily I always told you that damned temper of yours would get you into trouble Jim Then Elizabeth gave him his tea After it they talked calmly with an actual approach to cheerfulness till it was time for her to return to the Castle to dress Olivia s hair for dinner Then she would have it that he should escort her back to the Castle She declared truly enough that he was doing himself no good by moping at the cottage that people would say that he dare not show himself He must hold his head up She insisted also that they should take the long way round through the village that people should see them together She insisted that he should look cheerful and talk to her all the length of the village street The looking cheerful helped to lighten his spirit yet more As they went through the village she kept looking up at him in an affectionate fashion and smiling The village was indeed taken aback It had made up its mind that James Hutchings was a pariah to be shunned It was not only taken aback it was annoyed It had no wish that its belief that James Hutchings had murdered Lord Loudwater should be in any way unsettled missus Roper the mother of William Roper and a lifelong enemy of the Hutchings family summed up the feeling of her neighbours about the behaviour of James Hutchings and Elizabeth Brazen I call it she said bitterly Before they reached the Castle Elizabeth had come to feel that during the last three days James Hutchings had changed greatly and for the better She had an odd fancy that murdering his master had improved his character the fear of the police had softened him Not once did he try to domineer over her That domineering had been the source of their not infrequent quarrels for she was not at all of a temper to endure it Olivia and Grey had again spent their afternoon in the pavilion in the East wood Their bearing at times had been oddly like that of Elizabeth and James Hutchings Now and again they had lapsed from their absorption in one another into a like fearfulness But unlike Elizabeth and James Hutchings neither of them said a word about the murder of Lord Loudwater But both of them seemed a little less under a strain than they had been This new factor of a quarrel with an unknown woman seemed to open a loophole Olivia s colouring had lost some of its warmth the contours of her face were less rounded Grey had manifestly taken a step backwards in his convalescence his face was thinner even a little haggard there was a somewhat strained watchfulness in his eyes They could not tear themselves away from the pavilion till the last moment and he walked back with her as far as the shrubbery on the edge of the East lawn and there they parted after she had promised to meet him there that evening at nine As Olivia came into her sitting room Elizabeth and James Hatchings came to the back door of the Castle She did not say good bye at once of set purpose she lingered talking to him that the other servants might understand clearly that her attitude to him was definitely fixed But at last she held out her hand and said I must be getting along to her ladyship or she ll be waiting for me James Hutchings looked round considered the coast sufficiently clear caught her to him kissed her and said huskily You re just a ministering angel Lizzie and there s more sense in your little finger than in all my fat head I m feeling a different man and I ll baulk them yet Of course you will Jim said Elizabeth and she opened the door Lord how I wish I was coming in with you back in my old place I should be seeing you most of the time he said wistfully Elizabeth stopped short flushing and looked at him with suddenly excited eyes At his words a great thought had come into her mind Wait a minute Jim Wait till I come back she said somewhat breathlessly and leaving the door open she hurried down the passage She hurried up to her room took off her hat and hurried to Olivia She found her in her sitting room looking through an evening paper to learn if any new fact about the murder had come to light If you please your ladyship James Hutchings has come to ask if your ladyship would like him to come back for the time being till you ve got suited with another butler said Elizabeth in a rather breathless voice Olivia looked at Elizabeth s flushed excited and hopeful face and smiled Why have you and James made it up Elizabeth she said Yes m lady said Elizabeth and the flush deepened in her cheeks Then go and tell him to come back by all means said Olivia Thank you m lady said Elizabeth in accents of profound gratitude and she ran out of the room Olivia smiled and then she sighed It was pleasant to have given Elizabeth such obviously keen pleasure She never dreamed that Elizabeth and James Hutchings were under the same strain of fear and anxiety as she herself and that she had given them great help in their trouble for Elizabeth saw that the return of James Hutchings to his situation would give the wagging tongues full pause James Hutchings was dumbfounded on receiving the message He stared at Elizabeth with his mouth open Be quick Jim Get your clothes and be back in time to wait on her ladyship at dinner said Elizabeth James Hutchings came out of his stupor Why L L Lizzie you must let me p p put up our b b banns tomorrow he stammered Be off said Elizabeth stamping her foot We can talk about that later When she came from her bath Olivia sent Elizabeth to tell Holloway that she would dine with mister Flexen and mister Manley that evening She had a sudden desire to see more of mister Flexen to weigh him as an antagonist mister Flexen was somewhat surprised to receive the information then considering the terms on which Olivia had been with her husband he found her action natural enough After all she was not a woman of the middle class bound to make a pretence of grieving for a wholly unamiable bully Also he was pleased to dine with so charming a creature as Olivia would be pleasant and stimulating In the course of the evening his wits might rise to the solution of his problem Moreover it would be odd if he did not gain a further valuable insight into her character He was yet more surprised to find James Hutchings still rather pale and haggard but quite cool and master of himself superintending the waiting of Wilkins and Holloway at dinner Also he liked the way in which he spoke to Olivia and looked at her To mister Flexen James Hutchings had the air of the authentic faithful dog He was inclined to a better opinion of him Plainly too Olivia had learned that tongues were wagging against him and had taken this way of checking them It was a generous act At the same time he could very well believe that Olivia might unconsciously of course be on the side of the murderer of such a husband Thanks to mister Manley s invaluable sense of what was fitting there was no constraint about the dinner He had decided that they were three people of the world dining together and the fact that there had been a murder in the house three days before and a funeral in the morning should not be allowed to impair their proper nonchalance At the same time decorum must be preserved there must be no laughter Accordingly he took the conversation in hand and kept it in hand mister Flexen was somewhat astonished at the ability with which he did it now and again he felt as if personally he were performing feats on the loose wire but that thanks to mister Manley he was not going to fall off They talked of the usual subjects on which people who have not a large circle of common acquaintances fall back They all three abused the politicians with perfect sympathy they abused the British drama with perfect sympathy with no less perfect sympathy they abused the Cubists and the Vorticists and the New Poets mister Flexen had an odd feeling that they were behaving with entire naturalness and propriety that their real interest was in the politicians the British drama the Cubists the Vorticists and the New Poets and not at all in the fate of the murderer of the late Lord Loudwater After a while he found himself vying earnestly with mister Manley in an effort to display himself as a man of at least equal insight and intelligence Olivia did not talk much herself She never did But she displayed a quickness of understanding and soundness of judgment which stimulated them All the while she was watching and weighing mister Flexen He never once perceived it Plainly enough the talk did her good She had come to dinner looking mister Flexen thought rather under the water Before long she was looking as she had resolved to look her usual self When at a few minutes to nine she left them she was looking the most charming and sympathetic creature in the world and what was more a creature without a care When the door closed behind her she seemed to have taken with her a good deal of the brightness of the room mister Flexen dropped back into his chair and frowned In the silence which fell he wondered Plainly she was free enough from care now But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire Then mister Manley said in a tone almost insolent If you think she murdered that red eyed bull in a china shop you re wrong She didn t mister Flexen did not resent his tone Indeed before he could speak it flashed on him that if she had done so and Justice was depending on him himself to bring her to it it was depending on a somewhat frail reed He liked mister Manley for his readiness to fight for her cause He laughed gently and said I wasn t thinking so I was only wondering Then his eyes on mister Manley s face turned very keen and he said I believe you know a good deal more about the affair than I do if you liked to speak It seemed to him that for a moment mister Manley s desire to make himself valued struggled with his desire to be accurate Then the young man shook his head and said in a tone of surprise But what nonsense You know so much more about it than I do Why you must have all the threads in your hands by now I never even dreamt of the Daily Wire s mysterious woman Not quite all yet But they re coming all right said mister Flexen with a confidence he was far from feeling James Hutchings coming into the room to fetch cigarettes for Olivia interrupted them I m glad to see you back again Hutchings said mister Manley in a tone of hearty congratulation Your going away for a trifle after all the years you ve been here was a silly business Thank you sir said Hutchings gratefully When Hutchings had gone mister Flexen said It s all very well your talking but it was you who suggested that Lady Loudwater was a woman of strong primitive emotions with a strain of Italian blood in her I never suggested for a moment that she was a woman of primitive emotions mister Manley protested with some vehemence But the emotions of all women are primitive said mister Flexen Not the emotion excited in them by beauty said mister Manley with chivalrous warmth And hang it all Does she look like a woman to commit murder Not on her own account certainly said mister Flexen And on whose account should she commit murder cried mister Manley mister Flexen shrugged his shoulders I said you knew ten times as much about the business as I do said mister Manley in a tone of triumph CHAPTER XIV mister Flexen awoke next morning hopeful of news of the mysterious woman But the letters addressed to him at the Castle and those brought over from the office of the Chief Constable at Low Wycombe brought none 
6875-76999-0001	train-other-500	After breakfast still hopeful he telephoned to Scotland Yard
none	none	 No information had reached it He perceived clearly that the case was at a deadlock till he had that information 
6875-76999-0002	train-other-500	He was sure that it would come sooner or later possibly from the neighbourhood more probably from London It was always possible that mister Carrington might discover that some other lawyer had handled an entanglement for Lord Loudwater
6875-76999-0003	train-other-500	In the meantime his work at the Castle was done He had exhausted its possibilities
none	none	 There was no reason why he should not return to his rooms at Low Wycombe 
6875-76999-0004	train-other-500	After having conferred with Inspector Perkins he decided to leave one of the two detectives to continue making inquiries in the neighbourhood He told James Hutchings that he would like his clothes packed
6875-76999-0005	train-other-500	and went to the rose garden to taken his leave of Olivia and thank her for her hospitality
none	none	 He found her looking very charming in a light summer frock of white lace with a few black bows set about it and he thought that she seemed less under a strain than she had seemed the day before He told her that he was returning to Low Wycombe 
6875-76999-0006	train-other-500	she expressed regret at his going and thanked him for his efforts to clear up the matter of Lord Loudwater s death
none	none	 They parted on the friendliest terms As he came away 
6875-76999-0007	train-other-500	mister Flexen thought it significant that though she had thanked him for his efforts she had made no inquiry about the result of them It might be that she dreaded to hear that they were on the way to be successful He observed that James Hutchings
6875-76999-0008	train-other-500	who watched over his actual departure seemed less pale and haggard than he had been the night before He could well believe that he was glad to see him going without having had him arrested As he drove through the park
6875-76999-0009	train-other-500	he told himself that Lady Loudwater and mister Manley between them would probably break down any case the police might bring against any one but the mysterious woman and they might break down that For his part
6875-76999-0010	train-other-500	he was not going to give much time or attention to it till the mysterious woman had been discovered
none	none	 and he did not think that he would be urged by Headquarters to do so 
6875-76999-0011	train-other-500	after he had sent in his report for mindful of what he had told them of the unsatisfactory nature of doctor Thornhill s evidence mister Gregg in the Daily Wire and mister Douglas on the Daily Planet were dealing with the case in a half hearted manner
6875-76999-0012	train-other-500	though they were still clamouring with some vivacity for the mysterious woman As mister Flexen came out of the park gates he met William Roper on the edge of the West wood stopped the car and walked a few yards down the road to talk to him out of
6875-76999-0013	train-other-500	hearing of the chauffeur I gather that you haven t told any one of what you saw on the night of Lord Loudwater s death
none	none	 or I should have heard of it he said 
6875-76999-0014	train-other-500	Not a word I haven t said William Roper That s good said mister Flexen in a tone of warm approval It might spoil everything to put people on their guard He was more strongly than ever resolved to prevent if he could
6875-76999-0015	train-other-500	the gamekeeper from setting afoot a scandal about Lady Loudwater which could be of no service to the police or any one else Everybody says as James Hutchings did it sir
none	none	 said William Roper H m And what do they say about the mysterious lady the papers are talking about the lady you saw Oh they don t pay no eed to er not about ere sir 
6875-76999-0016	train-other-500	They know Jim Hutchings said William Roper contemptuously I see said mister Flexen Er ladyship and Colonel Grey they still spends a lot of their time in the East wood pavilion But now er ladyship s a widder
none	none	 it s nobody s business but their own I reckon said William Roper 
6875-76999-0017	train-other-500	Of course not of course not said mister Flexen quickly pleased to find that the ferret faced gamekeeper attached so little importance to it I suppose people about here see that They don t know about it
none	none	 Nobody knows about it but me and I don t tell everything I sees unless 
6875-76999-0018	train-other-500	there s something to be got by it A still tongue makes a wise ead I say said William Roper with a somewhat vainglorious air Quite right quite right said mister Flexen heartily Many a man s tongue has lost him a good job
6875-76999-0019	train-other-500	You re right there sir But not me it won t said William Roper with emphasis I can see that You ve too much sense Well I shall keep in touch with you and when the time comes you ll be called on Drink my health Good day
6875-76999-0020	train-other-500	said mister Flexen giving him half a crown He walked back to the car pleased to have done Olivia the service of closing William Roper s mouth at any rate for a time He would talk of course sooner or later probably sooner
6875-76999-0021	train-other-500	But he might have closed his mouth for a fortnight William Roper walked on to the village and went into the Bull and Gate
none	none	 The village was simmering in a very lively fashion 
6875-76999-0022	train-other-500	The return of James Hutchings to his situation at the Castle was a fact with which it could not grapple easily It was bewildered and annoyed
none	none	 William Roper had not as he had assured mister Flexen 
6875-76999-0023	train-other-500	told what he had seen on the night of the murder of Lord Loudwater but he had been dropping hints He dropped more He was a supporter of the theory that James Hutchings was the murderer
6875-76999-0024	train-other-500	because he desired to oust the father of James Hutchings from his post as head gamekeeper That was the reason also of his belief in James Hutchings guilt
6875-76999-0025	train-other-500	He was beginning to enjoy the interest he awakened as the storehouse of undivulged knowledge When mister Flexen had supposed that he would remain silent for a fortnight he had overestimated both his modesty and his reticence
6875-76999-0026	train-other-500	Later in the day the village was further upset by the behaviour of James Hutchings himself He came into the Bull and Gate with an easy air showed himself but little more civil than usual
none	none	 and told the landlord that he had just arranged 
6875-76999-0027	train-other-500	that the parson should publish the banns of his marriage with Elizabeth Twitcher on the following Sunday The village was staggered This was not the way in which it expected a man who would presently be tried and hanged for murder to behave
6875-76999-0028	train-other-500	In all fairness to James Hutchings it must be said that he would not have acted with this decision of his own accord Elizabeth had bidden him to it urging that a bold front was half the battle
6875-76999-0029	train-other-500	However grave her own doubts of his innocence might be she was resolved that such doubts should if possible be banished from the minds of other people Under her influence
6875-76999-0030	train-other-500	he was already becoming his old self as far as looks went A shade of his usual ruddiness had come back he was losing his haggardness With the going of mister Flexen there came a lull
none	none	 His departure was a relief to Olivia 
6875-76999-0031	train-other-500	to Colonel Grey and to James Hutchings Doubtless he was still working on the case but working at a distance he seemed less of a menace All three of them seemed less under a strain Olivia and Grey spent their hours together
none	none	 in a less feverish eagerness to make the most of them 
6875-76999-0032	train-other-500	Even Helena Truslove when mister Manley told her that mister Flexen had left the Castle said that she was very pleased to hear it She looked very pleased
6875-76999-0033	train-other-500	mister Manley s sense of what was fitting restrained him from asking her the reason of this pleasure He had indeed no great desire to hear the reason of it from her own lips
6875-76999-0034	train-other-500	It was enough for him to guess that she was the mysterious woman He felt no need of her full confidence The Castle seemed to be settling down to its old round the quieter for the loss of Lord Loudwater
6875-76999-0035	train-other-500	His heir in Mesopotamia had been informed of his death by cable But no cable in reply had come from him mister Manley remained at the Castle as secretary to Olivia
6875-76999-0036	train-other-500	who was making preparations leisurely to leave it and settle down in a flat in London Colonel Grey was recovering from his wound with a passable quickness James Hutchings had come to look very much his old self
6875-76999-0037	train-other-500	Thanks to the shock he had had and thanks to Elizabeth he wore a more subdued air and was much more amiable with his fellow servants The Daily Wire the Daily Planet and the rest of the newspapers
6875-76999-0038	train-other-500	had let the Loudwater mystery slip quietly out of their columns mister Flexen was waiting with quiet expectation for information about the unknown woman Since the advertisement the papers had given her had failed to produce that information
6875-76999-0039	train-other-500	he had a London detective working on the life in London before his marriage of the murdered man mister Carrington had found nothing among Lord Loudwater s papers in the office of his firm to throw any light on the matter
6875-76999-0040	train-other-500	The chief actors in the affair regarded the quiet turn it had taken with a timorous satisfaction Not so William Roper William Roper was thoroughly dissatisfied
none	none	 He had been willing enough to hold his tongue because by so doing his unexpected and damning appearance at the trial 
6875-76999-0041	train-other-500	would be the more dramatic and impressive But he was impatient to make that appearance and chafed at the delay Also his prestige was waning The village was losing interest in the mystery
6875-76999-0042	train-other-500	and it no longer looked to him to drop hints as the holder of the secret That did not prevent him from dropping them He would bring up the subject of the murder in order to drop them His acquaintances who wished now to talk about other things
6875-76999-0043	train-other-500	found this practice tiresome They did not hide this feeling Matters came to a climax one evening in the bar of the Bull and Gate William Roper dragged the subject of the murder into a conversation on the high price of groceries
none	none	 and then as usual hinted at the things he could say and he would 
6875-76999-0044	train-other-500	John Pittaway who had been leading the conversation about the high price of groceries turned on him and said with asperity
none	none	 I don t believe as there s anything you can tell us as we don t know or you d ave told it afore this fast enough William Roper 
6875-76999-0045	train-other-500	That s what I ve been thinking this long time said old Bob Carter who had for over forty years made a point of agreeing with the most disagreeable person at the moment in the bar of the Bull and Gate Isn t there You wait an see
6875-76999-0046	train-other-500	You wait till the trial said William Roper Trial There won t be no trial Oo s a goin to be tried
none	none	 They ain t agoin to try Jim Utchings It s plain that er ladyship as set er face against that And wot s more they can t ave much to try im on or they d ave to do it in spite o wot she said 
6875-76999-0047	train-other-500	said John Pittaway in yet more disagreeable accents
none	none	 William Roper was very angry 
6875-76999-0048	train-other-500	This was not to be borne Indeed if John Pittaway were right and there was to be no trial
none	none	 where was his dramatic and impressive appearance at it He had better be dramatic and impressive now Who said as they were goin to try Jim Utchings I never did he growled There was other people went to the Castle that night besides Jim Utchings 
6875-76999-0049	train-other-500	and that mysterierse woman the papers talked about An ow do you know said John Pittaway in a tone of most disagreeable incredulity I know because I seed em said William Roper Saw oo said John Pittaway
6875-76999-0050	train-other-500	Then the whole story he had told mister Flexen burst forth from William Roper s overcharged bosom the story with the embellishments natural to the lapse of time since its first telling No less naturally in the course of the discussion which followed
6875-76999-0051	train-other-500	he told also the story of the luckless kiss in the East wood and the landlord pounced on that as the cause of the quarrel between Lord Loudwater and Colonel Grey at Bellingham William Roper supported his contention
6875-76999-0052	train-other-500	with an embellished account of the interview with Lord Loudwater in which he had informed him of that kiss It was indeed his great hour not as great as the hour he had promised himself at the trial not so public but a great hour
6875-76999-0053	train-other-500	He left the Bull and Gate at closing time that night a man in the estimation of all there whose evidence could hang four of his fellow creatures the great man of the village Next morning the village was indeed simmering
6875-76999-0054	train-other-500	and the scandal rose and spread from it like a stench That very afternoon mister Manley heard it from Helena Truslove and the next morning mister Flexen received two anonymous letters conveying the information to him
6875-76999-0055	train-other-500	and suggesting that Colonel Grey and the Lady Loudwater had between them made away with her husband
none	none	 It is hard to say whether mister Manley or mister Flexen was more annoyed by William Roper s blabbing 
6875-76999-0056	train-other-500	But there was nothing to be done The scandal must run its course
none	none	 mister Flexen did not think that it would find its way into the papers 
6875-76999-0057	train-other-500	local or London None the less he was alive to the danger that a sudden heavy pressure might be put on the police and he might be forced to take ill advised action start a prosecution which would do Lady Loudwater infinite harm
6875-76999-0058	train-other-500	and yet end in a fiasco which would leave the mystery just where it was The one bright spot in the affair
none	none	 was that Lord Loudwater appeared to have left no friends behind him 
6875-76999-0059	train-other-500	who would make it their business to see that he was avenged As long as that avenging was everybody s business it was nobody s business Elizabeth Twitcher was no less disturbed than mister Flexen She felt that Olivia ought to be informed of what was being said
6875-76999-0060	train-other-500	that she might be able to take steps to meet the danger She took counsel with James Hutchings who could not help feeling relieved by this diversion of suspicion and he agreed with her that Olivia should be informed of the scandal at once
none	none	 But it was an uncommonly unpleasant task and she shrank from it Then a happy thought came to James Hutchings and he said Look here let mister Manley do it He s her ladyship s secretary 
6875-76999-0061	train-other-500	and it s the kind of thing he ll do very well He s a tactful young fellow It would be a blessing if he did said Elizabeth with a sigh She paused and added You do speak differently about him to what you used to
6875-76999-0062	train-other-500	Yes I made a mistake about him like as I did about some other people said James Hutchings with a rather shame faced air He behaved very well about seeing me here the night the master was murdered
none	none	 and saying nothing to the police about it An then he congratulated me 
6875-76999-0063	train-other-500	very handsomelike on coming back as butler before mister Flexen He would do it better than I should said Elizabeth Then I ll speak to him about it said James Hutchings He paused a while to kiss Elizabeth then went in search of mister Manley
6875-76999-0064	train-other-500	He learned from Holloway that he had come in about twenty minutes earlier and was in his sitting room
none	none	 He went to him and found him looking through the MS of the play he was writing 
6875-76999-0065	train-other-500	with an unlighted pipe in his mouth If you please sir I thought I d better come and tell you that they re saying in the village that Colonel Grey kissed her ladyship in the East wood on the afternoon of his lordship s death
6875-76999-0066	train-other-500	and his lordship was informed of it and quarrelled with Colonel Grey and then her ladyship and she and Colonel Grey made away with his lordship said James Hutchings I ve heard something about it said mister Manley frowning
6875-76999-0067	train-other-500	and he struck a match Who set this absurd story going William Roper one of the under gamekeepers sir William Roper Ah I know a ferret faced young fellow Yes sir
6875-76999-0068	train-other-500	And we was thinking that her ladyship ought to know about it so as she can put a stop to it at once and you were the proper person to tell her sir said James Hutchings On the instant mister Manley saw himself discharging this unpleasant but important duty
none	none	 with intelligence and tact and he said readily 
6875-76999-0069	train-other-500	I was thinking of doing so and now that I know the lying rascal s name I can do it at once The sooner this kind of thing is stopped the better Thank you sir said Hutchings and with a sigh of relief he left the room
6875-76999-0070	train-other-500	He had reached the top of the stairs when the door of mister Manley s room opened he appeared on the threshold and said Will you send some one to tell William Roper to be here at nine o clock tonight And it wouldn t be a bad idea to drop a hint to any one you send
6875-76999-0071	train-other-500	that William Roper has got himself into serious trouble mister Manley thought quickly Very good sir said James Hutchings and he hurried down the stairs mister Manley did not see Olivia at once
6875-76999-0072	train-other-500	for she was still in the pavilion in the East wood But as soon as she returned he sent a message by Holloway to her that he wished to see her on important business Holloway brought word that she would see him at once
6875-76999-0073	train-other-500	He found her in her sitting room gazing out of the window and she turned quickly at his entrance with inquiring eyes It s a rather unpleasant business and the sooner it s dealt with the better said mister Manley in a brisk businesslike voice
6875-76999-0074	train-other-500	One of the under gamekeepers has been spreading a scandalous and lying story about you and Colonel Grey something about his kissing you in the East wood on the afternoon of Lord Loudwater s death and he has gone on to suggest
6875-76999-0075	train-other-500	or assert I don t know which that you and Colonel Grey had a hand in Lord Loudwater s death The blow she had been expecting had fallen and Olivia paled and her mouth went dry
6875-76999-0076	train-other-500	Which of the under gamekeepers is it she said calmly but with difficulty for her tongue kept sticking to the roof of her mouth A ferret faced rascally looking fellow called William Roper said mister Manley with some heat
6875-76999-0077	train-other-500	Then to save her the effort of speaking he went on Of course you d like him discharged at once The sooner these people understand that their excitement about Lord Loudwater s death is not going to be held an excuse for telling lying stories the better
6875-76999-0078	train-other-500	You will not be troubled by any more of them Olivia looked at him with steady eyes She had recovered herself and was thinking hard mister Manley s certainty about the right method of dealing with the matter was catching
6875-76999-0079	train-other-500	It was better to show a bold front and at once There was no time to consult Antony Grey Yes You re quite right mister Manley Gentle measures are of no use with this kind of scandal monger
6875-76999-0080	train-other-500	William Roper must be discharged at once she said quietly Perhaps you would like me to deal with him It s rather a business for a man mister Manley suggested Yes if you would she said in a grateful tone I will as soon as I can get hold of him
6875-76999-0081	train-other-500	said mister Manley cheerfully He ll make no more mischief about here He went out of the room briskly His confidence was heartening When the door closed behind him Olivia sobbed twice in the reaction from the shock of his announcement
6875-76999-0082	train-other-500	Then she recovered herself and went quietly to her bath She observed Elizabeth s sympathetic manner as she dressed her hair Evidently all the servants as well as the villagers were talking about her
6875-76999-0083	train-other-500	But for its possible dangerous consequences she was indifferent to their talk She was now wholly absorbed in Grey he was the only thing of any importance in her life mister Manley ate his dinner with an excellent appetite
6875-76999-0084	train-other-500	He was pleased with the brisk almost brusque manner in which he had dealt with the matter of William Roper in his interview with Olivia If he had shilly shallied and hummed and hawed about the scandal
none	none	 it would have been so much more unpleasant for her 
6875-76999-0085	train-other-500	He thought too that his practical common sense attitude to the business would probably help her to take it more easily and he was sure that he had advised the best measure to be taken with William Roper
6875-76999-0086	train-other-500	He was smoking a cigar in a great content when at nine o clock Holloway brought him word that William Roper had come mister Manley bade him bring him
none	none	 to him at a quarter past 
6875-76999-0087	train-other-500	He felt that suspense would make William Roper malleable and he intended to hammer him At thirteen minutes past nine he composed his face into a dour truculence an expression to which the heavy conformation of the lower part
6875-76999-0088	train-other-500	lent itself admirably William Roper looking uncommonly ill at ease was ushered in by James Hutchings himself and the butler had improved the thirteen shining minutes he had had with him by increasing
6875-76999-0089	train-other-500	to a considerable degree his uneasiness and anxiety mister Manley did not greet William Roper He stood on the hearth rug and glowered at him with heavy truculence William Roper shuffled his feet and fumbled with his cap
6875-76999-0090	train-other-500	Then mister Manley said Her ladyship has been informed that you have been spreading scandalous reports in the village and she has instructed me to discharge you at once He walked across to the table
none	none	 took the sheet of notepaper on which he had written the amount due to William Roper 
6875-76999-0091	train-other-500	dipped a pen in the ink and added Here are your wages up to date and a week s wages in lieu of notice Sign this receipt He dipped a pen in the ink and held it out to William Roper
6875-76999-0092	train-other-500	with very much the air of Lady Macbeth presenting her husband with the dagger William Roper was stupefied mister Manley truculent and dramatic cowed him I never done nothing sir he said feebly
6875-76999-0093	train-other-500	Sign at once said mister Manley gazing at him with the glare of the basilisk I ain t agoing to sign I ain t done nothing to be discharged I ain t said nothing but what I seed with my own eyes William Roper protested
6875-76999-0094	train-other-500	Sign said mister Manley tapping the receipt like an official in a spy play Sign He was too much for William Roper The conflict such as it was of wills ceased abruptly William Roper signed
6875-76999-0095	train-other-500	mister Manley pushed the money towards him as towards a loathed pariah William Roper counted it and put it in his pocket He walked towards the door with an air of stupefied dejection
6875-76999-0096	train-other-500	Also you are to be off the estate by twelve o clock tomorrow Loudwater is not the place for ungrateful and slanderous rogues said mister Manley William Roper stopped and turned his face was working malignantly
6875-76999-0097	train-other-500	We ll see what mister Flexen s got to say about this he snarled went through the door and slammed it behind
none	none	 him CHAPTER XV Olivia came that night to her tryst with Grey in a great dejection She perceived clearly enough that the instant discharge of William Roper would not stop the scandal and she was desperately afraid of the results of it The hope which had sprung up in her mind on reading in the Daily Wire the story of her husband s quarrel with an unknown woman died down This was a far more important matter and she could not see how the police could fail to act on William Roper s story She found Grey waiting for her with his wonted impatience and presently told him about William Roper This is the very thing I ve been fearing he said with a sudden heaviness It will certainly force mister Flexen s hand she said I don t know I don t know he said more hopefully Flexen struck me as being the kind of man to act just when it suited him and I expect that he had known all along anything William Roper had to tell Yes he did Twitcher told me that Roper had an interview with him on the afternoon after Egbert s death she said catching a little of his hopefulness Well if he hasn t done anything about it so far there s no reason why he should act immediately the story becomes common property he said in a tone of relief No no she said slowly Then she sobbed once and cried But oh this waiting s so dreadful Never knowing what s going to happen and when feeling that he s lying in wait all the time It is pretty awful he said drawing her more closely to him and kissing her She clung tightly to him quivering The only thing to do is to stick it out and when the time comes if it comes put up a good fight I think we shall he said in a cheering tone Of course we will she said firmly gave herself a little shake and relaxed her grip a little He kissed her again and they were silent a while both of them thinking hard Then he said Look here let s get married Get married she said Yes The more we belong to one another the better we shall feel But but won t there be rather an outcry at our marrying so soon she said Oh if people knew of it yes But I don t propose that they should We ll get married quite quietly I ll get a special licence The padre of my regiment is in Town and he ll marry us I can find a couple of witnesses who ll hold their tongues We can get married in twenty four hours Will you Yes she said firmly His surprise at her ready assent was drowned in the joy it gave him The next morning at half past nine mister Manley rang up mister Flexen at his office at Low Wycombe When he heard his voice he said Good morning Flexen A young fellow of the name of William Roper will be calling on you this morning I expect you know all he has to say already But do you see anything to be gained by his making a pestiferous scandal mongering nuisance of himself I do not I will say a few kind words to him said mister Flexen grimly mister Manley thanked him and rang off Then he sent Hutchings down to the village to let it be known that any one who let William Roper lodge in his or her cottage would at once receive notice to quit it He thought it improbable in view of the general unpleasantness of William Roper that he would be called on to carry out the threat William Roper had already started to pay his visit to mister Flexen mister Flexen kept him dangling his heels in his office for three quarters of an hour before he saw him This cold welcome allowed much of William Roper s sense of his great importance in the district to ooze out of him mister Flexen emptied him of the rest of it He greeted him curtly heard his story with a deepening frown and abused him at some length for a babbling idiot and sent him about his business William Roper returned to his mother s cottage to find that her only object in life was to get him out of her cottage then and there She had conceived the idea that the whole affair was a plot to have a good excuse for giving her notice to leave that cottage She knew well that it was the opinion of all its other inhabitants that the village would be much better without her and that there were very good grounds for it William Roper perceived with uncommon clearness the truth of mister Flexen s assertion that he was a babbling idiot His dream of outing William Hutchings from the post of head gamekeeper and filling it himself was for ever shattered and he had been the great man of the village for little more than fourteen hours ten of which he had spent in sleep He cursed the hour in which he had espied that luckless kiss and too late perceived the folly of a humble gamekeeper s meddling with the affairs of those who own the game he keeps The next morning Elizabeth observed that her mistress was another creature almost her old self indeed The air of strain and oppression had for the time being at any rate gone from her face She moved with her old alertness She even smiled at Elizabeth s strictures on the treacherous William Roper After breakfast she bade Elizabeth pack a trunk for her since she was going to London that afternoon and would spend the night perhaps two or three days there Also she chose with frowning thoughtfulness and no little changing of mind the frocks she would take with her and discussed carefully with Elizabeth the changes necessary to give them a sufficiently mourning character Elizabeth was indeed pleased with the change in her mistress She ascribed it to the influence of Colonel Grey In the afternoon Olivia went to London and drove from Paddington to Grey s flat She found him awaiting her with the most eager expectation He had bought the special licence the chaplain of his regiment and a wounded friend were coming at seven o clock After they were married they would all four dine together and later he and she would return to his flat They had tea and then he showed her some of the beautiful things for the most part ivory and jade which were his most loved possessions She admitted frankly that she had to learn to appreciate and admire them as they deserved But she was sure that she would learn to do so She found the flat of a somewhat spartan simplicity after Loudwater Castle Quainton Hall and the houses to which she was used But she also found that it had been furnished with a keen regard for comfort In particular she observed that the easy chairs which were the chief furniture of the sitting room were the most comfortable she had ever taken her ease in At seven o clock the padre and Sir Charles Ross Grey s wounded friend arrived After they had talked for a few minutes making Olivia s acquaintance the padre married them Henderson Grey s valet a tall spare Scot with rugged features who in the course of his seven years service had acquired in his manner and way of speaking a curious and striking likeness to his master was the second witness It was wholly characteristic of Olivia that she felt no slightest need of the supporting presence of a woman Yet for all the unfamiliar simplicity of the scene the ceremony did not lack dignity or impressiveness At the end of it Olivia felt herself very much more the wife of Antony Grey than she had ever felt herself the wife of Lord Loudwater They dined in a private dining room at the Ritz and Olivia found the dinner delightful The three men after some desultory talk about common friends and the ordinary London subjects fell to talking about their work and their fighting in France She was most pleased by the evident respect and admiration with which the other two regarded her husband It was a new experience for her to be married to a man for whom any one showed respect At a few minutes past ten she and Grey went home to his flat They preferred to walk Olivia did not return to Loudwater for three days Grey did not return till the day after that Then they again spent much of their time in the pavilion in the East wood and since Olivia was careful not to replace William Roper no one knew of their meetings Every week they went to London for two days They lived in an absorption in one another which left them little time to be troubled by fears of the danger which hung over them The scandal about them ran the usual nine days course Then since no new development of the Loudwater case arose to give it a fresh active life it died down About a fortnight after their marriage mister Manley retired from his post of secretary and went to London A few days later he married Helena Truslove at the office of a registrar and they established themselves in a furnished flat at Clarence Gate while they furnished a flat of their own mister Manley found himself under the influence of domesticity the stimulation of life in London and the society of the intelligent writing his new play with all the ease and vigour he had expected mister Flexen was beginning somewhat gloomily to think it probable that the problem of the death of Lord Loudwater would have to be set among the unsolved problems which have at different times baffled the police Then before he had quite lost hope there came a letter from mister Carrington It ran Dear mister Flexen I received this morning a letter from missus Marshall of three Laburnum Terrace Low Wycombe asking me as the agent of the present Lord Loudwater to have some repairs made to the house in which she is his lordship s tenant We have never handled this property we did not even know that it belonged to the late Lord Loudwater If you can find the man who managed it for him he may be able to give you the information you want Yours faithfully C R W CARRINGTON In ten minutes mister Flexen was at three Laburnum Terrace in a quarter of an hour he had learned that missus Marshall had paid her rent to mister Shepherd of nine Bolton Street Low Wycombe in twenty minutes he had learned from missus Shepherd that her husband was in Mesopotamia and that she had not heard from him for two months In half an hour from the time he read mister Carrington s letter he was in the train on his way to London To get in touch with Captain Shepherd in that distant and backward land was a matter for Scotland Yard No acting Chief Constable would do so without considerable delay He drafted the telegram in consultation with one of the commissioners who himself set about the business of getting it through to Captain Shepherd and receiving his answer to it Then he returned to Low Wycombe Three days later came a letter from Scotland Yard to inform him that Captain Shepherd was in an out of the way district in the north of Mesopotamia and that there must be a delay of days before he received the telegram and sent his answer to it mister Flexen possessed his soul in the patience of a man who was sure that he was going to get what he wanted A few days later on a Saturday his work took him to Loudwater and he called on Olivia He found her a different creature She had lost her air of being under a strain and save that her eyes were at first anxious she showed herself wholly at her ease with him He came away assuring himself that she was one of the most charming women he had ever met He took it that she still met Colonel Grey in the pavilion in the East wood and that after a decorous lapse of time they would marry He thought Colonel Grey uncommonly fortunate Then he again wondered what had so perturbed them when he had been at the Castle inquiring into the death of Lord Loudwater What did they know of the mystery What part had they played in it Soon after he had left her Olivia went to London to spend the week end with her husband But she did not go in her wonted joyful mood She tried to thrust it out of her mind but mister Flexen s visit had brought back her old fear Grey at once perceived that she was not in good spirits and he was a little alarmed He had firmly kept his thought from the danger which still hung over them Now he caught from her something of her uneasiness But he would not yield to it and by the end of dinner he had for the while at any rate banished it from both their minds Then when he awoke that night quietly at the turning hour he heard Olivia crying very softly He put his arm round her and said seriously What is it darling What s the matter Oh why ever did you kill him she wailed He he wasn t worth it And I d have come to you without And we might have been so happy Grey with a start sat bolt upright and in a tone of the last astonishment stammered K K Kill him Me B B But I thought you k k killed him He had never been so taken aback in his life Olivia sat bolt upright in her turn Me she said in an astonishment fully as great as his No I didn t Then with one accord they clung to one another and laughed tremulously in an immeasurable relief Then Olivia said And you didn t mind You married me when you actually thought I d murdered Egbert Oh Egbert said Grey in a tone of contempt which placed the late Lord Loudwater definitely as a person the murder of whom was neither here nor there Then he added But hang it all You married me when you actually thought I d murdered him I thought you did it for my sake said Olivia I thought you did it for mine to get me out of a mess Though I ll be shot if I believe I should have cared if you d done it entirely on your own account Not that you could Oh Antony how very fond of one another we must be said Olivia in a hushed voice It was after breakfast next morning that Olivia who stood before the window smoking a cigarette and watching the passers by turned and said But if neither you nor I murdered Egbert who did The mysterious woman I suppose said Grey with very little show of interest in the matter But I never believed that there was any mysterious woman I thought the papers invented her said Olivia So did I said Grey But it s beginning to look to me as if there might have been one I wonder who she can be said Olivia A barmaid I should think said Grey in a tone which placed definitely the late Lord Loudwater as a lover You certainly do dislike Egbert said Olivia in a dispassionate tone of one stating a natural fact of little importance I do said Grey It s odd how little I remember him said Olivia thoughtfully But then I was always trying to forget him unless he was actually in the room with me And then I was always trying not to see him I remember the way he treated you said Grey sternly Olivia smiled at him I hope to goodness the police never do find that wretched woman he said Olivia frowned thoughtfully Then she smiled again I don t think it would be much use if they did she said I told mister Flexen that I heard Egbert snoring about twelve o clock I didn t but I thought that as you went away about half past eleven it would make it safer for you I could always stick to it if we thought it right And I told Flexen that I didn t hear him snoring at about half past eleven and I did I thought it would make it safer for you Well we are said Olivia and she laughed Then of a sudden her eyes sparkled and she cried But if you heard him snore at half past eleven that lets the mysterious woman out She went away at a quarter past By Jove so it does said Grey Three days later driving back in the evening from Rickmansworth to Low Wycombe mister Flexen passed Grey on his way home from an afternoon s fishing He stopped the car and as Grey came up to it he perceived that he was looking uncommonly well though his limp appeared to be as bad as ever He was not only looking well he was also looking happy wholly free from care They greeted one another and mister Flexen said By Jove you are looking fit Yes I m all right again said Grey Then he frowned and added But the nuisance of it is that I shall always have this confounded limp You get off more lightly than a good many men I know said Flexen sadly Yes I m not grousing much said Grey There came a pause and then Grey said I ve been rather hoping to come across you When you questioned me about my doings on the night of Loudwater s death you asked me whether I heard him snore as I went through the library going in and out of the Castle and for reasons which seemed quite good to me at the time I told you I didn t As a matter of fact he was snoring like a pig when I came out mister Flexen looked at him hard thinking quickly Then he said softly My goodness That would be half past eleven Close on it said Grey Well as a matter of fact I didn t believe you said mister Flexen frankly In my business you know one acquires a very good ear for the truth Grey laughed cheerfully and said I expect you do All the same I m glad to have it for certain said mister Flexen smiling at him Well I must be getting on let me give you a lift as far as Loudwater Grey thanked him and stepped into the car When he had set him down mister Flexen drove on in frowning thought Colonel Grey was speaking the truth and in that case neither James Hutchings nor the mysterious woman had committed the murder unless they had deliberately returned for the purpose He did not believe that James Hutchings had returned he thought it improbable that the mysterious woman had returned Even more important was the fact that this admission of Colonel Grey assured him that neither he nor Lady Loudwater had committed the murder Grey had evidently lied to shield her He had no less evidently learned that she did not need shielding That admission had not at all simplified the problem The next morning Scotland Yard telegraphed to him the reply to its cable to Captain Shepherd It ran Loudwater allowed missus Helena Truslove Crest Loudwater six hundred a year and gave her Crest He had the mysterious woman at last He drove over to the Crest at once and learned from the caretaker that missus Truslove was now living in London in a flat at Clarence Gate He could not get away from his work till the afternoon and it was past half past four when he knocked at the door of her flat The maid led him down the passage opened the door on the right and announced him Helena was sitting beside a table on which afternoon tea for two was set She looked surprised to hear his name missus Truslove he said I was missus Truslove she said rising and holding out her hand But now I am missus Manley You know my husband He will be so pleased to see you again I m expecting him every minute mister Flexen was for a moment conscious of a slight sensation of vertigo The mysterious woman was the wife of Herbert Manley He could not at once see the bearings of this fact but ideas fancies and suspicions raced one another through his head He checked them and said in a somewhat toneless voice I shall be delighted to see him again Have you been married long Rather more than a fortnight said Helena But do sit down My husband will be so pleased to see you again He has a great admiration for you mister Flexen sat down and unconsciously stared hard at her Ideas were jostling one another in his head We won t wait for him I ll have the tea made at once she said bending forward to press the bell button One moment please he said in his crispest most official voice I ve come to see you on a very important matter Oh she said quickly frowning Then she looked at him with steady eyes Yes You know that I am investigating the Loudwater case and I have received information that you are the mysterious lady who visited Lord Loudwater on the night of his death and had a violent quarrel with him We began by quarrelling she said quietly Began by quarrelling said mister Flexen Yes I d better tell you the whole story and you ll understand she said in a matter of fact voice Rather more than two years ago I was engaged to be married to Lord Loudwater He broke off our engagement and married Miss Quainton I was not going to stand that and I was going to bring a breach of promise action against him He didn t want that of course It would most likely have stopped his marrying Miss Quainton So he agreed to make over the Crest my house just beyond Loudwater to me and pay me an allowance of six hundred a year This was two years ago said mister Flexen Yes said Helena But stupidly though I had the house properly made over to me I didn t have a deed about the allowance And a few days before he committed suicide Committed suicide mister Flexen interrupted Of course he committed suicide Didn t doctor Thornhill say that the wound might have been self inflicted Besides poor Egbert had a most frightful temper But why should he commit suicide said mister Flexen He may have been upset about Lady Loudwater and Colonel Grey Why I m quite sure that it would drive him mad absolutely mad for the time being I know him well enough to be sure of that Yes yes said mister Flexen slowly It s a tenable theory doubtless But about your quarrel with him A few days before he died he talked about halving my allowance And of course I was frightfully annoyed about it I wanted to have it out with him I meant to but I knew that he d never let me get near him if he could help it But I knew too that he sat in the smoking room every evening after dinner and generally went to sleep You know everything about every one in the country you know And I determined to take him by surprise and I did We did have a row for I was frightfully angry It seemed so mean But he stopped it by telling me that he had instructed his bankers we have the same bankers to pay twelve thousand pounds into my account instead of allowing me six hundred a year There was just the faintest change in her voice as she spoke the last sentence and it did not escape mister Flexen s sensitive ear He thought that the whole story had been rehearsed it sounded so But she spoke the last sentence just a little more quickly The rest of the story rang true or at any rate truer Twelve thousand pounds he said slowly And did Lord Loudwater tell you when he instructed his bankers No But it must have been that very day The letter must have been in the post in fact for two mornings later I received a letter from the bank telling me that they had credited me with that amount the morning after the inquest I think it was I see said mister Flexen and he paused considering the story Then he said And were you surprised at all at his doing this Yes I was she said frankly It didn t seem like him But since I ve wondered whether he had made up his mind to commit suicide and wished to leave things quite straight It was a plausible theory but mister Flexen did not believe that Lord Loudwater had committed suicide I suppose that your husband knows all about it he said at random He may and he may not He hasn t said anything to me about it she said Then we may take it that he did not write the letter of instruction to the bankers said mister Flexen Oh he might have done and still have said nothing about it He has a very sensitive delicacy and might have thought it my business and not his I haven t told him about the twelve thousand pounds yet I don t bother him about business matters In fact I m going to manage his business as well as my own And he didn t know about the allowance said mister Flexen Oh yes he did I told him all about that said Helena quickly mister Flexen paused considering He seemed to have learnt from her all she had to tell There came the sound of the opening of the door of the flat and of steps in the hall Then the door of the room opened and mister Manley came in mister Flexen s eyes swept over him He was looking cheerful prosperous and rather sleek His air had grown even more important and assured He greeted mister Flexen warmly and beamed on him Then he demanded tea But mister Flexen rose declared that he must be going and in spite of mister Manley s protests went It had flashed on him that he might just catch mister Carrington at his office CHAPTER XVI mister Flexen did find mister Carrington at his office and mister Carrington s first words were Well have you found the mysterious woman I ve found the mysterious woman and she s now missus Herbert Manley said mister Flexen mister Carrington stared at him then he said softly Well I m damned It does explain several things said mister Flexen dryly We know now why she was so hard to find why there was no trace of her relations with Lord Loudwater no trace of Shepherd s managing the Low Wycombe property among his papers why there were no pass books mister Carrington flushed and said The young scoundrel had us on toast all the while Toast is the word said mister Flexen I never did like the beggar I couldn t stand his infernal manner But it never occurred to me that he was a bad hat I merely thought him a pretentious young ass who didn t know his place said mister Carrington I m not so sure about the ass said mister Flexen No perhaps not He certainly brought it off for a time and shielded her as long as it lasted said mister Carrington slowly She didn t need any shielding said mister Flexen Do you mean to tell me that she didn t murder Loudwater She did not You don t murder a man who has just given you twelve thousand pounds said mister Flexen Twelve thousand pounds said mister Carrington slowly Then he started from his chair and almost howled Are you telling me that Lord Loudwater gave this woman twelve thousand pounds He never gave any one twelve thousand pounds He never gave any one a thousand pounds He never gave any one fifty pounds He couldn t have done it Never in his life His voice rose in a fine crescendo Well perhaps it was hardly a gift said mister Flexen and he told him Helena s story At the end of it mister Carrington said with dogged sullen conviction I don t care I don t believe it Lord Loudwater couldn t have done it But there s the letter from her bankers said mister Flexen And I suppose you can trace the twelve thousand pounds mister Carrington started and said sharply Why that must be where the rubber shares went to What rubber shares said mister Flexen We can t lay our hands on a block of rubber shares Lord Loudwater owned The certificate isn t among his scrip he kept all his scrip at the Castle he wouldn t keep it at his bank Those rubber shares were worth just about twelve thousand pounds Well there you are said mister Flexen No I m not I tell you I don t believe in that gift not even in the circumstances Lord Loudwater would a thousand times rather have gone on paying the allowance as little of it as he could There s something fishy very fishy about it I tell you said mister Carrington vehemently And where did the fishiness come in said mister Flexen mister Carrington was silent frowning Then he said I ll I ll be hanged if I can see mister Flexen rose sharply and said There s only one point in the affair where it could have come in as far as I can see I should like to examine Lord Loudwater s letter of instruction to his bankers By George You ve got it said mister Carrington Well can we get a look at it said mister Flexen We can Harrison the manager will stretch a point for me He knows that I m quite safe Come along said mister Carrington At this hour The bank s been closed this two hours said Flexen He ll be there It s years since he got away before seven said mister Carrington confidently He told a clerk to telephone to the bank that he was coming They found a taxicab quickly drove to the bank entered it by the side door and were taken straight to mister Harrison He made no bones about showing them Lord Loudwater s letter of instructions with regard to the twelve thousand pounds mister Carrington and mister Flexen read it together It was quite short and ran GENTLEMEN I shall be much obliged by your paying the enclosed cheque from Messrs Hanbury and Johnson for Ltwelve thousand forty six into the account of missus Helena Truslove Yours faithfully LOUDWATER Rather a curt way of disposing of such a large sum said mister Flexen taking the letter and going to the window It was the way Lord Loudwater did things said mister Harrison Yes yes I know said mister Carrington Some things They both looked at mister Flexen who was examining the letter through a magnifying glass He studied it for a good two minutes turned to them with a quiet smile of triumph on his face and said I ve never seen Lord Loudwater s signature But this is a forgery A forgery said the manager sharply stepping quickly towards mister Flexen with outstretched hand I m not surprised to hear it said mister Carrington Well the signature is not written with the natural ease with which a man signs his name said mister Flexen giving the letter to mister Harrison mister Harrison studied it carefully Then he pressed a button on his desk and bade the clerk who came bring all the letters they had received from Lord Loudwater during the last three months of his life and bring them quickly Then he turned to mister Flexen and said stiffly I m bound to say that the signature looks perfectly right to me I ve no doubt that it s a good forgery It was done by a very clever man said mister Flexen A first class young scoundrel mister Carrington amended We shall soon see said mister Harrison politely incredulous The clerk came with the letters There were eight of them all written by mister Manley and signed by Lord Loudwater The manager compared the signatures of every one of them with the signature in question using a magnifying glass which lay on his desk Then triumphant in his turn he said curtly It s no forgery Allow me said mister Flexen and in his turn he compared the signatures again every one of them Then he said As I said it s an uncommonly good forgery You see that the bodies of the letters are all written with the same pen a gold nibbed fountain pen the signatures are written with a steel nib It cuts deeper into the paper and the ink doesn t flow off it so evenly The forged signature is written with the same kind of nib as the genuine ones Also the bodies of the letters are written in a fountain pen ink the Swan I think The signatures are written in Stephens blue black ink The forged signature is also written in Stephens blue black ink No error there you see You seem to know a good deal about these things said mister Harrison rather tartly Yes I ve been a partner in Punchard s Agency you know it we ve done some work for you for the last two years I didn t need this kind of knowledge for my work in India I only made a special study of forgery after joining the agency A private inquiry agency gets such a lot of it said mister Flexen Well and if there s an error in these details where is it It s not in the signature itself said mister Harrison Indeed it is said mister Flexen It s an uncommonly good signature too The Loud is perfect But the water gives it away The forger had evidently practised it a lot In fact he wrote the Loud straight off But the water has no less than five distinct pauses in it under the microscope of course where he paused to think or perhaps to look at a genuine signature the endorsement on the cheque very likely mister Harrison sniffed ever so faintly and said Of course I ve had experience of handwriting experts not very much thank goodness and you differ among yourselves so It s any odds that another expert will find those pauses in quite different places from you or even no pauses at all mister Flexen laughed gently and said Perhaps But he ought not to There you are And when it comes to a jury said mister Harrison and he threw out his hands Besides if you got your experts to agree you d have to show a very strong motive Oh we ve got that we ve got that said mister Carrington with conviction Well of course that will make it easier for you to get the jury to believe your handwriting experts rather than those of the other side said mister Harrison without any enthusiasm Then he added with rather more cheerfulness But you never can tell with a jury No that s true said mister Flexen quickly I m sure we re very much obliged to you for showing us the letter There was nothing more to be done at the bank and having again thanked mister Harrison they took their leave of him He showed no great cordiality in his leave taking he was looking at the matter from the point of view of the bank The bank preferred to detect forgeries itself in time As they came into the street mister Carrington rubbed his hands together and said in a tone of deep satisfaction And now for the warrant Warrant for whom said mister Flexen in a tone of polite inquiry Manley The sooner that young scoundrel is in gaol the better I shall feel said mister Carrington So should I said mister Flexen But I m very much afraid that for mister Manley it s a far cry to Holloway We have no case against him whatever not a scrap of a case that I can see Hang it all It s as plain as a pikestaff He s engaged to this woman this missus Truslove who has a nice little income He hears that her income is to be halved and we know that if an allowance begins by being halved as likely as not it will be stopped altogether before long He saw that clearly enough Then in the very nick of time this cheque comes along He sends it to the bank with this letter of instructions and murders Lord Loudwater so that he cannot disavow them What more of a case do you want I don t want a better case I only want some evidence It s true enough that missus Manley told me that she told Manley that Lord Loudwater proposed to halve her allowance But where s the evidence that she talked to him about it She d deny it if you put her into the witness box and you can t put her into the witness box Husband and wife by Jove Oh the clever young scoundrel cried mister Carrington And that halving of the allowance is the beginning of the whole business Manley had made up his mind to marry a lady with a fixed income indeed they were probably already engaged Loudwater upsets the arrangement Manley restores the status quo by means of this cheque and the murder of Loudwater Of course he hated Loudwater he admitted as much to me more than once But if Loudwater had played fair about that allowance he d be alive now Having established the status quo Manley promptly marries the lady and closes the mouth of the only person who can bear witness that the allowance was in danger and he had any motive for murdering Loudwater mister Carrington ground his teeth and murmured The infernal young scoundrel Then he broke out violently But we re not beaten yet Now that we know for a fact that he murdered Loudwater and why there must be some way of getting at him I very much doubt it said Flexen sadly He s an uncommonly able fellow I don t believe that he s taken a chance He wears a glove and leaves the knife in the wound so that there are no bloodstains And consider the cheque The bank wouldn t have honoured Loudwater s own cheque the cheque of a dead man but the stock broker s cheque goes through as a matter of course Of course said mister Carrington And he has kept the business so entirely in his own hands If we had run in any one else he d have come forward and sworn that he heard Loudwater snore after Roper had seen that person leave the Castle I m beginning to think that he s one of the most able murderers I ever heard of I certainly never came across one in my own experience who was a patch on him said mister Flexen Don t be in such a hurry to lose hope There must be some way of getting at him there must be said mister Carrington obstinately I m glad to hear it said mister Flexen in a tone of utter scepticism They walked on mister Flexen reflecting on mister Manley s ability mister Carrington cudgelling his brains for a method of bringing his crime home to him At the door of his office mister Flexen held out his hand Come along in I ve got an idea said mister Carrington CHAPTER XVII mister Flexen shrugged his shoulders with a sceptical air He had not formed a high opinion of mister Carrington s intelligence However he followed him into his office and sat down ready to give him his best attention mister Carrington wore a really hopeful expression and he said My idea is that we should get at Manley through missus Manley I m not at all keen on getting at a man through his wife said mister Flexen rather dolefully But in this case it s manifestly our duty to leave nothing untried Murder for money is murder for money I should think it was our duty cried mister Carrington with emphasis And there are three innocent people under suspicion of having committed the murder Fire away How is it to be done said mister Flexen The new Lord Loudwater must bring an action against missus Manley for the return of that twelve thousand pounds on the ground that it was obtained from the late Lord Loudwater by fraud as it certainly was said mister Carrington leaning forward with shining eyes and speaking very distinctly I see said mister Flexen But his expression was not hopeful Once we get her in the witness box we establish the fact that Lord Loudwater had made up his mind to halve her allowance for she ll have to give the reason for her visiting him so late that night and so we get Manley s motive for committing the murder also established I see But will you be able to use her evidence in the first trial at the second said mister Flexen doubtfully That s the idea said mister Carrington triumphantly You think it can be worked We can have a jolly good try at it said mister Carrington rubbing his hands together and his square massive face was rather malignant in its triumph mister Flexen did not look triumphant or even hopeful But will you get the new Lord Loudwater to bring this action he said Why of course There s the money for one thing and when he sees how important it is from the point of view of getting at Manley he can t refuse said mister Carrington confidently There isn t the money not necessarily He might get back the twelve thousand pounds and have to pay missus Manley six hundred a year for forty or fifty years She s a healthy looking woman said mister Flexen I take it that the late Lord Loudwater had property of his own against which she could claim Oh of course she could do that said mister Carrington and there was some diminution of the triumphant expression She would said mister Flexen Then you ll have to get over his objection to incurring a considerable amount of odium It will look bad for a man of his wealth to try to recover from a lady a sum of money to which every one will consider her entitled Oh but it was obtained by fraud said mister Carrington If you were sure of proving that it would make a difference in the way people would regard it But you re not sure of proving it not by a long chalk And you can t assure your client that you are There ll be a lot of conflicting evidence about that signature as Harrison pretty clearly showed If you don t prove it your client will be landed with the costs of the case and incur still greater odium Ah but he is bound to take the risk to bring his cousin s murderer to justice said mister Carrington Is he said Flexen dryly What kind of terms was he on with his murdered cousin Well I must say I didn t expect you to ask that question said mister Carrington pettishly What kind of terms was the late Lord Loudwater likely to be on with his heir They hated one another like poison I thought as much said mister Flexen And what kind of a man is the new man anything like his dead cousin Oh well all the Loudwaters are pretty much of a muchness But the present man is a better man all round better manners and better brains said mister Carrington Better brains and you think he ll be willing to celebrate his succession to the peerage by a first class scandal of this kind a scandal which may bring him this money but which will certainly bring odium on him said mister Flexen When it s a case of bringing a murderer to justice said mister Carrington obstinately The murderer of a man he hated like poison I should think that he d want to see his way pretty clear And it isn t clear not by any means For there s precious little chance of missus Manley s giving Lord Loudwater s threat to halve her allowance as the reason of her visit to him that night In fact there s no chance at all Manley will see to that Once attack the genuineness of that signature and you open his eyes to his danger She ll come into the witness box with quite another reason for that visit and a good reason too Manley will find it for her said mister Flexen with conviction But there s the quarrel She can t get over that quarrel said mister Carrington stubbornly She ll deny the quarrel It s only missus Carruthers word against hers Besides missus Carruthers heard what she did hear through a closed door It will be so easy to make out that she made a mistake You seem to take it for granted that missus Manley will commit perjury at that young scoundrel s bidding snapped mister Carrington I take it for granted that she ll be a woman fighting to save her husband And I m also sure that there ll be precious few mistakes in tactics made in the fight I think that all you ll get out of the trial will be a strong presumption that Lord Loudwater committed suicide I d bet that that is the line Manley will take And she ll make a thundering good witness for him She s a good looking woman with plenty of intelligence mister Carrington gazed at him with unhappy eyes His square massive face had lost utterly its expression of triumph But hang it all he cried What are we going to do Knowing what we know we can t sit still and do nothing I can t see anything we can do said mister Flexen frankly and he rose You have demonstrated that Manley s position is impregnable He took his leave of the dejected lawyer Outside mister Carrington s office he stood still hesitating He could have caught a train back to Low Wycombe but he could not bring himself to take it He could not at once tear himself away from London and mister Manley He must sleep on the new facts in the Loudwater case He went to his club engaged a bedroom and dined there mister and missus Manley dined at their flat mister Manley talked during dinner with elegance and vivacity The maid brought in the coffee and went back to the kitchen As he lighted his wife s cigarette mister Manley said in a careless tone What did Flexen want to see you about Helena gave him a full account of her interview with mister Flexen his questions and her answers I guessed that you were the Daily Wire s mysterious woman he said I saw how frightened you were when it came out But of course as you didn t say anything about it I didn t That is so like you she murmured One human being should never intrude on another said mister Manley with a noble air It might be your motto she said looking at him with admiring eyes She paused then she added And I was frightened horribly frightened I couldn t sleep I was going to tell you about it but I didn t like to You gave me no opening Then the letter came from my bankers about the twelve thousand pounds and it made it all right It made it clear that I had no reason to murder Loudwater Of course said mister Manley But in the event of any new developments I should not admit that Lord Loudwater talked of halving your allowance or that you quarrelled with him In fact I shouldn t let Flexen interview you again at all In an affair of this kind you can t be too careful I won t let him interview me again said Helena with decision mister Flexen did not try to interview her again But at eleven the next morning he called on mister Manley He had very little hope of effecting anything by the call though he meant to try But he had the keenest desire to scrutinize him again and carefully in the light of the new facts he had discovered mister Manley kept him waiting awhile in the drawing room then the maid ushered him into mister Manley s study mister Manley was sitting at a table at work on his play He greeted mister Flexen with a rather absent minded air mister Flexen surveyed him with very intent measuring eyes At once he perceived that he had rather missed mister Manley s jaw in giving attention to his admirable forehead It was indeed the jaw of a brute He could see him drive the knife into Lord Loudwater and walk out of the smoking room with an ugly contented smile on his face He had little hopes of bringing off anything in the nature of a bluff but he said in a rasping tone We ve discovered that the signature of Lord Loudwater s letter of instructions to his bankers to pay that cheque for twelve thousand pounds into your wife s account was forged mister Manley looked at him blankly for a moment There was no expression at all on his face Then it filled slowly with an expression of surprise Rehearsed by Jove murmured mister Flexen under his breath and he could not help admiring the skilful management of that expression of surprise It was so unhasty and natural My dear fellow what on earth are you driving at I saw him write it myself said mister Manley in an indulgent tone You forged it snapped mister Flexen mister Manley looked at him with a new surprise which changed slowly to pity Then he said in such a tone as one might use to an unreasonable child My good chap what on earth should I forge it for You knew that he was going to halve missus Truslove s allowance You were bent on marrying a woman with money You took this way of ensuring that she had money forged the letter and murdered Lord Loudwater said mister Flexen on a rising inflexion By Jove I see what you re after It shows how infernally silly a schoolboy joke can be Lord Loudwater never talked of halving my wife s allowance That was an invention of mine I told her that he was doing so just to tease her said mister Manley firmly with a note of contrition in his voice mister Flexen opened his mouth a little way It was a superb invention It left missus Manley free to go into the witness box to tell the story she had told him It knocked the bottom clean out of Carrington s case What really happened was that Lord Loudwater was grousing about the allowance at being reminded every six months that he had behaved like a cad I suggested that he should pay her a lump sum and be done with the business He jumped at the idea The cheque had come from his stockbrokers that morning he directed me to write that letter of instructions to his bankers I wrote it and he signed it There you have the whole business I don t believe a word of it cried mister Flexen mister Manley rose with an air of great dignity and said My good chap I can excuse your temper It was an ingenious theory and it must be very annoying to have it upset But I m fed up with this Loudwater business I ve got here he tapped the manuscript on the table a drama worth fifty of it Out of working hours I don t mind talking that affair over with you in them I won t mister Flexen rose and said You re undoubtedly the most accomplished scoundrel I ve ever come across If you will have it so said mister Manley patiently Then he smiled and added Praise from an expert They turned to see missus Manley standing in the doorway her lips parted her eyes dilated in a growing consternation She stepped forward mister Flexen slipped round her and fairly fled She looked at mister Manley with horror stricken eyes and said What what did he mean Herbert He meant what he said But what it really means is that I won t let him hang that wretched James Hutchings said mister Manley with a noble air Three months later on the first night of mister Manley s play Colonel Grey came upon mister Flexen in the lounge of the Haymarket between the second and third acts Both of them praised the play warmly and there came a pause Then Colonel Grey said I suppose you ve given up all hope of solving the problem of Loudwater s death Oh I solved it three months ago It was Manley said mister Flexen By Jove said Colonel Grey softly Not a doubt of it I ll tell you all about it one of these days said mister Flexen for the bell
