properly the shortest chapter in the book When Sylvia Marchmont went to Europe George Bellew being at the same time desirous of testing his newest acquired yacht followed her and mutual friends in New York Newport and elsewhere confidently awaited news of their engagement Great therefore was their surprise when they learnt of her approaching marriage to the Duke of Ryde Bellew being young and rich had many friends very naturally who while they sympathized with his loss yet agreed among themselves that despite Bellew s millions Sylvia had done vastly well for herself seeing that a duke is always a duke especially in America There were also divers ladies in New York Newport and elsewhere and celebrated for their palatial homes their jewels and their daughters who were anxious to know how Bellew would comport himself under his disappointment Some leaned to the idea that he would immediately blow his brains out others opined that he would promptly set off on another of his exploring expeditions and get himself torn to pieces by lions and tigers or devoured by alligators while others again feared greatly that in a fit of pique he would marry some young person unknown and therefore of course utterly unworthy How far these worthy ladies were right or wrong in their surmises they who take the trouble to turn the following pages shall find out CHAPTER II How George Bellew sought counsel of his Valet The first intimation Bellew received of the futility of his hopes was the following letter which he received one morning as he sat at breakfast in his chambers in saint James Street W MY DEAR GEORGE I am writing to tell you that I like you so much that I am quite sure I could never marry you it would be too ridiculous Liking you see George is not love is it Though personally I think all that sort of thing went out of fashion with our great grandmother s hoops and crinolines So George I have decided to marry the Duke of Ryde The ceremony will take place in three weeks time at saint George s Hanover Square and everyone will be there of course If you care to come too so much the better I won t say that I hope you will forget me because I don t but I am sure you will find someone to console you because you are such a dear good fellow and so ridiculously rich So good bye and best wishes Ever yours most sincerely SYLVIA Now under such circumstances had Bellew sought oblivion and consolation from bottles or gone headlong to the devil in any of other numerous ways that are more or less inviting deluded people would have pitied him and shaken grave heads over him for it seems that disappointment more especially in love may condone many offences and cover as many sins as Charity But Bellew knowing nothing of that latter day hysteria which wears the disguise and calls itself Temperament and being only a rather ordinary young man did nothing of the kind Having lighted his pipe and read the letter through again he rang instead for Baxter his valet Baxter was small and slight and dapper as to person clean shaven alert of eye and soft of movement in a word Baxter was the cream of gentlemen s gentlemen and the very acme of what a valet should be from the very precise parting of his glossy hair to the trim toes of his glossy boots Baxter as has been said was his valet and had been his father s valet before him and as to age might have been thirty or forty or fifty as he stood there beside the table with one eye brow raised a trifle higher than the other waiting for Bellew to speak Baxter Sir Take a seat Thank you sir And Baxter sat down not too near his master nor too far off but exactly at the right and proper distance Baxter I wish to consult with you As between Master and Servant sir As between man and man Baxter Very good mister George sir I should like to hear your opinion Baxter as to what is the proper and most accredited course to adopt when one has been er crossed in love Why sir began Baxter slightly wrinkling his smooth brow so far as I can call to mind the courses usually adopted by despairing lovers are in number four Name them Baxter First mister George there is what I may term the Course Retaliatory which is Marriage Marriage With another party sir on the principle that there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out and er pebbles on beaches sir you understand me sir Perfectly go on Secondly there is the Army sir I have known of a good many enlistments on account of blighted affections mister George sir indeed the Army is very popular

none	none	said Bellew settling the tobacco in his pipe with the aid of the salt spoon Proceed Baxter Thirdly mister George there are those who are content to to merely disappear Hum said Bellew And lastly sir though it is usually the first there is dissipation mister George Drink sir the consolation of bottles and Exactly nodded Bellew Now Baxter he pursued beginning to draw diagrams on the table cloth with the salt spoon knowing me as you do what course should you advise me to adopt You mean mister George speaking as between man and man of course you mean that you are in the unfortunate position of being crossed in your affections sir Also heart broken Baxter Certainly sir Miss Marchmont marries the Duke of Hyde in three weeks Baxter Indeed sir You were I believe aware of the fact that Miss Marchmont and I were as good as engaged I had hem gathered as much sir Then confound it all Baxter why aren t you surprised I am quite over come sir said Baxter stooping to recover the salt spoon which had slipped to the floor Consequently pursued Bellew I am er broken hearted as I told you Certainly sir Crushed despondent and utterly hopeless Baxter and shall be henceforth pursued by the er Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been Very natural sir indeed I could have hoped Baxter that having served me so long not to mention my father you would have shown just a er shade more feeling in the matter And if you were to ask me as between man and man sir why I don t show more feeling then speaking as the old servant of your respected father Master George sir I should beg most respectfully to say that regarding the lady in question her conduct is not in the least surprising Miss Marchmont being a beauty and aware of the fact Master George Referring to your heart sir I am ready to swear that it is not even cracked And now sir what clothes do you propose to wear this morning And pray why should you be so confident of regarding the er condition of my heart Because sir speaking as your father s old servant Master George I make bold to say that I don t believe that you have ever been in love or even know what love is Master George sir Bellew picked up the salt spoon balanced it very carefully upon his finger and put it down again Nevertheless said he shaking his head I can see for myself but the dreary perspective of a hopeless future Baxter blasted by the Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been I ll trouble you to push the cigarettes a little nearer And now sir said Baxter as he rose to strike and apply the necessary match what suit will you wear to day Something in tweeds Tweeds sir surely you forget your appointment with the Lady Cecily Prynne and her party Lord Mountclair had me on the telephone last night Also a good heavy walking stick Baxter and a knap sack A knap sack sir I shall set out on a walking tour in an hour s time Certainly sir where to sir I haven t the least idea Baxter but I m going in an hour On the whole of the four courses you describe for one whose life is blighted whose heart I say whose heart Baxter is broken utterly smashed and er shivered beyond repair I prefer to disappear in an hour Baxter Shall you drive the touring car sir or the new racer I shall walk Baxter alone in an hour CHAPTER III Which concerns itself with a hay cart and a belligerent Waggoner It was upon a certain August morning that George Bellew shook the dust of London from his feet and leaving Chance or Destiny to direct him followed a hap hazard course careless alike of how or when or where sighing as often and as heavily as he considered his heart broken condition required which was very often and very heavily yet heeding for all that the glory of the sun and the stir and bustle of the streets about him Thus it was that being careless of his ultimate destination Fortune condescended to take him under her wing if she has one and guided his steps across the river into the lovely land of Kent that county of gentle hills and broad pleasant valleys of winding streams and shady woods of rich meadows and smiling pastures of grassy lanes and fragrant hedgerows that most delightful land which has been called and very rightly The Garden of England It was thus as has been said upon a fair August morning that Bellew set out on what he termed a walking tour The reservation is necessary because Bellew s idea of a walking tour is original and quaint He began very well for Bellew in the morning he walked very nearly five miles and in the afternoon before he was discovered he accomplished ten more on a hay cart that happened to be going in his direction He had swung himself up among the hay unobserved by the somnolent driver and had ridden thus an hour or more in that delicious state between waking and sleeping ere the waggoner discovered him whereupon ensued the following colloquy THE WAGGONER Indignantly Hallo there what might you be a doing of in my hay BELLEW Drowsily Enjoying myself immensely THE WAGGONER Growling Well you get out o that and sharp about it BELLEW Yawning Not on your life No sir not for Cadwallader and all his goats THE WAGGONER You jest get down out o my hay now come BELLEW Sleepily Enough good fellow go to thy voice offends mine ear THE WAGGONER Threateningly Ear be blowed If ye don t get down out o my hay I ll come an throw ye out BELLEW Drowsily Twould be an act of wanton aggression that likes me not THE WAGGONER Dubiously Where be ye goin BELLEW Wherever you like to take me Thy way shall be my way and er thy people Yawn So drive on my rustic Jehu and Heaven s blessings prosper thee Saying which Bellew closed his eyes again sighed plaintively and once more composed himself to slumber But to drive on the Waggoner very evidently had no mind instead flinging the reins upon the backs of his horses he climbed down from his seat and spitting on his hands clenched them into fists and shook them up at the yawning Bellew one after the other It be enough said he to raise the Old Adam inside o me to ave a tramper o the roads a snoring in my hay but I ain t a going to be called names into the bargain Rusty I may be but I reckon I m good enough for the likes o you so come on down and the Waggoner shook his fists again He was a very square man was this Waggoner square of head square of jaw and square of body with twinkling blue eyes and a pleasant good natured face but just now the eyes gleamed and the face was set grimly and altogether he looked a very ugly opponent Therefore Bellew sighed again stretched himself and very reluctantly climbed down out of the hay No sooner was he fairly in the road than the Waggoner went for him with a rush and a whirl of knotted fists It was very dusty in that particular spot so that it presently rose in a cloud in the midst of which the battle raged fast and furious And in a while the Waggoner rising out of the ditch grinned to see Bellew wiping blood from his face You be no fool panted the Waggoner mopping his face with the end of his neckerchief Leastways not wi your fists Why you are pretty good yourself if it comes to that returned Bellew mopping in his turn Thus they stood a while stanching their wounds and gazing upon each other with a mutual and growing respect Well enquired Bellew when he had recovered his breath somewhat shall we begin again or do you think we have had enough To be sure I begin to feel much better for your efforts you see exercise is what I most need just now on account of the er Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been to offset its effect you know but it is uncomfortably warm work here in the sun isn t it Ah nodded the Waggoner it be Then suppose we er continue our journey said Bellew with his dreamy gaze upon the tempting load of sweet smelling hay Ah nodded the Waggoner again beginning to roll down his sleeves suppose we do I aren t above giving a lift to a chap as can use is fists not even if e is a vagrant and a uncommon dusty one at that so if you re in the same mind about it up you get but no more furrin curses mind With which admonition the Waggoner nodded grinned and climbed back to his seat while Bellew swung himself up into the hay once more Friend said he as the waggon creaked upon its way Do you smoke Ah nodded the Waggoner Then here are three cigars which you didn t manage to smash just now Cigars why it ain t often as I gets so far as a cigar unless it be Squire or Parson cigars eh Saying which the Waggoner turned and accepted the cigars which he proceeded to stow away in the cavernous interior of his wide eaved hat handling them with elaborate care rather as if they were explosives of a highly dangerous kind Meanwhile George Bellew American Citizen and millionaire lay upon the broad of his back staring up at the cloudless blue above and despite heart break and a certain Haunting Shadow felt singularly content which feeling he was at some pains with himself to account for It s the exercise said he speaking his thought aloud as he stretched luxuriously upon his soft and fragrant couch after all there is nothing like a little exercise That s what they all say nodded the Waggoner But I notice as them as says it ain t over fond o doing of it they mostly prefers to lie on their backs an talk about it like yourself Hum said Bellew ha Some are born to exercise some achieve exercise and some like myself have exercise thrust upon them But anyway it is a very excellent thing more especially if one is affected with a er broken heart A w ot enquired the Waggoner Blighted affections then sighed Bellew settling himself more comfortably in the hay You aren t inting at love are ye enquired the Waggoner cocking a somewhat sheepish eye at him I was but just at present and here Bellew lowered his voice it is a er rather painful subject with me let us therefore talk of something else You don t mean to say as your eart s broke do ye enquired the Waggoner in a tone of such vast surprise and disbelief that Bellew turned and propped himself on an indignant elbow And why the deuce not he retorted my heart is no more impervious than anyone else s confound it But said the Waggoner you ain t got the look of a eart broke cove no more than Squire Cassilis which the same I heard telling Miss Anthea as is eart were broke no later than yesterday at two o clock in the arternoon as ever was Anthea repeated Bellew blinking drowsily up at the sky again that is a very quaint name and very pretty Pretty ah an so s Miss Anthea as a pict er Oh really yawned Bellew Ah nodded the Waggoner there ain t a man in or out o the parish from Squire down as don t think the very same But here the Waggoner s voice tailed off into a meaningless drone that became merged with the creaking of the wheels the plodding hoof strokes of the horses and Bellew fell asleep He was awakened by feeling himself shaken lustily and sitting up saw that they had come to where a narrow lane branched off from the high road and wound away between great trees Yon s your way nodded the Waggoner pointing along the high road Dapplemere village lies over yonder bout a mile Thank you very much said Bellew but I don t want the village No enquired the Waggoner scratching his head Certainly not answered Bellew Then what do ye want Oh well I ll just go on lying here and see what turns up so drive on like the good fellow you are Can t be done said the Waggoner Why not Why since you ax me because I don t have to drive no farther There be the farm house over the up land yonder you can t see it because o the trees but there it be So Bellew sighed resignedly and perforce climbed down into the road What do I owe you he enquired Owe me said the Waggoner staring For the ride and the er very necessary exercise you afforded me Lord cried the Waggoner with a sudden great laugh you don t owe me nothin for that not nohow I owe you one for a knocking of me into that ditch back yonder though to be sure I did give ye one or two good uns didn t I You certainly did answered Bellew smiling and he held out his hand Hey what be this cried the Waggoner staring down at the bright five shilling piece in his palm Well I rather think it s five shillings said Bellew It s big enough heaven knows English money is all O K I suppose but it s confoundedly confusing and rather heavy to drag around if you happen to have enough of it Ah nodded the Waggoner but then nobody never has enough of it leastways I never knowed nobody as had Good bye sir and thankee and good luck saying which the Waggoner chirrupped to his horses slipped the coin into his pocket nodded and the waggon creaked and rumbled up the lane Bellew strolled along the road breathing an air fragrant with honey suckle from the hedges and full of the song of birds pausing now and then to listen to the blythe carol of a sky lark or the rich sweet notes of a black bird and feeling that it was indeed good to be alive so that what with all this the springy turf beneath his feet and the blue expanse over head he began to whistle for very joy of it until remembering the Haunting Shadow of the Might Have Been he checked himself and sighed instead Presently turning from the road he climbed a stile and followed a narrow path that led away across the meadows and as he went there met him a gentle wind laden with the sweet warm scent of ripening hops and fruit On he went and on heedless of his direction until the sun grew low and he grew hungry wherefore looking about he presently espied a nook sheltered from the sun s level rays by a steep bank where flowers bloomed and ferns grew Here he sat down unslinging his knap sack and here it was also that he first encountered Small Porges CHAPTER IV How Small Porges in looking for a fortune for another found an Uncle for Himself instead The meeting of George Bellew and Small Porges as he afterward came to be called was sudden precipitate and wholly unexpected and it befell on this wise Bellew had opened his knap sack had fished thence cheese clasp knife and a crusty loaf of bread and having exerted himself so far had fallen a thinking or a dreaming in his characteristic attitude i e on the flat of his back when he was aware of a crash in the hedge above and then of something that hurtled past him all arms and legs that rolled over two or three times and eventually brought up in a sitting posture and lifting a lazy head Bellew observed that it was a boy He was a very diminutive boy with a round head covered with coppery curls a boy who stared at Bellew out of a pair of very round blue eyes while he tenderly cherished a knee and an elbow He had been on the brink of tears for a moment but meeting Bellew s quizzical gaze he manfully repressed the weakness and lifting the small and somewhat weather beaten cap that found a precarious perch at the back of his curly head he gravely wished Bellew Good afternoon Well met my Lord Chesterfield nodded Bellew returning the salute are you hurt Just a bit on the elbow but my name s George Why so is mine said Bellew Though they call me Georgy Porgy Of course they do nodded Bellew they used to call me the same once upon a time Georgy Porgy pudding and pie Kissed the girls and made them cry though I never did anything of the kind one doesn t do that sort of thing when one is young and wise that comes later and brings its own care and er heart break Here Bellew sighed and hacked a piece from the loaf with the clasp knife Are you hungry Georgy Porgy he enquired glancing up at the boy who had risen and was removing some of the soil and dust from his small person with his cap Yes I am Then here is bread and cheese and bottled stout so fall to good comrade Thank you but I ve got a piece of bread an jam in my bundle Bundle I dropped it as I came through the hedge I ll get it and as he spoke he turned and climbing up the bank presently came back with a very small bundle that dangled from the end of a very long stick and seating himself beside Bellew he proceeded to open it There sure enough was the bread and jam in question seemingly a little the worse for wear and tear for Bellew observed various articles adhering to it amongst other things a battered penknife and a top These however were readily removed and Georgy Porgy fell to with excellent appetite And pray enquired Bellew after they had munched silently together some while pray where might you be going I don t know yet answered Georgy Porgy with a shake of his curls Good again exclaimed Bellew neither do I Though I ve been thinking of Africa continued his diminutive companion turning the remain of the bread and jam over and over thoughtfully Africa repeated Bellew staring that s quite a goodish step from here Yes sighed Georgy Porgy but you see there s gold there oh lots of it they dig it out of the ground with shovels you know Old Adam told me all bout it an it s gold I m looking for you see I m trying to find a fortune I er beg your pardon said Bellew Money you know explained Georgy Porgy with a patient sigh pounds an shillings an bank notes in a sack if I can get them And what does such a very small Georgy Porgy want so much money for Well it s for my Auntie you know so she won t have to sell her house an go away from Dapplemere She was telling me last night when I was in bed she always comes to tuck me up you know an she told me she was fraid we d have to sell Dapplemere an go to live somewhere else So I asked why an she said cause she hadn t any money an Oh Georgy she said oh Georgy if we could only find enough money to pay off the the Mortgage suggested Bellew at a venture Yes that s it but how did you know Never mind how go on with your tale Georgy Porgy If we could only find enough money or somebody would leave us a fortune she said an she was crying too cause I felt a tear fall on me you know So this morning I got up awful early an made myself a bundle on a stick like Dick Whittington had when he left home an I started off to find a fortune I see nodded Bellew But I haven t found anything yet said Georgy Porgy with a long sigh I s pose money takes a lot of looking for doesn t it Sometimes Bellew answered And do you live alone with your Auntie then Georgy Porgy Yes most boys live with their mothers but that s where I m different I don t need one cause I ve got my Auntie Anthea Anthea repeated Bellew thoughtfully Hereupon they fell silent Bellew watching the smoke curl up from his pipe into the warm still air and Georgy Porgy watching him with very thoughtful eyes and a somewhat troubled brow as if turning over some weighty matter in his mind at last he spoke Please said he with a sudden diffidence where do you live Live repeated Bellew smiling under my hat here there and everywhere which means nowhere in particular But I I mean where is your home My home said Bellew exhaling a great cloud of smoke my home lies beyond the bounding billow That sounds an awful long way off It is an awful long way off An where do you sleep while while you re here Anywhere they ll let me To night I shall sleep at some inn I suppose if I can find one if not under a hedge or hay rick Oh haven t you got any home of your own then here No And you re not going home just yet I mean across the bounding billow Not yet Then please the small boy s voice was suddenly tremulous and eager and he laid a little grimy hand upon Bellew s sleeve please if it isn t too much trouble would you mind coming with me to to help me to find the fortune you see you are so very big an Oh will you please George Bellew sat up suddenly and smiled Bellew s smile was at all times wonderfully pleasant to see at least the boy thought so Georgy Porgy said he you can just bet your small life I will and there s my hand on it old chap Bellew s lips were solemn now but all the best of his smile seemed somehow to have got into his gray eyes So the big hand clasped the small one and as they looked at each other there sprang up a certain understanding that was to be an enduring bond between them I think said Bellew as he lay and puffed at his pipe again I think I ll call you Porges it s shorter easier and I think altogether apt I ll be Big Porges and you shall be Small Porges what do you say Yes it s lots better than Georgy Porgy nodded the boy And so Small Porges he became thenceforth But said he after a thoughtful pause I think if you don t mind I d rather call you Uncle Porges You see Dick Bennet the black smith s boy has three uncles an I ve only got a single aunt so if you don t mind Uncle Porges it shall be now and for ever Amen murmured Bellew An when d you s pose we d better start enquired Small Porges beginning to re tie his bundle Start where nephew To find the fortune Hum said Bellew If we could manage to find some even if it was only a very little it would cheer her up so To be sure it would said Bellew and sitting up he pitched loaf cheese and clasp knife back into the knap sack fastened it slung it upon his shoulders and rising took up his stick Come on my Porges said he and whatever you do keep your weather eye on your uncle Where do you s pose we d better look first enquired Small Porges eagerly Why first I think we d better find your Auntie Anthea But began Porges his face falling But me no buts my Porges smiled Bellew laying his hand upon his new found nephew s shoulder but me no buts boy and as I said before just keep your eye on your uncle CHAPTER V How Bellew came to Arcadia So they set out together Big Porges and Small Porges walking side by side over sun kissed field and meadow slowly and thoughtfully to be sure for Bellew disliked hurry often pausing to listen to the music of running waters or to stare away across the purple valley for the sun was getting low And ever as they went they talked to one another whole heartedly as good friends should And from the boy s eager lips Bellew heard much of Auntie Anthea and learned little by little something of the brave fight she had made lonely and unaided and burdened with ancient debt to make the farm of Dapplemere pay Likewise Small Porges spoke learnedly of the condition of the markets and of the distressing fall in prices in regard to hay and wheat Old Adam he s our man you know he says that farming isn t what it was in his young days specially if you happen to be a woman like my Auntie Anthea an he told me yesterday that if he were Auntie he d give up trying an take mister Cassilis at his word Cassilis ah And who is mister Cassilis He lives at Brampton Court a great big house bout a mile from Dapplemere an he s always asking my Auntie to marry him but course she won t you know Why not Well I think it s cause he s got such big white teeth when he smiles an he s always smiling you know but Old Adam says that if he d been born a woman he d marry a man all teeth or no teeth at all if he had as much money as mister Cassilis The sun was low in the West as skirting a wood they came out upon a grassy lane that presently led them into the great broad highway Now as they trudged along together Small Porges with one hand clasped in Bellew s and the other supporting the bundle on his shoulder there appeared galloping towards them a man on a fine black horse at sight of whom Porges clasp tightened and he drew nearer to Bellew s side When he was nearly abreast of them the horse man checked his career so suddenly that his animal was thrown back on his haunches Why Georgy he exclaimed Good evening mister Cassilis said Small Porges lifting his cap mister Cassilis was tall handsome well built and very particular as to dress Bellew noticed that his teeth were indeed very large and white beneath the small carefully trained moustache also his eyes seemed just a trifle too close together perhaps Why what in the world have you been up to boy he enquired regarding Bellew with no very friendly eye Your Aunt is worrying herself ill on your account what have you been doing with yourself all day Again Bellew felt the small fingers tighten round his and the small figure shrink a little closer to him as Small Porges answered I ve been with Uncle Porges mister Cassilis With whom demanded mister Cassilis more sharply With his Uncle Porges sir Bellew rejoined a trustworthy person and very much at your service mister Cassilis stared his hand began to stroke and caress his small black moustache and he viewed Bellew from his dusty boots up to the crown of his dusty hat and down again with supercilious eyes Uncle he repeated incredulously Porges nodded Bellew I wasn t aware began mister Cassilis that er George was so very fortunate Baptismal name George continued Bellew lately of New York Newport and er other places in America U S A at present of Nowhere in Particular Ah said mister Cassilis his eyes seeming to grow a trifle nearer together an American Uncle Still I was not aware of even that relationship It is a singularly pleasing thought smiled Bellew to know that we may learn something every day that one never knows what the day may bring forth to morrow for instance you also may find yourself a nephew somewhere or other though personally I er doubt it yes I greatly doubt it still one never knows you know and while there s life there s hope A very good afternoon to you sir Come nephew mine the evening falls apace and I grow aweary let us on Excelsior mister Cassilis s cheek grew suddenly red he twirled his moustache angrily and seemed about to speak then he smiled instead and turning his horse spurred him savagely and galloped back down the road in a cloud of dust Did you see his teeth Uncle Porges I did He only smiles like that when he s awful angry said Small Porges shaking his head as the galloping hoof strokes died away in the distance An what do you s pose he went back for Well Porges it s in my mind that he has gone back to warn our Auntie Anthea of our coming Small Porges sighed and his feet dragged in the dust Tired my Porges Just a bit you know but it isn t that I was thinking that the day has almost gone an I haven t found a bit of the fortune yet Why there s always to morrow to live for my Porges Yes course there s always to morrow an then I did find you you know Uncle Porges To be sure you did and an uncle is better than nothing at all isn t he even if he is rather dusty and disreputable of exterior One doesn t find an uncle every day of one s life my Porges no sir An you are so nice an big you know said Porges viewing Bellew with a bright approving eye Long would be a better word perhaps suggested Bellew smiling down at him An wide too nodded Small Porges And from these two facts he seemed to derive a deal of solid comfort and satisfaction for he strode on manfully once more Leaving the high road he guided Bellew by divers winding paths through corn fields and over stiles until at length they were come to an orchard Such an orchard as surely may only be found in Kent where great apple trees gnarled and knotted shot out huge branches that seemed to twist and writhe where were stately pear trees where peaches and apricots ripened against time worn walls whose red bricks still glowed rosily for all their years where the air was sweet with the scent of fruit and fragrant with thyme and sage and marjoram and where the black birds bold marauders that they are piped gloriously all day long In the midst of this orchard they stopped and Small Porges rested one hand against the rugged bole of a great old apple tree This said he is my very own tree because he s so very big an so very very old Adam says he s the oldest tree in the orchard I call him King Arthur cause he is so big an strong just like a king should be you know an all the other trees are his Knights of the Round Table But Bellew was not looking at King Arthur just then his eyes were turned to where one came towards them through the green one surely as tall and gracious as proud and beautiful as Enid or Guinevere or any of those lovely ladies for all her simple gown of blue and the sunbonnet that shaded the beauty of her face Yes as he gazed Bellew was sure and certain that she who all unconscious of their presence came slowly towards them with the red glow of the sunset about her was handsomer lovelier statelier and altogether more desirable than all the beautiful ladies of King Arthur s court or any other court so ever But now Small Porges finding him so silent and seeing where he looked must needs behold her too and gave a sudden glad cry and ran out from behind the great bulk of King Arthur and she hearing his voice turned and ran to meet him and sank upon her knees before him and clasped him against her heart and rejoiced and wept and scolded him all in a breath Wherefore Bellew unobserved as yet in King Arthur s shadow watching the proud head with its wayward curls for the sunbonnet had been tossed back upon her shoulders watching the quick passionate caress of those slender brown hands and listening to the thrilling tenderness of that low soft voice felt all at once strangely lonely and friendless and out of place very rough and awkward and very much aware of his dusty person felt indeed as any other ordinary human might who had tumbled unexpectedly into Arcadia therefore he turned thinking to steal quietly away You see Auntie I went out to try an find a fortune for you Small Porges was explaining an I looked an looked but I didn t find a bit My dear dear brave Georgy said Anthea and would have kissed him again but he put her off Wait a minute please Auntie he said excitedly cause I did find something just as I was growing very tired an disappointed I found Uncle Porges under a hedge you know Uncle Porges said Anthea starting Oh that must be the man mister Cassilis mentioned So I brought him with me pursued Small Porges an there he is and he pointed triumphantly towards King Arthur Glancing thither Anthea beheld a tall dusty figure moving off among the trees Oh wait please she called rising to her feet and with Small Porges hand in hers approached Bellew who had stopped with his dusty back to them I I want to thank you for taking care of my nephew If you will come up to the house cook shall give you a good meal and if you are in need of work I I her voice faltered uncertainly and she stopped Thank you said Bellew turning and lifting his hat Oh I beg your pardon said Anthea Now as their eyes met it seemed to Bellew as though he had lived all his life in expectation of this moment and he knew that all his life he should never forget this moment But now even while he looked at her he saw her cheeks flush painfully and her dark eyes grow troubled I beg your pardon said she again I I thought mister Cassilis gave me to understand that you were A very dusty hungry looking fellow perhaps smiled Bellew and he was quite right you know the dust you can see for yourself but the hunger you must take my word for As for the work I assure you exercise is precisely what I am looking for But said Anthea and stopped and tapped the grass nervously with her foot and twisted one of her bonnet strings and meeting Bellew s steady gaze flushed again but you you are My Uncle Porges her nephew chimed in an I brought him home with me cause he s going to help me to find a fortune an he hasn t got any place to go to cause his home s far far beyond the bounding billow so you will let him stay won t you Auntie Anthea Why Georgy she began but seeing her distressed look Bellew came to her rescue Pray do Miss Anthea said he in his quiet easy manner My name is Bellew he went on to explain I am an American without family or friends here there or anywhere and with nothing in the world to do but follow the path of the winds Indeed I am rather a solitary fellow at least I was until I met my nephew Porges here Since then I ve been wondering if there would be er room for such as I at Dapplemere Oh there would be plenty of room said Anthea hesitating and wrinkling her white brow for a lodger was something entirely new in her experience As to my character pursued Bellew though something of a vagabond I am not a rogue at least I hope not and I could pay er four or five pounds a week Oh exclaimed Anthea with a little gasp If that would be sufficient It is a great deal too much said Anthea who would have scarcely dared to ask three Pardon me but I think not said Bellew shaking his head you see I am er rather extravagant in my eating eggs you know lots of em and ham and beef and er a duck quacked loudly from the vicinity of a neighbouring pond certainly an occasional duck Indeed five pounds a week would scarcely Three would be ample said Anthea with a little nod of finality Very well said Bellew we ll make it four and have done with it Anthea Devine being absolute mistress of Dapplemere was in the habit of exerting her authority and having her own way in most things therefore she glanced up in some surprise at this tall dusty rather lazy looking personage and she noticed even as had Small Porges that he was indeed very big and wide she noticed also that despite the easy courtesy of his manner and the quizzical light of his gray eyes his chin was very square and that despite his gentle voice he had the air of one who meant exactly what he said Nevertheless she was much inclined to take issue with him upon the matter plainly observing which Bellew smiled and shook his head Pray be reasonable he said in his gentle voice if you send me away to some horrible inn or other it will cost me being an American more than that every week in tips and things so let s shake hands on it and call it settled and he held out his hand to her Four pounds a week It would be a veritable God send just at present while she was so hard put to it to make both ends meet Four pounds a week So Anthea stood lost in frowning thought until meeting his frank smile she laughed You are dreadfully persistent she said and I know it is too much but we ll try to make you as comfortable as we can and she laid her hand in his And thus it was that George Bellew came to Dapplemere in the glory of the after glow of an August afternoon breathing the magic air of Arcadia which is and always has been of that rare quality warranted to go to the head sooner or later And thus it was that Small Porges with his bundle on his shoulder viewed this tall dusty Uncle with the eye of possession which is oft times an eye of rapture And Anthea She was busy calculating to a scrupulous nicety the very vexed question as to exactly how far four pounds per week might be made to go to the best possible advantage of all concerned CHAPTER VI Of the sad condition of the Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been Dapplemere Farm House or The Manor as it was still called by many had been built when Henry the Eighth was King as the carved inscription above the door testified The House of Dapplemere was a place of many gables and latticed windows and with tall slender chimneys shaped and wrought into things of beauty and delight It possessed a great old hall there were spacious chambers and broad stairways there were panelled corridors sudden flights of steps that led up or down again for no apparent reason there were broad and generous hearths and deep window seats and everywhere within and without there lurked an indefinable old world charm that was the heritage of years Storms had buffeted and tempests had beaten upon it but all in vain for save that the bricks glowed a deeper red where they peeped out beneath the clinging ivy the old house stood as it had upon that far day when it was fashioned in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty four In England many such houses are yet to be found monuments of the Bad Old Times memorials of the Dark Ages when lath and stucco existed not and the Jerry builder had no being But where among them all might be found such another parlour as this at Dapplemere with its low raftered ceiling its great carved mantel its panelled walls whence old portraits looked down at one like dream faces from dim and nebulous backgrounds And where might be found two such bright eyed rosy cheeked quick footed deft handed Phyllises as the two buxom maids who flitted here and there obedient to their mistress s word or gesture And lastly where in all this wide world could there ever be found just such another hostess as Miss Anthea herself Something of all this was in Bellew s mind as he sat with Small Porges beside him watching Miss Anthea dispense tea brewed as it should be in an earthen tea pot Milk and sugar mister Bellew Thank you This is blackberry an this is raspberry an red currant but the blackberry jam s the best Uncle Porges Thank you nephew Now aren t you awful glad I found you under that hedge Uncle Porges Nephew I am Nephew repeated Anthea glancing at him with raised brows Oh yes nodded Bellew we adopted each other at about four o clock this afternoon Under a hedge you know added Small Porges Wasn t it a very sudden and altogether unheard of proceeding Anthea enquired Well it might have been if it had happened anywhere but in Arcadia What do you mean by Arcadia Uncle Porges A place I ve been looking for nearly all my life nephew I ll trouble you for the blackberry jam my Porges Yes try the blackberry Aunt Priscilla made it her very own self You know it s perfectly ridiculous said Anthea frowning and laughing both at the same time What is Miss Anthea Why that you should be sitting here calling Georgy your nephew and that I should be pouring out tea for you quite as a matter of course It seems to me the most delightfully natural thing in the world said Bellew in his slow grave manner But I ve only known you half an hour But then friendships ripen quickly in Arcadia I wonder what Aunt Priscilla will have to say about it Aunt Priscilla She is our housekeeper the dearest busiest gentlest little housekeeper in all the world but with very sharp eyes mister Bellew She will either like you very much or not at all there are no half measures about Aunt Priscilla Now I wonder which it will be said Bellew helping himself to more jam Oh she ll like you a course nodded Small Porges I know she ll like you cause you re so different to mister Cassilis he s got black hair an a mestache you know an your hair s gold like mine an your mestache isn t there is it An I know she doesn t like mister Cassilis an I don t either cause She will be back to morrow said Anthea silencing Small Porges with a gentle touch of her hand and we shall be glad sha n t we Georgy The house is not the same place without her You see I am off in the fields all day as a rule a farm even such a small one as Dapplemere is a great responsibility and takes up all one s time if it is to be made to pay An sometimes it doesn t pay at all you know added Small Porges an then Auntie Anthea worries an I worry too Farming isn t what it was in Adam s young days so that s why I must find a fortune early tomorrow morning you know so my Auntie won t have to worry any more Now when he had got thus far Anthea leaned over and taking him by surprise kissed Small Porges suddenly It was very good and brave of you dear said she in her soft thrilling voice to go out all alone into this big world to try and find a fortune for me and here she would have kissed him again but that he reminded her that they were not alone But Georgy dear fortunes are very hard to find especially round Dapplemere I m afraid said she with a rueful little laugh Yes that s why I was going to Africa you know Africa she repeated Africa Oh yes nodded Bellew when I met him he was on his way there to bring back gold for you in a sack Only Uncle Porges said it was a goodish way off you know so I cided to stay an find the fortune nearer home And thus they talked unaffectedly together until tea being over Anthea volunteered to show Bellew over her small domain and they went out all three into an evening that breathed of roses and honeysuckle And as they went slow footed through the deepening twilight Small Porges directed Bellew s attention to certain nooks and corners that might be well calculated to conceal the fortune they were to find while Anthea pointed out to him the beauties of shady wood of rolling meadow and winding stream But there were other beauties that neither of them thought to call to his attention but which Bellew noted with observing eyes none the less such for instance as the way Anthea had of drooping her shadowy lashes at sudden and unexpected moments the wistful droop of her warm red lips and the sweet round column of her throat These and much beside Bellew noticed for himself as they walked on together through this midsummer evening And so betimes Bellew got him to bed and though the hour was ridiculously early yet he fell into a profound slumber and dreamed of nothing at all But far away upon the road forgotten and out of mind with futile writhing and grimaces the Haunting Shadow of the Might Have Been jibbered in the shadows CHAPTER VII Which concerns itself among other matters with the Old Adam Bellew awakened early next morning which was an unusual thing for Bellew to do under ordinary circumstances since he was one who held with that poet who has written somewhere or other something to the following effect God bless the man who first discovered sleep But damn the man with curses loud and deep who first invented early rising Nevertheless Bellew as has been said awoke early next morning to find the sun pouring in at his window and making a glory all about him But it was not this that had roused him he thought as he lay blinking drowsily nor the black bird piping so wonderfully in the apple tree outside a very inquisitive apple tree that had writhed and contorted itself most un naturally in its efforts to peep in at the window therefore Bellew fell to wondering sleepily enough what it could have been Presently it came again the sound a very peculiar sound the like of which Bellew had never heard before which as he listened gradually evolved itself into a kind of monotonous chant intoned by a voice deep and harsh yet withal not unmusical Now the words of the chant were these When I am dead diddle diddle as well may hap Bury me deep diddle diddle under the tap Under the tap diddle diddle I ll tell you why That I may drink diddle diddle when I am dry Hereupon Bellew rose and crossing to the open casement leaned out into the golden freshness of the morning Looking about he presently espied the singer one who carried two pails suspended from a yoke upon his shoulders a very square man that is to say square of shoulder square of head and square of jaw being in fact none other than the Waggoner with whom he had fought and ridden on the previous afternoon seeing which Bellew hailed him in cheery greeting The man glanced up and breaking off his song in the middle of a note stood gazing at Bellew open mouthed What be that you sir he enquired at last and then Lord an what be you a doing of up theer Why sleeping of course answered Bellew W ot again exclaimed the Waggoner with a grin you do be for ever a sleepin I do believe Not when you re anywhere about laughed Bellew Was it me as woke ye then Your singing did My singin Lord love ye an well it might My singin would wake the dead leastways so Prudence says an she s generally right leastways if she ain t she s a uncommon good cook an that goes a long way wi most of us But I don t sing very often unless I be alone or easy in my mind an appy earted which I ain t No enquired Bellew Not by no manner o means I ain t contrariwise my eart be sore an full o gloom which ain t to be wondered at nohow And yet you were singing Aye for sure I were singin but then who could help singin on such a mornin as this be an wi the black bird a piping away in the tree here Oh I were singin I don t go for to deny it but it s sore earted I be an filled wi gloom sir notwithstanding You mean said Bellew becoming suddenly thoughtful that you are haunted by the Carking Spectre of the er Might Have Been Lord bless you no sir This ain t no spectre nor yet no skellington which arter all is only old bones an such no this ain t nothin of that sort an no more it ain t a thing as I can stand ere a maggin about wi a long day s work afore me axing your pardon sir Saying which the Waggoner nodded suddenly and strode off with his pails clanking cheerily Very soon Bellew was shaved and dressed and going down stairs he let himself out into the early sunshine and strolled away towards the farm yard where cocks crew cows lowed ducks quacked turkeys and geese gobbled and hissed and where the Waggoner moved to and fro among them all like a presiding genius I think said Bellew as he came up I think you must be the Adam I have heard of That be my name sir Then Adam fill your pipe and Bellew extended his pouch whereupon Adam thanked him and fishing a small short black clay from his pocket proceeded to fill and light it Yes sir he nodded inhaling the tobacco with much apparent enjoyment Adam I were baptized some thirty odd year ago but I generally calls myself Old Adam But you re not old Adam Why it ain t on account o my age ye see sir it be all because o the Old Adam as is inside o me Lord love ye I am nat rally that full o the Old Adam as never was An e s alway a up an taking of me at the shortest notice Only t other day he up an took me because Job Jagway e works for Squire Cassilis you ll understand sir because Job Jagway sez as our wheat meanin Miss Anthea s wheat you ll understand sir was mouldy well the Old Adam up an took me to that extent sir that they ad to carry Job Jagway home arterwards Which is all on account o the Old Adam me being the mildest chap you ever see nat rally mild ah sucking doves wouldn t be nothin to me for mildness And what did the Squire have to say about your spoiling his man Wrote to Miss Anthea o course sir he s always writing to Miss Anthea about summat or other sez as how he was minded to lock me up for sault an battery but out o respect for her would let me off wi a warning Miss Anthea was worried I suppose Worried sir Oh Adam sez she Oh Adam aven t I got enough to bear but you must make it arder for me An I see the tears in her eyes while she said it Me make it arder for her Jest as if I wouldn t make things lighter for er if I could which I can t jest as if to help Miss Anthea I wouldn t let em take me an well never mind what only I would Yes I m sure you would nodded Bellew And is the Squire over here at Dapplemere very often Adam Why not so much lately sir Last time were yesterday jest afore Master Georgy come ome I were at work here in the yard an Squire comes riding up to me smiling quite friendly like which were pretty good of him considering as Job Jagway ain t back to work yet Oh Adam sez he so you re aving a sale here at Dapplemere are you Meaning sir a sale of some bits an sticks o furnitur as Miss Anthea s forced to part wi to meet some bill or other Summat o that sir says I making as light of it as I could Why then Adam sez he if Job Jagway should appen to come over to buy a few o the things no more fighting sez he An so he nods an smiles an off he rides An sir as I watched him go the Old Adam riz up in me to that extent as it s a mercy I didn t have no pitchfork andy Bellew sitting on the shaft of a cart with his back against a rick listened to this narration with an air of dreamy abstraction but Adam s quick eyes noticed that despite the unruffled serenity of his brow his chin seemed rather more prominent than usual So that was why you were feeling gloomy was it Adam Ah an enough to make any man feel gloomy I should think Miss Anthea s brave enough but I reckon twill come nigh breakin er eart to see the old stuff sold the furnitur an that so she s goin to drive over to Cranbrook to be out o the way while it s a doin And when does the sale take place The Saturday arter next sir as ever was Adam answered But hush mum s the word sir he broke off and winking violently with a side ways motion of the head he took up his pitch fork Wherefore glancing round Bellew saw Anthea coming towards them fresh and sweet as the morning Her hands were full of flowers and she carried her sun bonnet upon her arm Here and there a rebellious curl had escaped from its fastenings as though desirous and very naturally of kissing the soft oval of her cheek or the white curve of her neck And among them Bellew noticed one in particular a roguish curl that glowed in the sun with a coppery light and peeped at him wantonly above her ear Good morning said he rising and to all appearance addressing the curl in question you are early abroad this morning Early mister Bellew why I ve been up hours I m generally out at four o clock on market days we work hard and long at Dapplemere she answered giving him her hand with her grave sweet smile Aye for sure nodded Adam but farmin ain t what it was in my young days But I think we shall do well with the hops Adam Ops Miss Anthea lord love you there ain t no ops nowhere so good as ourn be They ought to be ready for picking soon do you think sixty people will be enough Ah they ll be more n enough Miss Anthea And Adam the five acre field should be mowed today I ll set the men at it right arter breakfast I ll ave it done trust me Miss Anthea I do Adam you know that And with a smiling nod she turned away Now as Bellew walked on beside her he felt a strange constraint upon him such as he had never experienced towards any woman before and the which he was at great pains with himself to account for Indeed so rapt was he that he started suddenly to find that she was asking him a question Do you like Dapplemere mister Bellew Like it he repeated like it Yes indeed I m so glad she answered her eyes glowing with pleasure It was a much larger property once Look and she pointed away across corn fields and rolling meadow to the distant woods In my grandfather s time it was all his as far as you can see and farther but it has dwindled since then and to day my Dapplemere is very small indeed You must be very fond of such a beautiful place Oh I love it she cried passionately if ever I had to give it up I think I should die She stopped suddenly and as though somewhat abashed by this sudden outburst adding in a lighter tone If I seem rather tragic it is because this is the only home I have ever known Well said Bellew appearing rather more dreamy than usual just then I have journeyed here and there in this world of ours I have wandered up and down and to and fro in it like a certain celebrated personage who shall be nameless yet I never saw or dreamed of any such place as this Dapplemere of yours It is like Arcadia itself and only I am out of place I seem somehow to be too common place and altogether matter of fact I m sure I m matter of fact enough she said with her low sweet laugh that Bellew thought was all too rare You said he and shook his head Well she enquired glancing at him through her wind tossed curls You are like some fair and stately lady out of the old romances he said gravely In a print gown and with a sun bonnet Even so he nodded Here for no apparent reason happening to meet his glance the colour deepened in her cheek and she was silent wherefore Bellew went on in his slow placid tones You surely are the Princess ruling this fair land of Arcadia and I am the Stranger within your gates It behoves you therefore to be merciful to this Stranger if only for the sake of er our mutual nephew Whatever Anthea might have said in answer was cut short by Small Porges himself who came galloping towards them with the sun bright in his curls Oh Uncle Porges he panted as he came up I was fraid you d gone away an left me I ve been hunting an hunting for you ever since I got up No I haven t gone away yet my Porges you see An you won t go ever or ever will you That said Bellew taking the small hand in his that is a question that we had better leave to the er future nephew But why Well you see it doesn t rest with me altogether my Porges Then who he was beginning but Anthea s soft voice interrupted him Georgy dear didn t Prudence send you to tell us that breakfast was ready Oh yes I was forgetting awfull silly of me wasn t it But you are going to stay Oh a long long time aren t you Uncle Porges I sincerely Hope so answered Bellew Now as he spoke his eyes by the merest chance in the world of course happened to meet Anthea s whereupon she turned and slipped on her sunbonnet which was very natural for the sun was growing hot already I m awful glad sighed Small Porges an Auntie s glad too aren t you Auntie Why of course from the depths of the sunbonnet Cause now you see there ll be two of us to take care of you Uncle Porges is so nice an big and wide isn t he Auntie Y e s Oh Georgy what are you talking about Why I mean I m rather small to take care of you all by myself alone Auntie though I do my best of course But now that I ve found myself a big tall Uncle Porges under the hedge you know we can take care of you together can t we Auntie Anthea But Anthea only hurried on without speaking whereupon Small Porges continued all unheeding You member the other night Auntie when you were crying you said you wished you had some one very big and strong to take care of you Oh Georgy Bellew heartily wished that sunbonnets had never been thought of But you did you know Auntie an so that was why I went out an found my Uncle Porges for you so that he But here Mistress Anthea for all her pride and stateliness catching her gown about her fairly ran on down the path and never paused until she had reached the cool dim parlour Being there she tossed aside her sunbonnet and looked at herself in the long old mirror and though surely no mirror made by man ever reflected a fairer vision of dark eyed witchery and loveliness nevertheless Anthea stamped her foot and frowned at it Oh she exclaimed and then again Oh Georgy and covered her burning cheeks Meanwhile Big Porges and Small Porges walking along hand in hand shook their heads solemnly wondering much upon the capriciousness of aunts and the waywardness thereof I wonder why she runned away Uncle Porges Ah I wonder Specks she s a bit angry with me you know cause I told you she was crying Hum said Bellew An Auntie takes an awful lot of looking after sighed Small Porges Yes nodded Bellew I suppose so especially if she happens to be young and er An what Uncle Porges Beautiful nephew Oh Do you think she s really beautiful demanded Small Porges I m afraid I do Bellew confessed So does mister Cassilis I heard him tell her so once in the orchard Hum said Bellew Ah but you ought to see her when she comes to tuck me up at night with her hair all down an hanging all about her like a shiny cloak you know Hum said Bellew Please Uncle Porges said Georgy turning to look up at him what makes you hum so much this morning I was thinking my Porges Bout my Auntie Anthea I do admit the soft impeachment sir Well I m thinking too What is it old chap I m thinking we ought to begin to find that fortune for her after breakfast Why it isn t quite the right season for fortune hunting yet at least not in Arcadia answered Bellew shaking his head Oh but why not Well the moon isn t right for one thing The moon echoed Small Porges Oh yes we must wait for a er a Money Moon you know surely you ve heard of a Money Moon Fraid not sighed Small Porges regretfully but I ve heard of a Honey moon They re often much the same nodded Bellew But when will the Money Moon come an how I can t exactly say my Porges but come it will one of these fine nights And when it does we shall know that the fortune is close by and waiting to be found So don t worry your small head about it just keep your eye on your uncle Betimes they came in to breakfast where Anthea awaited them at the head of the table Then who so demure so gracious and self possessed so sweetly sedate as she But the Cavalier in the picture above the carved mantel versed in the ways of the world and the pretty tricks and wiles of the Beau Sex Feminine smiled down at Bellew with an expression of such roguish waggery as said plain as words We know And Bellew remembering a certain pair of slender ankles that had revealed themselves in their hurried flight smiled back at the cavalier and it was all he could do to refrain from winking outright CHAPTER VIII Which tells of Miss Priscilla of peaches and of Sergeant Appleby late of the nineteenth Hussars Small Porges was at his lessons He was perched at the great oak table beside the window pen in hand and within easy reach of Anthea who sat busied with her daily letters and accounts Small Porges was laboriously inscribing in a somewhat splashed and besmeared copy book the rather surprising facts that A stitch in time saves nine nine That The Tagus a river in Spain R and that Artaxerxes was a king of the Persians A and the like surprising curious and interesting items of news his pen making not half so many curls and twists as did his small red tongue As he wrote he frowned terrifically and sighed oft betwixt whiles and Bellew watching where he stood outside the window noticed that Anthea frowned also as she bent over her accounts and sighed wearily more than once It was after a sigh rather more hopeless than usual that chancing to raise her eyes they encountered those of the watcher outside who seeing himself discovered smiled and came to lean in at the open window Won t they balance he enquired with a nod toward the heap of bills and papers before her Oh yes she answered with a rueful little smile but on the wrong side if you know what I mean I know he nodded watching how her lashes curled against her cheek If only we had done better with our first crop of wheat she sighed Job Jagway said it was mouldy you know that s why Adam punched him in the Georgy go on with your work sir Yes Auntie And immediately Small Porges pen began to scratch and his tongue to writhe and twist as before I m building all my hopes this year on the hops said Anthea sinking her head upon her hand if they should fail Well enquired Bellew with his gaze upon the soft curve of her throat I daren t think of it Then don t let us talk of something else Yes of Aunt Priscilla nodded Anthea she is in the garden And pray who is Aunt Priscilla Go and meet her But Go and find her in the orchard repeated Anthea Oh do go and leave us to our work Thus it was that turning obediently into the orchard and looking about Bellew presently espied a little bright eyed old lady who sat beneath the shadow of King Arthur with a rustic table beside her upon which stood a basket of sewing Now as he went he chanced to spy a ball of worsted that had fallen by the way and stooping therefore he picked it up while she watched him with her quick bright eyes Good morning mister Bellew she said in response to his salutation it was nice of you to trouble to pick up an old woman s ball of worsted As she spoke she rose and dropped him a courtesy and then as he looked at her again he saw that despite her words and despite her white hair she was much younger and prettier than he had thought I am Miss Anthea s house keeper she went on I was away when you arrived looking after one of Miss Anthea s old ladies pray be seated Miss Anthea bless her dear heart calls me her aunt but I m not really Oh dear no I m no relation at all But I ve lived with her long enough to feel as if I was her aunt and her uncle and her father and her mother all rolled into one though I should be rather small to be so many shouldn t I and she laughed so gaily and unaffectedly that Bellew laughed too I tell you all this she went on keeping pace to her flying needle because I have taken a fancy to you on the spot I always like or dislike a person on the spot first impressions you know Y e e s she continued glancing up at him side ways I like you just as much as I dislike mister Cassilis heigho how I do detest that man There now that s off my mind And why enquired Bellew smiling Dear me mister Bellew I how should I know only I do and what s more he knows it too And how she enquired changing the subject abruptly how is your bed comfortable mm Very You sleep well Like a top Any complaints so far None whatever laughed Bellew shaking his head That is very well We have never had a boarder before and Miss Anthea bless her dear soul was a little nervous about it And here s the Sergeant I er beg your pardon said Bellew The Sergeant repeated Miss Priscilla with a prim little nod Sergeant Appleby late of the Nineteenth Hussars a soldier every inch of him mister Bellew with one arm over there by the peaches Glancing in the direction she indicated Bellew observed a tall figure very straight and upright clad in a tight fitting blue coat with extremely tight trousers strapped beneath the insteps and with a hat balanced upon his close cropped grizzled head at a perfectly impossible angle for any save an ex cavalry man Now as he stood examining a peach tree that flourished against the opposite wall Bellew saw that his right sleeve was empty sure enough and was looped across his broad chest The very first thing he will say will be that it is a very fine day nodded Miss Priscilla stitching away faster than ever and the next that the peaches are doing remarkably well now mark my words mister Bellew As she spoke the Sergeant wheeled suddenly right about face and came striding down towards them jingling imaginary spurs and with his stick tucked up under his remaining arm very much as if it had been a sabre Being come up to them the Sergeant raised a stiff arm as though about to salute them military fashion but apparently changing his mind took off the straw hat instead and put it on again more over one ear than ever A particular fine day Miss Priscilla for the time o the year said he Indeed I quite agree with you Sergeant returned little Miss Priscilla with a bright nod and a sly glance at Bellew as much as to say I told you so And the peaches mam continued the Sergeant the peaches never looked better mam Having said which he stood looking at nothing in particular with his one hand resting lightly upon his hip Yes to be sure Sergeant nodded Miss Priscilla with another sly look But let me introduce you to mister Bellew who is staying at Dapplemere The Sergeant stiffened once more began a salute changed his mind took off his hat instead and after looking at it as though not quite sure what to do with it next clapped it back upon his ear in imminent danger of falling off and was done with it Proud to know you sir your servant sir How do you do said Bellew and held out his hand with his frank smile The Sergeant hesitated then put out his remaining hand My left sir said he apologetically can t be helped left my right out in India a good many years ago Good place for soldiering India sir plenty of active service chances of promotion though sun bad Sergeant said Miss Priscilla without seeming to glance up from her sewing Sergeant your hat Hereupon the Sergeant gave a sudden sideways jerk of the head and in the very nick of time saved the article in question from tumbling off and very dexterously brought it to the top of his close cropped head whence it immediately began slowly and by scarcely perceptible degrees to slide down to his ear again Sergeant said Miss Priscilla again sit down do Thank you mam said he and proceeded to seat himself at the other end of the rustic bench where he remained bolt upright and with his long legs stretched out straight before him as is and has been the manner of cavalrymen since they first wore straps And now said he staring straight in front of him how might Miss Anthea be Oh very well thank you nodded Miss Priscilla Good exclaimed the Sergeant with his eyes still fixed very good Here he passed his hand two or three times across his shaven chin regarding an apple tree nearby with an expression of the most profound interest And how said he again how might Master Georgy be Master Georgy is as well as ever answered Miss Priscilla stitching away faster than before and Bellew thought she kept her rosy cheeks stooped a little lower over her work Meanwhile the Sergeant continued to regard the tree with the same degree of lively interest and to rasp his fingers to and fro across his chin Suddenly he coughed behind hand whereupon Miss Priscilla raised her head and looked at him Well she enquired very softly And pray mam said the Sergeant removing his gaze from the tree with a jerk how might you be feeling mam Much the same as usual thank you she answered smiling like a girl for all her white hair as the Sergeant s eyes met hers You look said he pausing to cough behind his hand again you look blooming mam if you ll allow the expression blooming as you ever do mam I m an old woman Sergeant as well you know sighed Miss Priscilla shaking her head Old mam repeated the Sergeant old mam nothing of the sort mam Age has nothing to do with it Tisn t the years as count We aren t any older than we feel eh sir Of course not answered Bellew Nor than we look eh sir Certainly not Sergeant answered Bellew And she sir she don t look a day older than Thirty five said Bellew Exactly sir very true My own opinion thirty five exactly sir Sergeant said Miss Priscilla bending over her work again Sergeant your hat The Sergeant hereupon removed the distracting head gear altogether and sat with it upon his knee staring hard at the tree again Then all at once with a sudden gesture he drew a large silver watch from his pocket rather as if it were some weapon of offence looked at it listened to it and then nodding his head rose to his feet Must be going he said standing very straight and looking down at little Miss Priscilla though sorry as ever must be going mam Miss Priscilla mam good day to you And he stretched out his hand to her with a sudden jerky movement Miss Priscilla paused in her sewing and looked up at him with her youthful smile Must you go so soon Sergeant Then Good bye until to morrow and she laid her very small hand in his big palm The Sergeant stared down at it as though he were greatly minded to raise it to his lips instead of doing which he dropped it suddenly and turned to Bellew Sir I am proud to have met you Sir there is a poor crippled soldier as I know My cottage is very small and humble sir but if you ever feel like dropping in on him sir by day or night he will be honoured sir honoured And that s me Sergeant Richard Appleby late of the Nineteenth Hussars at your service sir saying which he put on his hat stiff armed wheeled and strode away through the orchard jingling his imaginary spurs louder than ever Well enquired Miss Priscilla in her quick bright way Well mister Bellew what do you think of him first impressions are always best at least I think so what do you think of Sergeant Appleby I think he s a splendid fellow said Bellew looking after the Sergeant s upright figure A very foolish old fellow I think and as stiff as one of the ram rods of one of his own guns said Miss Priscilla but her clear blue eyes were very soft and tender as she spoke And as fine a soldier as a man I m sure said Bellew Why yes he was a good soldier once upon a time I believe he won the Victoria Cross for doing something or other that was very brave and he wears it with all his other medals pinned on the inside of his coat Oh yes he was a fine soldier once but he s a very foolish old soldier now I think and as stiff as the ram rod of one of his own guns But I m glad you like him mister Bellew and he will be proud and happy for you to call and see him at his cottage And now I suppose it is half past eleven isn t it Yes just half past nodded Bellew glancing at his watch Exact to time as usual said Miss Priscilla I don t think the Sergeant has missed a minute or varied a minute in the last five years you see he is such a very methodical man mister Bellew Why then does he come every day at the same hour Every day nodded Miss Priscilla it has become a matter of habit with him Ah said Bellew smiling If you were to ask me why he comes I should answer that I fancy it is to look at the peaches Dear me mister Bellew what a very foolish old soldier he is to be sure Saying which pretty bright eyed Miss Priscilla laughed again folded up her work settled it in the basket with a deft little pat and rising took a small crutch stick from where it had lain concealed and then Bellew saw that she was lame Oh yes I m a cripple you see she nodded Oh very very lame my ankle you know That is why I came here the big world didn t want a poor lame old woman that is why Miss Anthea made me her Aunt God bless her No thank you I can carry my basket So you see he has lost an arm his right one and I am lame in my foot Perhaps that is why Heigho how beautifully the black birds are singing this morning to be sure CHAPTER IX In which may be found some description of Arcadia and gooseberries Anthea leaning on her rake in a shady corner of the five acre field turned to watch Bellew who stripped to his shirt sleeves bare of neck and arm and pitch fork in hand was busy tossing up great mounds of sweet smelling hay to Adam who stood upon a waggon to receive it with Small Porges perched up beside him A week had elapsed since Bellew had found his way to Dapplemere a week which had only served to strengthen the bonds of affection between him and his nephew and to win over sharp eyed shrewd little Miss Priscilla to the extent of declaring him to be First a gentleman Anthea my dear and Secondly what is much rarer now a days a true man A week and already he was hail fellow well met with everyone about the place for who was proof against his unaffected gaiety his simple easy good fellowship So he laughed and joked as he swung his pitch fork awkwardly enough to be sure and received all hints and directions as to its use in the kindly spirit they were tendered And Anthea watching him from her shady corner sighed once or twice and catching herself so doing stamped her foot at herself and pulled her sunbonnet closer about her face No Adam he was saying depend upon it there is nothing like exercise and of all exercise give me a pitch fork Why as to that mister Belloo sir Adam retorted I say so be it so long as I ain t near the wrong end of it for the way you do ave of flourishin an a whirlin that theer fork is fair as tonishin I do declare it be Why you see Adam there are some born with a leaning towards pitch forks as there are others born to the pen and the er palette and things but for me Adam the pitch fork every time said Bellew mopping his brow If you was to try an andle it more as if it was a pitchfork now mister Belloo sir suggested Adam and not waiting for Bellew s laughing rejoinder he chirrupped to the horses and the great waggon creaked away with its mountainous load surmounted by Adam s grinning visage and Small Porges golden curls and followed by the rest of the merry voiced hay makers Now it was that turning his head Bellew espied Anthea watching him whereupon he shouldered his fork and coming to where she sat upon a throne of hay he sank down at her feet with a luxurious sigh She had never seen him without a collar before and now she could not but notice how round and white and powerful his neck was and how the muscles bulged upon arm and shoulder and how his hair curled in small damp rings upon his brow It is good said he looking up into the witching face above him yes it is very good to see you idle just for once And I was thinking it was good to see you work just for once Work he exclaimed my dear Miss Anthea I assure you I have become a positive glutton for work It has become my earnest desire to plant things and grow things and chop things with axes to mow things with scythes I dream of pastures and ploughs of pails and pitchforks by night and by day reaping hooks hoes and rakes are in my thoughts continually which all goes to show the effect of this wonderful air of Arcadia Indeed I am as full of suppressed energy these days as Adam is of the Old Adam And talking of Adam reminds me that he has solemnly pledged himself to initiate me into the mysteries of swinging a scythe to morrow morning at five o clock Yes indeed my heart bounds responsive to the swish of a scythe in thick grass and my soul sits enraptured upon a pitch fork How ridiculous you are she laughed And how perfectly content he added Is anyone ever quite content she sighed glancing down at him wistful eyed Not unless they have found Arcadia he answered Have you then Yes he nodded complacently oh yes I ve found it Are you sure Quite sure Arcadia she repeated wrinkling her brows what is Arcadia and where Arcadia answered Bellew watching the smoke rise up from his pipe with a dreamy eye Arcadia is the Promised Land the Land that everyone tries to find sometime or other and may be anywhere And how came you to find it By the most fortunate chance in the world Tell me said Anthea taking a wisp of hay and beginning to plait it in dexterous brown fingers tell me how you found it Why then you must know in the first place he began in his slow even voice that it is a place I have sought for in all my wanderings and I have been pretty far afield but I sought it so long and so vainly that I began to think it was like the El Dorado of the old Adventurers and had never existed at all Yes said Anthea busy with her plaiting But one day Fate or Chance or Destiny or their benevolent spirit sent a certain square shouldered Waggoner to show me the way and after him a very small Porges bless him to lead me into this wonderful Arcadia Oh I see nodded Anthea very intent upon her plaiting But there is something more said Bellew Oh said Anthea Shall I tell you If it is very interesting Well then in this delightful land there is a castle grim embattled and very strong A castle said Anthea glancing up suddenly The Castle of Heart s Desire Oh said she and gave all her attention to her plaiting again And so continued Bellew I am waiting very patiently until in her own good time she who rules within shall open the gate to me or bid me go away Into Bellew s voice had crept a thrill no one had ever heard there before he leaned nearer to her and his dreamy eyes were keen now and eager And she though she saw nothing of all this yet being a woman knew it was there of course and for that very reason looked resolutely away Wherefore once again Bellew heartily wished that sunbonnets had never been invented So there was silence while Anthea stared away across the golden corn fields yet saw nothing of them and Bellew looked upon those slender capable fingers that had faltered in their plaiting and stopped And thus upon the silence there broke a sudden voice shrill with interest Go on Uncle Porges what about the dragons Oh please go on there s always dragons in chanted castles you know to guard the lovely Princess aren t you going to have any dragons that hiss you know an spit out smoke an flames Oh do please have a dragon And Small Porges appeared from the other side of the hay mow flushed and eager Certainly my Porges nodded Bellew drawing the small figure down beside him I was forgetting the dragons but there they are with scaly backs and iron claws spitting out sparks and flames just as self respecting dragons should and roaring away like thunder Ah exclaimed Small Porges nestling closer to Bellew and reaching out a hand to Auntie Anthea that s fine let s have plenty of dragons Do you think a er dozen would be enough my Porges Oh yes But s pose the beautiful Princess didn t open the door what would you do if you were really a wandering knight who was waiting patiently for it to open what would you do then Shin up a tree my Porges Oh but that wouldn t be a bit right would it Auntie Of course not laughed Anthea it would be most un knight like and very undignified Sides added Small Porges you couldn t climb up a tree in your armour you know Then I d make an awful good try at it nodded Bellew No said Small Porges shaking his head shall I tell you what you ought to do Well then you d draw your two edged sword an dress your shield like Gareth the Kitchen Knave did he was always dressing his shield an so was Lancelot an you d fight all those dragons an kill them an cut their heads off And then what would happen enquired Bellew Why then the lovely Princess would open the gate an marry you of course an live happy ever after an all would be revelry an joy Ah sighed Bellew if she d do that I think I d fight all the dragons that ever roared and kill them too But supposing she er wouldn t open the gate Why then said Small Porges wrinkling his brow why then you d have to storm the castle of course an break open the gate an run off with the Princess on your charger if she was very beautiful you know A most excellent idea my Porges If I should happen to find myself in like circumstances I ll surely take your advice Now as he spoke Bellew glanced at Anthea and she at him And straightway she blushed and then she laughed and then she blushed again and still blushing rose to her feet and turned to find mister Cassilis within a yard of them Ah Miss Anthea said he lifting his hat I sent Georgy to find you but it seems he forgot to mention that I was waiting I m awful sorry mister Cassilis but Uncle Porges was telling us bout dragons you know Small Porges hastened to explain Dragons repeated mister Cassilis with his supercilious smile ah indeed dragons should be interesting especially in such a very quiet shady nook as this quite an idyllic place for story telling it s a positive shame to disturb you and his sharp white teeth gleamed beneath his moustache as he spoke and he tapped his riding boot lightly with his hunting crop as he fronted Bellew who had risen and stood bare armed leaning upon his pitch fork And as in their first meeting there was a mute antagonism in their look Let me introduce you to each other said Anthea conscious of this attitude mister Cassilis of Brampton Court mister Bellew Of nowhere in particular sir added Bellew And pray said mister Cassilis perfunctorily as they strolled on across the meadow how do you like Dapplemere mister Bellew Immensely sir beyond all expression Yes it is considered rather pretty I believe Lovely sir nodded Bellew though it is not so much the beauty of the place itself that appeals to me so much as what it contains Oh indeed said mister Cassilis with a sudden sharp glance to what do you refer Goose berries sir I ah beg your pardon Sir said Bellew gravely all my life I have fostered a secret passion for goose berries raw or cooked in pie pudding or jam they are equally alluring Unhappily the American goose berry is but a hollow mockery at best Ha said mister Cassilis dubiously Now in goose berries as in everything else sir there is to be found the superlative the quintessence the ideal Consequently I have roamed East and West and North and South in quest of it Really said mister Cassilis stifling a yawn and turning towards Miss Anthea with the very slightest shrug of his shoulders And in Dapplemere concluded Bellew solemnly I have at last found my ideal Goose berry added Anthea with a laugh in her eyes Arcadia being a land of ideals nodded Bellew Ideals said mister Cassilis caressing his moustache ideals and ah goose berries though probably excellent things in themselves are apt to pall upon one in time personally I find them equally insipid Of course it is all a matter of taste sighed Bellew But mister Cassilis went on fairly turning his back upon him the subject I wished to discuss with you Miss Anthea was the er approaching sale The sale she repeated all the brightness dying out of her face I wished said Cassilis leaning nearer to her and lowering his voice confidentially to try to convince you how unnecessary it would be if and he paused significantly Anthea turned quickly aside as though to hide her mortification from Bellew s keen eyes whereupon he seeing it all became straightway more dreamy than ever and laying a hand upon Small Porges shoulder pointed with his pitch fork to where at the other end of the Five acre the hay makers worked away as merrily as ever Come my Porges said he let us away and join yon happy throng and er With Daphnis and Clo and Blowsabel We ll list to the er cuckoo in the dell So hand in hand the two Porges set off together But when they had gone some distance Bellew looked back and then he saw that Anthea walked with her head averted yet Cassilis walked close beside her and stooped now and then until the black moustache came very near the curl that curl of wanton witchery that peeped above her ear Uncle Porges why do you frown so Frown my Porges did I Well I was thinking Well I m thinking too only I don t frown you know but I m thinking just the same And what might you be thinking nephew Why I was thinking that although you re so awful fond of goose berries an though there s lots of ripe ones on the bushes I ve never seen you eat a single one CHAPTER X How Bellew and Adam entered into a solemn league and covenant Look at the moon to night Uncle Porges I see it It s awfull big an round isn t it Yes it s very big and very round An rather yellow isn t it Very yellow Just like a great big golden sovereign isn t it Very much like a sovereign my Porges Well do you know I was wondering if there was any chance that it was a Money Moon They were leaning out at the lattice Small Porges and Big Porges Anthea and Miss Priscilla were busied upon household matters wholly feminine wherefore Small Porges had drawn Bellew to the window and there they leaned the small body enfolded by Bellew s long arm and the two faces turned up to the silvery splendour of the moon But now Anthea came up behind them and not noticing the position of Bellew s arm as she leaned on the other side of Small Porges it befell that her hand touched and for a moment rested upon Bellew s hand hidden as it was in the shadow And this probably began it The air of Arcadia as has been said before is an intoxicating air but it is more it is an air charged with a subtle magic whereby the commonest objects losing their prosaic matter of fact shapes become transfigured into things of wonder and delight Little things that pass as mere ordinary common places things insignificant and wholly beneath notice in the every day world become fraught with such infinite meaning and may hold such sublime such undreamed of possibilities here in Arcadia Thus when it is recorded that Anthea s hand accidentally touched and rested upon Bellew s the significance of it will become at once apparent And pray said Anthea laying that same hand in the most natural manner in the world upon the Small Porges curls Pray what might you two be discussing so very solemnly The moon answered Small Porges I was wondering if it was a Money Moon an Uncle Porges hasn t said if it is yet Why no old chap answered Bellew I m afraid not And pray said Anthea again what might a Money Moon be Well explained Small Porges when the moon s just just so then you go out an an find a fortune you know But the moon s got to be a Money Moon and you ve got to know you know else you ll find nothing of course Ah Georgy dear sighed Anthea stooping her dark head down to his golden curls don t you know that fortunes are very hard to get and that they have to be worked for and that no one ever found one without a great deal of labour and sorrow Course everyone can t find fortunes Auntie Anthea I know that but we shall my Uncle Porges knows all about it you see an I know that we shall I m sure as sure we shall find one some day cause you see I put it in my prayers now at the end you know I say An please help me an my Uncle Porges to find a fortune when the Money Moon comes a big one world without end Amen So you see it s all right an we re just waiting till the Money Moon comes aren t we Uncle Porges Yes old chap yes nodded Bellew until the Money Moon comes And so there fell a silence between them yet a silence that held a wondrous charm of its own a silence that lasted so long that the coppery curls drooped lower and lower upon Bellew s arm until Anthea sighing rose and in a very tender voice bade Small Porges say Goodnight the which he did forthwith slumberous of voice and sleepy eyed and so with his hand in Anthea s went drowsily up to bed Wherefore seeing that Miss Priscilla had bustled away into the kitchen Bellew sauntered out into the rose garden to look upon the beauty of the night The warm air was fragrant with dewy scents and the moon already high above the tree tops poured down her gentle radiance upon the quaint old garden with its winding walks and clipped yew hedges while upon the quiet from the dim shadow of the distant woods stole the soft sweet song of a nightingale Bellew walked a path bordered with flowers and checkered with silver patches of moon light drinking in the thousand beauties about him staring up at the glory of the moon the indigo of the sky and listening to the voice of the lonely singer in the wood And yet it was of none of these he was thinking as he paused under the shadow of King Arthur nor of Small Porges nor of any one or anything in this world but only of the sudden light touch of a warm soft hand upon his Be that you sir Bellew started and now he found that he had been sitting all this while with an empty pipe between his teeth yet content therewith wherefore he shook his head and wondered Be that you mister Beloo sir Yes Adam it is I Ah an how might you be feelin now arter your exercise wi the pitch fork sir Very fit I thank you Adam Sit down and smoke and let us converse together Why thankee sir answered Adam producing the small black clay pipe from his waistcoat pocket and accepting Bellew s proffered pouch I ve been up to the ouse a visitin Prudence the cook an a rare cook she be too mister Beloo sir And a rare buxom girl into the bargain Adam Oh ah she s well enough sir I won t go for to deny as she s a fine up standing well shaped tall an proper figure of a woman as ever was sir though the Kentish lasses be a tidy lot mister Beloo sir But Lord when you come to think of her gift for Yorkshire Puddin likewise jam rollers and seed cake which though mentioned last ain t by no manner o means least when you come to think of her brew o ale an cider an ginger wine why then I m took sir I m took altogether an the Old Adam inside o me works hisself into such a state that if another chap specially that there Job Jagway gets lookin her way too often why it s got to get took out o him or took out o me in good ard knocks mister Belloo sir And when are you going to get married Adam Well sir we was thinkin that if Miss Anthea has a good season this year we d get it over an done wi some time in October sir but it s all accordin According to what To the ops sir the H O P S ops sir They re comin on fine ah scrumptuous they be If they don t take the blight sir they ll be the finest ops this side o Maidstone But then if they do take the blight why then my opes is blighted likewise sir B L I T E D blighted mister Belloo sir which said Adam laughed once nodded his head several times and relapsed into puffing silence mister Cassilis was over to day Adam said Bellew after a while pursuing a train of thought Ah sir I seen him e also seen me E told me as Job Jagway was up and about again likewise Job Jagway will be over ere to morrow along wi the rest of em for the sale sir Ah yes the sale said Bellew thoughtfully To think o that there Job Jagway a coming over here to buy Miss Anthea s furnitur do set the Old Adam a workin inside o me to that amazin extent as I can t sit still mister Belloo sir If that there Job crosses my path to morrer well let im look out that s all saying which Adam doubled up a huge knotted fist and shook it at an imaginary Job Adam said Bellew in the same thoughtful tone I wonder if you would do something for me Anything you ax me sir so long as you don t want me to I want you to buy some of that furniture for me What exclaimed Adam and vented his great laugh again well if that ain t a good un sir why that s just w ot I m a going to do Ye see I ain t w ot you might call a rich cove nor yet a millionaire but I ve got a bit put by an I drawed out ten pound yesterday Thinks I here s to save Miss Anthea s old sideboard or the mirror as she s so fond of or if not why then a cheer or so they ain t a going to get it all not while I ve got a pound or two I sez to myself Adam said Bellew turning suddenly that sentiment does you credit that sentiment makes me proud to have knocked you into a ditch shake hands Adam And there beneath the great apple tree while the moon looked on they very solemnly shook hands And now Adam pursued Bellew I want you to put back your ten pounds keep it for Prudence because I happen to have rather more than we shall want see here And with the words Bellew took out a leathern wallet and from this wallet money and bank notes more money and more bank notes than Adam had ever beheld in all his thirty odd years at sight of which his eyes opened and his square jaw relaxed to the imminent danger of his cherished clay pipe I want you to take this Bellew went on counting a sum into Adam s nerveless hand and to morrow when the sale begins if any one makes a bid for anything I want you to bid higher and no matter what you must always buy always you understand But sir that there old drorin room cab net wi the carvings Buy it An the silver candle sticks and the four post bed stead an the Buy em Adam buy everything If we haven t enough money there

none	none	Ow much ave you give me Why here s forty five fifty sixty Lord Put it away Adam forget all about it till to morrow and not a word mind A hundred pound gasped Adam Lord Oh I won t speak of it trust me mister Belloo sir But to think of me a walking about wi a hundred pound in my pocket Lord I won t say nothing but to think of Old Adam wi a hundred pound in his pocket e Cod it do seem that comical saying which Adam buttoned the money into a capacious pocket slapped it nodded and rose Well sir I ll be going there be Miss Anthea in the garden yonder and if she was to see me now there s no sayin but I should be took a laughin to think o this ere hundred pound Miss Anthea where Comin through the rose gardin She be off to see old Mother Dibbin They call Mother Dibbin a witch an now as she s down wi the rheumatics there ain t nobody to look arter er cept Miss Anthea she d ha starved afore now if it adn t been for Miss Anthea but Lord love your eyes an limbs mister Belloo sir Miss Anthea don t care if she s a witch or fifty witches not she So good night mister Belloo sir an mum s the word Saying which Adam slapped his pocket again nodded winked and went upon his way CHAPTER XI Of the Man with the Tiger Mark It is a moot question as to whether a curl can be more alluring when it glows beneath the fiery kisses of the sun or shines demurely in the tender radiance of the moon As Bellew looked at it now that same small curl that nodded and beckoned to him above Anthea s left ear he strongly inclined to the latter opinion Adam tells me that you are going out Miss Anthea Only as far as missus Dibbin s cottage just across the meadow Adam also informs me that missus Dibbin is a witch People call her so Never in all my days have I seen a genuine old witch so I ll come with you if I may Oh this is a very gentle old witch and she is neither humpbacked nor does she ride a broom stick so I m afraid you ll be disappointed mister Bellew Then at least I can carry your basket allow me And so in his quiet masterful fashion he took the basket from her arm and walked on beside her through the orchard What a glorious night it is exclaimed Anthea suddenly drawing a deep breath of the fragrant air Oh it is good to be alive In spite of all the cares and worries life is very sweet After this they walked on some distance in silence she gazing wistfully upon the beauties of the familiar world about her while he watched the curl above her ear until she becoming aware of it all at once promptly sent it back into retirement with a quick deft little pat of her fingers I hope said Bellew at last I do sincerely hope that you tucked up my nephew safe in bed you see Your nephew indeed Our nephew then I ask because he tells me that he can t possibly sleep unless you go to tuck him up and I can quite believe it Do you know mister Bellew I m growing quite jealous of you he can t move a step without you and he is for ever talking and lauding your numberless virtues But then I m only an uncle after all and if he talks of me to you he talks of you to me all day long Oh does he And among other things he told me that I ought to see you when your hair is down and all about you Oh exclaimed Anthea Indeed our nephew is much luckier than I because I never had an aunt of my own to come and tuck me up at night with her hair hanging all about her like a beautiful cloak So you see I have no boyish recollections to go upon but I think I can imagine And what do you think of the Sergeant Anthea enquired changing the subject abruptly I like him so much that I am going to take him at his word and call upon him at the first opportunity Did Aunt Priscilla tell you that he comes marching along regularly every day at exactly the same hour Yes to see how the peaches are getting on nodded Bellew For such a very brave soldier he is a dreadful coward said Anthea smiling it has taken him five years to screw up courage enough to tell her that she s uncommonly young for her age And yet I think it is just that diffidence that makes him so lovable And he is so simple and so gentle in spite of all his war medals When I am moody and cross the very sight of him is enough to put me in humour again Has he never spoken to Miss Priscilla Never though of course she knows and has done from the very first I asked him once why he had never told her what it was brought him so regularly to look at the peaches and he said in his quick sharp way Miss Anthea can t be done mam a poor battered old soldier only one arm no mam I wonder if one could find just such another Sergeant outside Arcadia said Bellew I wonder Now they were approaching a stile towards which Bellew had directed his eyes from time to time as for that matter curiously enough had Anthea but to him it seemed that it never would be reached while to her it seemed that it would be reached much too soon Therefore she began to rack her mind trying to remember some gate or any gap in the hedge that should obviate the necessity of climbing it But before she could recall any such gate or gap they were at the stile and Bellew leaping over had set down the basket and stretched out his hand to aid her over But Anthea tall and lithe active and vigorous with her outdoor life and used to such things from her infancy stood a moment hesitating To be sure the stile was rather high yet she could have vaulted it nearly if not quite as easily as Bellew himself had she been alone But then she was not alone moreover be it remembered this was in Arcadia of a mid summer night Thus she hesitated only a moment it is true for seeing the quizzical look in his eyes that always made her vaguely rebellious with a quick light movement she mounted the stile and there paused to shake her head in laughing disdain of his out stretched hand then there was the sound of rending cambric she tripped and next moment he had caught her in his arms It was for but a very brief instant that she lay soft and yielding in his embrace yet she was conscious of how strong were the arms that held her so easily ere they set her down I beg your pardon how awkward I am she exclaimed in hot mortification No said Bellew shaking his head it was a nail you know a bent and rusty nail here under the top bar Is your dress much torn Oh that is nothing thank you So they went on again but now they were silent once more and very naturally for Anthea was mightily angry with herself the stile Bellew and everything concerned while he was thinking of the sudden warm clasp of her arms of the alluring fragrance of her hair and of the shy droop of her lashes as she lay in his embrace Therefore as he walked on beside her saying nothing within his secret soul he poured benedictions upon the head of that bent and rusty nail And presently having turned down a grassy lane and crossed a small but very noisy brook that chattered impertinences among the stones and chuckled at them slyly from the shadows they eventually came upon a small and very lonely little cottage bowered in roses and honeysuckle as are all the cottages hereabouts But now Anthea paused looking at Bellew with a dubious brow I ought to warn you that missus Dibbin is very old and sometimes a little queer and sometimes says very surprising things Excellent nodded Bellew holding the little gate open for her very right and proper conduct in a witch and I love surprises above all things But Anthea still hesitated while Bellew stood with his hand upon the gate waiting for her to enter Now he had left his hat behind him and as the moon shone down on his bare head she could not but notice how bright and yellow was his hair despite the thick black brows below I think I would rather you waited outside if you don t mind mister Bellew You mean that I am to be denied the joy of conversing with a real live old witch and having my fortune told he sighed Well if such is your will so be it said he obediently and handed her the basket I won t keep you waiting very long and thank you she smiled and hurrying up the narrow path she tapped at the cottage door Come in come in cried an old quavering voice albeit very sharp and piercing That be my own soft dove of a maid my proud beautiful white lady Come in come in and bring him wi you him as is so big and strong him as I ve expected so long the tall golden man from over seas Bid him come in Miss Anthea that Goody Dibbin s old eyes may look at him at last Hereupon at a sign from Anthea Bellew turned in at the gate and striding up the path entered the cottage Despite the season a fire burned upon the hearth and crouched over this in a great elbow chair sat a very bent and aged woman Her face was furrowed and seamed with numberless lines and wrinkles but her eyes were still bright and she wore no spectacles likewise her white hair was wonderfully thick and abundant as could plainly be seen beneath the frill of her cap for like the very small room of this very small cottage she was extremely neat and tidy She had a great curving nose and a great curving chin and what with this and her bright black eyes and stooping figure she was very much like what a witch should be albeit a very superior kind of old witch She sat for a while staring up at Bellew who stood tall and bare headed smiling down at her and then all at once she nodded her head three several and distinct times Right she quavered right right it be all right the golden man as I ve watched this many an many a day wi the curly hair and the sleepy eye and the Tiger mark upon his arm right right What do you mean by Tiger mark enquired Bellew I mean young master wi your golden curls I mean as sitting here day in and day out staring down into my fire I has my dreams leastways I calls em my dreams though there s them as calls it the second sight But pray sit down tall sir on the stool there and you my tender maid my dark lady come you here upon my right and if you wish I ll look into the ink or read your pretty hand or tell you what I see down there in the fire But no first show what you have brought for Old Nannie in the blessed basket the fine strong basket as holds so much Yes set it down here where I can open it myself tall sir Eh what s this Tea God bless you for the tea my dear And eggs and butter and a cold chicken the Lord bless your kind heart Miss Anthea Ah my proud lady happy the man who shall win ye Happy the man who shall wed ye my dark beautiful maid And strong must he be aye and masterful he who shall wake the love light in those dark great passionate eyes of yours And there is no man in all this world can do it but he must be a golden man wi the Tiger mark upon him Why oh Nannie Aye blush if ye will my dark lady but Mother Dibbin knows she s seen it in the fire dreamed it in her dreams and read it in the ink The path lies very dark afore ye my lady aye very dark it be and full o cares and troubles but there s the sun shining beyond bright and golden You be proud and high and scornful my lady tis in your blood you ll need a strong hand to guide ye and the strong hand shall come By force you shall be wooed and by force you shall be wed and there be no man strong enough to woo and wed ye but him as I ve told ye of him as bears the Tiger mark But Nannie said Anthea again gently interrupting her and patting the old woman s shrivelled hand you re forgetting the basket you haven t found all we ve brought you yet Aye aye nodded old Nannie the fine strong basket let s see what more be in the good kind basket Here s bread and sugar and A pound of your favourite tobacco said Anthea with a smiling nod Oh the good weed The blessed weed cried the old woman clutching the package with trembling fingers Ah who can tell the comfort it has been to me in the long long days and the long long nights the blessed weed when I ve sat here a looking and a looking into the fire God bless you my sweet maid for your kindly thought and with a sudden gesture she caught Anthea s hand to her lips and then just as suddenly turned upon Bellew And now tall sir can I do ought for ye Shall I look into the fire for ye or the ink or read your hand Why yes answered Bellew stretching out his hand to her you shall tell me two things if you will first shall one ever find his way into the Castle of Heart s Desire and secondly When Oh but I don t need to look into your hand to tell you that tall sir nor yet in the ink or in the fire for I ve dreamed it all in my dreams And now see you tis a strong place this Castle wi thick doors and great locks and bars But I have seen those doors broke down those great locks and bars burst asunder but there is none can do this but him as bears the Tiger Mark So much for the first And for the second Happiness shall come a riding to you on the full moon but you must reach up and take it for yourself if you be tall enough And even you are not tall enough to do that mister Bellew laughed Anthea as she rose to bid Old Nannie Good night while Bellew unnoticed slipped certain coins upon a corner of the chimney piece So old Nannie blessed them and theirs past present and future thoroughly and completely with a fine comprehensiveness that only a genuinely accomplished old witch might hope to attain to and following them to the door paused there with one shrivelled claw like hand up lifted towards the sky At the full o the moon tall sir she repeated at the full o the moon As for you my dark eyed lady I say by force you shall be wooed and by force ye shall be wed aye aye but there is no man strong enough except he have the Tiger Mark upon him Old Nannie knows she s seen it in the ink dreamed it in the fire and read it all in your pretty hand And now thank ye for the tea my pretty and God bless ye for the good weed and just so sure as you ve been good and kind to old Nannie so shall Fortune be good and kind to you Miss Anthea Poor old Nannie said Anthea as they went on down the grassy lane she is so very grateful for so little And she is such a gentle old creature really though the country folk do call her a witch and are afraid of her because they say she has the evil eye which is ridiculous of course But nobody ever goes near her and she is dreadfully lonely poor old thing And so that is why you come to sit with her and let her talk to you enquired Bellew staring up at the moon Yes And do you believe in her dreams and visions No of course not answered Anthea rather hurriedly and with a deeper colour in her cheeks though Bellew was still intent upon the moon You don t either do you she enquired seeing he was silent Well I don t quite know he answered slowly but she is rather a wonderful old lady I think Yes she has wonderful thick hair still nodded Anthea and she s not a bit deaf and her eyes are as clear and sharp as ever they were Yes but I wasn t meaning her eyes or her hair or her hearing Oh then pray what were you pleased to mean Did you happen to notice what she said about a er Man with a Tiger Mark enquired Bellew still gazing up at the moon Anthea laughed The Man with the Tiger Mark of course he has been much in her dreams lately and she has talked of him a great deal Has she said Bellew ha Yes her mind is full of strange twists and fancies you see she is so very old and she loves to tell me her dreams and read the future for me Though of course you don t believe it said Bellew Believe it Anthea repeated and walked some dozen paces or so before she answered no of course not Then none of your fortune nothing she told you has ever come true Once more Anthea hesitated this time so long that Bellew turned from his moon gazing to look at her I mean he went on has none of it ever come true about this Man with the Tiger Mark for instance No oh no answered Anthea rather hastily and laughed again Old Nannie has seen him in her dreams everywhere in India and Africa and China in hot countries and cold countries oh Nannie has seen him everywhere but I have seen him nowhere and of course I never shall Ah said Bellew and she reads him always in your fortune does she And I listen very patiently Anthea nodded because it pleases her so much and it is all so very harmless after all isn t it Yes answered Bellew and very wonderful Wonderful poor old Nannie s fancies What do you mean by wonderful Upon my word I hardly know said Bellew shaking his head but there are more things in heaven and earth et cetera you know and this is one of them Really now you grow mysterious mister Bellew Like the night he answered turning to aid her across the impertinent brook that chuckled at them and laughed after them as only such a very impertinent brook possibly could So betimes they reached the stile and crossed it this time without mishap despite the lurking nail and all too soon for Bellew had traversed the orchard and were come to the garden where the roses all hung so still upon their stems that they might have been asleep and filling the air with the perfume of their dreams And here they paused perhaps because of the witchery of the moon perhaps to listen to the voice of the nightingale who sang on more gloriously than ever Yet though they stood so close together their glances seldom met and they were very silent But at last as though making up her mind Anthea spoke What did you mean when you said Old Nannie s dreams were so wonderful she asked I ll show you he answered and while he spoke slipped off his coat and drawing up his shirt sleeve held out a muscular white arm towards her He held it out in the full radiance of the moon and thus looking down at it her eyes grew suddenly wide and her breath caught strangely as surprise gave place to something else for there plain to be seen upon the white flesh were three long scars that wound up from elbow to shoulder And so for a while they stood thus she looking at his arm and he at her Why said she at last finding voice in a little gasp why then I am the Man with the Tiger Mark he said smiling his slow placid smile Now as his eyes looked down into hers she flushed sudden and hot and her glance wavered and fell beneath his Oh she cried and with the word turned about and fled from him into the house CHAPTER XII In which may be found a full true and particular account of the sale Uncle Porges there s a little man in the hall with a red red nose an a blue blue chin Yes I ve seen him also his nose and chin my Porges But he s sticking little papers with numbers on them all over my Auntie Anthea s chairs an tables Now what do you s pose he s doing that for Who knows It s probably all on account of his red nose and blue chin my Porges Anyway don t worry about him let us rather find our Auntie Anthea They found her in the hall And it was a hall here at Dapplemere wide and high and with a minstrel s gallery at one end a hall that years and years ago had often rung with the clash of men at arms and echoed with loud and jovial laughter for this was the most ancient part of the Manor It looked rather bare and barren just now for the furniture was all moved out of place ranged neatly round the walls and stacked at the farther end beneath the gallery where the little man in question blue of chin and red of nose was hovering about it dabbing little tickets on chairs and tables even as Small Porges had said And in the midst of it all stood Anthea a desolate figure Bellew thought who upon his entrance bent her head to draw on her driving gloves for she was waiting for the dog cart which was to bear her and Small Porges to Cranbrook far away from the hollow tap of the auctioneer s hammer We re getting rid of some of the old furniture you see mister Bellew she said laying her hand on an antique cabinet nearby we really have much more than we ever use Yes said Bellew But he noticed that her eyes were very dark and wistful despite her light tone and that she had laid her hand upon the old cabinet with a touch very like a caress Why is that man s nose so awful red and his chin so blue Auntie Anthea enquired Small Porges in a hissing stage whisper Hush Georgy I don t know said Anthea An why is he sticking his little numbers all over our best furniture That is to guide the auctioneer Where to an what is an auctioneer But at this moment hearing the wheels of the dog cart at the door Anthea turned and hastened out into the sunshine A lovely day it do be for drivin said Adam touching his hat an Bess be thinkin the same I do believe and he patted the glossy coat of the mare who arched her neck and pawed the gravel with an impatient hoof Lightly and nimbly Anthea swung herself up to the high seat turning to make Small Porges secure beside her as Bellew handed him up You ll look after things for me Adam said Anthea glancing back wistfully into the dim recesses of the cool old hall Aye I will that Miss Anthea mister Bellew we can find room for you if you care to come with us Thanks said he shaking his head but I rather think I ll stay here and er help Adam to to look after things if you don t mind Then Good bye said Anthea and nodding to Adam he gave the mare her head and off they went Good bye cried Small Porges an thank you for the shilling Uncle Porges The mare is er rather fresh this morning isn t she Adam enquired Bellew watching the dog cart s rapid course Fresh sir And that s rather a er dangerous sort of thing for a woman to drive isn t it Meanin the dog cart sir Meaning the dog cart Adam Why Lord love ye mister Belloo sir cried Adam with his great laugh there ain t nobody can andle the ribbons better than Miss Anthea there ain t a horse as she can t drive ah or ride for that matter not no wheres sir Hum said Bellew and having watched the dog cart out of sight he turned and followed Adam into the stables And here sitting upon a bale of hay they smoked many pipes together in earnest converse until such time as the sale should begin As the day advanced people began arriving in twos and threes and among the first the Auctioneer himself A jovial faced man was this Auctioneer with jovial manner and a jovial smile Indeed his joviality seemed somehow or other to have got into the very buttons of his coat for they fairly winked and twinkled with joviality Upon catching sight of the furniture he became if possible more jovial than ever and beckoning to his assistant that is to say to the small man with the red nose and the blue chin who it seemed answered to the name of Theodore he clapped him jovially upon the back rather as though he were knocking him down to some unfortunate bidder and immediately fell into business converse with him albeit jovial still But all the while intending purchasers were arriving they came on horse and afoot and in conveyances of every sort and kind and the tread of their feet and the buzz of their voices awoke unwonted echoes in the old place And still they came from far and near until some hundred odd people were crowded into the hall Conspicuous among them was a large man with a fat red neck which he was continually mopping at and rubbing with a vivid bandanna handkerchief scarcely less red Indeed red seemed to be his pervading colour for his hair was red his hands were red and his face heavy and round was reddest of all out of whose flaming circumference two diminutive but very sharp eyes winked and blinked continually His voice like himself was large with a peculiar brassy ring to it that penetrated to the farthest corners and recesses of the old hall He was beyond all doubt a man of substance and of no small importance for he was greeted deferentially on all hands and it was to be noticed that people elbowed each other to make way for him as people ever will before substance and property To some of them he nodded to some he spoke and with others he even laughed albeit he was of a solemn sober and serious nature as becomes a man of property and substance Between whiles however he bestowed his undivided attention upon the furniture He sat down suddenly and heavily in chairs he pummelled them with his plump red fists whereby to test their springs he opened the doors of cabinets he peered into drawers he rapped upon tables and altogether comported himself as a thoroughly knowing man should who is not to be hocussed by veneer or taken in by the shine and splendour of well applied bees wax Bellew watching all this from where he sat screened from the throng by a great carved sideboard and divers chairs and whatnots drew rather harder at his pipe and chancing to catch Adam s eye beckoned him to approach Who is that round red man yonder Adam he enquired nodding to where the individual in question was engaged at that moment poking at something or other with a large sausage like finger That replied Adam in a tone of profound disgust that be mister Grimes o Cranbrook sir Calls hisself a corn chandler but I calls im well never mind what sir only it weren t at corn chandling as e made all is money sir and it be him as we all work and slave for here at Dapplemere Farm What do you mean Adam I mean as it be him as holds the mortgage on Dapplemere sir Ah and how much Over three thousand pound mister Belloo sir sighed Adam with a hopeless shake of the head an that be a powerful lot o money sir Bellew thought of the sums he had lavished upon his yacht upon his three racing cars and certain other extravagances Three thousand pounds fifteen thousand dollars It would make her a free woman independent happy Just fifteen thousand dollars and he had thrown away more than that upon a poker game before now Lord exclaimed Adam the very sight o that theer Grimes s pig eyes a starin at Miss Anthea s furnitur do make the Old Adam rise up in me to that amazin extent mister Belloo sir why jest look at im a thumpin an a poundin at that theer chair Saying which Adam turned and elbowing his way to where mister Grimes was in the act of testing the springs of an easy chair he promptly and as though forced by a struggling mob fell up against mister Grimes and jostled mister Grimes and trod heavily upon the toes of mister Grimes and all with an expression of the most profound unconsciousness and abstraction which upon the indignant Corn chandler s loud expostulations immediately changed to a look of innocent surprise Can t you look where you re going you clumsy fool fumed the irate Grimes redder of neck than ever Ax your pardon mister Grimes said Adam solemnly but what wi people s legs an cheer legs an the legs o tables not to mention sideboards an cab nets which though not aving no legs ain t to be by no manner o means despised therefore w ot wi this an that an t other I am that con fined or as you might say con fused I don t know which legs is mine or yourn or anybody else s mister Grimes sir I makes so bold as to ax your pardon all over again sir During which speech Adam contrived once more to fall against to tread upon and to jostle the highly incensed mister Grimes back into the crowd again Thereafter he became a Nemesis to mister Grimes haunting him through the jungle of chairs and tables pursuing him into distant corners and shady places where so sure as the sausage like finger poised itself for an interrogatory poke or the fat red fist doubled itself for a spring testing punch the innocent seeming Adam would thereupon fall against him from the rear sideways or in front Meanwhile Bellew sat in his secluded corner watching the crowd through the blue wreaths of his pipe but thinking of her who brave though she was had nevertheless run away from it all at the last moment Presently however he was aware that the Corn chandler had seated himself on the other side of the chiffonier puffing and panting with heat and indignation where he was presently joined by another individual a small rat eyed man who bid mister Grimes a deferential Good day That there Adam puffed the Corn chandler that there Adam ought to be throwed out into the stables where he belongs I never see a man as was so much growed to feet and elbers in all my days He ought to be took repeated the Corn chandler and shook and throwed out into the yard Yes nodded the other took and shook and throwed out neck and crop sir And now what might you think o the furniture mister Grimes So so Parsons nodded Grimes so so Shall you buy I am a going said the Corn chandler with much deliberation I am a going to take them tapestry cheers sir likewise the grand feyther clock in the corner here likewise the four post bed stead wi the carved ead board and most particular Parsons I shall take this here side board There ain t another piece like this in the county as I know of solid ma hogany sir and the carvings and herewith he gave two loud double knocks upon the article of furniture in question Oh I ve ad my eye on this side board for years and years knowed I d get it some day too the only wonder is as she ain t had to sell up afore now Meaning Miss Anthea sir Ah her I say as it s a wonder to me wo t wi the interest on the mortgage I old on the place and one thing and another it s a wonder to me as she s kept her ead above water so long But mark me Parsons mark me she ll be selling again soon and next time it ll be lock stock and barrel Parsons Well I don t old wi women farmers myself nodded Parsons But as to that cup board over there Sheraton I think what might you suppose it to be worth betwixt friends now enquired Parsons the rat eyed Can t say till I ve seed it and likewise felt it answered the Corn chandler rising Let me lay my and upon it and I ll tell you to a shilling and here they elbowed their way into the crowd But Bellew sat there chin in hand quite oblivious to the fact that his pipe was out long since The tall old grand father clock ticking in leisurely fashion in the corner behind him solemn and sedate as it had done since as the neat inscription upon the dial testified it had first been made in the Year of Grace seventeen thirty two by one Jabez Havesham of London this ancient time piece now uttered a sudden wheeze which considering its great age could scarcely be wondered at and thereafter the wheezing having subsided gave forth a soft and mellow chime proclaiming to all and sundry that it was twelve o clock Hereupon the Auctioneer bustling to and fro with his hat upon the back of his head consulted his watch nodded to the red nosed blue chinned Theodore and perching himself above the crowd gave three sharp knocks with his hammer Gentlemen he began but here he was interrupted by a loud voice upraised in hot anger Confound ye for a clumsy rascal Will ye keep them elbers o yourn to out o my weskit eh Will ye keep them big feet o yourn to yeself If there ain t room enough for ye out ye go d ye hear I ll have ye took and shook and throwed out where ye belong so jest mind where ye come a trampin and a treadin Tread repeated Adam Lord where am I to tread If I steps backward I tread on ye If I steps sideways I tread on ye if I steps for ard I tread on ye It do seem to me as I can t go nowhere but there you be a waitin to be trod on mister Grimes sir Hereupon the Auctioneer rapped louder than ever upon which the clamour subsiding he smiled his most jovial smile and once more began Gentlemen you have all had an opportunity to examine the furniture I am about to dispose of and as fair minded human beings I think you will admit that a finer lot of genuine antique was never offered at one and the same time Gentlemen I am not going to burst forth into laudatory rodomontade which is a word gentlemen that I employ only among an enlightened community such as I now have the honour of addressing neither do I propose to waste your time in purposeless verbiage which is another of the same kind gentlemen therefore without further preface or preamble we will proceed at once to business The first lot I have to offer you is a screen six foot high bring out the screen Theodore There it is gentlemen open it out Theodore Observe Gentlemen it is carved rosewood the panels hand painted and representing shepherds and shepherdesses disporting themselves under a tree with banjo and guitar Now what am I offered for this hand painted antique screen come Fifteen shillings from someone deep hidden in the crowd Start as low as you like gentlemen I am offered a miserable fifteen shillings for a genuine hand painted Sixteen this from a long loose limbed fellow with a patch over one eye and another on his cheek A pound said Adam promptly A guinea nodded he of the patches Twenty five shillin s said Adam At twenty five shillings cried the Auctioneer any advance a genuine hand painted antique screen going at twenty five at twenty five going going gone To the large gentleman in the neckcloth Theodore Theer be that Job Jagway sir said Adam leaning across the side board to impart this information over yonder mister Belloo sir im as was bidding for the screen the tall chap wi the patches Two patches be pretty good but I do wish as I d give him a couple more while I was about it mister Belloo sir Here the Auctioneer s voice put an end to Adam s self reproaches and he turned back to the business in hand The next lot I m going to dispose of gentlemen is a fine set of six chairs with carved antique backs and upholstered in tapestry Also two arm chairs to match wheel em out Theodore Now what is your price for these eight fine pieces look em over and bid accordingly Thirty shillings Again from the depths of the crowd Ha ha you joke sir laughed the Auctioneer rubbing his hands in his most jovial manner you joke I can t see you but you joke of course and I laugh accordingly ha ha Thirty shillings for eight fine antique tapestried hand carved chairs Oh very good excellent upon my soul Three pound said the fiery necked Corn chandler Guineas said the rat eyed Parsons Four pound nodded the Corn chandler Four pound ten roared Adam Five nodded Grimes edging away from Adam s elbow Six pound ten cried Adam Seven from Parsons Eight said Grimes Ten roared Adam growing desperate Eleven said Grimes beginning to mop at his neck again Adam hesitated eleven pounds seemed so very much for those chairs that he had seen Prudence and the rosy cheeked maids dust regularly every morning and then it was not his money after all Therefore Adam hesitated and glanced wistfully towards a certain distant corner At eleven at eleven pounds this fine suite of hand carved antique chairs at eleven pounds at eleven at eleven going going Fifteen said a voice from the distant corner whereupon Adam drew a great sigh of relief while the Corn chandler contorted himself in his efforts to glare at Bellew round the side board Fifteen pounds chanted the Auctioneer I have fifteen I am given fifteen any advance These eight antique chairs going at fifteen going for the last time going gone Sold to the gentleman in the corner behind the side board Theodore They were certainly fine chairs mister Grimes said Parsons shaking his head So so said the Corn chandler sitting down heavily So so Parsons and he turned to glare at Bellew who lying back in an easy chair with his legs upon another puffed at his pipe and regarded all things with a placid interest It is not intended to record in these pages all the bids that were made as the afternoon advanced for that would be fatiguing to write and a weariness to read suffice it that lots were put up and regularly knocked down but always to Bellew or Adam Which last encouraged by Bellew s bold advances gaily roared down and constantly out bid all competitors with such unhesitating pertinacity that murmurs rose and swelled into open complaint In the midst of which the fiery visaged Corn chandler purple now between heat and vexation loudly demanded that he lay down some substantial deposit upon what he had already purchased failing which he should there and then be took and shook and throwed out into the yard Neck and crop added mister Parsons That seems to be a fair proposition smiled the Auctioneer who had already experienced some doubts as to Adam s financial capabilities yet with his joviality all unruffled that seems to be a very fair proposal indeed If the gentleman will put down some substantial deposit now Aye for sure nodded Adam stepping forward and unbuttoning a capacious pocket he drew out a handful of bank notes shall I gi e ye a hundred pound or will fifty be enough Why said the Auctioneer rubbing his hands as he eyed the fistful of bank notes ten pound will be all that is necessary sir just to ensure good faith you understand Hereupon Bellew beckoning to Adam handed him a like amount which was duly deposited with the Auctioneer So once more the bidding began once more lots were put up and knocked down now to Adam and now to Bellew The bed with the carved head board had fallen to Adam after a lively contest between him and Parsons and the Corn chandler which had left the latter in a state of perspiring profanity from which he was by no means recovered when the Auctioneer once more rapped for silence And now gentlemen last but by no means least we come to the gem of the sale a side board gentlemen a magnificent mahogany side board being a superb example of the carver s art Here is a side board gentlemen which if it can be equalled cannot be excelled no gentlemen not if you were to search all the baronial halls and lordly mansions in this land of mansions and baronials It is a truly magnificent piece in perfect condition and to be sold at your own price I say no more Gentlemen how much for this magnificent mahogany piece Ten pound Eleven Fifteen Seventeen said Adam who was rapidly drawing near the end of his resources Eighteen This from Job Jagway Go easy there Job hissed Adam edging a little nearer to him go easy now Nineteen Come come Gentlemen remonstrated the Auctioneer this isn t a coal scuttle nor a broom nor yet a pair of tongs this is a magnificent mahogany side board and you offer me nineteen pound Twenty said Job Twenty one roared Adam making his last bid and then turning he hissed in Job s unwilling ear go any higher an I ll pound ye to a jelly Job Twenty five said Parsons Twenty seven Twenty eight Thirty nodded Grimes scowling at Adam Thirty two cried Parsons Thirty six Thirty seven Forty nodded Grimes That drops me said Parsons sighing and shaking his head Ah chuckled the Corn chandler well I ve waited years for that side board Parsons and I ain t going to let you take it away from me nor nobody else sir At forty cried the Auctioneer at forty this magnifi One nodded Bellew beginning to fill his pipe Forty one s the bid I have forty one from the gent in the corner Forty five growled the Corn chandler Six said Bellew Fifty snarled Grimes One said Bellew Gent in the corner gives me fifty one chanted the Auctioneer any advance at fifty one Fifty five said Grimes beginning to mop at his neck harder than ever Add ten nodded Bellew What s that cried Grimes wheeling about Gent in the corner offers me sixty five at sixty five this magnificent piece at sixty five What are you all done at sixty five and cheap at the price come gentlemen take your time give it another look over and bid accordingly The crowd had dwindled rapidly during the last hour which was scarcely to be wondered at seeing that they were constantly out bid either by a hoarse voiced square shouldered fellow in a neck cloth or a dreamy individual who lolled in a corner and puffed at a pipe But now as Grimes his red cheeks puffed out his little eyes snapping in a way that many knew meant danger with a large D as the rich Corn chandler whose word was law to a good many turned and confronted this lounging long legged individual such as remained closed round them in a ring in keen expectation of what was to follow Observing which the Corn chandler feeling it incumbent upon him now or never to vindicate himself as a man of property and substance and not to be put down thrust his hands deep into his pockets spread his legs wide apart and stared at Bellew in a way that most people had found highly disconcerting before now Bellew however seemed wholly unaffected and went on imperturbably filling his pipe At sixty five cried the Auctioneer leaning towards Grimes with his hammer poised at sixty five Will you make it another pound sir come what do you say I say no sir returned the Corn chandler slowly and impressively I say no sir I say make it another twenty pound sir Hereupon heads were shaken or nodded and there rose the sudden shuffle of feet as the crowd closed in nearer I get eighty five any advance on eighty five Eighty six said Bellew settling the tobacco in his pipe bowl with his thumb Once again the Auctioneer leaned over and appealed to the Corn chandler who stood in the same attitude jingling the money in his pocket Come sir don t let a pound or so stand between you and a side board that can t be matched in the length and breadth of the United Kingdom come what do you say to another ten shillings I say sir said Grimes with his gaze still riveted upon Bellew I say no sir I say make it another twenty pound sir Again there rose the shuffle of feet again heads were nodded and elbows nudged neighbouring ribs and all eyes were focussed upon Bellew who was in the act of lighting his pipe One hundred and six pounds cried the Auctioneer at one six at one six Bellew struck a match but the wind from the open casement behind him extinguished it I have one hundred and six pounds is there any advance yes or no going at one hundred and six Adam who up till now had enjoyed the struggle to the utmost experienced a sudden qualm of fear Bellew struck another match At one hundred and six pounds at one six going at one hundred and six pounds A cold moisture started out on Adam s brow he clenched his hands and muttered between his teeth Supposing the money were all gone like his own share supposing they had to lose this famous old side board and to Grimes of all people This and much more was in Adam s mind while the Auctioneer held his hammer poised and Bellew went on lighting his pipe Going at one hundred and six going going Fifty up said Bellew His pipe was well alight at last and he was nodding to the Auctioneer through a fragrant cloud What cried Grimes ow much Gent in the corner gives me one hundred and fifty six pounds said the Auctioneer with a jovial eye upon the Corn chandler s lowering visage one five six all done any advance Going at one five six going going gone The hammer fell and with its tap a sudden silence came upon the old hall Then all at once the Corn chandler turned caught up his hat clapped it on shook a fat fist at Bellew and crossing to the door lumbered away muttering maledictions as he went By twos and threes the others followed him until there remained only Adam Bellew the Auctioneer and the red nosed Theodore And yet there was one other for chancing to raise his eyes to the minstrel s gallery Bellew espied Miss Priscilla who meeting his smiling glance leaned down suddenly over the carved rail and very deliberately threw him a kiss and then hurried away with a quick light tap tap of her stick CHAPTER XIII How Anthea came home
1121_176698_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Lord said Adam pausing with a chair under either arm Lord mister Belloo sir I wonder what Miss Anthea will say with which remark he strode off with the two chairs to set them in their accustomed places 
1121_176698_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Seldom indeed had the old hall despite its many years seen such a running to and fro heard such a patter of flying feet such merry voices such gay and heart felt laughter 
1121_176698_000003_000001	train-clean-360	For here was Miss Priscilla looking smaller than ever in a great arm chair whence she directed the disposal and arrangement of all things with quick little motions of her crutch stick 
none	none	And here were the two rosy cheeked maids brighter and rosier than ever and here was comely Prudence hither come from her kitchen to bear a hand and here as has been said was Adam and here also was Bellew his pipe laid aside with his coat pushing and tugging in his efforts to get the great side board back into its customary position and all as has also been said was laughter and bustle and an eager haste to have all things as they were and should be henceforth before Anthea s return
1121_176698_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Lord exclaimed Adam again balanced now upon a ladder and pausing to wipe his brow with one hand and with a picture swinging in the other Lord what ever will Miss Anthea say mister Belloo sir 
1121_176698_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah nodded Bellew thoughtfully I wonder 
none	none	What do you suppose she ll say Miss Priscilla mam I think you d better be careful of that picture Adam
1121_176698_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Which means said Bellew smiling down into Miss Priscilla s young bright eyes that you don t know 
none	none	Well mister Bellew she ll be very glad of course happier I think than you or I can guess because I know she loves every stick and stave of that old furniture but
1121_176698_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 But nodded Bellew yes I understand 
none	none	mister Bellew if Anthea God bless her dear heart but if she has a fault it is pride mister Bellew Pride Pride 
1121_176698_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Pride with a capital P 
1121_176698_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she is very proud 
none	none	She ll be that appy earted said Adam pausing near by with a great armful of miscellaneous articles an that full o joy as never was mister Belloo sir Having delivered himself of which he departed with his load
1121_176698_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I rose this morning very early mister Bellew Oh very early said Miss Priscilla following Adam s laden figure with watchful eyes couldn t possibly sleep you see 
1121_176698_000014_000001	train-clean-360	So I got up ridiculously early but bless you she was before me 
none	none	Ah
1121_176698_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear yes had been up hours 
none	none	And what what do you suppose she was doing Bellew shook his head She was rubbing and polishing that old side board that you paid such a dreadful price for down on her knees before it yes she was and polishing and rubbing and crying all the while Oh dear heart 
1121_176698_000017_000003	train-clean-360	such great big tears and so very quiet 
1121_176698_000017_000004	train-clean-360	When she heard my little stick come tapping along she tried to hide them I mean her tears of course mister Bellew and when I drew her dear beautiful head down into my arms she tried to smile 
none	none	I m so very silly Aunt Priscilla she said crying more than ever but it is so hard to let the old things be taken away you see I do love them so I tell you all this mister Bellew because I like you ever since you took the trouble to pick up a ball of worsted for a poor old lame woman in an orchard first impressions you know And secondly I tell you all this to explain to you why I hum
1121_176698_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Threw a kiss from a minstrel s gallery to a most unworthy individual Aunt Priscilla 
1121_176698_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Threw you a kiss mister Bellew I had to the side board you know on her knees you understand 
none	none	I understand You see mister Belloo sir said Adam at this juncture speaking from beneath an inlaid table which he held balanced upon his head it ain t as if this was jest ordinary furnitur sir ye see she kind er feels as it be all part o Dapplemere Manor as it used to be called it s all been here so long that them cheers an tables has come to be part o the ouse sir So when she comes an finds as it ain t all been took or as you might say vanished away why the question as I ax s you is w ot will she say Oh Lord And here Adam gave vent to his great laugh which necessitated an almost superhuman exertion of strength to keep the table from slipping from its precarious perch Whereupon Miss Priscilla screamed a very small scream like herself and Prudence scolded and the two rosy cheeked maids tittered and Adam went chuckling upon his way 
1121_176698_000022_000000	train-clean-360	And when the hall was once more its old familiar comfortable self when the floor had been swept of its litter and every trace of the sale removed then Miss Priscilla sighed and Bellew put on his coat 
1121_176698_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 When do you expect she will come home he enquired glancing at the grandfather clock in the corner 
1121_176698_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Well if she drove straight back from Cranbrook she would be here now but I fancy she won t be so very anxious to get home to day and may come the longest way round yes it s in my mind she will keep away from Dapplemere as long as ever she can 
1121_176698_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 And I think said Bellew Yes I think I ll take a walk 
none	none	I ll go and call upon the Sergeant
1121_176698_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 The Sergeant said Miss Priscilla let me see it is now a quarter to six it should take you about fifteen minutes to the village that will make it exactly six o clock 
1121_176698_000026_000001	train-clean-360	You will find the Sergeant just sitting down in the chair on the left hand side of the fire place in the corner at the King s Head you know 
none	none	Not that I have ever seen him there good gracious no but I happen to be acquainted with his habits and he is as regular and precise as his great big silver watch and that is the most precise and regular thing in all the world 
1121_176698_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I am glad you are going she went on because to day is well a day apart mister Bellew 
1121_176698_000026_000004	train-clean-360	You will find the Sergeant at the King s Head until half past seven 
1121_176698_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I will go to the King s Head said Bellew 
1121_176698_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 And what message do you send him 
none	none	None said Miss Priscilla laughing and shaking her head at least you can tell him if you wish that the peaches are riper than ever they were this evening I won t forget said Bellew smiling and went out into the sunshine But crossing the yard he was met by Adam who chuckling still paused to touch his hat To look at that theer all sir you wouldn t never know as there d ever been any sale at all not no ow Now the only question as worrits me and as I m a axin of myself constant is what will Miss Anthea ave to say about it Yes said Bellew I wonder And so he turned and went away slowly across the fields Miss Priscilla had been right Anthea was coming back the longest way round also she was anxious to keep away from Dapplemere as long as possible Therefore despite Small Porges exhortations and Bess s champing impatience she held the mare in permitting her only the slowest of paces which was a most unusual thing for Anthea to do 
1121_176698_000032_000002	train-clean-360	For the most part too she drove in silence seemingly deaf to Small Porges flow of talk which was also very unlike in her 
1121_176698_000032_000003	train-clean-360	But before her eyes were visions of her dismantled home in her ears was the roar of voices clamouring for her cherished possessions a sickening roar broken now and then by the hollow tap of the auctioneer s cruel hammer 
1121_176698_000032_000004	train-clean-360	And each time the clamouring voices rose she shivered and every blow of the cruel hammer seemed to fall upon her quivering heart 
1121_176698_000032_000005	train-clean-360	Thus she was unwontedly deaf and unresponsive to Small Porges who presently fell into a profound gloom in consequence and thus she held in the eager mare who therefore shied and fidgeted and tossed her head indignantly 
1121_176698_000033_000000	train-clean-360	But slowly as they went they came within sight of the house at last with its quaint gables and many latticed windows and the blue smoke curling up from its twisted chimneys smiling and placid as though in all this great world there were no such thing to be found as an auctioneer s hammer 
none	none	And presently they swung into the drive and drew up in the courtyard And there was Adam waiting to take the mare s head Adam as good natured and stolid as though there were no abominations called for want of a worse name sales 
1121_176698_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Very slowly for her Anthea climbed down from the high dog cart aiding Small Porges to earth and with his hand clasped tight in hers and with lips set firm she turned and entered the hall 
1121_176698_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But upon the threshold she stopped and stood there utterly still gazing and gazing upon the trim orderliness of everything 
none	none	Then seeing every well remembered thing in its appointed place all became suddenly blurred and dim and snatching her hand from Small Porges clasp she uttered a great choking sob and covered her face 
1121_176698_000036_000000	train-clean-360	But Small Porges had seen and stood aghast and Miss Priscilla had seen and now hurried forward with a quick tap tap of her stick 
1121_176698_000036_000001	train-clean-360	As she came Anthea raised her head and looked for one who should have been there but was not 
1121_176698_000036_000002	train-clean-360	And in that moment instinctively she knew how things came to be as they were and because of this knowledge her cheeks flamed with a swift burning colour and with a soft cry she hid her face in Miss Priscilla s gentle bosom 
1121_176698_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Then while her face was yet hidden there she whispered 
1121_176698_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me tell me all about it 
none	none	But meanwhile Bellew striding far away across the meadows seeming to watch the glory of the sun set and to hearken to a blackbird piping from the dim seclusion of the copse a melodious Good bye to the dying day yet saw and heard it not at all for his mind was still occupied with Adam s question What would Miss Anthea say CHAPTER XIV Which among other things has to do with shrimps muffins and tin whistles A typical Kentish Village is Dapplemere with its rows of scattered cottages bowered in roses and honeysuckle white walled cottages with steep pitched roofs and small latticed windows that seem to stare at all and sundry like so many winking eyes There is an air redolent of ripening fruit and hops for Dapplemere is a place of orchards and hop gardens and rick yards while here and there the sharp pointed red tiled roof of some oast house pierces the green Though Dapplemere village is but a very small place indeed now a days yet it possesses a church grey and ancient whose massive Norman tower looks down upon gable and chimney upon roof of thatch and roof of tile like some benignant giant keeping watch above them all Near by of course is the inn a great rambling comfortable place with time worn settles beside the door and with a mighty sign a swinging before it upon which plainly to be seen when the sun catches it fairly is that which purports to be a likeness of His Majesty King William the Fourth of glorious memory But alas the colours have long since faded so that now upon a dull day it is a moot question whether His Majesty s nose was of the Greek or Roman order or indeed whether he was blessed with any nose at all Thus Time and Circumstances have united to make a ghost of the likeness as they have done of the original long since which fading yet more and more will doubtless eventually vanish altogether like King William himself and leave but a vague memory behind Now before the inn was a small crowd gathered about a trap in which sat two men one of whom Bellew recognised as the rednecked Corn chandler Grimes and the other the rat eyed Parsons The Corn chandler was mopping violently at his face and neck down which ran and to which clung a foamy substance suspiciously like the froth of beer and as he mopped his loud brassy voice shook and quavered with passion I tell ye you shall get out o my cottage he was saying I say you shall quit my cottage at the end o the month and when I says a thing I means it I say you shall get off of my property you and that beggarly cobbler I say you shall be throwed out o my cottage lock stock and barrel I say I wouldn t mister Grimes leastways not if I was you another voice broke in calm and deliberate No I wouldn t go for to say another word sir because if ye do say another word I know a man as will drag you down out o that cart sir I know a man as will break your whip over your very own back sir I know a man as will then take and heave you into the horse pond sir and that man is me Sergeant Appleby late of the Nineteenth Hussars sir The Corn chandler having removed most of the froth from his head and face stared down at the straight alert figure of the big Sergeant hesitated glanced at the Sergeant s fist which though solitary was large and powerful scowled at the Sergeant from his polished boots to the crown of his well brushed hat which perched upon his close cropped grey hair at a ridiculous angle totally impossible to any but an ex cavalry man muttered a furious oath and snatching his whip cut viciously at his horse very much as if that animal had been the Sergeant himself and as the trap lurched forward he shook his fist and nodded his head Out ye go at the end o the month mind that he snarled and so rattled away down the road still mopping at his head and neck until he had fairly mopped himself out of sight Well Sergeant said Bellew extending his hand how are you Hearty sir hearty I thank you though at this precise moment just a leetle put out sir None the less I know a man as is happy to see you mister Bellew sir and that s me Sergeant Appleby at your service sir My cottage lies down the road yonder an easy march if you will step that far Speaking for my comrade and myself we shall be proud for you to take tea with us muffins sir shrimps mister Bellew also a pikelet or two Not a great feast but tolerable good rations sir and plenty of em what do you say I say done and thank you very much So without further parley the Sergeant saluted divers of the little crowd and wheeling sharply strode along beside Bellew rather more stiff in the back and fixed of eye than was his wont and jingling his imaginary spurs rather more loudly than usual You will be wondering at the tantrums of the man Grimes sir of his ordering me and my comrade Peterday out of his cottage Sir I ll tell you in two words It s all owing to the sale up at the Farm sir You see Grimes is a great hand at buying things uncommonly cheap and selling em uncommonly dear To day it seems he was disappointed Ah said Bellew At exactly twenty three minutes to six sir said the Sergeant consulting his large silver watch I were sitting in my usual corner beside the chimley sir when in comes Grimes like a thunder cloud Calls for a pint of ale in a tankard Tom draws pint which Tom is the landlord sir Buy anything at the sale mister Grimes says Tom Sale says Grimes sale indeed and falls a cursing folk up at the Farm shocking outrageous Ends by threatening to foreclose mortgage within the month Upon which I raise a protest upon which he grows abusive upon which I was forced to pour his ale over him after which I ran him out into the road and there it is you see And he threatened to foreclose the mortgage on Dapplemere Farm did he Sergeant Within the month sir upon which I warned him inn parlour no place lady s private money troubles gaping crowd dammit And so he is turning you out of his cottage Within the week sir but then beer down the neck is rather unpleasant and here the Sergeant uttered a short laugh and was immediately grave again It isn t he went on it isn t as I mind the inconvenience of moving sir though I shall be mighty sorry to leave the old place still it isn t that so much as the small corner cup board and my bookshelf by the chimley There never was such a cup board no sir there never was a cup board so well calculated to hold a pair o jack boots not to mention spurs highlows burnishers shoulder chains polishing brushes and a boot jack as that same small corner cup board As for the book shelf beside the chimley sir exactly three foot three sunk in a recess height the third button o my coat capacity fourteen books You couldn t get another book on that shelf no not if you tried with a sledge hammer or a hydraulic engine Which is highly surprising when you consider that fourteen books is the true and exact number of books as I possess Very remarkable said Bellew Then again there s my comrade Peter Day The Sergeant pronounced it as though it were all one word Sir my comrade Peterday is a very remarkable man most cobblers are When he s not cobbling he s reading when not reading he s cobbling or mending clocks and watches and betwixt this and that my comrade has picked up a power of information though he lost his leg a doing of it in a gale of wind off the Cape of Good Hope for my comrade was a sailor sir Consequently he is a handy man most sailors are and makes his own wooden legs sir he is also a musician the tin whistle sir and here we are Saying which the Sergeant halted wheeled opened a very small gate and ushered Bellew into a very small garden bright with flowers beyond which was a very small cottage indeed through the open door of which there issued a most appetizing odour accompanied by a whistle wonderfully clear and sweet that was rendering Tom Bowling with many shakes trills and astonishing runs Peterday was busied at the fire with a long toasting fork in his hand but on their entrance breaking off his whistling in the very middle of a note he sprang nimbly to his feet or rather his foot and stood revealed as a short yet strongly built man with a face that in one way resembled an island in that it was completely surrounded by hair and whisker But it was in all respects a vastly pleasant island to behold despite the somewhat craggy prominences of chin and nose and brow In other words it was a pleasing face notwithstanding the fierce thick eye brows which were more than offset by the merry blue eyes and the broad humourous mouth below Peterday said the Sergeant mister Bel lew Glad to see you sir said the mariner saluting the visitor with a quick bob of the head and a backward scrape of the wooden leg You couldn t make port at a better time sir and because why because the kettle s a biling sir the muffins is piping hot and the shrimps is a laying hove to waiting to be took aboard sir Saying which Peterday bobbed his head again shook his wooden leg again and turned away to reach another cup and saucer It was a large room for so small a cottage and comfortably furnished with a floor of red tile and with a grate at one end well raised up from the hearth Upon the hob a kettle sang murmurously and on a trivet stood a plate whereon rose a tower of toasted muffins A round table occupied the middle of the floor and was spread with a snowy cloth whereon cups and saucers were arranged while in the midst stood a great bowl of shrimps Now above the mantel piece that is to say to the left of it and fastened to the wall was a length of rope cunningly tied into what is called a running bowline above this on a shelf specially contrived to hold it was the model of a full rigged ship that was to all appearances making excellent way of it with every stitch of canvas set and drawing alow and aloft above this again was a sextant and a telescope Opposite all these upon the other side of the mantel were a pair of stirrups three pairs of spurs two cavalry sabres and a carbine while between these objects in the very middle of the chimney uniting as it were the Army and the Navy was a portrait of Queen Victoria Bellew also noticed that each side of the room partook of the same characteristics one being devoted to things nautical the other to objects military All this Bellew noticed while the soldier was brewing the tea and the sailor was bestowing the last finishing touches to the muffins It aren t often as we re honoured wi company sir said Peterday as they sat down is it Dick No answered the Sergeant handing Bellew the shrimps We ain t had company to tea said Peterday passing Bellew the muffins no we ain t had company to tea since the last time Miss Anthea and Miss Priscilla honoured us have we Dick Honoured us said the Sergeant nodding his head approvingly is the one and only word for it Peterday And the last time was this day twelve months sir because why because this day twelve months appened to be Miss Priscilla s birthday consequently to day is her birthday likewise wherefore the muffins and wherefore the shrimps sir for they was this day to have once more graced our board mister Bellew Graced our board said the Sergeant nodding his head again graced our board is the only expression for it Peterday But they disappointed us mister Bellew sir on account of the sale Messmate said Peterday with a note of concern in his voice how s the wind Tolerable comrade tolerable Then why forget the tea Tea said the Sergeant with a guilty start why so I am mister Bellew sir your pardon and forthwith he began to pour out the tea very solemnly but with less precision of movement than usual and with abstracted gaze The Sergeant tells me you are a musician said Bellew as Peterday handed him another muffin A musician me think o that now To be sure I do toot on the tin whistle now and then sir such things as The British Grenadiers and the Girl I left behind me for my shipmate and The Bay o Biscay and A Life on the Ocean Wave for myself but a musician Lord Ye see sir said Peterday taking advantage of the Sergeant s abstraction and whispering confidentially behind his muffin that messmate o mine has such a high opinion o my gifts as is fair over powering and a tin whistle is only a tin whistle after all And it is about the only instrument I could ever get the hang of said Bellew Why do you mean as you play sir Hardly that but I make a good bluff at it Why then I ve got a couple o very good whistles if you re so minded we might try a doo et sir arter tea With pleasure nodded Bellew But hereupon Peterday noticing that the Sergeant ate nothing leaned over and touched him upon the shoulder How s the wind now Shipmate he enquired Why so so Peterday fairish fairish said the Sergeant stirring his tea round and round and with his gaze fixed upon the opposite wall Then messmate why not a muffin or even a occasional shrimp where be your appetite Peterday said the Sergeant beginning to stir his tea faster than ever and with his eyes still fixed consequent upon disparaging remarks having been passed by one Grimes our landlord concerning them as should not be mentioned in a inn parlour or anywhere else by such as said Grimes I was compelled to pour a tankard of beer over said Grimes our landlord this arternoon Peterday at exactly twelve and a half minutes past six by my watch which done I ran our landlord out into the road Peterday say half a minute later which would make it precisely thirteen minutes after the hour Consequent upon which comrade we have received our marching orders What messmate is it heave our anchor you mean I mean comrade that on Saturday next being the twenty fifth instant we march out bag and baggage horse foot and artillery we evacuate our position in face of superior force for good and all comrade Is that so shipmate It s rough on you Peterday it s hard on you I ll admit but things were said comrade relative to business troubles of one as we both respect Peterday things was said as called for beer down the neck and running out into the road comrade But it s rough on you Peterday seeing as you like the Hussars at Assuan was never engaged so to speak Aye aye Shipmate that does ketch me all aback shipmate Why Lord I d give a pound two pound ah ten just to have been astarn of him wi a rope s end though come to think of it I d ha preferred a capstan bar Peterday said the Sergeant removing his gaze from the wall with a jerk on the twenty fifth instant we shall be without a roof to cover us and all my doing Peterday what have you to say about it Say messmate why that you and me honouring and respecting two ladies as deserves to be honoured and respected ain t going to let such a small thing as this here cottage come betwixt us and our honouring and respecting of them two ladies If therefore we are due to quit this anchorage why then it s all hands to the windlass with a heave yo ho and merrily say I Messmate my fist Hereupon with a very jerky movement indeed the Sergeant reached out his remaining arm and the soldier and the sailor shook hands very solemnly over the muffins already vastly diminished in number with a grip that spoke much Peterday you have lifted a load off my heart I thank ye comrade and spoke like a true soldier Peterday the muffins So now the Sergeant himself once more fell to in turn and they ate and drank and laughed and talked until the shrimps were all gone and the muffins were things of the past And now declining all Bellew s offers of assistance the soldier and the sailor began washing and drying and putting away their crockery each in his characteristic manner the Sergeant very careful and exact while the sailor juggled cups and saucers with the sure handed deftness that seems peculiar to nautical fingers Yes Peterday said the Sergeant hanging each cup upon its appointed nail and setting each saucer solicitously in the space reserved for it on the small dresser since you have took our marching orders as you have took em I am quite reconciled to parting with these here snug quarters barring only a book shelf and a cup board Cupboard returned Peterday with a snort of disdain why there never was such a ill contrived lubberly cupboard as that in all the world you can t get at it unless you lay over to port on account o the clothes press and then hard a starboard on account o the dresser and then it being in the darkest corner True Peterday but then I m used to it and use is everything as you know I can lay my hand upon anything in a minute watch me Saying which the Sergeant squeezed himself between the press and the dresser opened the cupboard and took thence several articles which he named each in order A pair o jack boots two brushes blacking and a burnisher Having set these down one by one upon the dresser he wheeled and addressed himself to Bellew as follows mister Bellew sir this evening being the anniversary of a certain event sir I will ask you to excuse me while I make the necessary preparations to honour this anniversary as is ever my custom As he ended he dropped the two brushes the blacking and the burnisher inside the legs of the boots picked them up with a sweep of the arm and turning short round strode out into the little garden A fine fellow is Dick sir nodded Peterday beginning to fill a long clay pipe Lord what a sailor he d ha made to be sure failing which he s as fine a soldier as ever was or will be with enough war medals to fill my Sunday hat sir When he lost his arm they gave him the V C and his discharge sir because why because a soldier wi one arm ain t any more good than a sailor wi one leg d ye see So they tried to discharge Dick but Lord love you they couldn t sir because why because Dick were a soldier bred and born and is as much a soldier to day as ever he was ah and always will be until he goes marching aloft like poor Tom Bowling until one as is General of all the armies and Admiral of all the fleets as ever sailed shall call the last muster roll sir At this present moment sir continued the sailor lighting his pipe with a live coal from the fire my messmate is a sitting to the leeward o the plum tree outside a polishing of his jack boots as don t need polishing and a burnishing of his spurs as don t need burnishing And because why because he goes on guard to night according to custom On guard repeated Bellew I m afraid I don t understand Of course you don t sir chuckled Peterday well then to night he marches away in full regimentals sir to mount guard And where do you suppose why I ll tell you under Miss Priscilla s window He gets there as the clock is striking eleven and there he stays a marching to and fro until twelve o clock Which does him a world o good sir and noways displeases Miss Priscilla because why because she don t know nothing whatever about it Hereupon Peterday rose and crossing to a battered sea man s chest in the corner came back with three or four tin whistles which he handed to Bellew who laid aside his pipe and having selected one ran tentatively up and down the scale while Peterday listened attentive of ear and beaming of face Sir said he what do you say to Annie Laurie as a start shall we give em Annie Laurie very good ready go Thus George Bellew American citizen and millionaire piped away on a tin whistle with all the gusto in the world introducing little trills and flourishes here and there that fairly won the one legged sailor s heart They had already given em three or four selections each of which had been vociferously encored by Peterday or Bellew and had just finished an impassioned rendering of the Suwanee River when the Sergeant appeared with his boots beneath his arm Shipmate cried Peterday flourishing his whistle did ye ever hear a tin whistle better played or mellerer in tone Meller is the only word for it comrade and your playing sirs is artistic though doleful P raps you wouldn t mind giving us something brighter a rattling quick step P raps you might remember one as begins Some talk of Alexander And some of Hercules if it wouldn t be troubling you too much Forthwith they burst forth into The British Grenadiers and never did tin whistles render the famous old tune with more fire and dash As the stirring notes rang out the Sergeant standing upon the hearth seemed to grow taller his broad chest expanded his eyes glowed a flush crept up into his cheek and the whole man thrilled to the music as he had done many a time and oft in years gone by As the last notes died away he glanced down at the empty sleeve pinned across his breast shook his head and thanking them in a very gruff voice indeed turned on his heel and busied himself at his little cupboard Peterday now rose and set a jug together with three glasses upon the table also spoons and a lemon keeping his weather eye meanwhile upon the kettle which last condescending to boil obligingly he rapped three times with his wooden leg Right O shipmate he cried very much as though he had been hailing the main top whereupon the Sergeant emerged from between the clothes press and the dresser with a black bottle in his hand which he passed over to Peterday who set about brewing what he called a jorum o grog the savour of which filled the place with a right pleasant fragrance And when the glasses brimmed each with a slice of lemon a top the Sergeant solemnly rose mister Bellew and comrade said he lifting his glass I give you Miss Priscilla God bless her said Peterday Amen added Bellew So the toast was drunk the glasses were emptied re filled and emptied again this time more slowly and the clock striking nine Bellew rose to take his leave Seeing which the Sergeant fetched his hat and stick and volunteered to accompany him a little way So when Bellew had shaken the sailor s honest hand they set out together Sergeant said Bellew after they had walked some distance I have a message for you For me sir From Miss Priscilla From indeed sir She bid me tell you that the peaches are riper to night than ever they were The Sergeant seemed to find in this a subject for profound thought and he strode on beside Bellew very silently and with his eyes straight before him That the peaches were riper to night than ever they were said he at last Yes Sergeant Riper said the Sergeant as though turning this over in his mind Riper than ever they were nodded Bellew The peaches I think sir The peaches yes Bellew heard the Sergeant s finger rasping to and fro across his shaven chin mister Bellew sir she is a very remarkable woman sir Yes Sergeant A wonderful woman Yes Sergeant The kind of woman that improves with age sir Yes Sergeant Talking of peaches sir I ve often thought she is very like a peach herself sir Very Sergeant but Well sir Peaches do not improve with age Sergeant and the peaches are riper than ever they were to night The Sergeant stopped short and stared at Bellew wide eyed Why sir said he very slowly you don t mean to say you think as she meant that But I do nodded Bellew And now just as suddenly as he had stopped the Sergeant turned and went on again Lord he whispered Lord Lord The moon was rising and looking at the Sergeant Bellew saw that there was a wonderful light in his face yet a light that was not of the moon Sergeant said Bellew laying a hand upon his shoulder why don t you speak to her Speak to her what me No no mister Bellew said the Sergeant hastily No no can t be done sir not to be mentioned or thought of sir The light was all gone out of his face now and he walked with his chin on his breast The surprising thing to me Sergeant is that you have never thought of putting your fortune to the test and speaking your mind to her before now Thought of it sir repeated the Sergeant bitterly thought of it Lord sir I ve thought of it these five years and more I ve thought of it day and night I ve thought of it so very much that I know I never can speak my mind to her Look at me he cried suddenly wheeling and confronting Bellew but not at all like his bold erect soldierly self Yes look at me a poor battered old soldier with his best arm gone left behind him in India and with nothing in the world but his old uniform getting very frayed and worn like himself sir a pair o jack boots likewise very much worn though wonderfully patched here and there by my good comrade Peterday a handful of medals and a very modest pension Look at me with the best o my days behind me and wi only one arm left and I m a deal more awkward and helpless with that one arm than you d think sir look at me and then tell me how could such a man dare to speak his mind to such a woman What right has such a man to even think of speaking his mind to such a woman when there s part o that man already in the grave Why no right sir none in the world Poverty and one arm are facts as make it impossible for that man to ever speak his mind And sir that man never will Sir good night to you and a pleasant walk I turn back here Which the Sergeant did then and there wheeling sharp right about face yet as Bellew watched him go he noticed that the soldier s step was heavy and slow and it seemed that for once the Sergeant had even forgotten to put on his imaginary spurs CHAPTER XV In which Adam explains Adam Yes Miss Anthea How much money did mister Bellew give you to buy the furniture Miss Anthea was sitting in her great elbow chair leaning forward with her chin in her hand looking at him in the way which always seemed to Adam as though she could see into the verimost recesses of his mind Therefore Adam twisted his hat in his hands and stared at the ceiling and the floor and the table before Miss Anthea and the wall behind Miss Anthea anywhere but at Miss Anthea You ax me how much it were Miss Anthea Yes Adam Well it were a goodish sum Was it fifty pounds Fifty pound repeated Adam in a tone of lofty disdain no Miss Anthea it were not fifty pound Do you mean it was more Ah nodded Adam I mean as it were a sight more If you was to take the fifty pound you mention add twenty more and then another twenty to that and then come ten more to that why then you d be a bit nigher the figure A hundred pounds exclaimed Anthea aghast Ah a hundred pound nodded Adam rolling the words upon his tongue with great gusto one hundred pound were the sum Miss Anthea Oh Adam Lord love you Miss Anthea that weren t nothing that were only a flea bite as you might say he give more ah nigh double as much as that for the side board Nonsense Adam It be gospel true Miss Anthea That there sideboard were the plum o the sale so to speak an old Grimes had set is eart on it d ye see Well it were bid up to eighty six pound an then Old Grimes e goes twenty more making it a hundred an six Then jest as I thought it were all over an jest as that there Old Grimes were beginning to swell hisself up wi triumph an get that red in the face as e were a sight to behold mister Belloo who d been lightin is pipe all this time up and sez Fifty up e sez in his quiet way making it a hundred an fifty six pound Miss Anthea which were too much for Grimes Lord I thought as that there man were going to burst Miss Anthea and Adam gave vent to his great laugh at the mere recollection But Anthea was grave enough and the troubled look in her eyes quickly sobered him A hundred and fifty six pounds she repeated in an awed voice but it it is awful Steepish admitted Adam pretty steepish for a old sideboard I ll allow Miss Anthea but you see it were a personal matter betwixt Grimes an mister Belloo I began to think as they never would ha left off biddin an by George I don t believe as mister Belloo ever would have left off biddin Ye see there s summat about mister Belloo whether it be his voice or his eye or his chin I don t know but there be summat about him as says very distinct that if so be e should appen to set is mind on a thing why e s a going to get it an e ain t a going to give in till e do get it Ye see Miss Anthea e s so very quiet in is ways an speaks so soft an gentle p raps that s it Say for instance e were to ax you for summat an you said No well e wouldn t make no fuss about it not im he d jest take it that s what he d do As for that there sideboard he d a sat there a bidding and a bidding all night I do believe But Adam why did he do it Why did he buy all that furniture Well to keep it from being took away p raps Oh Adam what am I to do Do Miss Anthea The mortgage must be paid off dreadfully soon you know that and I can t Oh I can t give the money back Why give it back No a course not Miss Anthea But I can t keep it Can t keep it Miss Anthea mam an why not Because I m very sure he doesn t want all those things the idea is quite absurd And yet even if the hops do well the money they bring will hardly be enough by itself and so I was selling my furniture to make it up and now Oh what am I to do and she leaned her head wearily upon her hand Now seeing her distress Adam all sturdy loyalty that he was must needs sigh in sympathy and fell once more to twisting his hat until he had fairly wrung it out of all semblance to its kind twisting and screwing it between his strong hands as though he would fain wring out of it some solution to the problem that so perplexed his mistress Then all at once the frown vanished from his brow his grip loosened upon his unfortunate hat and his eye brightened with a sudden gleam Miss Anthea said he drawing a step nearer and lowering his voice mysteriously supposing as I was to tell you that e did want that furnitur ah an wanted it bad Now how can he Adam It isn t as though he lived in England said Anthea shaking her head his home is thousands of miles away he is an American and besides Ah but then even a American may get married Miss Anthea mam said Adam Married she repeated glancing up very quickly Adam what do you mean Why you must know began Adam wringing at his hat again ever since the day I found him asleep in your hay Miss Anthea mam mister Belloo has been very kind and friendly like mister Belloo an me ave smoked a good many sociable pipes together an when men smoke together Miss Anthea they likewise talk together Yes Well said Anthea rather breathlessly and taking up a pencil that happened to be lying near to hand And mister Belloo continued Adam heavily mister Belloo has done me the the honour here Adam paused to give an extra twist to his hat the honour Miss Anthea Yes Adam Of confiding to me is opes said Adam slowly finding it much harder to frame his well meaning falsehood than he had supposed his H O P E S opes Miss Anthea of settling down very soon an of marryin a fine young lady as e as ad is eye on a goodish time aving knowed her from childhood s hour Miss Anthea and as lives up to Lonnon Yes Adam Consequently e bought all your furnitur to set up ousekeepin don t ye see Yes I see Adam Her voice was low soft and gentle as ever but the pencil was tracing meaningless scrawls in her shaking fingers So you don t ave to be no wise back ard about keepin the money Miss Anthea Oh no no of course not I I understand it was just a business transaction Ah that s it a business transaction nodded Adam So you ll put the money a one side to help pay off the mortgage eh Miss Anthea Yes If the ops comes up to what they promise to come up to you ll be able to get rid of Old Grimes for good an all Miss Anthea Yes Adam An you be quite easy in your mind now Miss Anthea about keepin the money Quite Thank you Adam for telling me You can go now Why then Good night Miss Anthea mam the mortgage is as good as paid there ain t no such ops nowhere near so good as our n be An you re quite free o care an appy earted Miss Anthea Quite Oh quite Adam But when Adam s heavy tread had died away when she was all alone she behaved rather strangely for one so free of care and happy hearted Something bright and glistening splashed upon the paper before her the pencil slipped from her fingers and with a sudden choking cry she swayed forward and hid her face in her hands CHAPTER XVI In which Adam proposes a game To be or not to be Bellew leaned against the mighty hole of King Arthur and stared up at the moon with knitted brows That is the question whether I shall brave the slings and arrows and things and speak tonight and have done with it one way or another or live on a while secure in this uncertainty To wait Whether I shall at this so early stage pit all my chances of happiness against the chances of losing her and with her Small Porges bless him and all the quaint and lovable beings of this wonderful Arcadia of mine For if her answer be No what recourse have I what is there left me but to go wandering forth again following the wind and with the gates of Arcadia shut upon me for ever To be or not to be that is the question Be that you mister Belloo sir Even so Adam Come sit ye a while good knave and gaze upon Dian s loveliness and smoke and let us converse of dead kings Why kings ain t much in my line sir living or dead uns me never aving seen any except a pic ter and that tore though very life like But why I were a lookin for you was to ax you to back me up an to play the game mister Belloo sir Why as to that my good Adam my gentle Daphnis my rugged Euphemio you may rely upon me to the uttermost Are you in trouble Is it counsel you need or only money Fill your pipe and while you smoke confide your cares to me put me wise or as your French cousins would say make me au fait Well began Adam when his pipe was well alight in the first place mister Belloo sir I begs to remind you as Miss Anthea sold her furnitur to raise enough money as with what the ops will bring might go to pay off the mortgage for good an all sir Yes Well to night sir Miss Anthea calls me into the parlour to ax or as you might say en quire as to the why an likewise the wherefore of you a buyin all that furnitur Did she Adam Ah why did e do it says she well to keep it from bein took away p raps says I sharp as any gimblet sir Good nodded Bellew Ah but it weren t no good sir returned Adam because she sez as ow your ome being in America you couldn t really need the furnitur nor yet want the furnitur an blest if she wasn t talkin of handing you the money back again Hum said Bellew Seeing which sir an because she must have that money if she opes to keep the roof of Dapplemere over er ead I there an then made up or as you might say concocted a story a anecdote or a yarn upon the spot mister Belloo sir Most excellent Machiavelli proceed I told her sir as you bought that furnitur on account of you being wishful to settle down whereat she starts an looks at me wi her eyes big an surprised like I told er likewise as you had told me on the quiet or as you might say con fi dential that you bought that furnitur to set up ouse keeping on account o you being on the p int o marrying a fine young lady up to Lonnon What Bellew didn t move nor did he raise his voice nevertheless Adam started back and instinctively threw up his arm You told her that I did sir But you knew it was a confounded lie Aye I knowed it But I d tell a hundred ah thousands o lies con founded or otherwise to save Miss Anthea To save her From ruination sir From losing Dapplemere Farm an every thing she has in the world Lord love ye the ops can never bring in by theirselves all the three thousand pounds as is owing it ain t to be expected but if that three thousand pound ain t paid over to that dirty Grimes by next Saturday week as ever was that dirty Grimes turns Miss Anthea out o Dapplemere wi Master Georgy an poor little Miss Priscilla An what ll become o them then I don t know Lord when I think of it the Old Adam do rise up in me to that extent as I m minded to take a pitch fork and go and skewer that there Grimes to his own chimbley corner Ye see mister Belloo sir he went on seeing Bellew was silent still Miss Anthea be that proud an independent that she d never ha took your money sir if I hadn t told her that there lie so that s why I did tell her that here lie I see nodded Bellew I see yes you did quite right You acted for the best and you did quite right Adam yes quite right Thankee sir And so this is the game I am to play is it That s it sir if she ax s you are you goin to get married you ll tell her yes to a lady as you ve knowed from your childhood s hour living in Lonnon that s all sir That s all is it Adam said Bellew slowly turning to look up at the moon again It doesn t sound very much does it Well I ll play your game Adam yes you may depend upon me Thankee mister Belloo sir thankee sir though I do ope as you ll excuse me for taking such liberties an making so free wi your eart and your affections sir Oh certainly Adam the cause excuses everything Then good night sir Good night Adam So this good well meaning Adam strode away proud on the whole of his night s work leaving Bellew to frown up at the moon with teeth clenched tight upon his pipe stem CHAPTER XVII How Bellew began the game Now in this life of ours there be games of many and divers sorts and all are calculated to try the nerve courage or skill of the player as the case may be Bellew had played many kinds of games in his day and among others had once been famous as a Eight Tackle on the Harvard Eleven Upon him he yet bore certain scars received upon a memorable day when Yale flushed with success saw their hitherto invincible line rent and burst asunder saw a figure torn bruised and bleeding flash out and away down the field to turn defeat into victory and then to be borne off honourably to hospital and bed If Bellew thought of this by any chance as he sat there staring up at the moon it is very sure that had the choice been given him he would joyfully have chosen the game of torn flesh and broken bones or any other game no matter how desperate rather than this particular game that Adam had invented and thrust upon him Presently Bellew knocked the ashes from his pipe and rising walked on slowly toward the house As he approached he heard someone playing the piano and the music accorded well with his mood or his mood with the music for it was haunting and very sweet and with a recurring melody in a minor key that seemed to voice all the sorrow of Humanity past present and to come Drawn by the music he crossed the Rose Garden and reaching the terrace paused there for the long French windows were open and from where he stood he could see Anthea seated at the piano She was dressed in a white gown of some soft clinging material and among the heavy braids of her hair was a single great red rose And as he watched he thought she had never looked more beautiful than now with the soft glow of the candles upon her for her face reflected the tender sadness of the music it was in the mournful droop of her scarlet lips and the sombre depths of her eyes Close beside her sat little Miss Priscilla busy with her needle as usual but now she paused and lifting her head in her quick bird like way looked up at Anthea long and fixedly Anthea my dear said she suddenly I m fond of music and I love to hear you play as you know but I never heard you play quite so dolefully dear me no that s not the right word nor dismal but I mean something between the two I thought you were fond of Grieg Aunt Priscilla So I am but then even in his gayest moments poor mister Grieg was always breaking his heart over something or other And Gracious there s mister Bellew at the window Pray come in mister Bellew and tell us how you liked Peterday and the muffins Thank you said Bellew stepping in through the long French window but I should like to hear Miss Anthea play again first if she will But Anthea who had already risen from the piano shook her head I only play when I feel like it to please myself and Aunt Priscilla said she crossing to the broad low window seat and leaning out into the fragrant night Why then said Bellew sinking into the easy chair that Miss Priscilla indicated with a little stab of her needle why then the muffins were delicious Aunt Priscilla and Peterday was just exactly what a one legged mariner ought to be And the shrimps mister Bellew enquired Miss Priscilla busy at her sewing again Out shrimped all other shrimps so ever he answered glancing to where Anthea sat with her chin propped in her hand gazing up at the waning moon seemingly quite oblivious of him And did He pour out the tea enquired Miss Priscilla from the china pot with the blue flowers and the Chinese Mandarin fanning himself and very awkward of course with his one hand I don t mean the Mandarin mister Bellew and very full of apologies He did Just as usual yes he always does and every year he gives me three lumps of sugar and I only take one you know It s a pity sighed Miss Priscilla that it was his right arm a great pity And here she sighed again and catching herself glanced up quickly at Bellew and smiled to see how completely absorbed he was in contemplation of the silent figure in the window seat But after all better a right arm than a leg she pursued at least I think so Certainly murmured Bellew A man with only one leg you see would be almost as helpless as an old woman with a crippled foot Who grows younger and brighter every year added Bellew turning to her with his pleasant smile yes and I think prettier Oh mister Bellew exclaimed Miss Priscilla shaking her head at him reprovingly yet looking pleased none the less how can you be so ridiculous Good gracious me Why it was the Sergeant who put it into my head The Sergeant Yes it was after I had given him your message about peaches Aunt Priscilla and Oh dear heart exclaimed Miss Priscilla at this juncture Prudence is out to night and I promised to bake the bread for her and here I sit chatting and gossipping while that bread goes rising and rising all over the kitchen And Miss Priscilla laid aside her sewing and catching up her stick hurried to the door And I was almost forgetting to wish you many happy returns of the day Aunt Priscilla said Bellew rising At this familiar appellation Anthea turned sharply in time to see him stoop and kiss Miss Priscilla s small white hand whereupon Anthea must needs curl her lip at his broad back Then he opened the door and Miss Priscilla tapped away even more quickly than usual Anthea was half sitting half kneeling among the cushions in the corner of the deep window apparently still lost in contemplation of the moon So much so that she did not stir or even lower her up ward gaze when Bellew came and stood beside her Therefore taking advantage of the fixity of her regard he once more became absorbed in her loveliness Surely a most unwise proceeding in Arcadia by the light of a midsummer moon And he mentally contrasted the dark proud beauty of her face with that of all the women he had ever known to their utter and complete disparagement Well enquired Anthea at last perfectly conscious of his look and finding the silence growing irksome yet still with her eyes averted Well mister Bellew On the contrary he answered the moon is on the wane The moon she repeated Suppose it is what then True happiness can only come riding astride the full moon you know you remember old Nannie told us so And you believed it she enquired scornfully Why of course he answered in his quiet way Anthea didn t speak but once again the curl of her lip was eloquent And so he went on quite unabashed when I behold Happiness riding astride the full moon I shall just reach up in the most natural manner in the world and take it down that it may abide with me world without end Do you think you will be tall enough We shall see when the time comes I think it s all very ridiculous said Anthea Why then suppose you play for me that same plaintive piece you were playing as I came in something of Grieg s I think it was will you Miss Anthea She was on the point of refusing then as if moved by some capricious whim she crossed to the piano and dashed into the riotous music of a Polish Dance As the wild notes leapt beneath her quick brown fingers Bellew seated near by kept his eyes upon the great red rose in her hair that nodded slyly at him with her every movement And surely in all the world there had never bloomed a more tantalizing more wantonly provoking rose than this Wherefore Bellew very wisely turned his eyes from its glowing temptation Doubtless observing which the rose in evident desperation nodded and swayed until it had fairly nodded itself from its sweet resting place and falling to the floor lay within Bellew s reach Whereupon he promptly stooped and picked it up and even as with a last crashing chord Anthea ceased playing and turned in that same moment he dropped it deftly into his coat pocket Oh by the way mister Bellew she said speaking as if the idea had but just entered her mind what do you intend to do about all your furniture Do about it he repeated settling the rose carefully in a corner of his pocket where it would not be crushed by his pipe I mean where would you like it stored until you can send and have it taken away Well I er rather thought of keeping it where it was if you didn t mind I m afraid that will be impossible mister Bellew Why then the barn will be an excellent place for it I don t suppose the rats and mice will do it any real harm and as for the damp and the dust Oh you know what I mean exclaimed Anthea beginning to tap the floor impatiently with her foot Of course we can t go on using the things now that they are your property it wouldn t be right Very well he nodded his fingers questing anxiously after the rose again I ll get Adam to help me to shift it all into the barn to morrow morning Will you please be serious mister Bellew As an owl he nodded Why then of course you will be leaving Dapplemere soon and I should like to know exactly when so that I can make the necessary arrangements But you see I am not leaving Dapplemere soon or even thinking of it Not she repeated glancing up at him in swift surprise Not until you bid me I You But I I understood that you intend to settle down Certainly nodded Bellew transferring his pipe to another pocket altogether lest it should damage the rose s tender petals To settle down has lately become the er ambition of my life Then pray said Anthea taking up a sheet of music and beginning to study it with attentive eyes be so good as to tell me what you mean That necessarily brings us back to the moon again answered Bellew The moon The moon But what in the world has the moon to do with your furniture she demanded her foot beginning to tap again Everything I bought that furniture with er with one eye on the moon as it were consequently the furniture the moon and I are bound indissolubly together You are pleased to talk in riddles to night and really mister Bellew I have no time to waste over them so if you will excuse me Thank you for playing to me he said as he held the door open for her I played because I I felt like it mister Bellew Nevertheless I thank you When you make up your mind about the furniture please let me know When the moon is at the full yes Can it be possible that you are still harping on the wild words of poor old Nannie she exclaimed and once more she curled her lip at him Nannie is very old I ll admit he nodded but surely you remember that we proved her right in one particular I mean about the Tiger Mark you know Now when he said this for no apparent reason the eyes that had hitherto been looking into his proud and scornful wavered and were hidden under their long thick lashes the colour flamed in her cheeks and without another word she was gone CHAPTER XVIII How the Sergeant went upon his guard The Arcadians one and all generally follow that excellent maxim which runs Early to bed and early to rise Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise Healthy they are beyond a doubt and in their quaint simple fashion profoundly wise If they are not extraordinarily wealthy yet are they generally blessed with contented minds which after all is better than money and far more to be desired than fine gold Now whether their general health happiness and wisdom is to be attributed altogether to their early to bed proclivities is perhaps a moot question Howbeit to night long after these weary Arcadians had forgotten their various cares and troubles in the blessed oblivion of sleep for even Arcadia has its troubles Bellew sat beneath the shade of King Arthur alone with his thoughts Presently however he was surprised to hear the house door open and close very softly and to behold not the object of his meditations but Miss Priscilla coming towards him As she caught sight of him in the shadow of the tree she stopped and stood leaning upon her stick as though she were rather disconcerted Aunt Priscilla said he rising Oh it s you she exclaimed just as though she hadn t known it all along Dear me mister Bellew how lonely you look and dreadfully thoughtful good gracious and she glanced up at him with her quick girlish smile I suppose you are wondering what I am doing out here at this unhallowed time of night it must be nearly eleven o clock Oh dear me yes you are Well sit down and I ll tell you Let us sit here in the darkest corner there Dear heart how bright the moon is to be sure So saying Miss Priscilla ensconced herself at the very end of the rustic bench where the deepest shadow lay Well mister Bellew she began as you know to day is my birthday As to my age I am let us say just turned twenty one and being young and foolish mister Bellew I have come out here to watch another very foolish person a ridiculous old Sergeant of Hussars who will come marching along very soon to mount guard in full regimentals mister Bellew with his busby on his head with his braided tunic and dolman and his great big boots and with his spurs jingling and his sabre bright under the moon So then you know he comes Why of course I do And I love to hear the jingle of his spurs and to watch the glitter of his sabre So every year I come here and sit among the shadows where he can t see me and watch him go march march marching up and down and to and fro until the clock strikes twelve and he goes marching home again Oh dear me it s all very foolish of course but I love to hear the jingle of his spurs And have you sat here watching him every year Every year And he has never guessed you were watching him Good gracious me of course not Don t you think Aunt Priscilla that you are just a little cruel Cruel why what do you mean I gave him your message Aunt Priscilla What message That to night the peaches were riper than ever they were Oh said Miss Priscilla and waited expectantly for Bellew to continue But as he was silent she glanced at him and seeing him staring at the moon she looked at it also And after she had gazed for perhaps half a minute as Bellew was still silent she spoke though in a very small voice indeed And what did he say Who enquired Bellew Why the the Sergeant to be sure Well he gave me to understand that a poor old soldier with only one arm left him must be content to stand aside always and hold his peace just because he was a poor maimed old soldier Don t you think that you have been just a little cruel all these years Aunt Priscilla Sometimes one is cruel only to be kind she answered Aren t the peaches ripe enough after all Aunt Priscilla Over ripe she said bitterly Oh they are over ripe Is that all Aunt Priscilla No she answered no there s this and she held up her little crutch stick Is that all Aunt Priscilla Oh isn t that enough Bellew rose Where are you going What are you going to do she demanded Wait said he smiling down at her perplexity and so he turned and crossed to a certain corner of the orchard When he came back he held out a great glowing peach towards her You were quite right he nodded it was so ripe that it fell at a touch But as he spoke she drew him down beside her in the shadow Hush she whispered Listen Now as they sat there very silent faint and far away upon the still night air they heard a sound a silvery rhythmic sound it was like the musical clash of fairy cymbals which drew rapidly nearer and nearer and Bellew felt that Miss Priscilla s hand was trembling upon his arm as she leaned forward listening with a smile upon her parted lips and a light in her eyes that was ineffably tender Nearer came the sound and nearer until presently now in moonlight now in shadow there strode a tall martial figure in all the glory of braided tunic and furred dolman the three chevrons upon his sleeve and many shining medals upon his breast a stalwart soldierly figure despite the one empty sleeve who moved with the long swinging stride that only the cavalry man can possess Being come beneath a certain latticed window the Sergeant halted and next moment his glittering sabre flashed up to the salute then with it upon his shoulder he wheeled and began to march up and down his spurs jingling his sabre gleaming his dolman swinging his sabre glittering each time he wheeled while Miss Priscilla leaning forward watched him wide eyed and with hands tight clasped Then all at once with a little fluttering sigh she rose Thus the Sergeant as he marched to and fro was suddenly aware of one who stood in the full radiance of the moon and with one hand outstretched towards him And now as he paused disbelieving his very eyes he saw that in her extended hand she held a great ripe peach Sergeant she said speaking almost in a whisper Oh Sergeant won t you take it The heavy sabre thudded down into the grass and he took a sudden step towards her But even now he hesitated until coming nearer yet he could look down into her eyes Then he spoke and his voice was very hoarse and uneven Miss Priscilla he said Priscilla Oh Priscilla And with the word he had fallen on his knees at her feet and his strong solitary arm was folded close about her CHAPTER XIX In which Porges Big and Porges Small discuss the subject of Matrimony What is it my Porges Well I m a bit worried you know Worried Yes fraid I shall be an old man before my time Uncle Porges Adam says it s worry that ages a man an it killed a cat too And why do you worry Oh it s my Auntie Anthea a course she was crying again last night Crying Bellew had been lying flat upon his back in the fragrant shadow of the hay rick but now he sat up very suddenly so suddenly that Small Porges started Crying he repeated last night Are you sure Oh yes You see she forgot to come an tuck me up last night so I creeped downstairs very quietly you know to see why An I found her bending over the table all sobbing an crying At first she tried to pretend that she wasn t but I saw the tears quite plain her cheeks were all wet you know an when I put my arms round her to comfort her a bit an asked her what was the matter she only kissed me a lot an said nothing nothing only a headache And why was she crying do you suppose my Porges Oh money a course he sighed What makes you think it was money Cause she d been talking to Adam I heard him say Good night as I creeped down the stairs Ah said Bellew staring straight before him His beloved pipe had slipped from his fingers and for a wonder lay all neglected It was after she had talked with Adam was it my Porges Yes that s why I knew it was bout money Adam s always talking bout morgyges an bills an money Oh Uncle Porges how I do hate money It is sometimes a confounded nuisance nodded Bellew But I do wish we had some so we could pay all her bills an morgyges for her She d be so happy you know an go about singing like she used to an I shouldn t worry myself into an old man before my time all wrinkled an gray you know an all would be revelry an joy if only she had enough gold an bank notes And she was crying you say demanded Bellew again his gaze still far away Yes You are quite sure you saw the tears my Porges Oh yes an there was one on her nose too a big one that shone awful bright twinkled you know And she said it was only a headache did she Yes but that meant money money always makes her head ache lately Oh Uncle Porges I s pose people do find fortunes sometimes don t they Why yes to be sure they do Then I wish I knew where they looked for them said he with a very big sigh indeed I ve hunted an hunted in all the attics an the cupboards an under hedges an in ditches an prayed an prayed you know every night Then of course you ll be answered my Porges Do you really s pose I shall be answered You see it s such an awful long way for one small prayer to have to go from here to heaven An there s clouds that get in the way an I m fraid my prayers aren t quite big or heavy enough an get lost an blown away in the wind No my Porges said Bellew drawing his arm about the small disconsolate figure you may depend upon it that your prayers fly straight up into heaven and that neither the clouds nor the wind can come between or blow them away So just keep on praying old chap and when the time is ripe they ll be answered never fear Answered Do you mean oh Uncle Porges do you mean the Money Moon The small hand upon Bellew s arm quivered and his voice trembled with eagerness Why yes to be sure the Money Moon my Porges it s bound to come one of these fine nights Ah but when oh when will the Money Moon ever come Well I can t be quite sure but I rather fancy from the look of things my Porges that it will be pretty soon Oh I do hope so for her sake an my sake You see she may go getting herself married to mister Cassilis if something doesn t happen soon an I shouldn t like that you know Neither should I my Porges But what makes you think so Why he s always bothering her an asking her to you see She always says No a course but one of these fine days I m fraid she ll say Yes accidentally you know Heaven forbid nephew Does that mean you hope not Indeed yes Then I say heaven forbid too cause I don t think she d ever be happy in mister Cassilis s great big house An I shouldn t either Why of course not You never go about asking people to marry you do you Uncle Porges Well it could hardly be called a confirmed habit of mine That s one of the things I like about you so all the time you ve been here you haven t asked my Auntie Anthea once have you No my Porges not yet Oh but you don t mean that you ever will Would you be very grieved and angry if I did some day soon my Porges Well I I didn t think you were that kind of a man answered Small Porges sighing and shaking his head regretfully I m afraid I am nephew Do you really mean that you want to marry my Auntie Anthea I do As much as mister Cassilis does A great deal more I think Small Porges sighed again and shook his head very gravely indeed Uncle Porges said he I m s prised at you I rather feared you would be nephew It s all so awful silly you know why do you want to marry her Because like a Prince in a fairy tale I m er rather anxious to live happy ever after Oh said Small Porges turning this over in his mind I never thought of that Marriage is a very important institution you see my Porges especially in this case because I can t possibly live happy ever after unless I marry first now can I No I s pose not Small Porges admitted albeit reluctantly after he had pondered the matter a while with wrinkled brow but why pick out my Auntie Anthea Just because she happens to be your Auntie Anthea of course Small Porges sighed again Why then if she s got to be married some day so she can live happy ever after well I s pose you d better take her Uncle Porges Thank you old chap I mean to I d rather you took her than mister Cassilis an why there he is Who mister Cassilis An he s stopped an he s twisting his mestache mister Cassilis who had been crossing the paddock had indeed stopped and was twisting his black moustache as if he were hesitating between two courses Finally he pushed open the gate and approaching Bellew saluted him with that supercilious air which Miss Priscilla always declared she found so trying Ah mister Bellew what might it be this morning the pitchfork the scythe or the plough he enquired Neither sir this morning it is matrimony Eh I beg your pardon matrimony With a large M sir nodded Bellew marriage sir wedlock my nephew and I are discussing it in its aspects philosophical sociological and That is surely rather a peculiar subject to discuss with a child mister Bellew Meaning my nephew sir I mean young George there Precisely my nephew Small Porges I refer said mister Cassilis with slow and crushing emphasis to Miss Devine s nephew And mine mister Cassilis mine by er mutual adoption and inclination And I repeat that your choice of subjects is peculiar to say the least of it But then mine is rather a peculiar nephew sir But surely it was not to discuss nephews mine or anyone else s that you are hither come and our ears do wait upon you pray be seated sir Thank you I prefer to stand Strange murmured Bellew shaking his head I never stand if I can sit or sit if I can lie down I should like you to define exactly your position here at Dapplemere mister Bellew Bellew s sleepy glance missed nothing of the other s challenging attitude and his ear nothing of mister Cassilis s authoritative tone therefore his smile was most engaging as he answered My position here sir is truly the most er enviable in the world Prudence is an admirable cook particularly as regard Yorkshire Pudding gentle little Miss Priscilla is the most er Aunt like and perfect of housekeepers and Miss Anthea is our sovereign lady before whose radiant beauty Small Porges and I like true knights and gallant gentles do constant homage and in whose behalf Small Porges and I do stand prepared to wage stern battle by day or by night Indeed said mister Cassilis and his smile was even more supercilious than usual Yes sir nodded Bellew I do confess me a most fortunate and happy wight who having wandered hither and yon upon this planet of ours which is so vast and so very small has by the most happy chance found his way hither into Arcady And may I enquire how long you intend to lead this Arcadian existence I fear I cannot answer that question until the full o the moon sir at present I grieve to say I do not know mister Cassilis struck his riding boot a sudden smart rap with his whip his eyes snapped and his nostrils dilated as he glanced down into Bellew s imperturbable face At least you know and will perhaps explain what prompted you to buy all that furniture You were the only buyer at the sale I understand Who bought anything yes nodded Bellew And pray what was your object you a stranger Well replied Bellew slowly as he began to fill his pipe I bought it because it was there to buy you know I bought it because furniture is apt to be rather useful now and then I acquired the chairs to er sit in the tables to er put things on and Don t quibble with me mister Bellew I beg your pardon mister Cassilis When I ask a question sir I am in the habit of receiving a direct reply And when I am asked a question mister Cassilis I am in the habit of answering it precisely as I please or not at all mister Bellew let me impress upon you once and for all that Miss Devine has friends old and tried friends to whom she can always turn for aid in any financial difficulty she may have to encounter friends who can more than tide over all her difficulties without the interference of strangers and as one of her oldest friends I demand to know by what right you force your wholly unnecessary assistance upon her My very good sir returned Bellew shaking his head in gentle reproof really you seem to forget that you are not addressing one of your grooms or footmen consequently you force me to remind you of the fact furthermore That is no answer said mister Cassilis his gloved hands tight clenched upon his hunting crop his whole attitude one of menace Furthermore pursued Bellew placidly settling the tobacco in his pipe with his thumb you can continue to er demand until all s blue and I shall continue to lie here and smoke and gaze up at the smiling serenity of heaven The black brows of mister Cassilis met in a sudden frown he tossed his whip aside and took a sudden quick stride towards the recumbent Bellew with so evident an intention that Small Porges shrank instinctively further within the encircling arm But at that psychic moment very fortunately for all concerned there came the sound of a quick light step and Anthea stood between them mister Cassilis mister Bellew she exclaimed her cheeks flushed and her bosom heaving with the haste she had made pray whatever does this mean Bellew rose to his feet and seeing Cassilis was silent shook his head and smiled Upon my word I hardly know Miss Anthea Our friend mister Cassilis seems to have got himself all worked up over the er sale I fancy The furniture exclaimed Anthea and stamped her foot with vexation That wretched furniture Of course you explained your object in buying it mister Bellew Well no we hadn t got as far as that Now when he said this Anthea s eyes flashed sudden scorn at him and she curled her lip at him and turned her back upon him mister Bellew bought my furniture because he intends to set up house keeping he is to be married soon I believe When the moon is at the full nodded Bellew Married exclaimed mister Cassilis his frown vanishing as if by magic Oh indeed I am on my way to the hop gardens if you care to walk with me mister Cassilis and with the words Anthea turned and as he watched them walk away together Bellew noticed upon the face of mister Cassilis an expression very like triumph and in his general air a suggestion of proprietorship that jarred upon him most unpleasantly Why do you frown so Uncle Porges I er was thinking nephew Well I m thinking too nodded Small Porges his brows knitted portentously And thus they sat Big and Little Porges frowning in unison at space for quite a while Are you quite sure you never told my Auntie Anthea that you were going to marry her enquired Small Porges at last Quite sure comrade why Then how did she know you were going to marry her an settle down Marry her and settle down Yes at the full o the moon you know Why really I don t know my Porges unless she guessed it I specks she did she s awful clever at guessing things But do you know Well I m thinking I don t just like the way she smiled at mister Cassilis I never saw her look at him like that before as if she were awful glad to see him you know so I don t think I d wait till the full o the moon if I were you I think you d better marry her this afternoon That said Bellew clapping him on the shoulder is a very admirable idea I ll mention it to her on the first available opportunity my Porges But the opportunity did not come that day nor the next nor the next after that for it seemed that with the approach of the Hop picking Anthea had no thought or time for anything else Wherefore Bellew smoked many pipes and as the days wore on possessed his soul in patience which is a most excellent precept to follow in all things but love CHAPTER XX Which relates a most extraordinary conversation In the days which now ensued while Anthea was busied out of doors and Miss Priscilla was busied indoors and Small Porges was diligently occupied with his lessons at such times Bellew would take his pipe and go to sit and smoke in company with the Cavalier in the great picture above the carved chimney piece A right jovial companion at all times was this Cavalier an optimist he from the curling feather in his broad brimmed beaver hat to the spurs at his heels Handsome gay and debonair was he with lips up curving to a smile beneath his moustachio and a quizzical light in his grey eyes very like that in Bellew s own Moreover he wore the knowing waggish air of one well versed in all the ways of the world and mankind in general and what is infinitely more of the Sex Feminine in particular Experienced was he beyond all doubt in their pretty tricks and foibles since he had ever been a diligent student of Feminine Capriciousness when the Merry Monarch ruled the land Hence it became customary for Bellew to sit with him and smoke and take counsel of this preux chevalier upon the unfortunate turn of affairs Whereof ensued many remarkable conversations of which the following was one BELLEW No sir emphatically I do not agree with you To be sure you may have had more experience than I in such affairs but then it was such a very long time ago THE CAVALIER Interrupting or seeming to BELLEW Again I beg to differ from you women are not the same to day as they ever were Judging by what I have read of the ladies of your day and King Charles s court at Whitehall I should say not At least if they are they act differently and consequently must be er wooed differently The methods employed in your day would be wholly inadequate and quite out of place in this THE CAVALIER Shaking his head and smirking or seeming to BELLEW Well I m willing to bet you anything you like that if you were to step down out of your frame change your velvets and laces for trousers and coat leave off your great peruke and wear a derby hat instead of that picturesque floppy affair and try your fortune with some Twentieth Century damsel your high sounding gallantries and flattering phrases would fall singularly flat and you would be promptly turned down sir THE CAVALIER Tossing his love locks or seeming to BELLEW The strong hand you say Hum History tells us that William the Conqueror wooed his lady with a club or a battle axe or something of the sort and she consequently liked him the better for it which was all very natural and proper of course in her case seeing that hers was the day of battle axes and things But then as I said before sir the times are sadly changed women may still admire strength of body and even occasionally of mind but the theory of Dog woman and walnut tree is quite obsolete THE CAVALIER Frowning and shaking his head or seeming to BELLEW Ha you don t believe me Well that is because you are obsolete too yes sir as obsolete as your hat or your boots or your long rapier Now for instance suppose I were to ask your advice in my own case You know precisely how the matter stands at present between Miss Anthea and myself You also know Miss Anthea personally since you have seen her much and often and have watched her grow from childhood into er glorious womanhood I repeat sir glorious womanhood Thus you ought to know and understand her far better than I for I do confess she is a constant source of bewilderment to me Now since you do know her so well what course should you adopt were you in my place THE CAVALIER Smirking more knowingly than ever or seeming to BELLEW Preposterous Quite absurd and just what I might have expected Carry her off indeed No no we are not living in your bad old glorious days when a maid s No was generally taken to mean Yes or when a lover might swing his reluctant mistress up to his saddle bow and ride off with her leaving the world far behind To day it is all changed sadly changed Your age was a wild age a violent age but in some respects perhaps a rather glorious age Your advice is singularly characteristic and of course quite impossible alas Carry her off indeed Hereupon Bellew sighed and turning away lighted his pipe which had gone out and buried himself in the newspaper CHAPTER XXI Of shoes and ships and sealing wax and the third finger of the left hand So Bellew took up the paper The house was very quiet for Small Porges was deep in the vexatious rules of the Multiplication Table and something he called Jogafrey Anthea was out as usual and Miss Priscilla was busied with her numerous household duties Thus the brooding silence was unbroken save for the occasional murmur of a voice the jingle of the housekeeping keys and the quick light tap tap of Miss Priscilla s stick Therefore Bellew read the paper and let it be understood that he regarded the daily news sheet as the last resource of the utterly bored Now presently as he glanced over the paper with a negative interest his eye was attracted by a long paragraph beginning At saint George s Hanover Square by the Right Reverend the Bishop of Silvia Cecile Marchmont to His Grace the Duke of Ryde K G K C B Below followed a full true and particular account of the ceremony which it seemed had been graced by Royalty George Bellew read it half way through and yawned positively and actually yawned and thereafter laughed And so I have been in Arcadia only three weeks I have known Anthea only twenty one days A ridiculously short time as time goes in any other place but Arcadia and yet sufficient to lay for ever the er Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been Lord what a preposterous ass I was Baxter was quite right utterly and completely right Now let us suppose that this paragraph had read To day at saint George s Hanover Square Anthea Devine to No no confound it and Bellew crumpled up the paper and tossed it into a distant corner I wonder what Baxter would think of me now good old faithful John The Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been What a preposterous ass what a monumental idiot I was Posterous ass isn t a very pretty word Uncle Porges or continental idiot said a voice behind him and turning he beheld Small Porges somewhat stained and bespattered with ink who shook a reproving head at him True nephew he answered but they are sometimes very apt and in this instance particularly so Small Porges drew near and seating himself upon the arm of Bellew s chair looked at his adopted uncle long and steadfastly Uncle Porges said he at last you never tell stories do you I mean lies you know Indeed I hope not Porges why do you ask Well cause my Auntie Anthea s fraid you do Is she hum Why When she came to tuck me up last night she sat down on my bed an talked to me a long time An she sighed a lot an said she was fraid I didn t care for her any more which was awful silly you know Yes of course nodded Bellew An then she asked me why I was so fond of you an I said cause you were my Uncle Porges that I found under a hedge An then she got more angrier than ever an said she wished I d left you under the hedge Did she my Porges Yes she said she wished she d never seen you an she d be awful glad when you d gone away So I told her you weren t ever going away an that we were waiting for the Money Moon to come an bring us the fortune An then she shook her head an said Oh my dear you mustn t believe anything he says to you about the moon or anything else cause he tells lies an she said lies twice Ah and did she stamp her foot Porges Yes I think she did an then she said there wasn t such a thing as a Money Moon an she told me you were going away very soon to get married you know And what did you say Oh I told her that I was going too An then I thought she was going to cry an she said Oh Georgy I didn t think you d leave me even for him So then I had to s plain how we had arranged that she was going to marry you so that we could all live happy ever after I mean that it was all settled you know an that you were going to speak to her on the first opportunity An then she looked at me a long time an asked me was I sure you had said so An then she got awful angry indeed an said How dare he Oh how dare he So a course I told her you d dare anything even a dragon cause you are so big an brave you know So then she went an stood at the window an she was so angry she cried an I nearly cried too But at last she kissed me Good night an said you were a man that never meant anything you said an that I must never believe you any more an that you were going away to marry a lady in London an that she was very glad cause then we should all be happy again she s posed So she kissed me again an tucked me up an went away But it was a long long time before I could go to sleep cause I kept on thinking an thinking s posing there really wasn t any Money Moon after all s posing you were going to marry another lady in London You see it would all be so frightfully awful wouldn t it Terribly dreadfully awful my Porges But you never do tell lies do you Uncle Porges No An there is a Money Moon isn t there Why of course there is An you are going to marry my Auntie Anthea in the full o the moon aren t you Yes my Porges Why then everything s all right again so let s go an sit under the hay stack an talk bout ships But why of ships enquired Bellew rising Cause I made up my mind this morning that I d be a sailor when I grow up a mariner you know like Peterday only I d prefer to have both my legs You d find it more convenient perhaps You know all bout oceans an waves and billows don t you Uncle Porges Well I know a little An are you ever sea sick like a landlubber I used to be but I got over it Was it a very big ship that you came over in No not so very big but she s about as fast as anything in her class and a corking sea boat What s her name Her name repeated Bellew well she was called the er Silvia That s an awful pretty name for a ship Hum so so but I have learned a prettier and next time she puts out to sea we ll change her name eh my Porges We cried Small Porges looking up with eager eyes do you mean you d take me to sea with you an my Auntie Anthea of course You don t suppose I d leave either of you behind if I could help it do you We d all sail away together wherever you wished Do you mean said Small Porges in a suddenly awed voice that it is your ship your very own Oh yes But do you know Uncle Porges you don t look as though you had a ship for your very own somehow Don t I You see a ship is such a very big thing for one man to have for his very own self An has it got masts an funnels an anchors Lots of em Then please when will you take me an Auntie Anthea sailing all over the oceans Just so soon as she is ready to come Then I think I d like to go to Nova Zembla first I found it in my jogafrey to day an it sounds nice an far off doesn t it It does Shipmate nodded Bellew Oh that s fine exclaimed Small Porges rapturously you shall be the captain an I ll be the shipmate an we ll say Aye Aye to each other like the real sailors do in books shall we Aye aye Shipmate nodded Bellew again Then please Uncle Por I mean Captain what shall we name our ship I mean the new name Well my Porges I mean of course shipmate I rather thought of calling her Hallo why here s the Sergeant Sure enough there was Sergeant Appleby sitting under the shade of King Arthur but who rose and stood at attention as they came up Why Sergeant how are you said Bellew gripping the veteran s hand You are half an hour before your usual time to day nothing wrong I hope Nothing wrong mister Bellew sir I thank you No nothing wrong but this is a memorable occasion sir May I trouble you to step behind the tree with me for half a moment sir Suiting the action to the word the Sergeant led Bellew to the other side of the tree and there screened from view of the house he with a sudden jerky movement produced a very small leather case from his pocket which he handed to Bellew Not good enough for such a woman I know but the best I could afford sir said the Sergeant appearing profoundly interested in the leaves overhead while Bellew opened the very small box Why it s very handsome Sergeant said Bellew making the jewels sparkle in the sun anyone might be proud of such a ring Why it did look pretty tidy in the shop sir to me and Peterday My comrade has a sharp eye and a sound judgment in most things sir and we took a deal of trouble in selecting it But now when it comes to giving it to Her why it looks uncommon small and mean sir A ruby and two diamonds and very fine stones too Sergeant So I made so bold as to come here sir pursued the Sergeant still interested in the foliage above half an hour afore my usual time to ask you sir if you would so far oblige me as to hand it to her when I m gone sir Lord no said Bellew smiling and shaking his head not on your life Sergeant Why man it would lose half its value in her eyes if any other than you gave it to her No Sergeant you must hand it to her yourself and what s more you must slip it upon her finger Good Lord sir exclaimed the Sergeant I could never do that Oh yes you could Not unless you stood by me a force in reserve as it were sir I ll do that willingly Sergeant Then p raps sir you might happen to know which finger The third finger of the left hand I believe Sergeant Here s Aunt Priscilla now said Small Porges at this juncture Lord exclaimed the Sergeant and sixteen minutes afore her usual time Yes there was Miss Priscilla her basket of sewing upon her arm as gentle as unruffled as placid as usual And yet it is probable that she divined something from their very attitudes for there was a light in her eyes and her cheeks seemed more delicately pink than was their wont Thus as she came toward them under the ancient apple trees despite her stick and her white hair she looked even younger and more girlish than ever At least the Sergeant seemed to think so for as he met her look his face grew suddenly radiant while a slow flush crept up under the tan of his cheek and the solitary hand he held out to her trembled a little for all its size and strength Miss Priscilla mam he said and stopped Miss Priscilla he began again and paused once more Why Sergeant she exclaimed though it was a very soft little exclamation indeed for her hand still rested in his and so she could feel the quiver of the strong fingers why Sergeant Miss Priscilla said he beginning all over again but with no better success Goodness me exclaimed Miss Priscilla I do believe he is going to forget to enquire about the peaches Peaches repeated the Sergeant Yes Priscilla And why Cause he s brought you a ring Small Porges broke in a very handsome ring you know Aunt Priscilla all diamonds an jewels an he wants you to please let him put it on your finger if you don t mind And here it is said the Sergeant and gave it into her hand Miss Priscilla stood very silent and very still looking down at the glittering gems then all at once her eyes filled and a slow wave of colour dyed her cheeks Oh Sergeant she said very softly Oh Sergeant I am only a poor old woman with a lame foot And I am a poor old soldier with only one arm Priscilla You are the strongest and gentlest and bravest soldier in all the world I think she answered And you Priscilla are the sweetest and most beautiful woman in the world I know And so I ve loved you all these years and never dared to tell you so because of my one arm Why then said Miss Priscilla smiling up at him through her tears if you do really think that why it s this finger Sergeant So the Sergeant very clumsily perhaps because he had but the one hand slipped the ring upon the finger in question And Porges Big and Small turning to glance back as they went upon their way saw that he still held that small white hand pressed close to his lips CHAPTER XXII Coming events cast their shadows before I s pose they ll be marrying each other one of these fine days said Small Porges as they crossed the meadow side by side Yes I expect so Shipmate nodded Bellew and may they live long and die happy say I Aye aye Captain an Amen returned Small Porges Now as they went conversing of marriage and ships and the wonders and marvels of foreign lands they met with Adam who stared up at the sky and muttered to himself and frowned and shook his head Good arternoon mister Belloo sir an Master Georgy Well Adam how are the hops Ops sir there never was such ops no not in all Kent sir All I m wishin is that they was all safe picked an gathered W ot do you make o them clouds sir over there jest over the p int o the oast house Bellew turned and cast a comprehensive sailor like glance in the direction indicated Rain Adam and wind and plenty of it said he Ah so I think sir driving storm and thrashing tempest Well Adam Well sir p raps you ve never seen w ot driving rain an raging wind can do among the op bines sir All I wish is that they ops was all safe picked an gathered sir And Adam strode off with his eye still turned heaven ward and shaking his head like some great bird of ill omen So the afternoon wore away to evening and with evening came Anthea but a very grave eyed troubled Anthea who sat at the tea table silent and preoccupied in so much that Small Porges openly wondered while Miss Priscilla watched over her wistful and tender Thus Tea which was wont to be the merriest meal of the day was but the pale ghost of what it should have been despite Small Porges flow of conversation when not impeded by bread and jam and Bellew s tactful efforts Now while he talked light heartedly keeping carefully to generalities he noticed two things one was that Anthea made but a pretence at eating and the second that though she uttered a word now and then yet her eyes persistently avoided his Thus he for one was relieved when tea was over and as he rose from the table he determined despite the unpropitious look of things to end the suspense one way or another and speak to Anthea just so soon as she should be alone But here again he was balked and disappointed for when Small Porges came to bid him good night as usual he learned that Auntie Anthea had already gone to bed She says it s a head ache said Small Porges but I specks it s the hops really you know The hops my Porges She s worrying about them she s fraid of a storm like Adam is An when she worries I worry Oh Uncle Porges if only my prayers can bring the Money Moon soon you know very soon If they don t bring it in a day or two fraid I shall wake up one fine morning an find I ve worried an worried myself into an old man Never fear Shipmate said Bellew in his most nautical manner all s well that ends well a low and aloft all s a taunto So just take a turn at the lee braces and keep your weather eye lifting for you may be sure of this if the storm does come it will bring the Money Moon with it Then having bidden Small Porges a cheery Good night Bellew went out to walk among the roses And as he walked he watched the flying wrack of clouds above his head and listened to the wind that moaned in fitful gusts Wherefore having learned in his many travels to read and interpret such natural signs and omens he shook his head and muttered to himself even as Adam had done before him Presently he wandered back into the house and filling his pipe went to hold communion with his friend the Cavalier And thus it was that having ensconced himself in the great elbow chair and raised his eyes to the picture he espied a letter tucked into the frame thereof Looking closer he saw that it was directed to himself He took it down and after a momentary hesitation broke the seal and read Miss Devine presents her compliments to mister Bellew and regrets to say that owing to unforeseen circumstances she begs that he will provide himself with other quarters at the expiration of the month being the Twenty third inst Bellew read the lines slowly twice over then folding the note very carefully put it into his pocket and stood for a long time staring at nothing in particular At length he lifted his head and looked up into the smiling eyes of the Cavalier above the mantel Sir said he very gravely it would almost seem that you were in the right of it that yours is the best method after all Then he knocked the ashes from his pipe and went slowly and heavily up stairs to bed It was a long time before he fell asleep but he did so at last for Insomnia is a demon who rarely finds his way into Arcadia But all at once he was awake again broad awake and staring into the dark for a thousand voices seemed to be screaming in his ears and eager hands were shaking and plucking at window and lattice He started up and then he knew that the storm was upon them at last in all its fury rain and a mighty wind a howling raging tempest Yes a great and mighty wind was abroad it shrieked under the eaves it boomed and bellowed in the chimneys and roared away to carry destruction among the distant woods while the rain beat hissing against the window panes Surely in all its many years the old house of Dapplemere had seldom borne the brunt of such a storm so wild so fierce and pitiless And lying there upon his bed listening to the uproar and tumult Bellew must needs think of her who had once said We are placing all our hopes this year upon the hops CHAPTER XXIII How Small Porges in his hour of need was deserted by his Uncle Ruined sir Done for Lord love me they ain t worth the trouble o gatherin w ot s left on em mister Belloo sir So bad as that Adam Bad ah so bad as ever was sir said Adam blinking suspiciously and turning suddenly away Has Miss Anthea seen does she know Ah she were out at dawn and Oh Lord mister Belloo sir I can t never forget her poor stricken face so pale and sad it were But she never said nothing only Oh Adam my poor hops An I see her lips all of a quiver while she spoke An so she turned away an came back to the ouse sir Poor lass Oh poor lass he exclaimed his voice growing more husky She s made a brave fight for it sir but it weren t no use ye see it ll be Good bye for her to Dapplemere arter all that there mortgage can t never be paid now nohow When is it due Well according to the bond or the deed or whatever they calls it it be doo tonight at nine o clock sir though Old Grimes as a special favour an arter much persuading ad agreed to hold over till next Saturday on account o the op picking But now seeing as there ain t no ops to be picked why he ll fore close to night an glad enough to do it you can lay your oath on that mister Belloo sir To night said Bellew to night and he stood for a while with bent head as though lost in profound thought Adam said he suddenly help me to harness the mare I must drive over to the nearest rail road depot hurry I must be off the sooner the better What be you goin sir Yes hurry man hurry D ye mean as you re a goin to leave her now in the middle o all this trouble Yes Adam I must go to London on business now hurry like a good fellow And so together they entered the stable and together they harnessed the mare Which done staying not for breakfast Bellew mounted the driver s seat and with Adam beside him drove rapidly away But Small Porges had seen these preparations and now came running all eagerness but ere he could reach the yard Bellew was out of ear shot So there stood Small Porges a desolate little figure watching the rapid course of the dogcart until it had vanished over the brow of the hill And then all at once the tears welled up into his eyes hot and scalding and a great sob burst from him for it seemed to him that his beloved Uncle Porges had failed him at the crucial moment had left him solitary just when he needed him most Thus Small Porges gave way to his grief hidden in the very darkest corner of the stable whither he had retired lest any should observe his weakness until having once more gained command of himself and wiped away his tears with his small and dingy pocket handkerchief he slowly re crossed the yard and entering the house went to look for his Auntie Anthea And after much search he found her half lying half kneeling beside his bed When he spoke to her though she answered him she did not look up and he knew that she was weeping Don t Auntie Anthea don t he pleaded I know Uncle Porges has gone away an left us but you ve got me left you know an I shall be a man very soon before my time I think So don t cry though I m awful sorry he s gone too just when we needed him the most you know Oh Georgy she whispered my dear brave little Georgy We shall only have each other soon they re going to take Dapplemere away from us and everything we have in the world Oh Georgy Well never mind said he kneeling beside her and drawing one small arm protectingly about her we shall always have each other left you know nobody shall ever take you away from me An then there s the Money Moon It s been an awful long time coming but it may come to night or tomorrow night He said it would be sure to come if the storm came an so I ll find the fortune for you at last I know I shall find it some day a course cause I ve prayed an prayed for it so very hard an He said my prayers went straight up to heaven an didn t get blown away or lost in the clouds So don t cry Auntie Anthea let s wait just a little longer till the Money Moon comes CHAPTER XXIV In which shall be found mention of a certain black bag Baxter Sir Get me a pen and ink Yes sir Now any ordinary mortal might have manifested just a little surprise to behold his master walk suddenly in dusty and dishevelled of person his habitual languor entirely laid aside and to thus demand pen and ink forthwith But then Baxter though mortal was the very cream of a gentleman s gentleman and the acme of valets as has been said and comported himself accordingly Baxter Sir Oblige me by getting this cashed Yes sir Bring half of it in gold Sir said Baxter glancing down at the slip of paper did you say half sir Yes Baxter I d take it all in gold only that it would be rather awkward to drag around So bring half in gold and the rest in five pound notes Very good sir And Baxter Sir Take a cab Certainly sir And Baxter went out closing the door behind him Meanwhile Bellew busied himself in removing all traces of his journey and was already bathed and shaved and dressed by the time Baxter returned Now gripped in his right hand Baxter carried a black leather bag which jingled as he set it down upon the table Got it enquired Bellew I have sir Good nodded Bellew Now just run around to the garage and fetch the new racing car the Mercedes Now sir Now Baxter Once more Baxter departed and while he was gone Bellew began to pack that is to say he bundled coats and trousers shirts and boots into a portmanteau in a way that would have wrung Baxter s heart could he have seen Which done Bellew opened the black bag glanced inside shut it again and lighting his pipe stretched himself out upon an ottoman and immediately became plunged in thought So lost was he indeed that Baxter upon his return was necessitated to emit three distinct coughs the most perfectly proper and gentleman like coughs in the world ere Bellew was aware of his presence Oh that you Baxter said he sitting up back so soon The car is at the door sir The car ah yes to be sure Baxter Sir What should you say if I told you Bellew paused to strike a match broke it tried another broke that and finally put his pipe back into his pocket very conscious the while of Baxter s steady though perfectly respectful regard Baxter said he again Sir said Baxter What should you say if I told you that I was in love at last Baxter Head over ears hopelessly irretrievably Say sir why I should say indeed sir What should you say pursued Bellew staring thoughtfully down at the rug under his feet if I told you that I am so very much in love that I am positively afraid to tell her so I should say very remarkable sir Bellew took out his pipe again looked at it very much as if he had never seen such a thing before and laid it down upon the mantelpiece Baxter said he kindly understand that I am speaking to you as er man to man as my father s old and trusted servant and my early boy hood s only friend sit down John Thank you Master George sir I wish to confess to you John that er regarding the er Haunting Spectre of the Might Have Been you were entirely in the right At that time I knew no more the meaning of the er the word John Meaning the word Love Master George Precisely I knew no more about it than that table But during these latter days I have begun to understand and er the fact of the matter is I m I m fairly up against it John Here Baxter who had been watching him with his quick sharp eyes nodded his head solemnly Master George said he speaking as your father s old servant and your boyhood s friend I m afraid you are Bellew took a turn up and down the room and then pausing in front of Baxter who had risen also as a matter of course he suddenly laid his two hands upon his valet s shoulders Baxter said he you ll remember that after my mother died my father was always too busy piling up his millions to give much time or thought to me and I should have been a very lonely small boy if it hadn t been for you John Baxter I was often up against it in those days John and you were always ready to help and advise me but now well from the look of things I m rather afraid that I must stay up against it that the game is lost already John But which ever way Fate decides win or lose I m glad yes very glad to have learned the true meaning of the word John Master George sir there was a poet once Tennyson I think who said Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all and I know that he was right Many years ago before you were born Master George I loved and lost and that is how I know But I hope that Fortune will be kinder to you indeed I do Thank you John though I don t see why she should be And Bellew stood staring down at the rug again till aroused by Baxter s cough Pray sir what are your orders the car is waiting downstairs Orders why er pack your grip Baxter I shall take you with me this time into Arcadia Baxter For how long sir Probably a week Very good sir It is now half past three I must be back in Dapplemere at eight Take your time I ll go down to look at the machine Just lock the place up and er don t forget the black bag Some ten minutes later the great racing car set out on its journey with Bellew at the wheel and Baxter beside him with the black bag held firmly upon his knee Their process was necessarily slow at first on account of the crowded thoroughfares But every now and then the long low car would shoot forward through some gap in the traffic grazing the hubs of bus wheels dodging hansoms shaving sudden corners in an apparently reckless manner But Baxter with his hand always upon the black leather bag sat calm and unruffled since he knew by long experience that Bellew s eye was quick and true and his hand firm and sure upon the wheel Over Westminster Bridge and along the Old Kent Road they sped now fast now slow threading a tortuous and difficult way amid the myriad vehicles and so betimes they reached Blackheath And now the powerful machine hummed over that ancient road that had aforetime shaken to the tread of stalwart Roman Legionaries up Shooter s Hill and down and so into the open country And ever as they went they talked And not as master and servant but as between man and man wherefore Baxter the Valet became merged and lost in Baxter the Human the honest John of the old days a gray haired kindly eyed middle aged cosmopolitan who listened to and looked at Young Alcides beside him as if he had indeed been the Master George of years ago So you see John if all things do go well with me we should probably take a trip to the Mediterranean In the Silvia of course Master George Yes though er I ve decided to change her name John Ah very natural under the circumstances Master George said honest John his eyes twinkling slyly as he spoke Now if I might suggest a new name it would be hard to find a more original one than The Haunting Spectre of the Bosh John there never was such a thing you were quite right as I said before and by heaven potato sacks Eh what potato sacks Master George They had been climbing a long winding ascent but now having reached the top of the hill they overtook a great lumbering market cart or wain piled high with sacks of potatoes and driven by an extremely surly faced man in a smock frock Hallo there cried Bellew slowing up how much for one of your potato sacks Get out now growled the surly faced man in a tone as surly as his look can t ye see as they re all occipied Well empty one Get out now repeated the man scowling blacker than ever I ll give you a sovereign for one Now don t ye try to come none o your jokes wi me young feller growled the carter Sovereign bah Show us Here it is said Bellew holding up the coin in question Catch and with the word he tossed it up to the carter who caught it very dexterously looked at it bit it rubbed it on his sleeve rang it upon the foot board of his waggon bit it again and finally pocketed it It s a go sir he nodded his scowl vanishing as by magic and as he spoke he turned seized the nearest sack and forthwith sent a cascade of potatoes rolling and bounding all over the road Which done he folded up the sack and handed it down to Bellew who thrust it under the seat nodded and throwing in the clutch set off down the road But long after the car had hummed itself out of sight and the dust of its going had subsided the carter sat staring after it open mouthed If Baxter wondered at this purchase he said nothing only he bent his gaze thoughtfully upon the black leather bag that he held upon his knee On they sped between fragrant hedges under whispering trees past lonely cottages and farm houses past gate and field and wood until the sun grew low At last Bellew stopped the automobile at a place where a narrow lane or cart track branched off from the high road and wound away between great trees I leave you here said he as he sprang from the car this is Dapplemere the farmhouse lies over the up land yonder though you can t see it because of the trees Is it far Master George About half a mile Here is the bag sir but do you think it is quite safe Safe John Under the circumstances Master George I think it would be advisable to to take this with you And he held out a small revolver Bellew laughed and shook his head Such things aren t necessary here in Arcadia John besides I have my stick So good bye for the present you ll stay at the King s Head remember Good night Master George sir goodnight and good fortune go with you Thank you said Bellew and reached out his hand I think we ll shake on that John So they clasped hands and Bellew turned and set off along the grassy lane And presently as he went he heard the hum of the car grow rapidly fainter and fainter until it was lost in the quiet of the evening CHAPTER XXV The Conspirators The shadows were creeping down and evening was approaching as Bellew took his way along that winding lane that led to the House of Dapplemere Had there been anyone to see which there was not they might have noticed something almost furtive in his manner of approach for he walked always under the trees where the shadows lay thickest and paused once or twice to look about him warily Being come within sight of the house he turned aside and forcing his way through a gap in the hedge came by a roundabout course to the farm yard Here after some search he discovered a spade the which having discarded his stick he took upon his shoulder and with the black leather bag tucked under his arm crossed the paddock with the same degree of caution and so at last reached the orchard On he went always in the shadow until at length he paused beneath the mighty knotted branches of King Arthur Never did conspirator glance about him with sharper eyes or hearken with keener ears than did George Bellew or Conspirator No One where he now stood beneath the protecting shadow of King Arthur or Conspirator No Two as having unfolded the potato sack he opened the black leather bag The moon was rising broad and yellow but it was low as yet and King Arthur stood in impenetrable gloom as any other thorough going self respecting conspirator should and now all at once from this particular patch of shadow there came a sudden sound a rushing sound a chinking clinking metallic sound and thereafter a crisp rustling that was not the rustling of ordinary paper And now Conspirator No One rises and ties the mouth of the sack with string he had brought with him for the purpose and setting down the sack bulky now and heavy by Conspirator No Two takes up the spade and begins to dig And in a while having made an excavation not very deep to be sure but sufficient to his purpose he deposits the sack within covers it with soil treads it down and replacing the torn sod carefully pats it down with the flat of his spade Which thing accomplished Conspirator No One wipes his brow and stepping forth of the shadow consults his watch with anxious eye and thereupon smiles surely a singularly pleasing smile for the lips of an arch conspirator to wear Thereafter he takes up the black bag empty now shoulders the spade and sets off keeping once more in the shadows leaving Conspirator No Two to guard their guilty secret Now as Conspirator No One goes his shady way he keeps his look directed towards the rising moon and thus he almost runs into one who also stands amid the shadows and whose gaze is likewise fixed upon the moon Ah mister Bellew exclaims a drawling voice and Squire Cassilis turns to regard him with his usual supercilious smile Indeed Squire Cassilis seems to be even more self satisfied and smiling than ordinary to night or at least Bellew imagines so You are still agriculturally inclined I see said mister Cassilis nodding towards the spade though it s rather a queer time to choose for digging isn t it Not at all sir not at all returned Bellew solemnly the moon is very nearly at the full you will perceive Well sir and what of that When the moon is at the full or nearly so I generally dig sir that is to say circumstances permitting Really said mister Cassilis beginning to caress his moustache it seems to me that you have very ah peculiar tastes mister Bellew That is because you have probably never experienced the fierce joys of moon light digging sir No mister Bellew digging as a recreation has never appealed to me at any time Then sir said Bellew shaking his head permit me to tell you that you have missed a great deal Had I the time I should be delighted to explain to you exactly how much as it is allow me to wish you a very good evening mister Cassilis smiled and his teeth seemed to gleam whiter and sharper than ever in the moon light Wouldn t it be rather more apropos if you said Good bye mister Bellew he enquired You are leaving Dapplemere shortly I understand aren t you Why sir returned Bellew grave and imperturbable as ever it all depends Depends upon what may I ask The moon sir The moon Precisely And pray what can the moon have to do with your departure A great deal more than you d think sir Had I the time I should be delighted to explain to you exactly how much as it is permit me to wish you a very good evening Saying which Bellew nodded affably and shouldering his spade went upon his way And still he walked in the shadows and still he gazed upon the moon but now his thick brows were gathered in a frown and he was wondering just why Cassilis should chance to be here to night and what his confident air and the general assurance of his manner might portend above all he was wondering how mister Cassilis came to be aware of his own impending departure And so at last he came to the rick yard full of increasing doubt and misgivings CHAPTER XXVI How the money moon rose Evening had deepened into night a night of ineffable calm a night of an all pervading quietude A horse snorted in the stable nearby a dog barked in the distance but these sounds served only to render the silence the more profound by contrast It was indeed a night wherein pixies and elves and goblins and fairies might weave their magic spells a night wherein tired humanity dreamed those dreams that seem so hopelessly impossible by day And over all the moon rose high and higher in solemn majesty filling the world with her pale loveliness and brooding over it like the gentle goddess she is Even the distant dog seemed to feel something of all this for after a futile bark or two he gave it up altogether and was heard no more And Bellew gazing up at Luna s pale serenity smiled and nodded as much as to say You ll do and so stood leaning upon his spade listening to That deep hush which seems a sigh Breathed by Earth to listening sky Now all at once upon this quietude there rose a voice up raised in fervent supplication wherefore treading very softly Bellew came and peeping round the hay rick beheld Small Porges upon his knees He was equipped for travel and the perils of the road for beside him lay a stick and tied to this stick was a bundle that bulged with his most cherished possessions His cheeks were wet with great tears that glistened in the moon beams but he wept with eyes tight shut and with his small hands clasped close together and thus he spoke albeit much shaken and hindered by sobs I s pose you think I bother you an awful lot dear Lord an so I do but you haven t sent the Money Moon yet you see an now my Auntie Anthea s got to leave Dapplemere if I don t find the fortune for her soon I know I m crying a lot an real men don t cry but it s only cause I m awful lonely an disappointed an nobody can see me so it doesn t matter But dear Lord I ve looked an looked everywhere an I haven t found a single sovereign yet an I ve prayed to you an prayed to you for the Money Moon an it s never come So now dear Lord I m going to Africa an I want you to please take care of my Auntie Anthea till I come back Sometimes I m fraid my prayers can t quite manage to get up to you cause of the clouds an wind but to night there isn t any so if they do reach you please Oh please let me find the fortune and if you don t mind let him come back to me dear Lord I mean my Uncle Porges you know An now that s all dear Lord so Amen As the prayer ended Bellew stole back and coming to the gate of the rick yard leaned there waiting And presently as he watched he saw a small figure emerge from behind the big hay stack and come striding manfully toward him his bundle upon his shoulder and with the moon bright in his curls But all at once Small Porges saw him and stopped and the stick and bundle fell to the ground and lay neglected Why my Porges said Bellew a trifle huskily perhaps why Shipmate and he held out his hands Then Small Porges uttered a cry and came running and next moment Big Porges had him in his arms Oh Uncle Porges then you have come back to me Aye aye Shipmate Why then my prayers did reach Why of course prayers always reach my Porges Then oh do you s pose I shall find the fortune too Not a doubt of it just look at the moon The moon Why haven t you noticed how er peculiar it is to night Peculiar repeated Small Porges breathlessly turning to look at it Why yes my Porges big you know and er yellow like er like a very large sovereign Do you mean Oh do you mean it s the But here Small Porges choked suddenly and could only look his question The Money Moon Oh yes there she is at last my Porges Take a good look at her I don t suppose we shall ever see another Small Porges stood very still and gazed up at the moon s broad yellow disc and as he looked the tears welled up in his eyes again and a great sob broke from him I m so glad he whispered So awful glad Then suddenly he dashed away his tears and slipped his small trembling hand into Bellew s Quick Uncle Porges said he mister Grimes is coming to night you know an we must find the money in time Where shall we look first Well I guess the orchard will do to start with Then let s go now But we shall need a couple of spades Shipmate Oh must we dig Yes I fancy that s a er digging moon my Porges from the look of it Ah there s a spade nice and handy you take that and I ll er I ll manage with this pitchfork But you can t dig with a Oh well you can do the digging and I ll just er prod you know Ready then heave ahead Shipmate So they set out hand in hand spade and pitch fork on shoulder and presently were come to the orchard It s an awful big place to dig up a fortune in said Small Porges glancing about Where do you s pose we d better begin Well Shipmate between you and me and the pitch fork here I rather fancy King Arthur knows more than most people would think Any way we ll try him You dig on that side and I ll prod on this Saying which Bellew pointed to a certain spot where the grass looked somewhat uneven and peculiarly bumpy and bidding Small Porges get to work went round to the other side of the great tree Being there he took out his pipe purely from force of habit and stood with it clenched in his teeth listening to the scrape of Small Porges spade Presently he heard a cry a panting breathless cry but full of a joy unspeakable I ve got it Oh Uncle Porges I ve found it Small Porges was down upon his knees pulling and tugging at a sack he had partially unearthed and which with Bellew s aid he dragged forth into the moonlight In the twinkling of an eye the string was cut and plunging in a hand Small Porges brought up a fistful of shining sovereigns and among them a crumpled banknote It s all right Uncle Porges he nodded his voice all of a quaver It s all right now I ve found the fortune I ve prayed for gold you know an banknotes in a sack Everything will be all right again now And while he spoke he rose to his feet and lifting the sack with an effort swung it across his shoulder and set off toward the house Is it heavy Shipmate Awful heavy he panted but I don t mind that it s gold you see But as they crossed the rose garden Bellew laid a restraining hand upon his shoulder Porges said he where is your Auntie Anthea In the drawing room waiting for mister Grimes Then come this way And turning Bellew led Small Porges up and along the terrace Now my Porges he admonished him when we come to the drawing room windows they re open you see I want you to hide with me in the shadows and wait until I give you the word Aye aye Captain panted Small Porges When I say heave ahead Shipmate why then you will take your treasure upon your back and march straight into the room you understand Aye aye Captain Why then come on and mum s the word Very cautiously they approached the long French windows and paused in the shadow of a great rose bush near by From where he stood Bellew could see Anthea and Miss Priscilla and between them sprawling in an easy chair was Grimes while Adam hat in hand scowled in the background All I can say is as I m very sorry for ye Miss Anthea Grimes was saying Ah that I am but glad as you ve took it so well no crying nor nonsense Here he turned to look at Miss Priscilla whose everlasting sewing had fallen to her feet and lay there all unnoticed while her tearful eyes were fixed upon Anthea standing white faced beside her And when when shall ye be ready to leave to vacate Dapplemere Miss Anthea Grimes went on Not as I mean to urry you mind only I should like you to name a day Now as Bellew watched he saw Anthea s lips move but no sound came Miss Priscilla saw also and catching the nerveless hand drew it to her bosom and wept over it Come come expostulated Grimes jingling the money in his pockets Come come Miss Anthea mam all as I m axing you is when All as I want you to do is But here Adam who had been screwing and wringing at his hat now stepped forward and tapping Grimes upon the shoulder pointed to the door Mister Grimes said he Miss Anthea s told ye all as you come here to find out she s told ye as she can t pay so now s pose you go But all I want to know is when she ll be ready to move and I ain t a going till I do so you get out o my way S pose you go repeated Adam Get out o my way d ye hear Because Adam went on if ye don t go Mister Grimes the Old Adam be arising inside o me to that degree as I shall be forced to ketch you by the collar o your jacket and heave you out mister Grimes sir so s pose you go Hereupon mister Grimes rose put on his hat and muttering to himself stamped indignantly from the room and Adam shutting the door upon him turned to Miss Anthea who stood white lipped and dry eyed while gentle little Miss Priscilla fondled her listless hand Don t don t look that way Miss Anthea said Adam I d rayther see you cry than look so It be ard to ave to let the old place go but Heave ahead Shipmate whispered Bellew Obedient to his command Small Porges with his burden upon his back ran forward and stumbled into the room It s all right Auntie Anthea he cried I ve got the fortune for you I ve found the money I prayed for here it is oh here it is The sack fell jingling to the floor and next moment he had poured a heap of shining gold and crumpled banknotes at Anthea s feet For a moment no one moved then with a strange hoarse cry Adam had flung himself down upon his knees and caught up a great handful of the gold then while Miss Priscilla sobbed with her arms about Small Porges and Anthea stared down at the treasure wide eyed and with her hands pressed down upon her heart Adam gave a sudden great laugh and springing up came running out through the window never spying Bellew in his haste and shouting as he ran Grimes he roared Oh Grimes come back an be paid Come back we ve had our little joke wi you now come back an be paid Then at last Anthea s stony calm was broken her bosom heaved with tempestuous sobs and next moment she had thrown herself upon her knees and had clasped her arms about Small Porges and Aunt Priscilla mingling kisses with her tears As for Bellew he turned away and treading a familiar path found himself beneath the shadow of King Arthur Therefore he sat down and lighting his pipe stared up at the glory of the full orbed moon Happiness said he speaking his thought aloud Happiness shall come riding astride the full moon Now I wonder CHAPTER XXVII In which is verified the adage of the cup and the lip Now as he sat thus plunged in thought he heard the voice of one who approached intoning a familiar chant or refrain the voice was harsh albeit not unmusical and the words of the chant were these When I am dead diddle diddle as well may hap Bury me deep diddle diddle under the tap Under the tap diddle diddle I ll tell you Lord exclaimed the singer breaking off suddenly be that you mister Belloo sir Yea in good sooth Adam the very same but you sing Adam Ah I sing mister Belloo sir an if you ax me why then I tell you because I be appy earted an full o j o y j y sir The mortgage be paid

when I think of her cookin Lord mister Belloo sir All as I say is God bless Master Georgy Good night sir an may your dreams be as appy as mine always supposin I do dream which is seldom Good night sir Long after Adam s cheery whistle had died away Bellew sat pipe in mouth staring up at the moon At length however he rose and turned his steps towards the house mister Bellew He started and turning saw Anthea standing amid her roses For a moment they looked upon each other in silence as though each dreaded to speak then suddenly she turned and broke a great rose from its stem and stood twisting it between her fingers Why did you do it she asked Do it he repeated I mean the fortune Georgy told me how you helped him to find it and I know how it came there of course Why did you do it You didn t tell him how it came there asked Bellew anxiously No she answered I think it would break his heart if he knew And I think it would have broken his heart if he had never found it said Bellew and I couldn t let that happen could I Anthea did not answer and he saw that her eyes were very bright in the shadow of her lashes though she kept them lowered to the rose in her fingers Anthea said he suddenly and reached out his hand to her But she started and drew from his touch Don t she said speaking almost in a whisper don t touch me Oh I know you have paid off the mortgage you have bought back my home for me as you bought back my furniture Why why I was nothing to you or you to me why have you laid me under this obligation you know I can never hope to return your money oh why why did you do it Because I love you Anthea have loved you from the first Because everything I possess in this world is yours even as I am You forget she broke in proudly you forget Everything but my love for you Anthea everything but that I want you for my wife I m not much of a fellow I know but could you learn to love me enough to marry me some day Anthea Would you have dared to say this to me before to night before your money had bought back the roof over my head Oh haven t I been humiliated enough You you have taken from me the only thing I had left my independence stolen it from me Oh hadn t I been shamed enough Now as she spoke she saw that his eyes were grown suddenly big and fierce and in that moment her hands were caught in his powerful clasp Let me go she cried No said he shaking his head not until you tell me if you love me Speak Anthea Loose my hands She threw up her head proudly and her eyes gleamed and her cheeks flamed with sudden anger Loose me she repeated But Bellew only shook his head and his chin seemed rather more prominent than usual as he answered Tell me that you love me or that you hate me whichever it is but until you do You hurt me said she and then as his fingers relaxed with a sudden passionate cry she had broken free but even so he had caught and swept her up in his arms and held her close against his breast And now feeling the hopelessness of further struggle she lay passive while her eyes flamed up into his and his eyes looked down into hers Her long thick hair had come loose and now with a sudden quick gesture she drew it across her face veiling it from him wherefore he stooped his head above those lustrous tresses Anthea he murmured and the masterful voice was strangely hesitating and the masterful arms about her were wonderfully gentle Anthea do you love me Lower he bent and lower until his lips touched her hair until beneath that fragrant veil his mouth sought and found hers and in that breathless moment he felt them quiver responsive to his caress And then he had set her down she was free and he was looking at her with a new found radiance in his eyes Anthea he said wonderingly why then you do But as he spoke she hid her face in her hands Anthea he repeated Oh she whispered I hate you despise you Oh you shall be paid back every penny every farthing and very soon Next week I marry mister Cassilis And so she turned and fled away and left him standing there amid the roses CHAPTER XXVIII Which tells how Bellew left Dapplemere in the dawn Far in the East a grey streak marked the advent of another day and upon all things was a solemn hush a great and awful stillness that was like the stillness of Death The Earth was a place of gloom and mist where spectral shadows writhed and twisted and flitted under a frowning heaven and out of the gloom there came a breath sharp and damp and exceeding chill Therefore as Bellew gazed down from the frowning Heaven to the gloom of Earth below with its ever moving misty shapes he shivered involuntarily In another hour it would be day and with the day the gates of Arcadia would open for his departure and he must go forth to become once more a wanderer going up and down and to and fro in the world until his course was run And yet it was worth having lived for this one golden month and in all his wanderings needs must he carry with him the memory of her who had taught him how deep and high how wide and infinitely far reaching that thing called Love may really be And Porges dear quaint Small Porges where under heaven could he ever find again such utter faith such pure unaffected loyalty and devotion as throbbed within that small warm heart How could he ever bid Good bye to loving eager little Small Porges And then there was Miss Priscilla and the strong gentle Sergeant and Peterday and sturdy Adam and Prudence and the rosy cheeked maids How well they all suited this wonderful Arcadia Yes indeed he and he only had been out of place and so he must go back to the every day matter of fact world but how could he ever say Good bye to faithful loving Small Porges Far in the East the grey streak had brightened and broadened and was already tinged with a faint pink that deepened and deepened as he watched Bellew had seen the glory of many a sun rise in divers wild places of the Earth and hitherto had always felt deep within him the responsive thrill the exhilaration of hope new born and joyful expectation of the great unknown Future But now he watched the varying hues of pink and scarlet and saffron and gold with gloomy brow and sombre eyes Now presently the Black bird who lived in the apple tree beneath his window the tree of the inquisitive turn of mind this Black bird fellow opening a drowsy eye must needs give vent to a croak very hoarse and feeble then apparently having yawned prodigiously and stretched himself wing and leg he tried a couple of notes in a hesitating tentative sort of fashion shook himself repeated the two notes tried three found them mellower and more what the waiting world very justly expected of him grew more confident tried four tried five grew perfectly assured and so burst forth into the full golden melody of his morning song Then Bellew leaning out from his casement as the first bright beams of the rising sun gilded the top most leaves of the tree thus apostrophised the unseen singer I suppose you will be piping away down in your tree there old fellow long after Arcadia has faded out of my life Well it will be only natural and perfectly right of course She will be here and may perhaps stop to listen to you Now if somehow you could manage to compose for me a Song of Memory some evening when I m gone some evening when She happens to be sitting idle and watching the moon rise over the upland yonder if at such a time you could just manage to remind her of me why I d thank you And so Good bye old fellow Saying which Bellew turned from the window and took up a certain bulging be strapped portmanteau while the Black bird having evidently hearkened to his request with much grave attention fell a singing more gloriously than ever Meanwhile Bellew descended the great wide stair soft of foot and cautious of step yet pausing once to look towards a certain closed door and so presently let himself quietly out into the dawn The dew sparkled in the grass it hung in glittering jewels from every leaf and twig while now and then a shining drop would fall upon him as he passed like a great tear Now as he reached the orchard up rose the sun in all his majesty filling the world with the splendour of his coming before whose kindly beams the skulking mists and shadows shrank affrighted and fled utterly away This morning King Arthur wore his grandest robes of state for his mantle of green was thick sewn with a myriad flaming gems very different he looked from that dark shrouded giant who had so lately been Conspirator No Two Yet perhaps for this very reason Bellew paused to lay a hand upon his mighty rugged hole and doing so turned and looked back at the House of Dapplemere And truly never had the old house seemed so beautiful so quaint and peaceful as now It s every stone and beam had become familiar and as he looked seemed to find an individuality of its own the very lattices seemed to look back at him like so many wistful eyes Therefore George Bellew American Citizen millionaire traveller explorer and LOVER sighed as he turned away sighed as he strode on through the green and golden morning and resolutely looked back no more CHAPTER XXIX Of the moon s message to Small Porges and how he told it to Bellew in a whisper Bellew walked on at a good pace with his back turned resolutely towards the House of Dapplemere and thus as he swung into that narrow grassy lane that wound away between trees he was much surprised to hear a distant hail Facing sharp about he espied a diminutive figure whose small legs trotted very fast and whose small fist waved a weather beaten cap Bellew s first impulse was to turn and run But Bellew rarely acted on impulse therefore he set down the bulging portmanteau seated himself upon it and taking out pipe and tobacco waited for his pursuer to come up Oh Uncle Porges panted a voice you did walk so awful fast an I called an called but you never heard An now please where are you going Going said Bellew searching through his pockets for a match going my Porges why er for a stroll to be sure just a walk before breakfast you know But then why have you brought your bag Bag repeated Bellew stooping down to look at it why so I have Please why persisted Small Porges suddenly anxious Why did you bring it Well I expect it was to er to bear me company But how is it you are out so very early my Porges Why I couldn t sleep last night you know cause I kept on thinking and thinking bout the fortune So I got up in the middle of the night an dressed myself an sat in the big chair by the window an looked at the Money Moon An I stared at it an stared at it till a wonderful thing happened an what do you s pose I don t know Well all at once while I stared up at it the moon changed itself into a great big face but I didn t mind a bit cause it was a very nice sort of face rather like a gnome s face only without the beard you know An while I looked at it it talked to me an it told me a lot of things an that s how I know that you are going away cause you are you know aren t you Why my Porges said Bellew fumbling with his pipe why Shipmate I since you ask me I am Yes I was fraid the moon was right said Small Porges and turned away But Bellew had seen the stricken look in his eyes therefore he took Small Porges in the circle of his big arm and holding him thus explained to him how that in this great world each of us must walk his appointed way and that there must and always will be partings but that also there must and always shall be meetings And so my Porges if we have to say Good bye now the sooner we shall meet again some day somewhere But Small Porges only sighed and shook his head in hopeless dejection Does she know you re going I mean my Auntie Anthea Oh yes she knows Porges Then I s pose that s why she was crying so in the night Crying Yes she s cried an awful lot lately hasn t she Last night when I woke up you know an couldn t sleep I went into her room an she was crying with her face hidden in the pillow an her hair all about her Crying Yes an she said she wished she was dead So then a course I tried to comfort her you know An she said I m a dreadful failure Georgy dear with the farm an everything else I ve tried to be a father and mother to you an I ve failed in that too so now I m going to give you a real father an she told me she was going to marry mister Cassilis But I said No cause I d ranged for her to marry you an live happy ever after But she got awful angry again an said she d never marry you if you were the last man in the world cause she spised you so And that would seem to settle it nodded Bellew gloomily so it s Good bye my Porges We may as well shake hands now and get it over and Bellew rose from the portmanteau and sighing held out his hand Oh but wait a minute cried Small Porges eagerly I haven t told you what the Moon said to me last night Ah to be sure we were forgetting that said Bellew with an absent look and a trifle wearily Why then please sit down again so I can speak into your ear cause what the Moon told me to tell you was a secret you know So perforce Bellew re seated himself upon his portmanteau and drawing Small Porges close bent his head down to the anxious little face and so Small Porges told him exactly what the Moon had said And the Moon s message whatever it was seemed to be very short and concise as all really important messages should be but these few words had a wondrous and magical effect upon George Bellew For a moment he stared wide eyed at Small Porges like one awaking from a dream then the gloom vanished from his brow and he sprang to his feet And being upon his feet he smote his clenched fist down into the palm of his hand with a resounding smack By heaven he exclaimed and took a turn to and fro across the width of the lane and seeing Small Porges watching him caught him suddenly up in his arms and hugged him And the moon will be at the full tonight said he Thereafter he sat him down upon his portmanteau again with Small Porges upon his knee and they talked confidentially together with their heads very close together and in muffled tones When at last Bellew rose his eyes were bright and eager and his square chin prominent and grimly resolute So you quite understand my Porges Yes yes Oh I understand Where the little bridge spans the brook the trees are thicker there Aye aye Captain Then fare thee well Shipmate Goodbye my Porges and remember So they clasped hands very solemnly Big Porges and Small Porges and turned each his appointed way the one up the other down the lane But lo as they went Small Porges tears were banished quite and Bellew strode upon his way his head held high his shoulders squared like one in whom Hope has been newborn CHAPTER XXX How Anthea gave her promise And so he has really gone Miss Priscilla sighed as she spoke and looked up from her needle work to watch Anthea who sat biting her pen and frowning down at the blank sheet of paper before her And so he is really gone Who mister Bellew Oh yes He went very early Yes And without any breakfast That was his own fault said Anthea And without even saying Good bye Perhaps he was in a hurry Anthea suggested Oh dear me no my dear I don t believe mister Bellew was ever in a hurry in all his life No said Anthea giving her pen a vicious bite I don t believe he ever was he is always so hatefully placid and deliberate and here she bit her pen again Eh my dear exclaimed Miss Priscilla pausing with her needle in mid air did you say hatefully Yes Anthea I hate him Aunt Priscilla Eh My dear That was why I sent him away You sent him away Yes But Anthea why Oh Aunt Priscilla surely you never believed in the fortune Surely you guessed it was his money that paid back the mortgage didn t you Aunt didn t you Well my dear But then he did it so very tactfully and and I had hoped my dear that That I should marry him and settle the obligation that way perhaps Well yes my dear I did hope so Oh I m going to marry Then why did you send I m going to marry mister Cassilis whenever he pleases Anthea The word was a cry and her needle work slipped from Miss Priscilla s nerveless fingers He asked me to write and tell him if ever I changed my mind Oh my dear my dear cried Miss Priscilla reaching out imploring hands you never mean it you are all distraught to day tired and worn out with worry and loss of sleep wait Wait repeated Anthea bitterly for what To marry him O Anthea you never mean it Think think what you are doing I thought of it all last night Aunt Priscilla and all this morning and I have made up my mind You mean to write Yes To tell mister Cassilis that you will marry him Yes But now Miss Priscilla rose and next moment was kneeling beside Anthea s chair Oh my dear she pleaded you that I love like my own flesh and blood don t Oh Anthea don t do what can never be undone Don t give your youth and beauty to one who can never never make you happy Oh Anthea Dear Aunt Priscilla I would rather marry one I don t love than have to live beholden all my days to a man that I hate Now as she spoke though her embrace was as ready and her hands as gentle as ever yet Miss Priscilla saw that her proud face was set and stern So she presently rose sighing and taking her little crutch stick tapped dolefully away and left Anthea to write her letter And now hesitating no more Anthea took up her pen and wrote surely a very short missive for a love letter And when she had folded and sealed it she tossed it aside and laying her arms upon the table hid her face with a long shuddering sigh In a little while she rose and taking up the letter went out to find Adam but remembering that he had gone to Cranbrook with Small Porges she paused irresolute and then turned her steps toward the orchard Hearing voices she stopped again and glancing about espied the Sergeant and Miss Priscilla She had given both her hands into the Sergeant s one great solitary fist and he was looking down at her and she was looking up at him and upon the face of each was a great and shining joy And seeing all this Anthea felt herself very lonely all at once and turning aside saw all things through a blur of sudden tears She was possessed also of a sudden fierce loathing of the future a horror because of the promise her letter contained Nevertheless she was firm and resolute on her course because of the pride that burned within her So thus it was that as the Sergeant presently came striding along on his homeward way he was suddenly aware of Miss Anthea standing before him whereupon he halted and removing his hat wished her a good afternoon Sergeant said she will you do something for me Anything you ask me Miss Anthea mam ever and always I want you to take this letter to mister Cassilis will you The Sergeant hesitated unwontedly turning his hat about and about in his hand finally he put it on out of the way Will you Sergeant Since you ask me Miss Anthea mam I will Give it into his own hand Miss Anthea mam I will Thank you here it is Sergeant And so she turned and was gone leaving the Sergeant staring down at the letter in his hand and shaking his head over it Anthea walked on hastily never looking behind and so coming back to the house threw herself down by the open window and stared out with unseeing eyes at the roses nodding slumberous heads in the gentle breeze So the irrevocable step was taken She had given her promise to marry Cassilis whenever he would and must abide by it Too late now any hope of retreat she had deliberately chosen her course and must follow it to the end Begging your pardon Miss Anthea mam She started and glancing round espied Adam Oh you startled me Adam what is it Begging your pardon Miss Anthea but is it true as mister Belloo be gone away for good Yes Adam Why then all I can say is as I m sorry ah mortal sorry I be an my eart mam my eart likewise gloomy Were you so fond of him Adam Well Miss Anthea considering as he were the best good naturedest properest kind o gentleman as ever was when I tell you as over an above all this he could use his fists better than any man as ever I see him having knocked me into a dry ditch though to be sure I likewise drawed his claret begging your pardon I m sure Miss Anthea all of which happened on account o me finding him a sleeping in your ay mam when I tell you furthermore as he treated me ever as a man an wern t noways above shaking my and or smoking a pipe wi me sociable like when I tell you as he were the finest gentleman and properest man as ever I knowed or heard tell on why I think as the word fond be about the size of it Miss Anthea mam saying which Adam nodded several times and bestowed an emphatic backhanded knock to the crown of his hat You used to sit together very often under the big apple tree didn t you Adam Ah many an many a night Miss Anthea Did he ever tell you much of his life Adam Why yes Miss Anthea told me summat about his travels told me as he d shot lions an tigers away out in India an Africa Did he ever mention Well Miss Anthea said he enquiringly seeing she had paused Did he ever speak of the lady he is going to marry Lady repeated Adam giving a sudden twist to his hat Yes the lady who lives in London No Miss Anthea answered Adam screwing his hat tighter and tighter Why what do you mean I mean as there never was no lady Miss Anthea neither up to Lonnon nor nowhere s else as I ever heard on But oh Adam you told me Ah for sure I told ye but it were a lie Miss Anthea leastways it weren t the truth Ye see I were afraid as you d refuse to take the money for the furnitur unless I made ye believe as he wanted it uncommon bad So I up an told ye as he d bought it all on account o him being matrimonially took wi a young lady up to Lonnon And then you went to him and warned him told him of the story you had invented I did Miss Anthea at first I thought as he were going to up an give me one for myself but arterwards he took it very quiet an told me as I d done quite right an agreed to play the game An that s all about it an glad I am as it be off my mind at last Ah now Miss Anthea mam seeing you re that rich wi Master Georgy s fortun why you can pay back for the furnitur if so be you re minded to An I hope as you agree wi me as I done it all for the best Miss Anthea Here Adam unscrewed his hat and knocked out the wrinkles against his knee which done he glanced at Anthea Why what is it Miss Anthea Nothing Adam I haven t slept well lately that s all Ah well you ll be all right again now we all shall now the mortgage be paid off shan t we Miss Anthea Yes Adam We ad a great day over to Cranbrook Master Georgy an me he be in the kitchen now wi Prudence a eating of bread an jam Good night Miss Anthea mam if you should be wanting me again I shall be in the stables Good night Miss Anthea So honest well meaning Adam touched his forehead with a square ended finger and trudged away But Anthea sat there very still with drooping head and vacant eyes And so it was done the irrevocable step had been taken she had given her promise So now having chosen her course she must follow it to the end For in Arcadia it would seem that a promise is still a sacred thing Now in a while lifting her eyes they encountered those of the smiling Cavalier above the mantel Then as she looked she stretched out her arms with a sudden yearning gesture Oh she whispered if I were only just a picture like you CHAPTER XXXI Which being the last is very properly the longest in the book In those benighted days when men went abroad cased in steel and upon very slight provocation were wont to smite each other with axes and clubs to buffet and skewer each other with spears lances swords and divers other barbarous engines yet in that dark and doughty age ignorant though they were of all those smug maxims and excellent moralities with which we are so happily blessed even in that unhallowed day when the solemn tread of the policeman s foot was all unknown they had evolved for themselves a code of rules whereby to govern their life and conduct Amongst these it was tacitly agreed upon and understood that a spoken promise was a pledge and held to be a very sacred thing and he who broke faith committed all the cardinal sins Indeed their laws were very few and simple easily understood and well calculated to govern man s conduct to his fellow In this day of ours ablaze with learning and culture veneered with a fine civilization our laws are complex beyond all knowing and expression man regulates his conduct to them and is as virtuous and honest as the law compels him to be This is the age of Money and therefore an irreverent age it is also the age of Respectability with a very large R and the policeman s bludgeon But in Arcadia because it is an old world place where life follows an even simple course where money is as scarce as roguery the old law still holds a promise once given is a sacred obligation and not to be set aside Even the Black bird who lived in the inquisitive apple tree understood and was aware of this it had been born in him and had grown with his feathers Therefore though to be sure he had spoken no promise signed no bond nor affixed his mark to any agreement still he had nevertheless borne in mind a certain request preferred to him when the day was very young Thus with a constancy of purpose worthy of all imitation he had given all his mind and thought to the composition of a song with a new theme He had applied himself to it most industriously all day long and now as the sun began to set he had at last corked it all out every note every quaver and trill and perched upon a look out branch he kept his bold bright eye turned toward a certain rustic seat hard by uttering a melodious note or two every now and then from pure impatience And presently sure enough he spied her for whom he waited the tall long limbed supple waisted creature whose skin was pink and gold like the peaches and apricots in the garden and with soft little rings of hair that would have made such an excellent lining to a nest From this strictly utilitarian point of view he had often admired her hair had this Black bird fellow as she passed to and fro among her flowers or paused to look up at him and listen to his song or even sometimes to speak to him in her sweet low voice But to day she seemed to have forgotten him altogether she did not even glance his way indeed she walked with bent head and seemed to keep her eyes always upon the ground Therefore the black bird hopped a little further along the branch and peered over to look down at her with first one round eye and then the other as she sank upon the seat near by and leaned her head wearily against the great tree behind And thus he saw upon the pint and gold of her cheek something that shone and twinkled like a drop of dew If the Black bird wondered at this and was inclined to be curious he sturdily repressed the weakness for here was the audience seated and waiting all expectation for him to begin So without more ado he settled himself upon the bough lifted his head stretched his throat and from his yellow bill poured forth a flood of golden melody as he burst forth into his Song of Memory And what a song it was so full of passionate entreaty of tender pleading of haunting sweetness that as she listened the bright drop quivering upon her lashes fell and was succeeded by another and another Nor did she attempt to check them or wipe them away only she sat and listened with her heavy head pillowed against the great tree while the Blackbird glancing down at her every now and then with critical eye to mark the effect of some particularly difficult passage piped surely as he had never done before until the listener s proud face sank lower and lower and was at last hidden in her hands Seeing which the Black bird like the true artist he was fearing an anti climax very presently ended his song with a long drawn plaintive note But Anthea sat there with her proud head bowed low long after he had retired for the night And the sun went down and the shadows came creeping stealthily about her and the moon began to rise big and yellow over the up land but Anthea still sat there with her head once more resting wearily against King Arthur watching the deepening shadows until she was roused by Small Porges hand upon hers and his voice saying Why I do believe you re crying Auntie Anthea an why are you here all alone an by yourself I was listening to the Black bird dear I never heard him sing quite so beautifully before But black birds don t make people cry an I know you ve been crying cause you sound all quivery you know Do I Georgy Yes is it cause you feel lonely Yes dear You ve cried an awful lot lately Auntie Anthea Have I dear Yes an it worries me you know I m afraid I ve been a great responsibility to you Georgy dear said she with a rueful little laugh Fraid you have but I don mind the sponsibility I ll always take care of you you know nodded Small Porges sitting down the better to get his arm protectingly about her while Anthea stooped to kiss the top of his curly head I promised my Uncle Porges I d always take care of you an so I will Yes dear Uncle Porges told me Never mind dear don let s talk of him Do you still hate him then Auntie Anthea Hush dear it s very wrong to hate people Yes a course it is Then perhaps if you don t hate him any more you like him a bit jest a teeny bit you know Why there s the clock striking half past eight Georgy Yes I hear it but do you the teeniest bit Oh can t you like him jest a bit for my sake Auntie Anthea I m always trying to please you an I found you the fortune you know so now I want you to please me an tell me you like him for my sake But Oh Georgy dear you don t understand cause you see Small Porges continued after all I found him for you under a hedge you know Ah why did you Georgy dear We were so happy before he came But you couldn t have been you know you weren t married even then so you couldn t have been really happy you know said Small Porges shaking his head Why Georgy what do you mean Well Uncle Porges told me that nobody can live happy ever after unless they re married first So that was why I ranged for him to marry you so you could both be happy an all revelry an joy like the fairy tale you know But you see we aren t in a fairy tale dear so I m afraid we must make the best of things as they are and here she sighed again and rose Come Georgy it s much later than I thought and quite time you were in bed dear All right Auntie Anthea only don t you think it s jest a bit cruel to send a boy to bed so very early an when the moon s so big an everything looks so frightfully fine sides Well what now she asked a little wearily as obedient to his pleading gesture she sat down again Why you haven t answered my question yet you know What question said she not looking at him Bout my Uncle Porges But Georgy I You do like him jest a bit don t you please Small Porges was standing before her as he waited for her answer but now seeing how she hesitated and avoided his eyes he put one small hand beneath the dimple in her chin so that she was forced to look at him You do please don t you he pleaded Anthea hesitated but after all He was gone and nobody could hear and Small Porges was so very small and who could resist the entreaty in his big wistful eyes surely not Anthea Therefore with a sudden gesture of abandonment she leaned forward in his embrace and rested her weary head against his manly small shoulder Yes she whispered Jest as much as you like mister Cassilis he whispered back Yes A bit more jest a teeny bit more Yes A lot more lots an lots oceans more Yes The word was spoken and having uttered it Anthea grew suddenly hot with shame and mightily angry with herself and would straightway have given the world to have it unsaid the more so as she felt Small Porges clasp tighten joyfully and looking up fancied she read something like triumph in his look She drew away from him rather hastily and rose to her feet Come said she speaking now in a vastly different tone it must be getting very late Yes I s pecks it ll soon be nine o clock now he nodded Then you ought to be in bed fast asleep instead of talking such nonsense out here So come along at once sir But can t I stay up jest a little while You see No You see it s such a magnif cent night It feels as though things might happen Don t be so silly Well but it does you know What do you mean what things Well it feels gnomy to me I s pecks there s lots of elves about hidden in the shadows you know an peeping at us There aren t any elves or gnomes said Anthea petulantly for she was still furiously angry with herself But my Uncle Porges told me Oh cried Anthea stamping her foot suddenly can t you talk of anyone or anything but him I m tired to death of him and his very name But I thought you liked him an awful lot an Well I don t But you said Never mind what I said It s time you were in bed asleep so come along at once sir So they went on through the orchard together very silently for Small Porges was inclined to be indignant but much more inclined to be hurt Thus they had not gone so very far when he spoke in a voice that he would have described as quivery Don t you think that you re just the teeniest bit cruel to me Auntie Anthea he enquired wistfully after I prayed an prayed till I found a fortune for you don t you please Surely Anthea was a creature of moods to night for even while he spoke she stopped and turned and fell on her knees and caught him in her arms kissing him many times Yes yes dear I m hateful to you horrid to you But I don t mean to be There forgive me Oh it s all right again now Auntie Anthea thank you I only thought you were jest a bit hard cause it is such a magnif cent night isn t it Yes dear and perhaps there are gnomes and pixies about Anyhow we can pretend there are if you like as we used to Oh will you that would be fine Then please may I go with you as far as the brook We ll wander you know I ve never wandered with you in the moonlight an I do love to hear the brook talking to itself so will you wander jest this once Well said Anthea hesitating it s very late Nearly nine o clock yes But Oh please don t forget that I found a fortune for you Very well she smiled just this once Now as they went together hand in hand through the moonlight Small Porges talked very fast and very much at random while his eyes bright and eager glanced expectantly towards every patch of shadow doubtless in search of gnomes and pixies But Anthea saw nothing of this heard nothing of the suppressed excitement in his voice for she was thinking that by now mister Cassilis had read her letter that he might even then be on his way to Dapplemere She even fancied once or twice that she could hear the gallop of his horse s hoofs And when he came he would want to kiss her Why do you shiver so Auntie Anthea are you cold No dear Well then why are you so quiet to me I ve asked you a question three times Have you dear I I was thinking what was the question I was asking you if you would be awful frightened s posing we did find a pixie or a gnome in the shadows an would you be so very awfully frightened if a gnome a great big one you know came jumping out an ran off with you should you No said Anthea with another shiver No dear I think I should be rather glad of it Should you Auntie I m so awful glad you wouldn t be frightened A course I don t s pose there are gnomes I mean great big ones really you know but there might be on a magnif cent night like this If you shiver again Auntie you ll have to take my coat I thought I heard a horse galloping hush They had reached the stile by now the stile with the crooked lurking nail and she leaned there a while to listen I m sure I heard something away there on the road I don t said Small Porges stoutly so take my hand please an let me sist you over the stile So they crossed the stile and presently came to the brook that was the most impertinent brook in the world And here upon the little rustic bridge they stopped to look down at the sparkle of the water and to listen to its merry voice Yes indeed to night it was as impertinent as ever laughing and chuckling to itself among the hollows and whispering scandalously in the shadows It seemed to Anthea that it was laughing at her mocking and taunting her with the future And now amid the laughter were sobs and tearful murmurs and now again it seemed to be the prophetic voice of old Nannie By force ye shall be wooed and by force ye shall be wed and there is no man strong enough to do it but him as bears the Tiger Mark upon him The Tiger Mark Alas how very far from the truth were poor old Nannie s dreams after all the dreams which Anthea had very nearly believed in once or twice How foolish it had all been And yet even now Anthea had been leaning over the gurgling waters while all this passed through her mind but now she started at the sound of a heavy foot fall on the planking of the bridge behind her and in that same instant she was encircled by a powerful arm caught up in a strong embrace swung from her feet and borne away through the shadows of the little copse It was very dark in the wood but she knew instinctively whose arms these were that held her so close and carried her so easily away through the shadows of the wood away from the haunting hopeless dread of the future from which there had seemed no chance or hope of escape And knowing all this she made no struggle and uttered no word And now the trees thinned out and from under her lashes she saw the face above her the thick black brows drawn together the close set of the lips the grim prominence of the strong square chin And now they were in the road and now he had lifted her into an automobile had sprung in beside her and they were off gliding swift and ever swifter under the shadows of the trees And still neither spoke nor looked at each other only she leaned away from him against the cushions while he kept his frowning eyes fixed upon the road a head and ever the great car flew onward faster and faster yet not so fast as the beating of her heart wherein shame and anger and fear and another feeling strove and fought for mastery But at last finding him so silent and impassive she must needs steal a look at him beneath her lashes He wore no hat and as she looked upon him with his yellow hair his length of limb and his massive shoulders he might have been some fierce Viking and she his captive taken by strength of arm borne away by force By force And hereupon as the car hummed over the smooth road it seemed to find a voice a subtle mocking voice very like the voice of the brook that murmured to her over and over again By force ye shall be wooed and by force ye shall be wed The very trees whispered it as they passed and her heart throbbed in time to it By force ye shall be wooed and by force ye shall be wed So she leaned as far from him as she might watching him with frightened eyes while he frowned ever upon the road in front and the car rocked and swayed with their going as they whirled onward through moonlight and through shadow faster and faster yet not so fast as the beating of her heart wherein was fear and shame and anger and another feeling but greatest of all now was fear Could this be the placid soft spoken gentleman she had known this man with the implacable eyes and the brutal jaw who neither spoke to nor looked at her but frowned always at the road in front And so the fear grew and grew within her fear of the man whom she knew and knew not at all She clasped her hands nervously together watching him with dilating eyes as the car slowed down for the road made a sudden turn hereabouts And still he neither looked at nor spoke to her and therefore because she could bear the silence no longer she spoke in a voice that sounded strangely faint and far away and that shook and trembled in spite of her Where are you taking me To be married he answered never looking at her You wouldn t dare Wait and see he nodded Oh but what do you mean The fear in her voice was more manifest than ever I mean that you are mine you always were you always must and shall be So I m going to marry you in about half an hour by special license Still he did not even glance towards her and she looked away over the country side all lonely and desolate under the moon I want you you see he went on I want you more than I ever wanted anything in this world I need you because without you my life will be utterly purposeless and empty So I have taken you because you are mine I know it Ah yes and deep down in your woman s heart you know it too And so I am going to marry you yes I am unless and here he brought the car to a standstill and turning looked at her for the first time And now before the look in his eyes her own wavered and fell lest he should read within them that which she would fain hide from him and which she knew they must reveal that which was neither shame nor anger nor fear but the other feeling for which she dared find no name And thus for a long moment there was silence At last she spoke though with her eyes still hidden Unless she repeated breathlessly Anthea look at me But Anthea only drooped her head the lower wherefore he leaned forward and even as Small Porges had done set his hand beneath the dimple in her chin and lifted the proud un willing face Anthea look at me And now what could Anthea do but obey Unless said he as her glance at last met his unless you can tell me now as your eyes look into mine that you love Cassilis Tell me that and I will take you back this very instant and never trouble you again But unless you do tell me that why then your Pride shall not blast two lives if I can help it Now speak But Anthea was silent also she would have turned aside from his searching look but that his arms were about her strong and compelling So needs must she suffer him to look down into her very heart for it seemed to her that in that moment he had rent away every stitch and shred of Pride s enfolding mantle and that he saw the truth at last But if he had he gave no sign only he turned and set the car humming upon its way once more On they went through the midsummer night up hill and down hill by cross road and bye lane until as they climbed a long ascent they beheld a tall figure standing upon the top of the hill in the attitude of one who waits and who spying them immediately raised a very stiff left arm whereupon this figure was joined by another Now as the car drew nearer Anthea with a thrill of pleasure recognized the Sergeant standing very much as though he were on parade and with honest faced Peterday beside him who stumped joyfully forward and with a bob of his head and a scrape of his wooden leg held out his hand to her Like one in a dream she took the sailor s hand to step from the car and like one in a dream she walked on between the soldier and the sailor who now reached out to her each a hand equally big and equally gentle to aid her up certain crumbling and time worn steps On they went together until they were come to a place of whispering echoes where lights burned few and dim And here still as one in a dream she spoke those words which gave her life henceforth into the keeping of him who stood beside her whose strong hand trembled as he set upon her finger that which is an emblem of eternity Like one in a dream she took the pen and signed her name obediently where they directed And yet could this really be herself this silent submissive creature And now they were out upon the moon lit road again seated in the car while Peterday his hat in his hand was speaking to her And yet was it to her missus Belloo mam he was saying on this here monumentous occasion Monumentous is the only word for it Peterday nodded the Sergeant On this here monumentous occasion missus Belloo the sailor proceeded my shipmate Dick and me mam respectfully beg the favour of saluting the bride missus Belloo by your leave here s health and happiness mam And hereupon the old sailor kissed her right heartily Which done he made way for the Sergeant who after a moment s hesitation followed suit A fair wind and prosperous cried Peterday flourishing his hat And God bless you both said the Sergeant as the car shot away So it was done the irrevocable step was taken Her life and future had passed for ever into the keeping of him who sat so silent beside her who neither spoke nor looked at her but frowned ever at the road before him On sped the car faster and faster yet not so fast as the beating of her heart wherein there was yet something of fear and shame but greatest of all was that other emotion and the name of it was Joy Now presently the car slowed down and he spoke to her though without turning his head And yet something in his voice thrilled through her strangely Look Anthea the moon is at the full to night Yes she answered And Happiness shall come riding astride the full moon he quoted Old Nannie is rather a wonderful old witch after all isn t she Yes And then there is our nephew my dear little Porges But for him Happiness would have been a stranger to me all my days Anthea He dreamed that the Money Moon spoke to him and but he shall tell you of that for himself But Anthea noticed that he spoke without once looking at her indeed it seemed that he avoided glancing towards her of set design and purpose and his deep voice quivered now and then in a way she had never heard before Therefore her heart throbbed the faster and she kept her gaze bent downward and thus chancing to see the shimmer of that which was upon her finger she blushed and hid it in a fold of her gown Anthea Yes You have no regrets have you No she whispered We shall soon be home now Yes And are you mine for ever and always Anthea you aren t afraid of me any more are you No Nor ever will be Nor ever will be Now as the car swept round a bend behold yet two other figures standing beside the way Yo ho Captain cried a voice Oh please heave to Uncle Porges And forth to meet them came Small Porges running Yet remembering Miss Priscilla tapping along behind him he must needs turn back to give her his hand like the kindly small gentleman that he was And now Miss Priscilla had Anthea in her arms and they were kissing each other and murmuring over each other as loving women will while Small Porges stared at the car and all things pertaining thereto more especially the glaring head lights with great wondering eyes At length having seen Anthea and Miss Priscilla safely stowed he clambered up beside Bellew and gave him the word to proceed What pen could describe his ecstatic delight as he sat there with one hand hooked into the pocket of Uncle Porges coat and with the cool night wind whistling through his curls So great was it indeed that Bellew was constrained to turn aside and make a wide detour purely for the sake of the radiant joy in Small Porges eager face When at last they came within sight of Dapplemere and the great machine crept up the rutted grassy lane Small Porges sighed and spoke Auntie Anthea said he are you sure that you are married nice an tight you know Yes dear she answered why yes Georgy But you don t look a bit diff rent you know either of you Are you quite sure cause I shouldn t like you to disappoint me after all Never fear my Porges said Bellew I made quite sure of it while I had the chance look As he spoke he took Anthea s left hand drawing it out into the moonlight so that Small Porges could see the shining ring upon her finger Oh said he nodding his head then that makes it all right I s pose An you aren t angry with me cause I let a great big gnome come an carry you off are you Auntie Anthea No dear Why then everything s quite magnif cent isn t it An now we re going to live happy ever after all of us an Uncle Porges is going to take us to sail the oceans in his ship he s got a ship that all belongs to his very own self you know Auntie Anthea so all will be revelry an joy just like the fairy tale after all And so at last they came to the door of the ancient House of Dapplemere Whereupon very suddenly Adam appeared bare armed from the stables who looking from Bellew s radiant face to Miss Anthea s shy eyes threw back his head vented his great laugh and was immediately solemn again Miss Anthea said he wringing and twisting at his hat or I think I should say missus Belloo mam there ain t no word for it least ways not as I know on nohow No words be strong enough to tell the J O Y j y mam as fills us one an all Here he waved his hand to where stood the comely Prudence with the two rosy cheeked maids peeping over her buxom shoulders Only pursued Adam I be glad ah mortal glad I be as tis you mister Belloo sir There ain t a man in all the world or as you might say uni verse as is so proper as you to be the husband to our Miss Anthea as was not nohow mister Belloo sir I wish you j y a j y as shall grow wi the years an abide wi you always both on ye That is a very excellent thought Adam said Bellew and I think I should like to shake hands on it Which they did forthwith An now missus Belloo mam Adam concluded wi your kind permission I ll step into the kitchen an drink a glass o Prue s ale to your ealth and appiness If I stay here any longer I won t say but what I shall burst out a singing in your very face mam for I do be that appy earted Lord With which exclamation Adam laughed again and turning about strode away to the kitchen with Prudence and the rosy cheeked maids laughing as he went Oh my dears said little Miss Priscilla I ve hoped for this prayed for it because I believe he is worthy of you Anthea and because you have both loved each other from the very beginning oh dear me yes you have And so my dears your happiness is my happiness and Oh goodness me here I stand talking sentimental nonsense while our Small Porges is simply dropping asleep as he stands Fraid I am a bit tired Small Porges admitted but it s been a magnif cent night An I think Uncle Porges when we sail away in your ship I think I d like to sail round the Horn first cause they say it s always blowing you know and I should love to hear it blow An now Good night Wait a minute my Porges just tell us what it was the Money Moon said to you last night will you Well said Small Porges shaking his head and smiling a slow sly smile I don t s pose we d better talk about it Uncle Porges cause you see it was such a very great secret an sides I m awful sleepy you know So saying he nodded slumberously kissed Anthea sleepily and giving Miss Priscilla his hand went drowsily into the house But as for Bellew it seemed to him that this was the hour for which he had lived all his life and though he spoke nothing of this thought yet Anthea knew it instinctively as she knew why he had avoided looking at her hitherto and what had caused the tremor in his voice despite his iron self control and therefore now that they were alone she spoke hurriedly and at random What did he Georgy mean by your ship Why I promised to take him a cruise in the yacht if you cared to come Anthea Yacht she repeated are you so dreadfully rich I m afraid we are he nodded but at least it has the advantage of being better than if we were dreadfully poor hasn t it Now in the midst of the garden there was an old sun dial worn by time and weather and it chanced that they came and leaned there side by side And looking down upon the dial Bellew saw certain characters graven thereon in the form of a poesy What does it say here Anthea he asked But Anthea shook her head That you must read for yourself she said not looking at him So he took her hand in his and with her slender finger spelled out this motto Time and youthe do flee awaie Love Oh Love then whiles ye may Anthea said he and again she heard the tremor in his voice you have been my wife nearly three quarters of an hour and all that time I haven t dared to look at you because if I had I must have kissed you and I meant to wait until your own good time But Anthea you have never yet told me that you love me Anthea She did not speak or move indeed she was so very still that he needs must bend down to see her face Then all at once her lashes were lifted her eyes looked up into his deep and dark with passionate tenderness Aunt Priscilla was quite right she said speaking in her low thrilling voice I have loved you from the very beginning I think And with a soft murmurous sigh she gave herself into his embrace Now far away across the meadow Adam was plodding his homeward way and as he trudged he sang to himself in a harsh but not unmusical voice and the words of his song were these When I am dead diddle diddle as well may hap You ll bury me diddle diddle under the tap Under the tap diddle diddle I ll tell you why That I may drink diddle diddle when I am dry THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW

addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no
