People Void of Feeling Need Not Read CHAPTER XXXIV Retribution CHAPTER XXXV Conclusion PREFACE FOR the perusal of the young and thoughtless of the fair sex this Tale of Truth is designed and I could wish my fair readers to consider it as not merely the effusion of Fancy but as a reality The circumstances on which I have founded this novel were related to me some little time since by an old lady who had personally known Charlotte though she concealed the real names of the characters and likewise the place where the unfortunate scenes were acted yet as it was impossible to offer a relation to the public in such an imperfect state I have thrown over the whole a slight veil of fiction and substituted names and places according to my own fancy The principal characters in this little tale are now consigned to the silent tomb it can therefore hurt the feelings of no one and may I flatter myself be of service to some who are so unfortunate as to have neither friends to advise or understanding to direct them through the various and unexpected evils that attend a young and unprotected woman in her first entrance into life While the tear of compassion still trembled in my eye for the fate of the unhappy Charlotte I may have children of my own said I to whom this recital may be of use and if to your own children said Benevolence why not to the many daughters of Misfortune who deprived of natural friends or spoilt by a mistaken education are thrown on an unfeeling world without the least power to defend themselves from the snares not only of the other sex but from the more dangerous arts of the profligate of their own Sensible as I am that a novel writer at a time when such a variety of works are ushered into the world under that name stands but a poor chance for fame in the annals of literature but conscious that I wrote with a mind anxious for the happiness of that sex whose morals and conduct have so powerful an influence on mankind in general and convinced that I have not wrote a line that conveys a wrong idea to the head or a corrupt wish to the heart I shall rest satisfied in the purity of my own intentions and if I merit not applause I feel that I dread not censure If the following tale should save one hapless fair one from the errors which ruined poor Charlotte or rescue from impending misery the heart of one anxious parent I shall feel a much higher gratification in reflecting on this trifling performance than could possibly result from the applause which might attend the most elegant finished piece of literature whose tendency might deprave the heart or mislead the understanding CHARLOTTE TEMPLE VOLUME I CHAPTER I A BOARDING SCHOOL ARE you for a walk said Montraville to his companion as they arose from table are you for a walk or shall we order the chaise and proceed to Portsmouth Belcour preferred the former and they sauntered out to view the town and to make remarks on the inhabitants as they returned from church Montraville was a Lieutenant in the army Belcour was his brother officer they had been to take leave of their friends previous to their departure for America and were now returning to Portsmouth where the troops waited orders for embarkation They had stopped at Chichester to dine and knowing they had sufficient time to reach the place of destination before dark and yet allow them a walk had resolved it being Sunday afternoon to take a survey of the Chichester ladies as they returned from their devotions They had gratified their curiosity and were preparing to return to the inn without honouring any of the belles with particular notice when Madame Du Pont at the head of her school descended from the church Such an assemblage of youth and innocence naturally attracted the young soldiers they stopped and as the little cavalcade passed almost involuntarily pulled off their hats A tall elegant girl looked at Montraville and blushed he instantly recollected the features of Charlotte Temple whom he had once seen and danced with at a ball at Portsmouth At that time he thought on her only as a very lovely child she being then only thirteen but the improvement two years had made in her person and the blush of recollection which suffused her cheeks as she passed awakened in his bosom new and pleasing ideas Vanity led him to think that pleasure at again beholding him might have occasioned the emotion he had witnessed and the same vanity led him to wish to see her again She is the sweetest girl in the world said he as he entered the inn Belcour stared Did you not notice her continued Montraville she had on a blue bonnet and with a pair of lovely eyes of the same colour has contrived to make me feel devilish odd about the heart Pho said Belcour a musket ball from our friends the Americans may in less than two months make you feel worse I never think of the future replied Montraville but am determined to make the most of the present and would willingly compound with any kind Familiar who would inform me who the girl is and how I might be likely to obtain an interview But no kind Familiar at that time appearing and the chaise which they had ordered driving up to the door Montraville and his companion were obliged to take leave of Chichester and its fair inhabitant and proceed on their journey But Charlotte had made too great an impression on his mind to be easily eradicated having therefore spent three whole days in thinking on her and in endeavouring to form some plan for seeing her he determined to set off for Chichester and trust to chance either to favour or frustrate his designs Arriving at the verge of the town he dismounted and sending the servant forward with the horses proceeded toward the place where in the midst of an extensive pleasure ground stood the mansion which contained the lovely Charlotte Temple Montraville leaned on a broken gate and looked earnestly at the house The wall which surrounded it was high and perhaps the Argus s who guarded the Hesperian fruit within were more watchful than those famed of old Tis a romantic attempt said he and should I even succeed in seeing and conversing with her it can be productive of no good I must of necessity leave England in a few days and probably may never return why then should I endeavour to engage the affections of this lovely girl only to leave her a prey to a thousand inquietudes of which at present she has no idea I will return to Portsmouth and think no more about her The evening now was closed a serene stillness reigned and the chaste Queen of Night with her silver crescent faintly illuminated the hemisphere The mind of Montraville was hushed into composure by the serenity of the surrounding objects I will think on her no more said he and turned with an intention to leave the place but as he turned he saw the gate which led to the pleasure grounds open and two women come out who walked arm in arm across the field I will at least see who these are said he He overtook them and giving them the compliments of the evening begged leave to see them into the more frequented parts of the town but how was he delighted when waiting for an answer he discovered under the concealment of a large bonnet the face of Charlotte Temple He soon found means to ingratiate himself with her companion who was a French teacher at the school and at parting slipped a letter he had purposely written into Charlotte s hand and five guineas into that of Mademoiselle who promised she would endeavour to bring her young charge into the field again the next evening CHAPTER II DOMESTIC CONCERNS mister Temple was the youngest son of a nobleman whose fortune was by no means adequate to the antiquity grandeur and I may add pride of the family He saw his elder brother made completely wretched by marrying a disagreeable woman whose fortune helped to prop the sinking dignity of the house and he beheld his sisters legally prostituted to old decrepid men whose titles gave them consequence in the eyes of the world and whose affluence rendered them splendidly miserable I will not sacrifice internal happiness for outward shew said he I will seek Content and if I find her in a cottage will embrace her with as much cordiality as I should if seated on a throne mister Temple possessed a small estate of about five hundred pounds a year and with that he resolved to preserve independence to marry where the feelings of his heart should direct him and to confine his expenses within the limits of his income He had a heart open to every generous feeling of humanity and a hand ready to dispense to those who wanted part of the blessings he enjoyed himself As he was universally known to be the friend of the unfortunate his advice and bounty was frequently solicited nor was it seldom that he sought out indigent merit and raised it from obscurity confining his own expenses within a very narrow compass You are a benevolent fellow said a young officer to him one day and I have a great mind to give you a fine subject to exercise the goodness of your heart upon You cannot oblige me more said Temple than to point out any way by which I can be serviceable to my fellow creatures Come along then said the young man we will go and visit a man who is not in so good a lodging as he deserves and were it not that he has an angel with him who comforts and supports him he must long since have sunk under his misfortunes The young man s heart was too full to proceed and Temple unwilling to irritate his feelings by making further enquiries followed him in silence til they arrived at the Fleet prison The officer enquired for Captain Eldridge a person led them up several pair of dirty stairs and pointing to a door which led to a miserable small apartment said that was the Captain s room and retired The officer whose name was Blakeney tapped at the door and was bid to enter by a voice melodiously soft He opened the door and discovered to Temple a scene which rivetted him to the spot with astonishment The apartment though small and bearing strong marks of poverty was neat in the extreme In an arm chair his head reclined upon his hand his eyes fixed on a book which lay open before him sat an aged man in a Lieutenant s uniform which though threadbare would sooner call a blush of shame into the face of those who could neglect real merit than cause the hectic of confusion to glow on the cheeks of him who wore it Beside him sat a lovely creature busied in painting a fan mount She was fair as the lily but sorrow had nipped the rose in her cheek before it was half blown Her eyes were blue and her hair which was light brown was slightly confined under a plain muslin cap tied round with a black ribbon a white linen gown and plain lawn handkerchief composed the remainder of her dress and in this simple attire she was more irresistibly charming to such a heart as Temple s than she would have been if adorned with all the splendor of a courtly belle When they entered the old man arose from his seat and shaking Blakeney by the hand with great cordiality offered Temple his chair and there being but three in the room seated himself on the side of his little bed with evident composure This is a strange place said he to Temple to receive visitors of distinction in but we must fit our feelings to our station While I am not ashamed to own the cause which brought me here why should I blush at my situation Our misfortunes are not our faults and were it not for that poor girl Here the philosopher was lost in the father He rose hastily from his seat and walking toward the window wiped off a tear which he was afraid would tarnish the cheek of a sailor Temple cast his eye on Miss Eldridge a pellucid drop had stolen from her eyes and fallen upon a rose she was painting It blotted and discoloured the flower Tis emblematic said he mentally the rose of youth and health soon fades when watered by the tear of affliction My friend Blakeney said he addressing the old man told me I could be of service to you be so kind then dear Sir as to point out some way in which I can relieve the anxiety of your heart and increase the pleasures of my own My good young man said Eldridge you know not what you offer While deprived of my liberty I cannot be free from anxiety on my own account but that is a trifling concern my anxious thoughts extend to one more dear a thousand times than life I am a poor weak old man and must expect in a few years to sink into silence and oblivion but when I am gone who will protect that fair bud of innocence from the blasts of adversity or from the cruel hand of insult and dishonour Oh my father cried Miss Eldridge tenderly taking his hand be not anxious on that account for daily are my prayers offered to heaven that our lives may terminate at the same instant and one grave receive us both for why should I live when deprived of my only friend Temple was moved even to tears You will both live many years said he and I hope see much happiness Cheerly my friend cheerly these passing clouds of adversity will serve only to make the sunshine of prosperity more pleasing But we are losing time you might ere this have told me who were your creditors what were their demands and other particulars necessary to your liberation My story is short said mister Eldridge but there are some particulars which will wring my heart barely to remember yet to one whose offers of friendship appear so open and disinterested I will relate every circumstance that led to my present painful situation But my child continued he addressing his daughter let me prevail on you to take this opportunity while my friends are with me to enjoy the benefit of air and exercise Go my love leave me now to morrow at your usual hour I will expect you Miss Eldridge impressed on his cheek the kiss of filial affection and obeyed CHAPTER III UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNES MY life said mister Eldridge till within these few years was marked by no particular circumstance deserving notice I early embraced the life of a sailor and have served my King with unremitted ardour for many years At the age of twenty five I married an amiable woman one son and the girl who just now left us were the fruits of our union My boy had genius and spirit I straitened my little income to give him a liberal education but the rapid progress he made in his studies amply compensated for the inconvenience At the academy where he received his education he commenced an acquaintance with a mister Lewis a young man of affluent fortune as they grew up their intimacy ripened into friendship and they became almost inseparable companions George chose the profession of a soldier I had neither friends or money to procure him a commission and had wished him to embrace a nautical life but this was repugnant to his wishes and I ceased to urge him on the subject The friendship subsisting between Lewis and my son was of such a nature as gave him free access to our family and so specious was his manner that we hesitated not to state to him all our little difficulties in regard to George s future views He listened to us with attention and offered to advance any sum necessary for his first setting out I embraced the offer and gave him my note for the payment of it but he would not suffer me to mention any stipulated time as he said I might do it whenever most convenient to myself About this time my dear Lucy returned from school and I soon began to imagine Lewis looked at her with eyes of affection I gave my child a caution to beware of him and to look on her mother as her friend She was unaffectedly artless and when as I suspected Lewis made professions of love she confided in her parents and assured us her heart was perfectly unbiassed in his favour and she would cheerfully submit to our direction I took an early opportunity of questioning him concerning his intentions towards my child he gave an equivocal answer and I forbade him the house The next day he sent and demanded payment of his money It was not in my power to comply with the demand I requested three days to endeavour to raise it determining in that time to mortgage my half pay and live on a small annuity which my wife possessed rather than be under an obligation to so worthless a man but this short time was not allowed me for that evening as I was sitting down to supper unsuspicious of danger an officer entered and tore me from the embraces of my family My wife had been for some time in a declining state of health ruin at once so unexpected and inevitable was a stroke she was not prepared to bear and I saw her faint into the arms of our servant as I left my own habitation for the comfortless walls of a prison My poor Lucy distracted with her fears for us both sunk on the floor and endeavoured to detain me by her feeble efforts but in vain they forced open her arms she shrieked and fell prostrate But pardon me The horrors of that night unman me I cannot proceed He rose from his seat and walked several times across the room at length attaining more composure he cried What a mere infant I am Why Sir I never felt thus in the day of battle No said Temple but the truly brave soul is tremblingly alive to the feelings of humanity True replied the old man something like satisfaction darting across his features and painful as these feelings are I would not exchange them for that torpor which the stoic mistakes for philosophy How many exquisite delights should I have passed by unnoticed but for these keen sensations this quick sense of happiness or misery Then let us my friend take the cup of life as it is presented to us tempered by the hand of a wise Providence be thankful for the good be patient under the evil and presume not to enquire why the latter predominates This is true philosophy said Temple Tis the only way to reconcile ourselves to the cross events of life replied he But I forget myself I will not longer intrude on your patience but proceed in my melancholy tale The very evening that I was taken to prison my son arrived from Ireland where he had been some time with his regiment From the distracted expressions of his mother and sister he learnt by whom I had been arrested and late as it was flew on the wings of wounded affection to the house of his false friend and earnestly enquired the cause of this cruel conduct With all the calmness of a cool deliberate villain he avowed his passion for Lucy declared her situation in life would not permit him to marry her but offered to release me immediately and make any settlement on her if George would persuade her to live as he impiously termed it a life of honour Fired at the insult offered to a man and a soldier my boy struck the villain and a challenge ensued He then went to a coffee house in the neighbourhood and wrote a long affectionate letter to me blaming himself severely for having introduced Lewis into the family or permitted him to confer an obligation which had brought inevitable ruin on us all He begged me whatever might be the event of the ensuing morning not to suffer regret or unavailing sorrow for his fate to increase the anguish of my heart which he greatly feared was already insupportable This letter was delivered to me early in the morning It would be vain to attempt describing my feelings on the perusal of it suffice it to say that a merciful Providence interposed and I was for three weeks insensible to miseries almost beyond the strength of human nature to support A fever and strong delirium seized me and my life was despaired of At length nature overpowered with fatigue gave way to the salutary power of rest and a quiet slumber of some hours restored me to reason though the extreme weakness of my frame prevented my feeling my distress so acutely as I otherways should The first object that struck me on awaking was Lucy sitting by my bedside her pale countenance and sable dress prevented my enquiries for poor George for the letter I had received from him was the first thing that occurred to my memory By degrees the rest returned I recollected being arrested but could no ways account for being in this apartment whither they had conveyed me during my illness I was so weak as to be almost unable to speak I pressed Lucy s hand and looked earnestly round the apartment in search of another dear object Where is your mother said I faintly The poor girl could not answer she shook her head in expressive silence and throwing herself on the bed folded her arms about me and burst into tears What both gone said I Both she replied endeavouring to restrain her emotions but they are happy no doubt Here mister Eldridge paused the recollection of the scene was too painful to permit him to proceed CHAPTER IV CHANGE OF FORTUNE IT was some days continued mister Eldridge recovering himself before I could venture to enquire the particulars of what had happened during my illness at length I assumed courage to ask my dear girl how long her mother and brother had been dead she told me that the morning after my arrest George came home early to enquire after his mother s health staid with them but a few minutes seemed greatly agitated at parting but gave them strict charge to keep up their spirits and hope every thing would turn out for the best In about two hours after as they were sitting at breakfast and endeavouring to strike out some plan to attain my liberty they heard a loud rap at the door which Lucy running to open she met the bleeding body of her brother borne in by two men who had lifted him from a litter on which they had brought him from the place where he fought Her poor mother weakened by illness and the struggles of the preceding night was not able to support this shock gasping for breath her looks wild and haggard she reached the apartment where they had carried her dying son She knelt by the bed side and taking his cold hand my poor boy said she I will not be parted from thee husband son both at once lost Father of mercies spare me She fell into a strong convulsion and expired in about two hours In the mean time a surgeon had dressed George s wounds but they were in such a situation as to bar the smallest hopes of recovery He never was sensible from the time he was brought home and died that evening in the arms of his sister Late as it was when this event took place my affectionate Lucy insisted on coming to me What must he feel said she at our apparent neglect and how shall I inform him of the afflictions with which it has pleased heaven to visit us She left the care of the dear departed ones to some neighbours who had kindly come in to comfort and assist her and on entering the house where I was confined found me in the situation I have mentioned How she supported herself in these trying moments I know not heaven no doubt was with her and her anxiety to preserve the life of one parent in some measure abated her affliction for the loss of the other My circumstances were greatly embarrassed my acquaintance few and those few utterly unable to assist me When my wife and son were committed to their kindred earth my creditors seized my house and furniture which not being sufficient to discharge all their demands detainers were lodged against me No friend stepped forward to my relief from the grave of her mother my beloved Lucy followed an almost dying father to this melancholy place Here we have been nearly a year and a half My half pay I have given up to satisfy my creditors and my child supports me by her industry sometimes by fine needlework sometimes by painting She leaves me every night and goes to a lodging near the bridge but returns in the morning to cheer me with her smiles and bless me by her duteous affection A lady once offered her an asylum in her family but she would not leave me We are all the world to each other said she I thank God I have health and spirits to improve the talents with which nature has endowed me and I trust if I employ them in the support of a beloved parent I shall not be thought an unprofitable servant While he lives I pray for strength to pursue my employment and when it pleases heaven to take one of us may it give the survivor resignation to bear the separation as we ought till then I will never leave him But where is this inhuman persecutor said Temple He has been abroad ever since replied the old man but he has left orders with his lawyer never to give up the note till the utmost farthing is paid And how much is the amount of your debts in all said Temple Five hundred pounds he replied Temple started it was more than he expected But something must be done said he that sweet maid must not wear out her life in a prison I will see you again to morrow my friend said he shaking Eldridge s hand keep up your spirits light and shade are not more happily blended than are the pleasures and pains of life and the horrors of the one serve only to increase the splendor of the other You never lost a wife and son said Eldridge No replied he but I can feel for those that have Eldridge pressed his hand as they went toward the door and they parted in silence When they got without the walls of the prison Temple thanked his friend Blakeney for introducing him to so worthy a character and telling him he had a particular engagement in the city wished him a good evening And what is to be done for this distressed man said Temple as he walked up Ludgate Hill Would to heaven I had a fortune that would enable me instantly to discharge his debt what exquisite transport to see the expressive eyes of Lucy beaming at once with pleasure for her father s deliverance and gratitude for her deliverer but is not my fortune affluence continued he nay superfluous wealth when compared to the extreme indigence of Eldridge and what have I done to deserve ease and plenty while a brave worthy officer starves in a prison Three hundred a year is surely sufficient for all my wants and wishes at any rate Eldridge must be relieved When the heart has will the hands can soon find means to execute a good action Temple was a young man his feelings warm and impetuous unacquainted with the world his heart had not been rendered callous by being convinced of its fraud and hypocrisy He pitied their sufferings overlooked their faults thought every bosom as generous as his own and would cheerfully have divided his last guinea with an unfortunate fellow creature No wonder then that such a man without waiting a moment for the interference of Madam Prudence should resolve to raise money sufficient for the relief of Eldridge by mortgaging part of his fortune We will not enquire too minutely into the cause which might actuate him in this instance suffice it to say he immediately put the plan in execution and in three days from the time he first saw the unfortunate Lieutenant he had the superlative felicity of seeing him at liberty and receiving an ample reward in the tearful eye and half articulated thanks of the grateful Lucy And pray young man said his father to him one morning what are your designs in visiting thus constantly that old man and his daughter Temple was at a loss for a reply he had never asked himself the question he hesitated and his father continued It was not till within these few days that I heard in what manner your acquaintance first commenced and cannot suppose any thing but attachment to the daughter could carry you such imprudent lengths for the father it certainly must be her art that drew you in to mortgage part of your fortune Art Sir cried Temple eagerly Lucy Eldridge is as free from art as she is from every other error she is Everything that is amiable and lovely said his father interrupting him ironically no doubt in your opinion she is a pattern of excellence for all her sex to follow but come Sir pray tell me what are your designs towards this paragon I hope you do not intend to complete your folly by marrying her Were my fortune such as would support her according to her merit I don t know a woman more formed to insure happiness in the married state Then prithee my dear lad said his father since your rank and fortune are so much beneath what your PRINCESS might expect be so kind as to turn your eyes on Miss Weatherby who having only an estate of three thousand a year is more upon a level with you and whose father yesterday solicited the mighty honour of your alliance I shall leave you to consider on this offer and pray remember that your union with Miss Weatherby will put it in your power to be more liberally the friend of Lucy Eldridge The old gentleman walked in a stately manner out of the room and Temple stood almost petrified with astonishment contempt and rage CHAPTER V SUCH THINGS ARE MISS Weatherby was the only child of a wealthy man almost idolized by her parents flattered by her dependants and never contradicted even by those who called themselves her friends I cannot give a better description than by the following lines The lovely maid whose form and face Nature has deck d with ev ry grace But in whose breast no virtues glow Whose heart ne er felt another s woe Whose hand ne er smooth d the bed of pain Or eas d the captive s galling chain But like the tulip caught the eye Born just to be admir d and die When gone no one regrets its loss Or scarce remembers that it was Such was Miss Weatherby her form lovely as nature could make it but her mind uncultivated her heart unfeeling her passions impetuous and her brain almost turned with flattery dissipation and pleasure and such was the girl whom a partial grandfather left independent mistress of the fortune before mentioned She had seen Temple frequently and fancying she could never be happy without him nor once imagining he could refuse a girl of her beauty and fortune she prevailed on her fond father to offer the alliance to the old Earl of D mister Temple s father The Earl had received the offer courteously he thought it a great match for Henry and was too fashionable a man to suppose a wife could be any impediment to the friendship he professed for Eldridge and his daughter Unfortunately for Temple he thought quite otherwise the conversation he had just had with his father discovered to him the situation of his heart and he found that the most affluent fortune would bring no increase of happiness unless Lucy Eldridge shared it with him and the knowledge of the purity of her sentiments and the integrity of his own heart made him shudder at the idea his father had started of marrying a woman for no other reason than because the affluence of her fortune would enable him to injure her by maintaining in splendor the woman to whom his heart was devoted he therefore resolved to refuse Miss Weatherby and be the event what it might offer his heart and hand to Lucy Eldridge Full of this determination he fought his father declared his resolution and was commanded never more to appear in his presence Temple bowed his heart was too full to permit him to speak he left the house precipitately and hastened to relate the cause of his sorrows to his good old friend and his amiable daughter In the mean time the Earl vexed to the soul that such a fortune should be lost determined to offer himself a candidate for Miss Weatherby s favour What wonderful changes are wrought by that reigning power ambition the love sick girl when first she heard of Temple s refusal wept raved tore her hair and vowed to found a protestant nunnery with her fortune and by commencing abbess shut herself up from the sight of cruel ungrateful man for ever Her father was a man of the world he suffered this first transport to subside and then very deliberately unfolded to her the offers of the old Earl expatiated on the many benefits arising from an elevated title painted in glowing colours the surprise and vexation of Temple when he should see her figuring as a Countess and his mother in law and begged her to consider well before she made any rash vows The DISTRESSED fair one dried her tears listened patiently and at length declared she believed the surest method to revenge the slight put on her by the son would be to accept the father so said so done and in a few days she became the Countess D Temple heard the news with emotion he had lost his father s favour by avowing his passion for Lucy and he saw now there was no hope of regaining it but he shall not make me miserable said he Lucy and I have no ambitious notions we can live on three hundred a year for some little time till the mortgage is paid off and then we shall have sufficient not only for the comforts but many of the little elegancies of life We will purchase a little cottage my Lucy said he and thither with your reverend father we will retire we will forget there are such things as splendor profusion and dissipation we will have some cows and you shall be queen of the dairy in a morning while I look after my garden you shall take a basket on your arm and sally forth to feed your poultry and as they flutter round you in token of humble gratitude your father shall smoke his pipe in a woodbine alcove and viewing the serenity of your countenance feel such real pleasure dilate his own heart as shall make him forget he had ever been unhappy Lucy smiled and Temple saw it was a smile of approbation He sought and found a cottage suited to his taste thither attended by Love and Hymen the happy trio retired where during many years of uninterrupted felicity they cast not a wish beyond the little boundaries of their own tenement Plenty and her handmaid Prudence presided at their board Hospitality stood at their gate Peace smiled on each face Content reigned in each heart and Love and Health strewed roses on their pillows Such were the parents of Charlotte Temple who was the only pledge of their mutual love and who at the earnest entreaty of a particular friend was permitted to finish the education her mother had begun at Madame Du Pont s school where we first introduced her to the acquaintance of the reader CHAPTER VI AN INTRIGUING TEACHER MADAME Du Pont was a woman every way calculated to take the care of young ladies had that care entirely devolved on herself but it was impossible to attend the education of a numerous school without proper assistants and those assistants were not always the kind of people whose conversation and morals were exactly such as parents of delicacy and refinement would wish a daughter to copy Among the teachers at Madame Du Pont s school was Mademoiselle La Rue who added to a pleasing person and insinuating address a liberal education and the manners of a gentlewoman She was recommended to the school by a lady whose humanity overstepped the bounds of discretion for though she knew Miss La Rue had eloped from a convent with a young officer and on coming to England had lived with several different men in open defiance of all moral and religious duties yet finding her reduced to the most abject want and believing the penitence which she professed to be sincere she took her into her own family and from thence recommended her to Madame Du Pont as thinking the situation more suitable for a woman of her abilities But Mademoiselle possessed too much of the spirit of intrigue to remain long without adventures At church where she constantly appeared her person attracted the attention of a young man who was upon a visit at a gentleman s seat in the neighbourhood she had met him several times clandestinely and being invited to come out that evening and eat some fruit and pastry in a summer house belonging to the gentleman he was visiting and requested to bring some of the ladies with her Charlotte being her favourite was fixed on to accompany her The mind of youth eagerly catches at promised pleasure pure and innocent by nature it thinks not of the dangers lurking beneath those pleasures till too late to avoid them when Mademoiselle asked Charlotte to go with her she mentioned the gentleman as a relation and spoke in such high terms of the elegance of his gardens the sprightliness of his conversation and the liberality with which he ever entertained his guests that Charlotte thought only of the pleasure she should enjoy in the visit not on the imprudence of going without her governess s knowledge or of the danger to which she exposed herself in visiting the house of a gay young man of fashion Madame Du Pont was gone out for the evening and the rest of the ladies retired to rest when Charlotte and the teacher stole out at the back gate and in crossing the field were accosted by Montraville as mentioned in the first CHAPTER Charlotte was disappointed in the pleasure she had promised herself from this visit The levity of the gentlemen and the freedom of their conversation disgusted her She was astonished at the liberties Mademoiselle permitted them to take grew thoughtful and uneasy and heartily wished herself at home again in her own chamber Perhaps one cause of that wish might be an earnest desire to see the contents of the letter which had been put into her hand by Montraville Any reader who has the least knowledge of the world will easily imagine the letter was made up of encomiums on her beauty and vows of everlasting love and constancy nor will he be surprised that a heart open to every gentle generous sentiment should feel itself warmed by gratitude for a man who professed to feel so much for her nor is it improbable but her mind might revert to the agreeable person and martial appearance of Montraville In affairs of love a young heart is never in more danger than when attempted by a handsome young soldier A man of an indifferent appearance will when arrayed in a military habit shew to advantage but when beauty of person elegance of manner and an easy method of paying compliments are united to the scarlet coat smart cockade and military sash ah well a day for the poor girl who gazes on him she is in imminent danger but if she listens to him with pleasure tis all over with her and from that moment she has neither eyes nor ears for any other object Now my dear sober matron if a sober matron should deign to turn over these pages before she trusts them to the eye of a darling daughter let me intreat you not to put on a grave face and throw down the book in a passion and declare tis enough to turn the heads of half the girls in England I do solemnly protest my dear madam I mean no more by what I have here advanced than to ridicule those romantic girls who foolishly imagine a red coat and silver epaulet constitute the fine gentleman and should that fine gentleman make half a dozen fine speeches to them they will imagine themselves so much in love as to fancy it a meritorious action to jump out of a two pair of stairs window abandon their friends and trust entirely to the honour of a man who perhaps hardly knows the meaning of the word and if he does will be too much the modern man of refinement to practice it in their favour Gracious heaven when I think on the miseries that must rend the heart of a doating parent when he sees the darling of his age at first seduced from his protection and afterwards abandoned by the very wretch whose promises of love decoyed her from the paternal roof when he sees her poor and wretched her bosom tom between remorse for her crime and love for her vile betrayer when fancy paints to me the good old man stooping to raise the weeping penitent while every tear from her eye is numbered by drops from his bleeding heart my bosom glows with honest indignation and I wish for power to extirpate those monsters of seduction from the earth Oh my dear girls for to such only am I writing listen not to the voice of love unless sanctioned by paternal approbation be assured it is now past the days of romance no woman can be run away with contrary to her own inclination then kneel down each morning and request kind heaven to keep you free from temptation or should it please to suffer you to be tried pray for fortitude to resist the impulse of inclination when it runs counter to the precepts of religion and virtue CHAPTER VII NATURAL SENSE OF PROPRIETY INHERENT IN THE FEMALE BOSOM I CANNOT think we have done exactly right in going out this evening Mademoiselle said Charlotte seating herself when she entered her apartment nay I am sure it was not right for I expected to be very happy but was sadly disappointed It was your own fault then replied Mademoiselle for I am sure my cousin omitted nothing that could serve to render the evening agreeable True said Charlotte but I thought the gentlemen were very free in their manner I wonder you would suffer them to behave as they did Prithee don t be such a foolish little prude said the artful woman affecting anger I invited you to go in hopes it would divert you and be an agreeable change of scene however if your delicacy was hurt by the behaviour of the gentlemen you need not go again so there let it rest I do not intend to go again said Charlotte gravely taking off her bonnet and beginning to prepare for bed I am sure if Madame Du Pont knew we had been out to night she would be very angry and it is ten to one but she hears of it by some means or other Nay Miss said La Rue perhaps your mighty sense of propriety may lead you to tell her yourself and in order to avoid the censure you would incur should she hear of it by accident throw the blame on me but I confess I deserve it it will be a very kind return for that partiality which led me to prefer you before any of the rest of the ladies but perhaps it will give you pleasure continued she letting fall some hypocritical tears to see me deprived of bread and for an action which by the most rigid could only be esteemed an inadvertency lose my place and character and be driven again into the world where I have already suffered all the evils attendant on poverty This was touching Charlotte in the most vulnerable part she rose from her seat and taking Mademoiselle s hand You know my dear La Rue said she I love you too well to do anything that would injure you in my governess s opinion I am only sorry we went out this evening I don t believe it Charlotte said she assuming a little vivacity for if you had not gone out you would not have seen the gentleman who met us crossing the field and I rather think you were pleased with his conversation I had seen him once before replied Charlotte and thought him an agreeable man and you know one is always pleased to see a person with whom one has passed several cheerful hours But said she pausing and drawing the letter from her pocket while a gentle suffusion of vermillion tinged her neck and face he gave me this letter what shall I do with it Read it to be sure returned Mademoiselle I am afraid I ought not said Charlotte my mother has often told me I should never read a letter given me by a young man without first giving it to her Lord bless you my dear girl cried the teacher smiling have you a mind to be in leading strings all your life time Prithee open the letter read it and judge for yourself if you show it your mother the consequence will be you will be taken from school and a strict guard kept over you so you will stand no chance of ever seeing the smart young officer again I should not like to leave school yet replied Charlotte till I have attained a greater proficiency in my Italian and music But you can if you please Mademoiselle take the letter back to Montraville and tell him I wish him well but cannot with any propriety enter into a clandestine correspondence with him She laid the letter on the table and began to undress herself Well said La Rue I vow you are an unaccountable girl have you no curiosity to see the inside now for my part I could no more let a letter addressed to me lie unopened so long than I could work miracles he writes a good hand continued she turning the letter to look at the superscription Tis well enough said Charlotte drawing it towards her He is a genteel young fellow said La Rue carelessly folding up her apron at the same time but I think he is marked with the small pox Oh you are greatly mistaken said Charlotte eagerly he has a remarkable clear skin and fine complexion His eyes if I could judge by what I saw said La Rue are grey and want expression By no means replied Charlotte they are the most expressive eyes I ever saw Well child whether they are grey or black is of no consequence you have determined not to read his letter so it is likely you will never either see or hear from him again Charlotte took up the letter and Mademoiselle continued He is most probably going to America and if ever you should hear any account of him it may possibly be that he is killed and though he loved you ever so fervently though his last breath should be spent in a prayer for your happiness it can be nothing to you you can feel nothing for the fate of the man whose letters you will not open and whose sufferings you will not alleviate by permitting him to think you would remember him when absent and pray for his safety Charlotte still held the letter in her hand her heart swelled at the conclusion of Mademoiselle s speech and a tear dropped upon the wafer that closed it The wafer is not dry yet said she and sure there can be no great harm She hesitated La Rue was silent I may read it Mademoiselle and return it afterwards Certainly replied Mademoiselle At any rate I am determined not to answer it continued Charlotte as she opened the letter Here let me stop to make one remark and trust me my very heart aches while I write it but certain I am that when once a woman has stifled the sense of shame in her own bosom when once she has lost sight of the basis on which reputation honour every thing that should be dear to the female heart rests she grows hardened in guilt and will spare no pains to bring down innocence and beauty to the shocking level with herself and this proceeds from that diabolical spirit of envy which repines at seeing another in the full possession of that respect and esteem which she can no longer hope to enjoy Mademoiselle eyed the unsuspecting Charlotte as she perused the letter with a malignant pleasure She saw that the contents had awakened new emotions in her youthful bosom she encouraged her hopes calmed her fears and before they parted for the night it was determined that she should meet Montraville the ensuing evening CHAPTER VIII DOMESTIC PLEASURES PLANNED I THINK my dear said missus Temple laying her hand on her husband s arm as they were walking together in the garden I think next Wednesday is Charlotte s birth day now I have formed a little scheme in my own mind to give her an agreeable surprise and if you have no objection we will send for her home on that day Temple pressed his wife s hand in token of approbation and she proceeded You know the little alcove at the bottom of the garden of which Charlotte is so fond I have an inclination to deck this out in a fanciful manner and invite all her little friends to partake of a collation of fruit sweetmeats and other things suitable to the general taste of young guests and to make it more pleasing to Charlotte she shall be mistress of the feast and entertain her visitors in this alcove I know she will be delighted and to complete all they shall have some music and finish with a dance A very fine plan indeed said Temple smiling and you really suppose I will wink at your indulging the girl in this manner You will quite spoil her Lucy indeed you will She is the only child we have said missus Temple the whole tenderness of a mother adding animation to her fine countenance but it was withal tempered so sweetly with the meek affection and submissive duty of the wife that as s

none	none	expecting her husband s answer he gazed at her tenderly and found he was unable to refuse her request She is a good girl said Temple She is indeed replied the fond mother exultingly a grateful affectionate girl and I am sure will never lose sight of the duty she owes her parents If she does said he she must forget the example set her by the best of mothers missus Temple could not reply but the delightful sensation that dilated her heart sparkled in her intelligent eyes and heightened the vermillion on her cheeks Of all the pleasures of which the human mind is sensible there is none equal to that which warms and expands the bosom when listening to commendations bestowed on us by a beloved object and are conscious of having deserved them Ye giddy flutterers in the fantastic round of dissipation who eagerly seek pleasure in the lofty dome rich treat and midnight revel tell me ye thoughtless daughters of folly have ye ever found the phantom you have so long sought with such unremitted assiduity Has she not always eluded your grasp and when you have reached your hand to take the cup she extends to her deluded votaries have you not found the long expected draught strongly tinctured with the bitter dregs of disappointment I know you have I see it in the wan cheek sunk eye and air of chagrin which ever mark the children of dissipation Pleasure is a vain illusion she draws you on to a thousand follies errors and I may say vices and then leaves you to deplore your thoughtless credulity Look my dear friends at yonder lovely Virgin arrayed in a white robe devoid of ornament behold the meekness of her countenance the modesty of her gait her handmaids are Humility Filial Piety Conjugal Affection Industry and Benevolence her name is CONTENT she holds in her hand the cup of true felicity and when once you have formed an intimate acquaintance with these her attendants nay you must admit them as your bosom friends and chief counsellors then whatever may be your situation in life the meek eyed Virgin wig immediately take up her abode with you Is poverty your portion she will lighten your labours preside at your frugal board and watch your quiet slumbers Is your state mediocrity she will heighten every blessing you enjoy by informing you how grateful you should be to that bountiful Providence who might have placed you in the most abject situation and by teaching you to weigh your blessings against your deserts show you how much more you receive than you have a right to expect Are you possessed of affluence what an inexhaustible fund of happiness will she lay before you To relieve the distressed redress the injured in short to perform all the good works of peace and mercy Content my dear friends will blunt even the arrows of adversity so that they cannot materially harm you She will dwell in the humblest cottage she will attend you even to a prison Her parent is Religion her sisters Patience and Hope She will pass with you through life smoothing the rough paths and tread to earth those thorns which every one must meet with as they journey onward to the appointed goal She will soften the pains of sickness continue with you even in the cold gloomy hour of death and cheating you with the smiles of her heaven born sister Hope lead you triumphant to a blissful eternity I confess I have rambled strangely from my story but what of that if I have been so lucky as to find the road to happiness why should I be such a niggard as to omit so good an opportunity of pointing out the way to others The very basis of true peace of mind is a benevolent wish to see all the world as happy as one s Self and from my soul do I pity the selfish churl who remembering the little bickerings of anger envy and fifty other disagreeables to which frail mortality is subject would wish to revenge the affront which pride whispers him he has received For my own part I can safely declare there is not a human being in the universe whose prosperity I should not rejoice in and to whose happiness I would not contribute to the utmost limit of my power and may my offences be no more remembered in the day of general retribution than as from my soul I forgive every offence or injury received from a fellow creature Merciful heaven who would exchange the rapture of such a reflexion for all the gaudy tinsel which the world calls pleasure But to return Content dwelt in missus Temple s bosom and spread a charming animation over her countenance as her husband led her in to lay the plan she had formed for the celebration of Charlotte s birth day before mister Eldridge CHAPTER IX WE KNOW NOT WHAT A DAY MAY BRING FORTH VARIOUS were the sensations which agitated the mind of Charlotte during the day preceding the evening in which she was to meet Montraville Several times did she almost resolve to go to her governess show her the letter and be guided by her advice but Charlotte had taken one step in the ways of imprudence and when that is once done there are always innumerable obstacles to prevent the erring person returning to the path of rectitude yet these obstacles however forcible they may appear in general exist chiefly in imagination Charlotte feared the anger of her governess she loved her mother and the very idea of incurring her displeasure gave her the greatest uneasiness but there was a more forcible reason still remaining should she show the letter to Madame Du Pont she must confess the means by which it came into her possession and what would be the consequence Mademoiselle would be turned out of doors I must not be ungrateful said she La Rue is very kind to me besides I can when I see Montraville inform him of the impropriety of our continuing to see or correspond with each other and request him to come no more to Chichester However prudent Charlotte might be in these resolutions she certainly did not take a proper method to confirm herself in them Several times in the course of the day she indulged herself in reading over the letter and each time she read it the contents sunk deeper in her heart As evening drew near she caught herself frequently consulting her watch I wish this foolish meeting was over said she by way of apology to her own heart I wish it was over for when I have seen him and convinced him my resolution is not to be shaken I shall feel my mind much easier The appointed hour arrived Charlotte and Mademoiselle eluded the eye of vigilance and Montraville who had waited their coming with impatience received them with rapturous and unbounded acknowledgments for their condescension he had wisely brought Belcour with him to entertain Mademoiselle while he enjoyed an uninterrupted conversation with Charlotte Belcour was a man whose character might be comprised in a few words and as he will make some figure in the ensuing pages I shall here describe him He possessed a genteel fortune and had a liberal education dissipated thoughtless and capricious he paid little regard to the moral duties and less to religious ones eager in the pursuit of pleasure he minded not the miseries he inflicted on others provided his own wishes however extravagant were gratified Self darling self was the idol he worshipped and to that he would have sacrificed the interest and happiness of all mankind Such was the friend of Montraville will not the reader be ready to imagine that the man who could regard such a character must be actuated by the same feelings follow the same pursuits and be equally unworthy with the person to whom he thus gave his confidence But Montraville was a different character generous in his disposition liberal in his opinions and good natured almost to a fault yet eager and impetuous in the pursuit of a favorite object he staid not to reflect on the consequence which might follow the attainment of his wishes with a mind ever open to conviction had he been so fortunate as to possess a friend who would have pointed out the cruelty of endeavouring to gain the heart of an innocent artless girl when he knew it was utterly impossible for him to marry her and when the gratification of his passion would be unavoidable infamy and misery to her and a cause of never ceasing remorse to himself had these dreadful consequences been placed before him in a proper light the humanity of his nature would have urged him to give up the pursuit but Belcour was not this friend he rather encouraged the growing passion of Montraville and being pleased with the vivacity of Mademoiselle resolved to leave no argument untried which he thought might prevail on her to be the companion of their intended voyage and he made no doubt but her example added to the rhetoric of Montraville would persuade Charlotte to go with them Charlotte had when she went out to meet Montraville flattered herself that her resolution was not to be shaken and that conscious of the impropriety of her conduct in having a clandestine intercourse with a stranger she would never repeat the indiscretion But alas poor Charlotte she knew not the deceitfulness of her own heart or she would have avoided the trial of her stability Montraville was tender eloquent ardent and yet respectful Shall I not see you once more said he before I leave England will you not bless me by an assurance that when we are divided by a vast expanse of sea I shall not be forgotten Charlotte sighed Why that sigh my dear Charlotte could I flatter myself that a fear for my safety or a wish for my welfare occasioned it how happy would it make me I shall ever wish you well Montraville said she but we must meet no more Oh say not so my lovely girl reflect that when I leave my native land perhaps a few short weeks may terminate my existence the perils of the ocean the dangers of war I can hear no more said Charlotte in a tremulous voice I must leave you Say you will see me once again I dare not said she Only for one half hour to morrow evening tis my last request I shall never trouble you again Charlotte I know not what to say cried Charlotte struggling to draw her hands from him let me leave you now And you will come to morrow said Montraville Perhaps I may said she Adieu then I will live upon that hope till we meet again He kissed her hand She sighed an adieu and catching hold of Mademoiselle s arm hastily entered the garden gate CHAPTER X WHEN WE HAVE EXCITED CURIOSITY IT IS BUT AN ACT OF GOOD NATURE TO GRATIFY IT MONTRAVILLE was the youngest son of a gentleman of fortune whose family being numerous he was obliged to bring up his sons to genteel professions by the exercise of which they might hope to raise themselves into notice My daughters said he have been educated like gentlewomen and should I die before they are settled they must have some provision made to place them above the snares and temptations which vice ever holds out to the elegant accomplished female when oppressed by the frowns of poverty and the sting of dependance my boys with only moderate incomes when placed in the church at the bar or in the field may exert their talents make themselves friends and raise their fortunes on the basis of merit When Montraville chose the profession of arms his father presented him with a commission and made him a handsome provision for his private purse Now my boy said he go seek glory in the field of battle You have received from me all I shall ever have it in my power to bestow it is certain I have interest to gain you promotion but be assured that interest shall never be exerted unless by your future conduct you deserve it Remember therefore your success in life depends entirely on yourself There is one thing I think it my duty to caution you against the precipitancy with which young men frequently rush into matrimonial engagements and by their thoughtlessness draw many a deserving woman into scenes of poverty and distress A soldier has no business to think of a wife till his rank is such as to place him above the fear of bringing into the world a train of helpless innocents heirs only to penury and affliction If indeed a woman whose fortune is sufficient to preserve you in that state of independence I would teach you to prize should generously bestow herself on a young soldier whose chief hope of future prosperity depended on his success in the field if such a woman should offer every barrier is removed and I should rejoice in an union which would promise so much felicity But mark me boy if on the contrary you rush into a precipitate union with a girl of little or no fortune take the poor creature from a comfortable home and kind friends and plunge her into all the evils a narrow income and increasing family can inflict I will leave you to enjoy the blessed fruits of your rashness for by all that is sacred neither my interest or fortune shall ever be exerted in your favour I am serious continued he therefore imprint this conversation on your memory and let it influence your future conduct Your happiness will always be dear to me and I wish to warn you of a rock on which the peace of many an honest fellow has been wrecked for believe me the difficulties and dangers of the longest winter campaign are much easier to be borne than the pangs that would seize your heart when you beheld the woman of your choice the children of your affection involved in penury and distress and reflected that it was your own folly and precipitancy had been the prime cause of their sufferings As this conversation passed but a few hours before Montraville took leave of his father it was deeply impressed on his mind when therefore Belcour came with him to the place of assignation with Charlotte he directed him to enquire of the French woman what were Miss Temple s expectations in regard to fortune Mademoiselle informed him that though Charlotte s father possessed a genteel independence it was by no means probable that he could give his daughter more than a thousand pounds and in case she did not marry to his liking it was possible he might not give her a single SOUS nor did it appear the least likely that mister Temple would agree to her union with a young man on the point of embarking for the feat of war Montraville therefore concluded it was impossible he should ever marry Charlotte Temple and what end he proposed to himself by continuing the acquaintance he had commenced with her he did not at that moment give himself time to enquire CHAPTER XI CONFLICT OF LOVE AND DUTY ALMOST a week was now gone and Charlotte continued every evening to meet Montraville and in her heart every meeting was resolved to be the last but alas when Montraville at parting would earnestly intreat one more interview that treacherous heart betrayed her and forgetful of its resolution pleaded the cause of the enemy so powerfully that Charlotte was unable to resist Another and another meeting succeeded and so well did Montraville improve each opportunity that the heedless girl at length confessed no idea could be so painful to her as that of never seeing him again Then we will never be parted said he Ah Montraville replied Charlotte forcing a smile how can it be avoided My parents would never consent to our union and even could they be brought to approve it how should I bear to be separated from my kind my beloved mother Then you love your parents more than you do me Charlotte I hope I do said she blushing and looking down I hope my affection for them will ever keep me from infringing the laws of filial duty Well Charlotte said Montraville gravely and letting go her hand since that is the case I find I have deceived myself with fallacious hopes I had flattered my fond heart that I was dearer to Charlotte than any thing in the world beside I thought that you would for my sake have braved the dangers of the ocean that you would by your affection and smiles have softened the hardships of war and had it been my fate to fall that your tenderness would cheer the hour of death and smooth my passage to another world But farewel Charlotte I see you never loved me I shall now welcome the friendly ball that deprives me of the sense of my misery Oh stay unkind Montraville cried she catching hold of his arm as he pretended to leave her stay and to calm your fears I will here protest that was it not for the fear of giving pain to the best of parents and returning their kindness with ingratitude I would follow you through every danger and in studying to promote your happiness insure my own But I cannot break my mother s heart Montraville I must not bring the grey hairs of my doating grand father with sorrow to the grave or make my beloved father perhaps curse the hour that gave me birth She covered her face with her hands and burst into tears All these distressing scenes my dear Charlotte cried Montraville are merely the chimeras of a disturbed fancy Your parents might perhaps grieve at first but when they heard from your own hand that you was with a man of honour and that it was to insure your felicity by an union with him to which you feared they would never have given their assent that you left their protection they will be assured forgive an error which love alone occasioned and when we return from America receive you with open arms and tears of joy Belcour and Mademoiselle heard this last speech and conceiving it a proper time to throw in their advice and persuasions approached Charlotte and so well seconded the entreaties of Montraville that finding Mademoiselle intended going with Belcour and feeling her own treacherous heart too much inclined to accompany them the hapless Charlotte in an evil hour consented that the next evening they should bring a chaise to the end of the town and that she would leave her friends and throw herself entirely on the protection of Montraville But should you said she looking earnestly at him her eyes full of tears should you forgetful of your promises and repenting the engagements you here voluntarily enter into forsake and leave me on a foreign shore Judge not so meanly of me said he The moment we reach our place of destination Hymen shall sanctify our love and when I shall forget your goodness may heaven forget me Ah said Charlotte leaning on Mademoiselle s arm as they walked up the garden together I have forgot all that I ought to have remembered in consenting to this intended elopement You are a strange girl said Mademoiselle you never know your own mind two minutes at a time Just now you declared Montraville s happiness was what you prized most in the world and now I suppose you repent having insured that happiness by agreeing to accompany him abroad Indeed I do repent replied Charlotte from my soul but while discretion points out the impropriety of my conduct inclination urges me on to ruin Ruin fiddlestick said Mademoiselle am I not going with you and do I feel any of these qualms You do not renounce a tender father and mother said Charlotte But I hazard my dear reputation replied Mademoiselle bridling True replied Charlotte but you do not feel what I do She then bade her good night but sleep was a stranger to her eyes and the tear of anguish watered her pillow CHAPTER XII Nature s last best gift Creature in whom excell d whatever could To sight or thought be nam d Holy divine good amiable and sweet How thou art fall n WHEN Charlotte left her restless bed her languid eye and pale cheek discovered to Madame Du Pont the little repose she had tasted My dear child said the affectionate governess what is the cause of the languor so apparent in your frame Are you not well Yes my dear Madam very well replied Charlotte attempting to smile but I know not how it was I could not sleep last night and my spirits are depressed this morning Come cheer up my love said the governess I believe I have brought a cordial to revive them I have just received a letter from your good mama and here is one for yourself Charlotte hastily took the letter it contained these words As to morrow is the anniversary of the happy day that gave my beloved girl to the anxious wishes of a maternal heart I have requested your governess to let you come home and spend it with us and as I know you to be a good affectionate child and make it your study to improve in those branches of education which you know will give most pleasure to your delighted parents as a reward for your diligence and attention I have prepared an agreeable surprise for your reception Your grand father eager to embrace the darling of his aged heart will come in the chaise for you so hold yourself in readiness to attend him by nine o clock Your dear father joins in every tender wish for your health and future felicity which warms the heart of my dear Charlotte s affectionate mother L TEMPLE Gracious heaven cried Charlotte forgetting where she was and raising her streaming eyes as in earnest supplication Madame Du Pont was surprised Why these tears my love said she Why this seeming agitation I thought the letter would have rejoiced instead of distressing you It does rejoice me replied Charlotte endeavouring at composure but I was praying for merit to deserve the unremitted attentions of the best of parents You do right said Madame Du Pont to ask the assistance of heaven that you may continue to deserve their love Continue my dear Charlotte in the course you have ever pursued and you will insure at once their happiness and your own Oh cried Charlotte as her governess left her I have forfeited both for ever Yet let me reflect the irrevocable step is not yet taken it is not too late to recede from the brink of a precipice from which I can only behold the dark abyss of ruin shame and remorse She arose from her seat and flew to the apartment of La Rue Oh Mademoiselle said she I am snatched by a miracle from destruction This letter has saved me it has opened my eyes to the folly I was so near committing I will not go Mademoiselle I will not wound the hearts of those dear parents who make my happiness the whole study of their lives Well said Mademoiselle do as you please Miss but pray understand that my resolution is taken and it is not in your power to alter it I shall meet the gentlemen at the appointed hour and shall not be surprized at any outrage which Montraville may commit when he finds himself disappointed Indeed I should not be astonished was he to come immediately here and reproach you for your instability in the hearing of the whole school and what will be the consequence you will bear the odium of having formed the resolution of eloping and every girl of spirit will laugh at your want of fortitude to put it in execution while prudes and fools will load you with reproach and contempt You will have lost the confidence of your parents incurred their anger and the scoffs of the world and what fruit do you expect to reap from this piece of heroism for such no doubt you think it is you will have the pleasure to reflect that you have deceived the man who adores you and whom in your heart you prefer to all other men and that you are separated from him for ever This eloquent harangue was given with such volubility that Charlotte could not find an opportunity to interrupt her or to offer a single word till the whole was finished and then found her ideas so confused that she knew not what to say At length she determined that she would go with Mademoiselle to the place of assignation convince Montraville of the necessity of adhering to the resolution of remaining behind assure him of her affection and bid him adieu Charlotte formed this plan in her mind and exulted in the certainty of its success How shall I rejoice said she in this triumph of reason over inclination and when in the arms of my affectionate parents lift up my soul in gratitude to heaven as I look back on the dangers I have escaped The hour of assignation arrived Mademoiselle put what money and valuables she possessed in her pocket and advised Charlotte to do the same but she refused my resolution is fixed said she I will sacrifice love to duty Mademoiselle smiled internally and they proceeded softly down the back stairs and out of the garden gate Montraville and Belcour were ready to receive them Now said Montraville taking Charlotte in his arms you are mine for ever No said she withdrawing from his embrace I am come to take an everlasting farewel It would be useless to repeat the conversation that here ensued suffice it to say that Montraville used every argument that had formerly been successful Charlotte s resolution began to waver and he drew her almost imperceptibly towards the chaise I cannot go said she cease dear Montraville to persuade I must not religion duty forbid Cruel Charlotte said he if you disappoint my ardent hopes by all that is sacred this hand shall put a period to my existence I cannot will not live without you Alas my torn heart said Charlotte how shall I act Let me direct you said Montraville lifting her into the chaise Oh my dear forsaken parents cried Charlotte The chaise drove off She shrieked and fainted into the arms of her betrayer CHAPTER XIII CRUEL DISAPPOINTMENT WHAT pleasure cried mister Eldridge as he stepped into the chaise to go for his grand daughter what pleasure expands the heart of an old man when he beholds the progeny of a beloved child growing up in every virtue that adorned the minds of her parents I foolishly thought some few years since that every sense of joy was buried in the graves of my dear partner and my son but my Lucy by her filial affection soothed my soul to peace and this dear Charlotte has twined herself round my heart and opened such new scenes of delight to my view that I almost forget I have ever been unhappy When the chaise stopped he alighted with the alacrity of youth so much do the emotions of the soul influence the body It was half past eight o clock the ladies were assembled in the school room and Madame Du Pont was preparing to offer the morning sacrifice of prayer and praise when it was discovered that Mademoiselle and Charlotte were missing She is busy no doubt said the governess in preparing Charlotte for her little excursion but pleasure should never make us forget our duty to our Creator Go one of you and bid them both attend prayers The lady who went to summon them soon returned and informed the governess that the room was locked and that she had knocked repeatedly but obtained no answer Good heaven cried Madame Du Pont this is very strange and turning pale with terror she went hastily to the door and ordered it to be forced open The apartment instantly discovered that no person had been in it the preceding night the beds appearing as though just made The house was instantly a scene of confusion the garden the pleasure grounds were searched to no purpose every apartment rang with the names of Miss Temple and Mademoiselle but they were too distant to hear and every face wore the marks of disappointment mister Eldridge was sitting in the parlour eagerly expecting his grand daughter to descend ready equipped for her journey he heard the confusion that reigned in the house he heard the name of Charlotte frequently repeated What can be the matter said he rising and opening the door I fear some accident has befallen my dear girl The governess entered The visible agitation of her countenance discovered that something extraordinary had happened Where is Charlotte said he Why does not my child come to welcome her doating parent Be composed my dear Sir said Madame Du Pont do not frighten yourself unnecessarily She is not in the house at present but as Mademoiselle is undoubtedly with her she will speedily return in safety and I hope they will both be able to account for this unseasonable absence in such a manner as shall remove our present uneasiness Madam cried the old man with an angry look has my child been accustomed to go out without leave with no other company or protector than that French woman Pardon me Madam I mean no reflections on your country but I never did like Mademoiselle La Rue I think she was a very improper person to be entrusted with the care of such a girl as Charlotte Temple or to be suffered to take her from under your immediate protection You wrong me mister Eldridge replied she if you suppose I have ever permitted your grand daughter to go out unless with the other ladies I would to heaven I could form any probable conjecture concerning her absence this morning but it is a mystery which her return can alone unravel Servants were now dispatched to every place where there was the least hope of hearing any tidings of the fugitives but in vain Dreadful were the hours of horrid suspense which mister Eldridge passed till twelve o clock when that suspense was reduced to a shocking certainty and every spark of hope which till then they had indulged was in a moment extinguished mister Eldridge was preparing with a heavy heart to return to his anxiously expecting children when Madame Du Pont received the following note without either name or date Miss Temple is well and wishes to relieve the anxiety of her parents by letting them know she has voluntarily put herself under the protection of a man whose future study shall be to make her happy Pursuit is needless the measures taken to avoid discovery are too effectual to be eluded When she thinks her friends are reconciled to this precipitate step they may perhaps be informed of her place of residence Mademoiselle is with her As Madame Du Pont read these cruel lines she turned pale as ashes her limbs trembled and she was forced to call for a glass of water She loved Charlotte truly and when she reflected on the innocence and gentleness of her disposition she concluded that it must have been the advice and machinations of La Rue which led her to this imprudent action she recollected her agitation at the receipt of her mother s letter and saw in it the conflict of her mind Does that letter relate to Charlotte said mister Eldridge having waited some time in expectation of Madame Du Pont s speaking It does said she Charlotte is well but cannot return today Not return Madam where is she who will detain her from her fond expecting parents You distract me with these questions mister Eldridge Indeed I know not where she is or who has seduced her from her duty The whole truth now rushed at once upon mister Eldridge s mind She has eloped then said he My child is betrayed the darling the comfort of my aged heart is lost Oh would to heaven I had died but yesterday A violent gush of grief in some measure relieved him and after several vain attempts he at length assumed sufficient composure to read the note And how shall I return to my children said he how approach that mansion so late the habitation of peace Alas my dear Lucy how will you support these heart rending tidings or how shall I be enabled to console you who need so much consolation myself The old man returned to the chaise but the light step and cheerful countenance were no more sorrow filled his heart and guided his motions he seated himself in the chaise his venerable head reclined upon his bosom his hands were folded his eye fixed on vacancy and the large drops of sorrow rolled silently down his cheeks There was a mixture of anguish and resignation depicted in his countenance as if he would say henceforth who shall dare to boast his happiness or even in idea contemplate his treasure lest in the very moment his heart is exulting in its own felicity the object which constitutes that felicity should be torn from him CHAPTER XIV MATERNAL SORROW SLOW and heavy passed the time while the carriage was conveying mister Eldridge home and yet when he came in sight of the house he wished a longer reprieve from the dreadful task of informing mister and missus Temple of their daughter s elopement It is easy to judge the anxiety of these affectionate parents when they found the return of their father delayed so much beyond the expected time They were now met in the dining parlour and several of the young people who had been invited were already arrived Each different part of the company was employed in the same manner looking out at the windows which faced the road At length the long expected chaise appeared missus Temple ran out to receive and welcome her darling her young companions flocked round the door each one eager to give her joy on the return of her birth day The door of the chaise was opened Charlotte was not there Where is my child cried missus Temple in breathless agitation mister Eldridge could not answer he took hold of his daughter s hand and led her into the house and sinking on the first chair he came to burst into tears and sobbed aloud She is dead cried missus Temple Oh my dear Charlotte and clasping her hands in an agony of distress fell into strong hysterics mister Temple who had stood speechless with surprize and fear now ventured to enquire if indeed his Charlotte was no more mister Eldridge led him into another apartment and putting the fatal note into his hand cried Bear it like a Christian and turned from him endeavouring to suppress his own too visible emotions It would be vain to attempt describing what mister Temple felt whilst he hastily ran over the dreadful lines when he had finished the paper dropt from his unnerved hand Gracious heaven said he could Charlotte act thus Neither tear nor sigh escaped him and he sat the image of mute sorrow till roused from his stupor by the repeated shrieks of missus Temple He rose hastily and rushing into the apartment where she was folded his arms about her and saying Let us be patient my dear Lucy nature relieved his almost bursting heart by a friendly gush of tears Should any one presuming on his own philosophic temper look with an eye of contempt on the man who could indulge a woman s weakness let him remember that man was a father and he will then pity the misery which wrung those drops from a noble generous heart missus Temple beginning to be a little more composed but still imagining her child was dead her husband gently taking her hand cried You are mistaken my love Charlotte is not dead Then she is very ill else why did she not come But I will go to her the chaise is still at the door let me go instantly to the dear girl If I was ill she would fly to attend me to alleviate my sufferings and cheer me with her love Be calm my dearest Lucy and I will tell you all said mister Temple You must not go indeed you must not it will be of no use Temple said she assuming a look of firmness and composure tell me the truth I beseech you I cannot bear this dreadful suspense What misfortune has befallen my child Let me know the worst and I will endeavour to bear it as I ought Lucy replied mister Temple imagine your daughter alive and in no danger of death what misfortune would you then dread There is one misfortune which is worse than death But I know my child too well to suspect Be not too confident Lucy Oh heavens said she what horrid images do you start is it possible she should forget She has forgot us all my love she has preferred the love of a stranger to the affectionate protection of her friends Not eloped cried she eagerly mister Temple was silent You cannot contradict it said she I see my fate in those tearful eyes Oh Charlotte Charlotte how ill have you requited our tenderness But Father of Mercies continued she sinking on her knees and raising her streaming eyes and clasped hands to heaven this once vouchsafe to hear a fond a distracted mother s prayer Oh let thy bounteous Providence watch over and protect the dear thoughtless girl save her from the miseries which I fear will be her portion and oh of thine infinite mercy make her not a mother lest she should one day feel what I now suffer The last words faultered on her tongue and she fell fainting into the arms of her husband who had involuntarily dropped on his knees beside her A mother s anguish when disappointed in her tenderest hopes none but a mother can conceive Yet my dear young readers I would have you read this scene with attention and reflect that you may yourselves one day be mothers Oh my friends as you value your eternal happiness wound not by thoughtless ingratitude the peace of the mother who bore you remember the tenderness the care the unremitting anxiety with which she has attended to all your wants and wishes from earliest infancy to the present day behold the mild ray of affectionate applause that beams from her eye on the performance of your duty listen to her reproofs with silent attention they proceed from a heart anxious for your future felicity you must love her nature all powerful nature has planted the seeds of filial affection in your bosoms Then once more read over the sorrows of poor missus Temple and remember the mother whom you so dearly love and venerate will feel the same when you forgetful of the respect due to your maker and yourself forsake the paths of virtue for those of vice and folly CHAPTER XV EMBARKATION IT was with the utmost difficulty that the united efforts of Mademoiselle and Montraville could support Charlotte s spirits during their short ride from Chichester to Portsmouth where a boat waited to take them immediately on board the ship in which they were to embark for America As soon as she became tolerably composed she entreated pen and ink to write to her parents This she did in the most affecting artless manner entreating their pardon and blessing and describing the dreadful situation of her mind the conflict she suffered in endeavouring to conquer this unfortunate attachment and concluded with saying her only hope of future comfort consisted in the perhaps delusive idea she indulged of being once more folded in their protecting arms and hearing the words of peace and pardon from their lips The tears streamed incessantly while she was writing and she was frequently obliged to lay down her pen but when the task was completed and she had committed the letter to the care of Montraville to be sent to the post office she became more calm and indulging the delightful hope of soon receiving an answer that would seal her pardon she in some measure assumed her usual cheerfulness But Montraville knew too well the consequences that must unavoidably ensue should this letter reach mister Temple he therefore wisely resolved to walk on the deck tear it in pieces and commit the fragments to the care of Neptune who might or might not as it suited his convenience convey them on shore All Charlotte s hopes and wishes were now concentred in one namely that the fleet might be detained at Spithead till she could receive a letter from her friends but in this she was disappointed for the second morning after she went on board the signal was made the fleet weighed anchor and in a few hours the wind being favourable they bid adieu to the white cliffs of Al bion In the mean time every enquiry that could be thought of was made by mister and missus Temple for many days did they indulge the fond hope that she was merely gone off to be married and that when the indissoluble knot was once tied she would return with the partner she had chosen and entreat their blessing and forgiveness And shall we not forgive her said mister Temple Forgive her exclaimed the mother Oh yes whatever be our errors is she not our child and though bowed to the earth even with shame and remorse is it not our duty to raise the poor penitent and whisper peace and comfort to her desponding soul would she but return with rapture would I fold her to my heart and bury every remembrance of her faults in the dear embrace But still day after day passed on and Charlotte did not appear nor were any tidings to be heard of her yet each rising morning was welcomed by some new hope the evening brought with it disappointment At length hope was no more despair usurped her place and the mansion which was once the mansion of peace became the habitation of pale dejected melancholy The cheerful smile that was wont to adorn the face of missus Temple was fled and had it not been for the support of unaffected piety and a consciousness of having ever set before her child the fairest example she must have sunk under this heavy affliction Since said she the severest scrutiny cannot charge me with any breach of duty to have deserved this severe chastisement I will bow before the power who inflicts it with humble resignation to his will nor shall the duty of a wife be totally absorbed in the feelings of the mother I will endeavour to appear more cheerful and by appearing in some measure to have conquered my own sorrow alleviate the sufferings of my husband and rouse him from that torpor into which this misfortune has plunged him My father too demands my care and attention I must not by a selfish indulgence of my own grief forget the interest those two dear objects take in my happiness or misery I will wear a smile on my face though the thorn rankles in my heart and if by so doing I in the smallest degree contribute to restore their peace of mind I shall be amply rewarded for the pain the concealment of my own feelings may occasion Thus argued this excellent woman and in the execution of so laudable a resolution we shall leave her to follow the fortunes of the hapless victim of imprudence and evil counsellors CHAPTER XVI NECESSARY DIGRESSION ON board of the ship in which Charlotte and Mademoiselle were embarked was an officer of large unincumbered fortune and elevated rank and whom I shall call Crayton He was one of those men who having travelled in their youth pretend to have contracted a peculiar fondness for every thing foreign and to hold in contempt the productions of their own country and this affected partiality extended even to the women With him therefore the blushing modesty and unaffected simplicity of Charlotte passed unnoticed but the forward pertness of La Rue the freedom of her conversation the elegance of her person mixed with a certain engaging JE NE SAIS QUOI perfectly enchanted him The reader no doubt has already developed the character of La Rue designing artful and selfish she had accepted the devoirs of Belcour because she was heartily weary of the retired life she led at the school wished to be released from what she deemed a slavery and to return to that vortex of folly and dissipation which had once plunged her into the deepest misery but her plan she flattered herself was now better formed she resolved to put herself under the protection of no man till she had first secured a settlement but the clandestine manner in which she left Madame Du Pont s prevented her putting this plan in execution though Belcour solemnly protested he would make her a handsome settlement the moment they arrived at Portsmouth This he afterwards contrived to evade by a pretended hurry of business La Rue readily conceiving he never meant to fulfil his promise determined to change her battery and attack the heart of Colonel Crayton She soon discovered the partiality he entertained for her nation and having imposed on him a feigned tale of distress representing Belcour as a villain who had seduced her from her friends under promise of marriage and afterwards betrayed her pretending great remorse for the errors she had committed and declaring whatever her affection for Belcour might have been it was now entirely extinguished and she wished for nothing more than an opportunity to leave a course of life which her soul abhorred but she had no friends to apply to they had all renounced her and guilt and misery would undoubtedly be her future portion through life Crayton was possessed of many amiable qualities though the peculiar trait in his character which we have already mentioned in a great measure threw a shade over them He was beloved for his humanity and benevolence by all who knew him but he was easy and unsuspicious himself and became a dupe to the artifice of others He was when very young united to an amiable Parisian lady and perhaps it was his affection for her that laid the foundation for the partiality he ever retained for the whole nation He had by her one daughter who entered into the world but a few hours before her mother left it This lady was universally beloved and admired being endowed with all the virtues of her mother without the weakness of the father she was married to Major Beauchamp and was at this time in the same fleet with her father attending her husband to New York Crayton was melted by the affected contrition and distress of La Rue he would converse with her for hours read to her play cards with her listen to all her complaints and promise to protect her to the utmost of his power La Rue easily saw his character her sole aim was to awaken a passion in his bosom that might turn out to her advantage and in this aim she was but too successful for before the voyage was finished the infatuated Colonel gave her from under his hand a promise of marriage on their arrival at New York under forfeiture of five thousand pounds And how did our poor Charlotte pass her time during a tedious and tempestuous passage naturally delicate the fatigue and sickness which she endured rendered her so weak as to be almost entirely confined to her bed yet the kindness and attention of Montraville in some measure contributed to alleviate her sufferings and the hope of hearing from her friends soon after her arrival kept up her spirits and cheered many a gloomy hour But during the voyage a great revolution took place not only in the fortune of La Rue but in the bosom of Belcour whilst in pursuit of his amour with Mademoiselle he had attended little to the interesting inobtrusive charms of Charlotte but when cloyed by possession and disgusted with the art and dissimulation of one he beheld the simplicity and gentleness of the other the contrast became too striking not to fill him at once with surprise and admiration He frequently conversed with Charlotte he found her sensible well informed but diffident and unassuming The languor which the fatigue of her body and perturbation of her mind spread over her delicate features served only in his opinion to render her more lovely he knew that Montraville did not design to marry her and he formed a resolution to endeavour to gain her himself whenever Montraville should leave her Let not the reader imagine Belcour s designs were honourable Alas when once a woman has forgot the respect due to herself by yielding to the solicitations of illicit love they lose all their consequence even in the eyes of the man whose art has betrayed them and for whose sake they have sacrificed every valuable consideration The heedless Fair who stoops to guilty joys A man may pity but he must despise Nay every libertine will think he has a right to insult her with his licentious passion and should the unhappy creature shrink from the insolent overture he will sneeringly taunt her with pretence of modesty CHAPTER XVII A WEDDING ON the day before their arrival at New York after dinner Crayton arose from his seat and placing himself by Mademoiselle thus addressed the company As we are now nearly arrived at our destined port I think it but my duty to inform you my friends that this lady taking her hand has placed herself under my protection I have seen and severely felt the anguish of her heart and through every shade which cruelty or malice may throw over her can discover the most amiable qualities I thought it but necessary to mention my esteem for her before our disembarkation as it is my fixed resolution the morning after we land to give her an undoubted title to my favour and protection by honourably uniting my fate to hers I would wish every gentleman here therefore to remember that her honour henceforth is mine and continued he looking at Belcour should any man presume to speak in the least disrespectfully of her I shall not hesitate to pronounce him a scoundrel Belcour cast at him a smile of contempt and bowing profoundly low wished Mademoiselle much joy in the proposed union and assuring the Colonel that he need not be in the least apprehensive of any one throwing the least odium on the character of his lady shook him by the hand with ridiculous gravity and left the cabin The truth was he was glad to be rid of La Rue and so he was but freed from her he cared not who fell a victim to her infamous arts The inexperienced Charlotte was astonished at what she heard She thought La Rue had like herself only been urged by the force of her attachment to Belcour to quit her friends and follow him to the feat of war how wonderful then that she should resolve to marry another man It was certainly extremely wrong It was indelicate She mentioned her thoughts to Montraville He laughed at her simplicity called her a little idiot and patting her on the cheek said she knew nothing of the world If the world sanctifies such things tis a very bad world I think said Charlotte Why I always understood they were to have been married when they arrived at New York I am sure Mademoiselle told me Belcour promised to marry her Well and suppose he did Why he should be obliged to keep his word I think Well but I suppose he has changed his mind said Montraville and then you know the case is altered Charlotte looked at him attentively for a moment A full sense of her own situation rushed upon her mind She burst into tears and remained silent Montraville too well understood the cause of her tears He kissed her cheek and bidding her not make herself uneasy unable to bear the silent but keen remonstrance hastily left her The next morning by sun rise they found themselves at anchor before the city of New York A boat was ordered to convey the ladies on shore Crayton accompanied them and they were shewn to a house of public entertainment Scarcely were they seated when the door opened and the Colonel found himself in the arms of his daughter who had landed a few minutes before him The first transport of meeting subsided Crayton introduced his daughter to Mademoiselle La Rue as an old friend of her mother s for the artful French woman had really made it appear to the credulous Colonel that she was in the same convent with his first wife and though much younger had received many tokens of her esteem and regard If Mademoiselle said missus Beauchamp you were the friend of my mother you must be worthy the esteem of all good hearts Mademoiselle will soon honour our family said Crayton by supplying the place that valuable woman filled and as you are married my dear I think you will not blame Hush my dear Sir replied missus Beauchamp I know my duty too well to scrutinize your conduct Be assured my dear father your happiness is mine I shall rejoice in it and sincerely love the person who contributes to it But tell me continued she turning to Charlotte who is this lovely girl Is she your sister Mademoiselle A blush deep as the glow of the carnation suffused the cheeks of Charlotte It is a young lady replied the Colonel who came in the same vessel with us from England He then drew his daughter aside and told her in a whisper Charlotte was the mistress of Montraville What a pity said missus Beauchamp softly casting a most compassionate glance at her But surely her mind is not depraved The goodness of her heart is depicted in her ingenuous countenance Charlotte caught the word pity And am I already fallen so low said she A sigh escaped her and a tear was ready to start but Montraville appeared and she checked the rising emotion Mademoiselle went with the Colonel and his daughter to another apartment Charlotte remained with Montraville and Belcour The next morning the Colonel performed his promise and La Rue became in due form missus Crayton exulted in her own good fortune and dared to look with an eye of contempt on the unfortunate but far less guilty Charlotte VOLUME II CHAPTER XVIII REFLECTIONS AND am I indeed fallen so low said Charlotte as to be only pitied Will the voice of approbation no more meet my ear and shall I never again possess a friend whose face will wear a smile of joy whenever I approach Alas how thoughtless how dreadfully imprudent have I been I know not which is most painful to endure the sneer of contempt or the glance of compassion which is depicted in the various countenances of my own sex they are both equally humiliating Ah my dear parents could you now see the child of your affections the daughter whom you so dearly loved a poor solitary being without society here wearing out her heavy hours in deep regret and anguish of heart no kind friend of her own sex to whom she can unbosom her griefs no beloved mother no woman of character will appear in my company and low as your Charlotte is fallen she cannot associate with infamy These were the painful reflections which occupied the mind of Charlotte Montraville had placed her in a small house a few miles from New York he gave her one female attendant and supplied her with what money she wanted but business and pleasure so entirely occupied his time that he had little to devote to the woman whom he had brought from all her connections and robbed of innocence Sometimes indeed he would steal out at the close of evening and pass a few hours with her and then so much was she attached to him that all her sorrows were forgotten while blest with his society she would enjoy a walk by moonlight or sit by him in a little arbour at the bottom of the garden and play on the harp accompanying it with her plaintive harmonious voice But often very often did he promise to renew his visits and forgetful of his promise leave her to mourn her disappointment What painful hours of expectation would she pass She would sit at a window which looked toward a field he used to cross counting the minutes and straining her eyes to catch the first glimpse of his person till blinded with tears of disappointment she would lean her head on her hands and give free vent to her sorrows then catching at some new hope she would again renew her watchful position till the shades of evening enveloped every object in a dusky cloud she would then renew her complaints and with a heart bursting with disappointed love and wounded sensibility retire to a bed which remorse had strewed with thorns and court in vain that comforter of weary nature who seldom visits the unhappy to come and steep her senses in oblivion Who can form an adequate idea of the sorrow that preyed upon the mind of Charlotte The wife whose breast glows with affection to her husband and who in return meets only indifference can but faintly conceive her anguish Dreadfully painful is the situation of such a woman but she has many comforts of which our poor Charlotte was deprived The duteous faithful wife though treated with indifference has one solid pleasure within her own bosom she can reflect that she has not deserved neglect that she has ever fulfilled the duties of her station with the strictest exactness she may hope by constant assiduity and unremitted attention to recall her wanderer and be doubly happy in his returning affection she knows he cannot leave her to unite himself to another he cannot cast her out to poverty and contempt she looks around her and sees the smile of friendly welcome or the tear of affectionate consolation on the face of every person whom she favours with her esteem and from all these circumstances she gathers comfort but the poor girl by thoughtless passion led astray who in parting with her honour has forfeited the esteem of the very man to whom she has sacrificed every thing dear and valuable in life feels his indifference in the fruit of her own folly and laments her want of power to recall his lost affection she knows there is no tie but honour and that in a man who has been guilty of seduction is but very feeble he may leave her in a moment to shame and want he may marry and forsake her for ever and should he she has no redress no friendly soothing companion to pour into her wounded mind the balm of consolation no benevolent hand to lead her back to the path of rectitude she has disgraced her friends forfeited the good opinion of the world and undone herself she feels herself a poor solitary being in the midst of surrounding multitudes shame bows her to the earth remorse tears her distracted mind and guilt poverty and disease close the dreadful scene she sinks unnoticed to oblivion The finger of contempt may point out to some passing daughter of youthful mirth the humble bed where lies this frail sister of mortality and will she in the unbounded gaiety of her heart exult in her own unblemished fame and triumph over the silent ashes of the dead Oh no has she a heart of sensibility she will stop and thus address the unhappy victim of folly Thou had saint thy faults but sure thy sufferings have expiated them thy errors brought thee to an early grave but thou wert a fellow creature thou hast been unhappy then be those errors forgotten Then as she stoops to pluck the noxious weed from off the sod a tear will fall and consecrate the spot to Charity For ever honoured be the sacred drop of humanity the angel of mercy shall record its source and the soul from whence it sprang shall be immortal My dear Madam contract not your brow into a frown of disapprobation I mean not to extenuate the faults of those unhappy women who fall victims to guilt and folly but surely when we reflect how many errors we are ourselves subject to how many secret faults lie hid in the recesses of our hearts which we should blush to have brought into open day and yet those faults require the lenity and pity of a benevolent judge or awful would be our prospect of futurity I say my dear Madam when we consider this we surely may pity the faults of others Believe me many an unfortunate female who has once strayed into the thorny paths of vice would gladly return to virtue was any generous friend to endeavour to raise and re assure her but alas it cannot be you say the world would deride and scoff Then let me tell you Madam tis a very unfeeling world and does not deserve half the blessings which a bountiful Providence showers upon it Oh thou benevolent giver of all good how shall we erring mortals dare to look up to thy mercy in the great day of retribution if we now uncharitably refuse to overlook the errors or alleviate the miseries of our fellow creatures CHAPTER XIX A MISTAKE DISCOVERED JULIA Franklin was the only child of a man of large property who at the age of eighteen left her independent mistress of an unincumbered income of seven hundred a year she was a girl of a lively disposition and humane susceptible heart she resided in New York with an uncle who loved her too well and had too high an opinion of her prudence to scrutinize her actions so much as would have been necessary with many young ladies who were not blest with her discretion she was at the time Montraville arrived at New York the life of society and the universal toast Montraville was introduced to her by the following accident One night when he was upon guard a dreadful fire broke out near mister Franklin s house which in a few hours reduced that and several others to ashes fortunately no lives were lost and by the assiduity of the soldiers much valuable property was saved from the flames In the midst of the confusion an old gentleman came up to Montraville and putting a small box into his hands cried Keep it my good Sir till I come to you again and then rushing again into the thickest of the crowd Montraville saw him no more He waited till the fire was quite extinguished and the mob dispersed but in vain the old gentleman did not appear to claim his property and Montraville fearing to make any enquiry lest he should meet with impostors who might lay claim without any legal right to the box carried it to his lodgings and locked it up he naturally imagined that the person who committed it to his care knew him and would in a day or two reclaim it but several weeks passed on and no enquiry being made he began to be uneasy and resolved to examine the contents of the box and if they were as he supposed valuable to spare no pains to discover and restore them to the owner Upon opening it he found it contained jewels to a large amount about two hundred pounds in money and a miniature picture set for a bracelet On examining the picture he thought he had somewhere seen features very like it but could not recollect where A few days after being at a public assembly he saw Miss Franklin and the likeness was too evident to be mistaken he enquired among his brother officers if any of them knew her and found one who was upon terms of intimacy in the family then introduce me to her immediately said he for I am certain I can inform her of something which will give her peculiar pleasure He was immediately introduced found she was the owner of the jewels and was invited to breakfast the next morning in order to their restoration This whole evening Montraville was honoured with Julia s hand the lively sallies of her wit the elegance of her manner powerfully charmed him he forgot Charlotte and indulged himself in saying every thing that was polite and tender to Julia But on retiring recollection returned What am I about said he though I cannot marry Charlotte I cannot be villain enough to forsake her nor must I dare to trifle with the heart of Julia Franklin I will return this box said he which has been the source of so much uneasiness already and in the evening pay a visit to my poor melancholy Charlotte and endeavour to forget this fascinating Julia He arose dressed himself and taking the picture out I will reserve this from the rest said he and by presenting it to her when she thinks it is lost enhance the value of the obligation He repaired to mister Franklin s and found Julia in the breakfast parlour alone How happy am I Madam said he that being the fortunate instrument of saving these jewels has been the means of procuring me the acquaintance of so amiable a lady There are the jewels and money all safe But where is the picture Sir said Julia Here Madam I would not willingly part with it It is the portrait of my mother said she taking it from him tis all that remains She pressed it to her lips and a tear trembled in her eyes Montraville glanced his eye on her grey night gown and black ribbon and his own feelings prevented a reply Julia Franklin was the very reverse of Charlotte Temple she was tall elegantly shaped and possessed much of the air and manner of a woman of fashion her complexion was a clear brown enlivened with the glow of health her eyes full black and sparkling darted their intelligent glances through long silken lashes her hair was shining brown and her features regular and striking there was an air of innocent gaiety that played about her countenance where good humour sat triumphant I have been mistaken said Montraville I imagined I loved Charlotte but alas I am now too late convinced my attachment to her was merely the impulse of the moment I fear I have not only entailed lasting misery on that poor girl but also thrown a barrier in the way of my own happiness which it will be impossible to surmount I feel I love Julia Franklin with ardour and sincerity yet when in her presence I am sensible of my own inability to offer a heart worthy her acceptance and remain silent Full of these painful thoughts Montraville walked out to see Charlotte she saw him approach and ran out to meet him she banished from her countenance the air of discontent which ever appeared when he was absent and met him with a smile of joy I thought you had forgot me Montraville said she and was very unhappy I shall never forget you Charlotte he replied pressing her hand The uncommon gravity of his countenance and the brevity of his reply alarmed her You are not well said she your hand is hot your eyes are heavy you are very ill I am a villain said he mentally as he turned from her to hide his emotions But come continued she tenderly you shall go to bed and I will sit by and watch you you will be better when you have slept Montraville was glad to retire and by pretending sleep hide the agitation of his mind from her penetrating eye Charlotte watched by him till a late hour and then lying softly down by his side sunk into a profound sleep from whence she awoke not till late the next morning CHAPTER XX Virtue never appears so amiable as when reaching forth her hand to raise a fallen sister CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS WHEN Charlotte awoke she missed Montraville but thinking he might have arisen early to enjoy the beauties of the morning she was preparing to follow him when casting her eye on the table she saw a note and opening it hastily found these words My dear Charlotte must not be surprised if she does not see me again for some time unavoidable business will prevent me that pleasure be assured I am quite well this morning and what your fond imagination magnified into illness was nothing more than fatigue which a few hours rest has entirely removed Make yourself happy and be certain of the unalterable friendship of MONTRAVILLE FRIENDSHIP said Charlotte emphatically as she finished the note is it come to this at last Alas poor forsaken Charlotte thy doom is now but too apparent Montraville is no longer interested in thy happiness and shame remorse and disappointed love will henceforth be thy only attendants Though these were the ideas that involuntarily rushed upon the mind of Charlotte as she perused the fatal note yet after a few hours had elapsed the syren Hope again took possession of her bosom and she flattered herself she could on a second perusal discover an air of tenderness in the few lines he had left which at first had escaped her notice He certainly cannot be so base as to leave me said she and in styling himself my friend does he not promise to protect me I will not torment myself with these causeless fears I will place a confidence in his honour and sure he will not be so unjust as to abuse it Just as she had by this manner of reasoning brought her mind to some tolerable degree of composure she was surprised by a visit from Belcour The dejection visible in Charlotte s countenance her swoln eyes and neglected attire at once told him she was unhappy he made no doubt but Montraville had by his coldness alarmed her suspicions and was resolved if possible to rouse her to jealousy urge her to reproach him and by that means occasion a breach between them If I can once convince her that she has a rival said he she will listen to my passion if it is only to revenge his slights Belcour knew but little of the female heart and what he did know was only of those of loose and dissolute lives He had no idea that a woman might fall a victim to imprudence and yet retain so strong a sense of honour as to reject with horror and contempt every solicitation to a second fault He never imagined that a gentle generous female heart once tenderly attached when treated with unkindness might break but would never harbour a thought of revenge His visit was not long but before he went he fixed a scorpion in the heart of Charlotte whose venom embittered every future hour of her life We will now return for a moment to Colonel Crayton He had been three months married and in that little time had discovered that the conduct of his lady was not so prudent as it ought to have been but remonstrance was vain her temper was violent and to the Colonel s great misfortune he had conceived a sincere affection for her she saw her own power and with the art of a Circe made every action appear to him in what light she pleased his acquaintance laughed at his blindness his friends pitied his infatuation his amiable daughter missus Beauchamp in secret deplored the loss of her father s affection and grieved that he should be so entirely swayed by an artful and she much feared infamous woman missus Beauchamp was mild and engaging she loved not the hurry and bustle of a city and had prevailed on her husband to take a house a few miles from New York Chance led her into the same neighbourhood with Charlotte their houses stood within a short space of each other and their gardens joined she had not been long in her new habitation before the figure of Charlotte struck her she recollected her interesting features she saw the melancholy so conspicuous in her countenance and her heart bled at the reflection that perhaps deprived of honour friends all that was valuable in life she was doomed to linger out a wretched existence in a strange land and sink broken hearted into an untimely grave Would to heaven I could snatch her from so hard a fate said she but the merciless world has barred the doors of compassion against a poor weak girl who perhaps had she one kind friend to raise and reassure her would gladly return to peace and virtue nay even the woman who dares to pity and endeavour to recall a wandering sister incurs the sneer of contempt and ridicule for an action in which even angels are said to rejoice The longer missus Beauchamp was a witness to the solitary life Charlotte led the more she wished to speak to her and often as she saw her cheeks wet with the tears of anguish she would say Dear sufferer how gladly would I pour into your heart the balm of consolation were it not for the fear of derision But an accident soon happened which made her resolve to brave even the scoffs of the world rather than not enjoy the heavenly satisfaction of comforting a desponding fellow creature missus Beauchamp was an early riser She was one morning walking in the garden leaning on her husband s arm when the sound of a harp attracted their notice they listened attentively and heard a soft melodious voice distinctly sing the following stanzas Thou glorious orb supremely bright Just rising from the sea To cheer all nature with thy light What are thy beams to me In vain thy glories bid me rise To hail the new born day Alas my morning sacrifice Is still to weep and pray For what are nature s charms combin d To one whose weary breast Can neither peace nor comfort find Nor friend whereon to rest
5984_56840_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh never 
none	none	never whilst I live Can my heart s anguish cease Come friendly death thy mandate give And let me be at peace Tis poor Charlotte said missus Beauchamp the pellucid drop of humanity stealing down her cheek Captain Beauchamp was alarmed at her emotion What Charlotte said he do you know her In the accent of a pitying angel did she disclose to her husband Charlotte s unhappy situation and the frequent wish she had formed of being serviceable to her I fear continued she the poor girl has been basely betrayed and if I thought you would not blame me I would pay her a visit offer her my friendship and endeavour to restore to her heart that peace she seems to have lost and so pathetically laments Who knows my dear laying her hand affectionately on his arm who knows but she has left some kind affectionate parents to lament her errors and would she return they might with rapture receive the poor penitent and wash away her faults in tears of joy Oh what a glorious reflexion would it be for me could I be the happy instrument of restoring her Her heart may not be depraved Beauchamp Exalted woman cried Beauchamp embracing her how dost thou rise every moment in my esteem Follow the impulse of thy generous heart my Emily Let prudes and fools censure if they dare and blame a sensibility they never felt I will exultingly tell them that the heart that is truly virtuous is ever inclined to pity and forgive the errors of its fellow creatures A beam of exulting joy played round the animated countenance of missus Beauchamp at these encomiums bestowed on her by a beloved husband the most delightful sensations pervaded her heart and having breakfasted she prepared to visit Charlotte CHAPTER XXI Teach me to feel another s woe To hide the fault I see That mercy I to others show That mercy show to me POPE WHEN missus Beauchamp was dressed she began to feel embarrassed at the thought of beginning an acquaintance with Charlotte and was distressed how to make the first visit I cannot go without some introduction said she it will look so like impertinent curiosity At length recollecting herself she stepped into the garden and gathering a few fine cucumbers took them in her hand by way of apology for her visit A glow of conscious shame vermillioned Charlotte s face as missus Beauchamp entered You will pardon me Madam said she for not having before paid my respects to so amiable a neighbour but we English people always keep up that reserve which is the characteristic of our nation wherever we go I have taken the liberty to bring you a few cucumbers for I observed you had none in your garden Charlotte though naturally polite and well bred was so confused she could hardly speak Her kind visitor endeavoured to relieve her by not noticing her embarrassment I am come Madam continued she to request you will spend the day with me I shall be alone and as we are both strangers in this country we may hereafter be extremely happy in each other s friendship Your friendship Madam said Charlotte blushing is an honour to all who are favoured with it Little as I have seen of this part of the world I am no stranger to missus Beauchamp s goodness of heart and known humanity but my friendship She paused glanced her eye upon her own visible situation and spite of her endeavours to suppress them burst into tears missus Beauchamp guessed the source from whence those tears flowed You seem unhappy Madam said she shall I be thought worthy your confidence will you entrust me with the cause of your sorrow and rest on my assurances to exert my utmost power to serve you Charlotte returned a look of gratitude but could not speak and missus Beauchamp continued My heart was interested in your behalf the first moment I saw you and I only lament I had not made earlier overtures towards an acquaintance but I flatter myself you will henceforth consider me as your friend Oh Madam cried Charlotte I have forfeited the good opinion of all my friends I have forsaken them and undone myself Come come my dear said missus Beauchamp you must not indulge these gloomy thoughts you are not I hope so miserable as you imagine yourself endeavour to be composed and let me be favoured with your company at dinner when if you can bring yourself to think me your friend and repose a confidence in me I am ready to convince you it shall not be abused She then arose and bade her good morning At the dining hour Charlotte repaired to missus Beauchamp s and during dinner assumed as composed an aspect as possible but when the cloth was removed she summoned all her resolution and determined to make missus Beauchamp acquainted with every circumstance preceding her unfortunate elopement and the earnest desire she had to quit a way of life so repugnant to her feelings With the benignant aspect of an angel of mercy did missus Beauchamp listen to the artless tale she was shocked to the soul to find how large a share La Rue had in the seduction of this amiable girl and a tear fell when she reflected so vile a woman was now the wife of her father When Charlotte had finished she gave her a little time to collect her scattered spirits and then asked her if she had never written to her friends Oh yes Madam said she frequently but I have broke their hearts they are either dead or have cast me off for ever for I have never received a single line from them I rather suspect said missus Beauchamp they have never had your letters but suppose you were to hear from them and they were willing to receive you would you then leave this cruel Montraville and return to them Would I said Charlotte clasping her hands would not the poor sailor tost on a tempestuous ocean threatened every moment with death gladly return to the shore he had left to trust to its deceitful calmness Oh my dear Madam I would return though to do it I were obliged to walk barefoot over a burning desert and beg a scanty pittance of each traveller to support my existence I would endure it all cheerfully could I but once more see my dear blessed mother hear her pronounce my pardon and bless me before I died but alas I shall never see her more she has blotted the ungrateful Charlotte from her remembrance and I shall sink to the grave loaded with her s and my father s curse missus Beauchamp endeavoured to sooth her You shall write to them again said she and I will see that the letter is sent by the first packet that sails for England in the mean time keep up your spirits and hope every thing by daring to deserve it She then turned the conversation and Charlotte having taken a cup of tea wished her benevolent friend a good evening CHAPTER XXII SORROWS OF THE HEART WHEN Charlotte got home she endeavoured to collect her thoughts and took up a pen in order to address those dear parents whom spite of her errors she still loved with the utmost tenderness but vain was every effort to write with the least coherence her tears fell so fast they almost blinded her and as she proceeded to describe her unhappy situation she became so agitated that she was obliged to give over the attempt and retire to bed where overcome with the fatigue her mind had undergone she fell into a slumber which greatly refreshed her and she arose in the morning with spirits more adequate to the painful task she had to perform and after several attempts at length concluded the following letter to her mother TO missus TEMPLE NEW YORK Will my once kind my ever beloved mother deign to receive a letter from her guilty but repentant child or has she justly incensed at my ingratitude driven the unhappy Charlotte from her remembrance Alas thou much injured mother shouldst thou even disown me I dare not complain because I know I have deserved it but yet believe me guilty as I am and cruelly as I have disappointed the hopes of the fondest parents that ever girl had even in the moment when forgetful of my duty I fled from you and happiness even then I loved you most and my heart bled at the thought of what you would suffer Oh never never whilst I have existence will the agony of that moment be erased from my memory It seemed like the separation of soul and body What can I plead in excuse for my conduct alas nothing That I loved my seducer is but too true yet powerful as that passion is when operating in a young heart glowing with sensibility it never would have conquered my affection to you my beloved parents had I not been encouraged nay urged to take the fatally imprudent step by one of my own sex who under the mask of friendship drew me on to ruin Yet think not your Charlotte was so lost as to voluntarily rush into a life of infamy no my dear mother deceived by the specious appearance of my betrayer and every suspicion lulled asleep by the most solemn promises of marriage I thought not those promises would so easily be forgotten I never once reflected that the man who could stoop to seduction would not hesitate to forsake the wretched object of his passion whenever his capricious heart grew weary of her tenderness When we arrived at this place I vainly expected him to fulfil his engagements but was at last fatally convinced he had never intended to make me his wife or if he had once thought of it his mind was now altered I scorned to claim from his humanity what I could not obtain from his love I was conscious of having forfeited the only gem that could render me respectable in the eye of the world I locked my sorrows in my own bosom and bore my injuries in silence But how shall I proceed This man this cruel Montraville for whom I sacrificed honour happiness and the love of my friends no longer looks on me with affection but scorns the credulous girl whom his art has made miserable Could you see me my dear parents without society without friends stung with remorse and I feel the burning blush of shame die my cheeks while I write it tortured with the pangs of disappointed love cut to the soul by the indifference of him who having deprived me of every other comfort no longer thinks it worth his while to sooth the heart where he has planted the thorn of never ceasing regret My daily employment is to think of you and weep to pray for your happiness and deplore my own folly my nights are scarce more happy for if by chance I close my weary eyes and hope some small forgetfulness of sorrow some little time to pass in sweet oblivion fancy still waking wafts me home to you I see your beloved forms I kneel and hear the blessed words of peace and pardon Extatic joy pervades my soul I reach my arms to catch your dear embraces the motion chases the illusive dream I wake to real misery At other times I see my father angry and frowning point to horrid caves where on the cold damp ground in the agonies of death I see my dear mother and my revered grand father I strive to raise you you push me from you and shrieking cry Charlotte thou hast murdered me Horror and despair tear every tortured nerve I start and leave my restless bed weary and unrefreshed Shocking as these reflexions are I have yet one more dreadful than the rest Mother my dear mother do not let me quite break your heart when I tell you in a few months I shall bring into the world an innocent witness of my guilt Oh my bleeding heart I shall bring a poor little helpless creature heir to infamy and shame This alone has urged me once more to address you to interest you in behalf of this poor unborn and beg you to extend your protection to the child of your lost Charlotte for my own part I have wrote so often so frequently have pleaded for forgiveness and entreated to be received once more beneath the paternal roof that having received no answer not even one line I much fear you have cast me from you for ever But sure you cannot refuse to protect my innocent infant it partakes not of its mother s guilt Oh my father oh beloved mother now do I feel the anguish I inflicted on your hearts recoiling with double force upon my own If my child should be a girl which heaven forbid tell her the unhappy fate of her mother and teach her to avoid my errors if a boy teach him to lament my miseries but tell him not who inflicted them lest in wishing to revenge his mother s injuries he should wound the peace of his father And now dear friends of my soul kind guardians of my infancy farewell I feel I never more must hope to see you the anguish of my heart strikes at the strings of life and in a short time I shall be at rest Oh could I but receive your blessing and forgiveness before I died it would smooth my passage to the peaceful grave and be a blessed foretaste of a happy eternity I beseech you curse me not my adored parents but let a tear of pity and pardon fall to the memory of your lost CHARLOTTE CHAPTER XXIII A MAN MAY SMILE AND SMILE AND BE A VILLAIN WHILE Charlotte was enjoying some small degree of comfort in the consoling friendship of missus Beauchamp Montraville was advancing rapidly in his affection towards Miss Franklin Julia was an amiable girl she saw only the fair side of his character she possessed an independent fortune and resolved to be happy with the man of her heart though his rank and fortune were by no means so exalted as she had a right to expect she saw the passion which Montraville struggled to conceal she wondered at his timidity but imagined the distance fortune had placed between them occasioned his backwardness and made every advance which strict prudence and a becoming modesty would permit Montraville saw with pleasure he was not indifferent to her but a spark of honour which animated his bosom would not suffer him to take advantage of her partiality He was well acquainted with Charlotte s situation and he thought there would be a double cruelty in forsaking her at such a time and to marry Miss Franklin while honour humanity every sacred law obliged him still to protect and support Charlotte was a baseness which his soul shuddered at He communicated his uneasiness to Belcour it was the very thing this pretended friend had wished And do you really said he laughing hesitate at marrying the lovely Julia and becoming master of her fortune because a little foolish fond girl chose to leave her friends and run away with you to America Dear Montraville act more like a man of sense this whining pining Charlotte who occasions you so much uneasiness would have eloped with somebody else if she had not with you Would to heaven said Montraville I had never seen her my regard for her was but the momentary passion of desire but I feel I shall love and revere Julia Franklin as long as I live yet to leave poor Charlotte in her present situation would be cruel beyond description Oh my good sentimental friend said Belcour do you imagine no body has a right to provide for the brat but yourself Montraville started Sure said he you cannot mean to insinuate that Charlotte is false I don t insinuate it said Belcour I know it Montraville turned pale as ashes Then there is no faith in woman said he While I thought you attached to her said Belcour with an air of indifference I never wished to make you uneasy by mentioning her perfidy but as I know you love and are beloved by Miss Franklin I was determined not to let these foolish scruples of honour step between you and happiness or your tenderness for the peace of a perfidious girl prevent your uniting yourself to a woman of honour Good heavens said Montraville what poignant reflections does a man endure who sees a lovely woman plunged in infamy and is conscious he was her first seducer but are you certain of what you say Belcour So far replied he that I myself have received advances from her which I would not take advantage of out of regard to you but hang it think no more about her I dined at Franklin s to day and Julia bid me seek and bring you to tea so come along my lad make good use of opportunity and seize the gifts of fortune while they are within your reach Montraville was too much agitated to pass a happy evening even in the company of Julia Franklin he determined to visit Charlotte early the next morning tax her with her falsehood and take an everlasting leave of her but when the morning came he was commanded on duty and for six weeks was prevented from putting his design in execution At length he found an hour to spare and walked out to spend it with Charlotte it was near four o clock in the afternoon when he arrived at her cottage she was not in the parlour and without calling the servant he walked up stairs thinking to find her in her bed room He opened the door and the first object that met his eyes was Charlotte asleep on the bed and Belcour by her side Death and distraction said he stamping this is too much Rise villain and defend yourself Belcour sprang from the bed The noise awoke Charlotte terrified at the furious appearance of Montraville and seeing Belcour with him in the chamber she caught hold of his arm as he stood by the bed side and eagerly asked what was the matter Treacherous infamous girl said he can you ask How came he here pointing to Belcour As heaven is my witness replied she weeping I do not know I have not seen him for these three weeks Then you confess he sometimes visits you He came sometimes by your desire Tis false I never desired him to come and you know I did not but mark me Charlotte from this instant our connexion is at an end Let Belcour or any other of your favoured lovers take you and provide for you I have done with you for ever He was then going to leave her but starting wildly from the bed she threw herself on her knees before him protesting her innocence and entreating him not to leave her Oh Montraville said she kill me for pity s sake kill me but do not doubt my fidelity Do not leave me in this horrid situation for the sake of your unborn child oh spurn not the wretched mother from you Charlotte said he with a firm voice I shall take care that neither you nor your child want any thing in the approaching painful hour but we meet no more He then endeavoured to raise her from the ground but in vain she clung about his knees entreating him to believe her innocent and conjuring Belcour to clear up the dreadful mystery Belcour cast on Montraville a smile of contempt it irritated him almost to madness he broke from the feeble arms of the distressed girl she shrieked and fell prostrate on the floor Montraville instantly left the house and returned hastily to the city CHAPTER XXIV MYSTERY DEVELOPED UNFORTUNATELY for Charlotte about three weeks before this unhappy rencontre Captain Beauchamp being ordered to Rhode Island his lady had accompanied him so that Charlotte was deprived of her friendly advice and consoling society 
5984_56837_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The afternoon on which Montraville had visited her she had found herself languid and fatigued and after making a very slight dinner had lain down to endeavour to recruit her exhausted spirits and contrary to her expectations had fallen asleep 
5984_56837_000005_000002	train-clean-360	She had not long been lain down when Belcour arrived for he took every opportunity of visiting her and striving to awaken her resentment against Montraville 
none	none	He enquired of the servant where her mistress was and being told she was asleep took up a book to amuse himself having sat a few minutes he by chance cast his eyes towards the road and saw Montraville approaching he instantly conceived the diabolical scheme of ruining the unhappy Charlotte in his opinion for ever he therefore stole softly up stairs and laying himself by her side with the greatest precaution for fear she should awake was in that situation discovered by his credulous friend When Montraville spurned the weeping Charlotte from him and left her almost distracted with terror and despair Belcour raised her from the floor and leading her down stairs assumed the part of a tender consoling friend she listened to the arguments he advanced with apparent composure but this was only the calm of a moment the remembrance of Montraville s recent cruelty again rushed upon her mind she pushed him from her with some violence and crying Leave me Sir I beseech you leave me for much I fear you have been the cause of my fidelity being suspected go leave me to the accumulated miseries my own imprudence has brought upon me 
5984_56837_000007_000000	train-clean-360	She then left him with precipitation and retiring to her own apartment threw herself on the bed and gave vent to an agony of grief which it is impossible to describe 
none	none	It now occurred to Belcour that she might possibly write to Montraville and endeavour to convince him of her innocence he was well aware of her pathetic remonstrances and sensible of the tenderness of Montraville s heart resolved to prevent any letters ever reaching him he therefore called the servant and by the powerful persuasion of a bribe prevailed with her to promise whatever letters her mistress might write should be sent to him 
5984_56837_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He then left a polite tender note for Charlotte and returned to New York 
5984_56837_000008_000002	train-clean-360	His first business was to seek Montraville and endeavour to convince him that what had happened would ultimately tend to his happiness he found him in his apartment solitary pensive and wrapped in disagreeable reflexions 
5984_56837_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Why how now whining pining lover said he clapping him on the shoulder 
5984_56837_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Montraville started a momentary flush of resentment crossed his cheek but instantly gave place to a death like paleness occasioned by painful remembrance remembrance awakened by that monitor whom though we may in vain endeavour we can never entirely silence 
5984_56837_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Belcour said he you have injured me in a tender point Prithee Jack replied Belcour do not make a serious matter of it how could I refuse the girl s advances and thank heaven she is not your wife 
5984_56837_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 True said Montraville but she was innocent when I first knew her It was I seduced her Belcour 
5984_56837_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Had it not been for me she had still been virtuous and happy in the affection and protection of her family 
none	none	Pshaw replied Belcour laughing if you had not taken advantage of her easy nature some other would and where is the difference pray
5984_56837_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish I had never seen her cried he passionately and starting from his seat 
none	none	Oh that cursed French woman added he with vehemence had it not been for her I might have been happy He paused
5984_56837_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 With Julia Franklin said Belcour 
5984_56837_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The name like a sudden spark of electric fire seemed for a moment to suspend his faculties for a moment he was transfixed but recovering he caught Belcour s hand and cried Stop stop 
none	none	I beseech you name not the lovely Julia and the wretched Montraville in the same breath 
5984_56837_000014_000003	train-clean-360	I am a seducer a mean ungenerous seducer of unsuspecting innocence 
5984_56837_000014_000004	train-clean-360	I dare not hope that purity like her s would stoop to unite itself with black premeditated guilt yet by heavens I swear Belcour I thought I loved the lost abandoned Charlotte till I saw Julia I thought I never could forsake her but the heart is deceitful and I now can plainly discriminate between the impulse of a youthful passion and the pure flame of disinterested affection 
5984_56837_000015_000000	train-clean-360	At that instant Julia Franklin passed the window leaning on her uncle s arm 
5984_56837_000015_000001	train-clean-360	She curtseyed as she passed and with the bewitching smile of modest cheerfulness cried Do you bury yourselves in the house this fine evening gents There was something in the voice the manner 
5984_56837_000015_000002	train-clean-360	the look that was altogether irresistible 
none	none	Perhaps she wishes my company said Montraville mentally as he snatched up his hat if I thought she loved me I would confess my errors and trust to her generosity to pity and pardon me He soon overtook her and offering her his arm they sauntered to pleasant but unfrequented walks 
5984_56837_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Belcour drew mister Franklin on one side and entered into a political discourse they walked faster than the young people and Belcour by some means contrived entirely to lose sight of them 
none	none	It was a fine evening in the beginning of autumn the last remains of day light faintly streaked the western sky while the moon with pale and virgin lustre in the room of gorgeous gold and purple ornamented the canopy of heaven with silver fleecy clouds which now and then half hid her lovely face and by partly concealing heightened every beauty the zephyrs whispered softly through the trees which now began to shed their leafy honours a solemn silence reigned and to a happy mind an evening such as this would give serenity and calm unruffled pleasure but to Montraville while it soothed the turbulence of his passions it brought increase of melancholy reflections 
5984_56837_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Julia was leaning on his arm he took her hand in his and pressing it tenderly sighed deeply but continued silent 
5984_56837_000015_000007	train-clean-360	Julia was embarrassed she wished to break a silence so unaccountable but was unable she loved Montraville she saw he was unhappy and wished to know the cause of his uneasiness but that innate modesty which nature has implanted in the female breast prevented her enquiring 
none	none	I am bad company Miss Franklin said he at last recollecting himself but I have met with something to day that has greatly distressed me and I cannot shake off the disagreeable impression it has made on my mind
5984_56837_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sorry she replied that you have any cause of inquietude 
5984_56837_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I am sure if you were as happy as you deserve and as all your friends wish you She hesitated 
none	none	And might I replied he with some animation presume to rank the amiable Julia in that number
5984_56837_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly said she the service you have rendered me the knowledge of your worth all combine to make me esteem you 
5984_56837_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Esteem my lovely Julia said he passionately is but a poor cold word 
5984_56837_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I would if I dared if I thought I merited your attention but no I must not honour forbids 
5984_56837_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I am beneath your notice Julia I am miserable and cannot hope to be otherwise Alas said Julia I pity you 
none	none	Oh thou condescending charmer said he how that sweet word cheers my sad heart 
5984_56837_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Indeed if you knew all you would pity but at the same time I fear you would despise me 
5984_56837_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Just then they were again joined by mister Franklin and Belcour 
5984_56837_000020_000001	train-clean-360	It had interrupted an interesting discourse 
5984_56837_000020_000002	train-clean-360	They found it impossible to converse on indifferent subjects and proceeded home in silence 
none	none	At mister Franklin s door Montraville again pressed Julia s hand and faintly articulating good night retired to his lodgings dispirited and wretched from a consciousness that he deserved not the affection with which he plainly saw he was honoured CHAPTER XXV RECEPTION OF A LETTER AND where now is our poor Charlotte said mister Temple one evening as the cold blasts of autumn whistled rudely over the heath and the yellow appearance of the distant wood spoke the near approach of winter In vain the cheerful fire blazed on the hearth in vain was he surrounded by all the comforts of life the parent was still alive in his heart and when he thought that perhaps his once darling child was ere this exposed to all the miseries of want in a distant land without a friend to sooth and comfort her without the benignant look of compassion to cheer or the angelic voice of pity to pour the balm of consolation on her wounded heart when he thought of this his whole soul dissolved in tenderness and while he wiped the tear of anguish from the eye of his patient uncomplaining Lucy he struggled to suppress the sympathizing drop that started in his own Oh my poor girl said missus Temple how must she be altered else surely she would have relieved our agonizing minds by one line to say she lived to say she had not quite forgot the parents who almost idolized her Gracious heaven said mister Temple starting from his seat I who would wish to be a father to experience the agonizing pangs inflicted on a parent s heart by the ingratitude of a child missus Temple wept her father took her hand he would have said be comforted my child but the words died on his tongue The sad silence that ensued was interrupted by a loud rap at the door In a moment a servant entered with a letter in his hand missus Temple took it from him she cast her eyes upon the superscription she knew the writing Tis Charlotte said she eagerly breaking the seal she has not quite forgot us But before she had half gone through the contents a sudden sickness seized her she grew cold and giddy and puffing it into her husband s hand she cried Read it I cannot mister Temple attempted to read it aloud but frequently paused to give vent to his tears My poor deluded child said he when he had finished Oh shall we not forgive the dear penitent said missus Temple We must we will my love she is willing to return and tis our duty to receive her Father of mercy said mister Eldridge raising his clasped hands let me but live once more to see the dear wanderer restored to her afflicted parents and take me from this world of sorrow whenever it seemeth best to thy wisdom Yes we will receive her said mister Temple we will endeavour to heal her wounded spirit and speak peace and comfort to her agitated soul I will write to her to return immediately Oh said missus Temple I would if possible fly to her support and cheer the dear sufferer in the approaching hour of distress and tell her how nearly penitence is allied to virtue Cannot we go and conduct her home my love continued she laying her hand on his arm My father will surely forgive our absence if we go to bring home his darling You cannot go my Lucy said mister Temple the delicacy of your frame would but poorly sustain the fatigue of a long voyage but I will go and bring the gentle penitent to your arms we may still see many years of happiness The struggle in the bosom of missus Temple between maternal and conjugal tenderness was long and painful At length the former triumphed and she consented that her husband should set forward to New York by the first opportunity she wrote to her Charlotte in the tenderest most consoling manner and looked forward to the happy hour when she should again embrace her with the most animated hope CHAPTER XXVI WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN the mean time the passion Montraville had conceived for Julia Franklin daily encreased and he saw evidently how much he was beloved by that amiable girl he was likewise strongly prepossessed with an idea of Charlotte s perfidy What wonder then if he gave himself up to the delightful sensation which pervaded his bosom and finding no obstacle arise to oppose his happiness he solicited and obtained the hand of Julia A few days before his marriage he thus addressed Belcour Though Charlotte by her abandoned conduct has thrown herself from my protection I still hold myself bound to support her till relieved from her present condition and also to provide for the child I do not intend to see her again but I will place a sum of money in your hands which will amply supply her with every convenience but should she require more let her have it and I will see it repaid I wish I could prevail on the poor deluded girl to return to her friends she was an only child and I make no doubt but that they would joyfully receive her it would shock me greatly to see her henceforth leading a life of infamy as I should always accuse myself of being the primary cause of all her errors If she should chuse to remain under your protection be kind to her Belcour I conjure you Let not satiety prompt you to treat her in such a manner as may drive her to actions which necessity might urge her to while her better reason disapproved them she shall never want a friend while I live but I never more desire to behold her her presence would be always painful to me and a glance from her eye would call the blush of conscious guilt into my cheek I will write a letter to her which you may deliver when I am gone as I shall go to saint Eustatia the day after my union with Julia who will accompany me Belcour promised to fulfil the request of his friend though nothing was farther from his intentions than the least design of delivering the letter or making Charlotte acquainted with the provision Montraville had made for her he was bent on the complete ruin of the unhappy girl and supposed by reducing her to an entire dependance on him to bring her by degrees to consent to gratify his ungenerous passion The evening before the day appointed for the nuptials of Montraville and Julia the former refired early to his apartment and ruminating on the past scenes of his life suffered the keenest remorse in the remembrance of Charlotte s seduction Poor girl said he I will at least write and bid her adieu I will too endeavour to awaken that love of virtue in her bosom which her unfortunate attachment to me has extinguished He took up the pen and began to write but words were denied him How could he address the woman whom he had seduced and whom though he thought unworthy his tenderness he was about to bid adieu for ever How should he tell her that he was going to abjure her to enter into the most indissoluble ties with another and that he could not even own the infant which she bore as his child Several letters were begun and destroyed at length he completed the following TO CHARLOTTE Though I have taken up my pen to address you my poor injured girl I feel I am inadequate to the task yet however painful the endeavour I could not resolve upon leaving you for ever without one kind line to bid you adieu to tell you how my heart bleeds at the remembrance of what you was before you saw the hated Montraville Even now imagination paints the scene when torn by contending passions when struggling between love and duty you fainted in my arms and I lifted you into the chaise I see the agony of your mind when recovering you found yourself on the road to Portsmouth but how my gentle girl how could you when so justly impressed with the value of virtue how could you when loving as I thought you loved me yield to the solicitations of Belcour Oh Charlotte conscience tells me it was I villain that I am who first taught you the allurements of guilty pleasure it was I who dragged you from the calm repose which innocence and virtue ever enjoy and can I dare I tell you it was not love prompted to the horrid deed No thou dear fallen angel believe your repentant Montraville when he tells you the man who truly loves will never betray the object of his affection Adieu Charlotte could you still find charms in a life of unoffend ing innocence return to your parents you shall never want the means of support both for yourself and child Oh gracious heaven may that child be entirely free from the vices of its father and the weakness of its mother To morrow but no I cannot tell you what to morrow will produce Belcour will inform you he also has cash for you which I beg you will ask for whenever you may want it Once more adieu believe me could I hear you was returned to your friends and enjoying that tranquillity of which I have robbed you I should be as completely happy as even you in your fondest hours could wish me but till then a gloom will obscure the brightest prospects of MONTRAVILLE After he had sealed this letter he threw himself on the bed and enjoyed a few hours repose Early in the morning Belcour tapped at his door he arose hastily and prepared to meet his Julia at the altar This is the letter to Charlotte said he giving it to Belcour take it to her when we are gone to Eustatia and I conjure you my dear friend not to use any sophistical arguments to prevent her return to virtue but should she incline that way encourage her in the thought and assist her to put her design in execution CHAPTER XXVII Pensive she mourn d and hung her languid head Like a fair lily overcharg d with dew CHARLOTTE had now been left almost three months a prey to her own melancholy reflexions sad companions indeed nor did any one break in upon her solitude but Belcour who once or twice called to enquire after her health and tell her he had in vain endeavoured to bring Montraville to hear reason and once but only once was her mind cheered by the receipt of an affectionate letter from missus Beauchamp 
5984_56840_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Often had she wrote to her perfidious seducer and with the most persuasive eloquence endeavoured to convince him of her innocence but these letters were never suffered to reach the hands of Montraville or they must though on the very eve of marriage have prevented his deserting the wretched girl 
5984_56840_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Real anguish of heart had in a great measure faded her charms her cheeks were pale from want of rest and her eyes by frequent indeed almost continued weeping were sunk and heavy 
none	none	Sometimes a gleam of hope would play about her heart when she thought of her parents They cannot surely she would say refuse to forgive me or should they deny their pardon to me they win not hate my innocent infant on account of its mother s errors How often did the poor mourner wish for the consoling presence of the benevolent missus Beauchamp
5984_56840_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 If she were here she would cry she would certainly comfort me and sooth the distraction of my soul 
5984_56840_000007_000000	train-clean-360	She was sitting one afternoon wrapped in these melancholy reflexions when she was interrupted by the entrance of Belcour 
none	none	Great as the alteration was which incessant sorrow had made on her person she was still interesting still charming and the unhallowed flame which had urged Belcour to plant dissension between her and Montraville still raged in his bosom he was determined if possible to make her his mistress nay he had even conceived the diabolical scheme of taking her to New York and making her appear in every public place where it was likely she should meet Montraville that he might be a witness to his unmanly triumph When he entered the room where Charlotte was sitting he assumed the look of tender consolatory friendship
5984_56840_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 And how does my lovely Charlotte said he taking her hand I fear you are not so well as I could wish 
5984_56840_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not well mister Belcour said she very far from it but the pains and infirmities of the body I could easily bear nay submit to them with patience were they not aggravated by the most insupportable anguish of my mind 
5984_56840_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 You are not happy Charlotte said he with a look of well dissembled sorrow 
none	none	Alas replied she mournfully shaking her head how can I be happy deserted and forsaken as I am without a friend of my own sex to whom I can unburthen my full heart nay my fidelity suspected by the very man for whom I have sacrificed every thing valuable in life for whom I have made myself a poor despised creature an outcast from society an object only of contempt and pity You think too meanly of yourself Miss Temple there is no one who would dare to treat you with contempt all who have the pleasure of knowing you must admire and esteem 
5984_56840_000012_000001	train-clean-360	You are lonely here my dear girl give me leave to conduct you to New York where the agreeable society of some ladies to whom I will introduce you will dispel these sad thoughts and I shall again see returning cheerfulness animate those lovely features 
none	none	Oh never 
5984_56840_000013_000001	train-clean-360	never cried Charlotte emphatically the virtuous part of my sex will scorn me and I will never associate with infamy 
none	none	No Belcour here let me hide my shame and sorrow here let me spend my few remaining days in obscurity unknown and unpitied here let me die unlamented and my name sink to oblivion Here her tears stopped her utterance Belcour was awed to silence he dared not interrupt her and after a moment s pause she proceeded I once had conceived the thought of going to New York to seek out the still dear though cruel ungenerous Montraville to throw myself at his feet and entreat his compassion heaven knows not for myself if I am no longer beloved I will not be indebted to his pity to redress my injuries but I would have knelt and entreated him not to forsake my poor unborn She could say no more a crimson glow rushed over her cheeks and covering her face with her hands she sobbed aloud 
5984_56840_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Something like humanity was awakened in Belcour s breast by this pathetic speech he arose and walked towards the window but the selfish passion which had taken possession of his heart soon stifled these finer emotions and he thought if Charlotte was once convinced she had no longer any dependance on Montraville she would more readily throw herself on his protection 
5984_56840_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Determined therefore to inform her of all that had happened he again resumed his seat and finding she began to be more composed enquired if she had ever heard from Montraville since the unfortunate recontre in her bed chamber 
5984_56840_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah no said she 
none	none	I fear I shall never hear from him again
5984_56840_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I am greatly of your opinion said Belcour for he has been for some time past greatly attached 
5984_56840_000017_000000	train-clean-360	At the word attached a death like paleness overspread the countenance of Charlotte but she applied to some hartshorn which stood beside her and Belcour proceeded 
5984_56840_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 He has been for some time past greatly attached to one Miss Franklin a pleasing lively girl with a large fortune 
5984_56840_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 She may be richer may be handsomer cried Charlotte but cannot love him so well 
5984_56840_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Oh may she beware of his art and not trust him too far as I have done 
5984_56840_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 He addresses her publicly said he and it was rumoured they were to be married before he sailed for Eustatia whither his company is ordered 
none	none	Belcour said Charlotte seizing his hand and gazing at him earnestly while her pale lips trembled with convulsive agony tell me and tell me truly I beseech you do you think he can be such a villain as to marry another woman and leave me to die with want and misery in a strange land tell me what you think I can bear it very well I will not shrink from this heaviest stroke of fate I have deserved my afflictions and I will endeavour to bear them as I ought
5984_56840_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear said Belcour he can be that villain 
5984_56840_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps cried she eagerly interrupting him perhaps he is married already come let me know the worst continued she with an affected look of composure you need not be afraid I shall not send the fortunate lady a bowl of poison 
5984_56840_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then my dear girl said he deceived by her appearance they were married on Thursday and yesterday morning they sailed for Eustatia 
5984_56840_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Married gone say you cried she in a distracted accent what without a last farewell without one thought on my unhappy situation Oh Montraville may God forgive your perfidy She shrieked and Belcour sprang forward just in time to prevent her falling to the floor 
5984_56840_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Alarming faintings now succeeded each other and she was conveyed to her bed from whence she earnestly prayed she might never more arise Belcour staid with her that night and in the morning found her in a high fever 
none	none	The fits she had been seized with had greatly terrified him and confined as she now was to a bed of sickness she was no longer an object of desire it is true for several days he went constantly to see her but her pale emaciated appearance disgusted him his visits became less frequent he forgot the solemn charge given him by Montraville he even forgot the money entrusted to his care and the burning blush of indignation and shame tinges my cheek while I write it this disgrace to humanity and manhood at length forgot even the injured Charlotte and attracted by the blooming health of a farmer s daughter whom he had seen in his frequent excursions to the country he left the unhappy girl to sink unnoticed to the grave a prey to sickness grief and penury while he having triumphed over the virtue of the artless cottager rioted in all the intemperance of luxury and lawless pleasure CHAPTER XXVIII A TRIFLING RETROSPECT BLESS my heart cries my young volatile reader I shall never have patience to get through these volumes there are so many ahs and ohs so much fainting tears and distress I am sick to death of the subject My dear cheerful innocent girl for innocent I will suppose you to be or you would acutely feel the woes of Charlotte did conscience say thus might it have been with me had not Providence interposed to snatch me from destruction therefore my lively innocent girl I must request your patience I am writing a tale of truth I mean to write it to the heart but if perchance the heart is rendered impenetrable by unbounded prosperity or a continuance in vice I expect not my tale to please nay I even expect it will be thrown by with disgust But softly gentle fair one I pray you throw it not aside till you have perused the whole mayhap you may find something therein to repay you for the trouble Methinks I see a sarcastic smile sit on your countenance And what cry you does the conceited author suppose we can glean from these pages if Charlotte is held up as an object of terror to prevent us from falling into guilty errors does not La Rue triumph in her shame and by adding art to guilt obtain the affection of a worthy man and rise to a station where she is beheld with respect and cheerfully received into all companies What then is the moral you would inculcate Would you wish us to think that a deviation from virtue if covered by art and hypocrisy is not an object of detestation but on the contrary shall raise us to fame and honour while the hapless girl who falls a victim to her too great sensibility shall be loaded with ignominy and shame No my fair querist I mean no such thing Remember the endeavours of the wicked are often suffered to prosper that in the end their fall may be attended with more bitterness of heart while the cup of affliction is poured out for wise and salutary ends and they who are compelled to drain it even to the bitter dregs often find comfort at the bottom the tear of penitence blots their offences from the book of fate and they rise from the heavy painful trial purified and fit for a mansion in the kingdom of eternity Yes my young friends the tear of compassion shall fall for the fate of Charlotte while the name of La Rue shall be detested and despised For Charlotte the soul melts with sympathy for La Rue it feels nothing but horror and contempt But perhaps your gay hearts would rather follow the fortunate missus Crayton through the scenes of pleasure and dissipation in which she was engaged than listen to the complaints and miseries of Charlotte I will for once oblige you I will for once follow her to midnight revels balls and scenes of gaiety for in such was she constantly engaged I have said her person was lovely let us add that she was surrounded by splendor and affluence and he must know but little of the world who can wonder however faulty such a woman s conduct at her being followed by the men and her company courted by the women in short missus Crayton was the universal favourite she set the fashions she was toasted by all the gentlemen and copied by all the ladies Colonel Crayton was a domestic man Could he be happy with such a woman impossible Remonstrance was vain he might as well have preached to the winds as endeavour to persuade her from any action however ridiculous on which she had set her mind in short after a little ineffectual struggle he gave up the attempt and left her to follow the bent of her own inclinations what those were I think the reader must have seen enough of her character to form a just idea Among the number who paid their devotions at her shrine she singled one a young Ensign of mean birth indifferent education and weak intellects How such a man came into the army we hardly know to account for and how he afterwards rose to posts of honour is likewise strange and wonderful But fortune is blind and so are those too frequently who have the power of dispensing her favours else why do we see fools and knaves at the very top of the wheel while patient merit sinks to the extreme of the opposite abyss But we may form a thousand conjectures on this subject and yet never hit on the right Let us therefore endeavour to deserve her smiles and whether we succeed or not we shall feel more innate satisfaction than thousands of those who bask in the sunshine of her favour unworthily But to return to missus Crayton this young man whom I shall distinguish by the name of Corydon was the reigning favourite of her heart He escorted her to the play danced with her at every ball and when indisposition prevented her going out it was he alone who was permitted to cheer the gloomy solitude to which she was obliged to confine herself Did she ever think of poor Charlotte if she did my dear Miss it was only to laugh at the poor girl s want of spirit in consenting to be moped up in the country while Montraville was enjoying all the pleasures of a gay dissipated city When she heard of his marriage she smiling said so there s an end of Madam Charlotte s hopes I wonder who will take her now or what will become of the little affected prude But as you have lead to the subject I think we may as well return to the distressed Charlotte and not like the unfeeling missus Crayton shut our hearts to the call of humanity CHAPTER XXIX WE GO FORWARD AGAIN THE strength of Charlotte s constitution combatted against her disorder and she began slowly to recover though she still laboured under a violent depression of spirits how must that depression be encreased when upon examining her little store she found herself reduced to one solitary guinea and that during her illness the attendance of an apothecary and nurse together with many other unavoidable expences had involved her in debt from which she saw no method of extricating herself As to the faint hope which she had entertained of hearing from and being relieved by her parents it now entirely forsook her for it was above four months since her letter was dispatched and she had received no answer she therefore imagined that her conduct had either entirely alienated their affection from her or broken their hearts and she must never more hope to receive their blessing Never did any human being wish for death with greater fervency or with juster cause yet she had too just a sense of the duties of the Christian religion to attempt to put a period to her own existence I have but to be patient a little longer she would cry and nature fatigued and fainting will throw off this heavy load of mortality and I shall be released from all my sufferings It was one cold stormy day in the latter end of December as Charlotte sat by a handful of fire the low state of her finances not allowing her to replenish her stock of fuel and prudence teaching her to be careful of what she had when she was surprised by the entrance of a farmer s wife who without much ceremony seated herself and began this curious harangue I m come to see if as how you can pay your rent because as how we hear Captain Montable is gone away and it s fifty to one if he b ant killed afore he comes back again an then Miss or Ma am or whatever you may be as I was saying to my husband where are we to look for our money This was a stroke altogether unexpected by Charlotte she knew so little of the ways of the world that she had never bestowed a thought on the payment for the rent of the house she knew indeed that she owed a good deal but this was never reckoned among the others she was thunder struck she hardly knew what answer to make yet it was absolutely necessary that she should say something and judging of the gentleness of every female disposition by her own she thought the best way to interest the woman in her favour would be to tell her candidly to what a situation she was reduced and how little probability there was of her ever paying any body Alas poor Charlotte how confined was her knowledge of human nature or she would have been convinced that the only way to insure the friendship and assistance of your surrounding acquaintance is to convince them you do not require it for when once the petrifying aspect of distress and penury appear whose qualities like Medusa s head can change to stone all that look upon it when once this Gorgon claims acquaintance with us the phantom of friendship that before courted our notice will vanish into unsubstantial air and the whole world before us appear a barren waste Pardon me ye dear spirits of benevolence whose benign smiles and cheerful giving hand have strewed sweet flowers on many a thorny path through which my wayward fate forced me to pass think not that in condemning the unfeeling texture of the human heart I forget the spring from whence flow an the comforts I enjoy oh no I look up to you as to bright constellations gathering new splendours from the surrounding darkness but ah whilst I adore the benignant rays that cheered and illumined my heart I mourn that their influence cannot extend to all the sons and daughters of affliction Indeed Madam said poor Charlotte in a tremulous accent I am at a loss what to do Montraville placed me here and promised to defray all my expenses but he has forgot his promise he has forsaken me and I have no friend who has either power or will to relieve me Let me hope as you see my unhappy situation your charity Charity cried the woman impatiently interrupting her charity indeed why Mistress charity begins at home and I have seven children at home HONEST LAWFUL children and it is my duty to keep them and do you think I will give away my property to a nasty impudent hussey to maintain her and her bastard an I was saying to my husband the other day what will this world come to honest women are nothing now a days while the harlotings are set up for fine ladies and look upon us no more nor the dirt they walk upon but let me tell you my fine spoken Ma am I must have my money so seeing as how you can t pay it why you must troop and leave all your fine gimcracks and fal der ralls behind you I don t ask for no more nor my right and nobody shall dare for to go for to hinder me of it Oh heavens cried Charlotte clasping her hands what will become of me Come on ye retorted the unfeeling wretch why go to the barracks and work for a morsel of bread wash and mend the soldiers cloaths an cook their victuals and not expect to live in idleness on honest people s means Oh I wish I could see the day when all such cattle were obliged to work hard and eat little it s only what they deserve Father of mercy cried Charlotte I acknowledge thy correction just but prepare me I beseech thee for the portion of misery thou may saint please to lay upon me Well said the woman I shall go an tell my husband as how you can t pay and so d ye see Ma am get ready to be packing away this very night for you should not stay another night in this house though I was sure you would lay in the street Charlotte bowed her head in silence but the anguish of her heart was too great to permit her to articulate a single word CHAPTER XXX And what is friendship but a name A charm that lulls to sleep A shade that follows wealth and fame But leaves the wretch to weep WHEN Charlotte was left to herself she began to think what course she must take or to whom she could apply to prevent her perishing for want or perhaps that very night falling a victim to the inclemency of the season After many perplexed thoughts she at last determined to set out for New York and enquire out missus Crayton from whom she had no doubt but she should obtain immediate relief as soon as her distress was made known she had no sooner formed this resolution than she resolved immediately to put it in execution she therefore wrote the following little billet to missus Crayton thinking if she should have company with her it would be better to send it in than to request to see her TO missus CRAYTON MADAM When we left our native land that dear happy land which now contains all that is dear to the wretched Charlotte our prospects were the same we both pardon me Madam if I say we both too easily followed the impulse of our treacherous hearts and trusted our happiness on a tempestuous ocean where mine has been wrecked and lost for ever you have been more fortunate you are united to a man of honour and humanity united by the most sacred ties respected esteemed and admired and surrounded by innumerable blessings of which I am bereaved enjoying those pleasures which have fled my bosom never to return alas sorrow and deep regret have taken their place Behold me Madam a poor forsaken wanderer who has no where to lay her weary head wherewith to supply the wants of nature or to shield her from the inclemency of the weather To you I sue to you I look for pity and relief I ask not to be received as an intimate or an equal only for charity s sweet sake receive me into your hospitable mansion allot me the meanest apartment in it and let me breath out my soul in prayers for your happiness I cannot I feel I cannot long bear up under the accumulated woes that pour in upon me but oh my dear Madam for the love of heaven suffer me not to expire in the street and when I am at peace as soon I shall be extend your compassion to my helpless offspring should it please heaven that it should survive its unhappy mother A gleam of joy breaks in on my benighted soul while I reflect that you cannot will not refuse your protection to the heart broken CHARLOTTE When Charlotte had finished this letter late as it was in the afternoon and though the snow began to fall very fast she tied up a few necessaries which she had prepared against her expected confinement and terrified lest she should be again exposed to the insults of her barbarous landlady more dreadful to her wounded spirit than either storm or darkness she set forward for New York It may be asked by those who in a work of this kind love to cavil at every trifling omission whether Charlotte did not possess any valuable of which she could have disposed and by that means have supported herself till missus Beauchamp s return when she would have been certain of receiving every tender attention which compassion and friendship could dictate but let me entreat these wise penetrating gentlemen to reflect that when Charlotte left England it was in such haste that there was no time to purchase any thing more than what was wanted for immediate use on the voyage and after her arrival at New York Montraville s affection soon began to decline so that her whole wardrobe consisted of only necessaries and as to baubles with which fond lovers often load their mistresses she possessed not one except a plain gold locket of small value which contained a lock of her mother s hair and which the greatest extremity of want could not have forced her to part with I hope Sir your prejudices are now removed in regard to the probability of my story Oh they are Well then with your leave I will proceed The distance from the house which our suffering heroine occupied to New York was not very great yet the snow fen so fast and the cold so intense that being unable from her situation to walk quick she found herself almost sinking with cold and fatigue before she reached the town her garments which were merely suitable to the summer season being an undress robe of plain white muslin were wet through and a thin black cloak and bonnet very improper habiliments for such a climate but poorly defended her from the cold In this situation she reached the city and enquired of a foot soldier whom she met the way to Colonel Crayton s Bless you my sweet lady said the soldier with a voice and look of compassion I will shew you the way with all my heart but if you are going to make a petition to Madam Crayton it is all to no purpose I assure you if you please I will conduct you to mister Franklin s though Miss Julia is married and gone now yet the old gentleman is very good Julia Franklin said Charlotte is she not married to Montraville Yes replied the soldier and may God bless them for a better officer never lived he is so good to us all and as to Miss Julia all the poor folk almost worshipped her Gracious heaven cried Charlotte is Montraville unjust then to none but me The soldier now shewed her Colonel Crayton s door and with a beating heart she knocked for admission CHAPTER XXXI SUBJECT CONTINUED WHEN the door was opened Charlotte in a voice rendered scarcely articulate through cold and the extreme agitation of her mind demanded whether missus Crayton was at home The servant hesitated he knew that his lady was engaged at a game of picquet with her dear Corydon nor could he think she would like to be disturbed by a person whose appearance spoke her of so little consequence as Charlotte yet there was something in her countenance that rather interested him in her favour and he said his lady was engaged but if she had any particular message he would deliver it Take up this letter said Charlotte tell her the unhappy writer of it waits in her hall for an answer The tremulous accent the tearful eye must have moved any heart not composed of adamant The man took the letter from the poor suppliant and hastily ascended the stair case A letter Madam said he presenting it to his lady an immediate answer is required missus Crayton glanced her eye carelessly over the contents What stuff is this cried she haughtily have not I told you a thousand times that I will not be plagued with beggars and petitions from people one knows nothing about Go tell the woman I can t do any thing in it I m sorry but one can t relieve every body The servant bowed and heavily returned with this chilling message to Charlotte Surely said she missus Crayton has not read my letter Go my good friend pray go back to her tell her it is Charlotte Temple who requests beneath her hospitable roof to find shelter from the inclemency of the season Prithee don t plague me man cried missus Crayton impatiently as the servant advanced something in behalf of the unhappy girl I tell you I don t know her Not know me cried Charlotte rushing into the room for she had followed the man up stairs not know me not remember the ruined Charlotte Temple who but for you perhaps might still have been innocent still have been happy Oh La Rue this is beyond every thing I could have believed possible Upon my honour Miss replied the unfeeling woman with the utmost effrontery this is a most unaccountable address it is beyond my comprehension John continued she turning to the servant the young woman is certainly out of her senses do pray take her away she terrifies me to death Oh God cried Charlotte clasping her hands in an agony this is too much what will become of me but I will not leave you they shall not tear me from you here on my knees I conjure you to save me from perishing in the streets if you really have forgot me oh for charity s sweet sake this night let me be sheltered from the winter s piercing cold The kneeling figure of Charlotte in her affecting situation might have moved the heart of a stoic to compassion but missus Crayton remained inflexible In vain did Charlotte recount the time they had known each other at Chichester in vain mention their being in the same ship in vain were the names of Montraville and Belcour mentioned missus Crayton could only say she was sorry for her imprudence but could not think of having her own reputation endangered by encouraging a woman of that kind in her own house besides she did not know what trouble and expense she might bring upon her husband by giving shelter to a woman in her situation I can at least die here said Charlotte I feel I cannot long survive this dreadful conflict Father of mercy here let me finish my existence Her agonizing sensations overpowered her and she fell senseless on the floor Take her away said missus Crayton she will really frighten me into hysterics take her away I say this instant And where must I take the poor creature said the servant with a voice and look of compassion Any where cried she hastily only don t let me ever see her again I declare she has flurried me so I shan t be myself again this fortnight John assisted by his fellow servant raised and carried her down stairs Poor soul said he you shall not lay in the street this night I have a bed and a poor little hovel where my wife and her little ones rest them but they shall watch to night and you shall be sheltered from danger They placed her in a chair and the benevolent man assisted by one of his comrades carried her to the place where his wife and children lived A surgeon was sent for he bled her she gave signs of returning life and before the dawn gave birth to a female infant After this event she lay for some hours in a kind of stupor and if at any time she spoke it was with a quickness and incoherence that plainly evinced the total deprivation of her reason CHAPTER XXXII REASONS WHY AND WHEREFORE THE reader of sensibility may perhaps be astonished to find missus Crayton could so positively deny any knowledge of Charlotte it is therefore but just that her conduct should in some measure be accounted for She had ever been fully sensible of the superiority of Charlotte s sense and virtue she was conscious that she had never swerved from rectitude had it not been for her bad precepts and worse example These were things as yet unknown to her husband and she wished not to have that part of her conduct exposed to him as she had great reason to fear she had already lost considerable part of that power she once maintained over him She trembled whilst Charlotte was in the house lest the Colonel should return she perfectly well remembered how much he seemed interested in her favour whilst on their passage from England and made no doubt but should he see her in her present distress he would offer her an asylum and protect her to the utmost of his power In that case she feared the unguarded nature of Charlotte might discover to the Colonel the part she had taken in the unhappy girl s elopement and she well knew the contrast between her own and Charlotte s conduct would make the former appear in no very respectable light Had she reflected properly she would have afforded the poor girl protection and by enjoining her silence ensured it by acts of repeated kindness but vice in general blinds its votaries and they discover their real characters to the world when they are most studious to preserve appearances Just so it happened with missus Crayton her servants made no scruple of mentioning the cruel conduct of their lady to a poor distressed lunatic who claimed her protection every one joined in reprobating her inhumanity nay even Corydon thought she might at least have ordered her to be taken care of but he dare not even hint it to her for he lived but in her smiles and drew from her lavish fondness large sums to support an extravagance to which the state of his own finances was very inadequate it cannot therefore be supposed that he wished missus Crayton to be very liberal in her bounty to the afflicted suppliant yet vice had not so entirely seared over his heart but the sorrows of Charlotte could find a vulnerable part Charlotte had now been three days with her humane preservers but she was totally insensible of every thing she raved incessantly for Montraville and her father she was not conscious of being a mother nor took the least notice of her child except to ask whose it was and why it was not carried to its parents Oh said she one day starting up on hearing the infant cry why why will you keep that child here I am sure you would not if you knew how hard it was for a mother to be parted from her infant it is like tearing the cords of life asunder Oh could you see the horrid sight which I now behold there there stands my dear mother her poor bosom bleeding at every vein her gentle affectionate heart torn in a thousand pieces and all for the loss of a ruined ungrateful child Save me save me from her frown I dare not indeed I dare not speak to her Such were the dreadful images that haunted her distracted mind and nature was sinking fast under the dreadful malady which medicine had no power to remove The surgeon who attended her was a humane man he exerted his utmost abilities to save her but he saw she was in want of many necessaries and comforts which the poverty of her hospitable host rendered him unable to provide he therefore determined to make her situation known to some of the officers ladies and endeavour to make a collection for her relief When he returned home after making this resolution he found a message from missus Beauchamp who had just arrived from Rhode Island requesting he would call and see one of her children who was very unwell I do not know said he as he was hastening to obey the summons I do not know a woman to whom I could apply with more hope of success than missus Beauchamp I will endeavour to interest her in this poor girl s behalf she wants the soothing balm of friendly consolation we may perhaps save her we will try at least And where is she cried missus Beauchamp when he had prescribed something for the child and told his little pathetic tale where is she Sir we will go to her immediately Heaven forbid that I should be deaf to the calls of humanity Come we will go this instant Then seizing the doctor s arm they sought the habitation that contained the dying Charlotte CHAPTER XXXIII WHICH PEOPLE VOID OF FEELING NEED NOT READ WHEN missus Beauchamp entered the apartment of the poor sufferer she started back with horror On a wretched bed without hangings and but poorly supplied with covering lay the emaciated figure of what still retained the semblance of a lovely woman though sickness had so altered her features that missus Beauchamp had not the least recollection of her person In one corner of the room stood a woman washing and shivering over a small fire two healthy but half naked children the infant was asleep beside its mother and on a chair by the bed side stood a porrenger and wooden spoon containing a little gruel and a tea cup with about two spoonfulls of wine in it missus Beauchamp had never before beheld such a scene of poverty she shuddered involuntarily and exclaiming heaven preserve us leaned on the back of a chair ready to sink to the earth The doctor repented having so precipitately brought her into this affecting scene but there was no time for apologies Charlotte caught the sound of her voice and starting almost out of bed exclaimed Angel of peace and mercy art thou come to deliver me Oh I know you are for whenever you was near me I felt eased of half my sorrows but you don t know me nor can I with all the recollection I am mistress of remember your name just now but I know that benevolent countenance and the softness of that voice which has so often comforted the wretched Charlotte missus Beauchamp had during the time Charlotte was speaking seated herself on the bed and taken one of her hands she looked at her attentively and at the name of Charlotte she perfectly conceived the whole shocking affair A faint sickness came over her Gracious heaven said she is this possible and bursting into tears she reclined the burning head of Charlotte on her own bosom and folding her arms about her wept over her in silence Oh said Charlotte you are very good to weep thus for me it is a long time since I shed a tear for myself my head and heart are both on fire but these tears of your s seem to cool and refresh it Oh now I remember you said you would send a letter to my poor father do you think he ever received it or perhaps you have brought me an answer why don t you speak Madam Does he say I may go home Well he is very good I shall soon be ready She then made an effort to get out of bed but being prevented her frenzy again returned and she raved with the greatest wildness and incoherence missus Beauchamp finding it was impossible for her to be removed contented herself with ordering the apartment to be made more comfortable and procuring a proper nurse for both mother and child and having learnt the particulars of Charlotte s fruitless application to missus Crayton from honest John she amply rewarded him for his benevolence and returned home with a heart oppressed with many painful sensations but yet rendered easy by the reflexion that she had performed her duty towards a distressed fellow creature Early the next morning she again visited Charlotte and found her tolerably composed she called her by name thanked her for her goodness and when her child was brought to her pressed it in her arms wept over it and called it the offspring of disobedience missus Beauchamp was delighted to see her so much amended and began to hope she might recover and spite of her former errors become an useful and respectable member of society but the arrival of the doctor put an end to these delusive hopes he said nature was making her last effort and a few hours would most probably consign the unhappy girl to her kindred dust Being asked how she found herself she replied Why better much better doctor I hope now I have but little more to suffer I had last night a few hours sleep and when I awoke recovered the full power of recollection I am quite sensible of my weakness I feel I have but little longer to combat with the shafts of affliction I have an humble confidence in the mercy of him who died to save the world and trust that my sufferings in this state of mortality joined to my unfeigned repentance through his mercy have blotted my offences from the sight of my offended maker I have but one care my poor infant Father of mercy continued she raising her eyes of thy infinite goodness grant that the sins of the parent be not visited on the unoffending child May those who taught me to despise thy laws be forgiven lay not my offences to their charge I beseech thee and oh shower the choicest of thy blessings on those whose pity has soothed the afflicted heart and made easy even the bed of pain and sickness She was exhausted by this fervent address to the throne of mercy and though her lips still moved her voice became inarticulate she lay for some time as it were in a doze and then recovering faintly pressed missus Beauchamp s hand and requested that a clergyman might be sent for On his arrival she joined fervently in the pious office frequently mentioning her ingratitude to her parents as what lay most heavy at her heart When she had performed the last solemn duty and was preparing to lie down a little bustle on the outside door occasioned missus Beauchamp to open it and enquire the cause A man in appearance about forty presented himself and asked for missus Beauchamp That is my name Sir said she Oh then my dear Madam cried he tell me where I may find my poor ruined but repentant child missus Beauchamp was surprised and affected she knew not what to say she foresaw the agony this interview would occasion mister Temple who had just arrived in search of his Charlotte and yet was sensible that the pardon and blessing of her father would soften even the agonies of death to the daughter She hesitated Tell me Madam cried he wildly tell me I beseech thee does she live shall I see my darling once again Perhaps she is in this house Lead lead me to her that I may bless her and then lie down and die The ardent manner in which he uttered these words occasioned him to raise his voice It caught the ear of Charlotte she knew the beloved sound and uttering a loud shriek she sprang forward as mister Temple entered the room My adored father My long lost child Nature could support no more and they both sunk lifeless into the arms of the attendants Charlotte was again put into bed and a few moments restored mister Temple but to describe the agony of his sufferings is past the power of any one who though they may readily conceive cannot delineate the dreadful scene Every eye gave testimony of what each heart felt but all were silent When Charlotte recovered she found herself supported in her father s arms She cast on him a most expressive look but was unable to speak A reviving cordial was administered She then asked in a low voice for her child it was brought to her she put it in her father s arms Protect her said she and bless your dying Unable to finish the sentence she sunk back on her pillow her countenance was serenely composed she regarded her father as he pressed the infant to his breast with a steadfast look a sudden beam of joy passed across her languid features she raised her eyes to heaven and then closed them for ever CHAPTER XXXIV RETRIBUTION IN the mean time Montraville having received orders to return to New York arrived and having still some remains of compassionate tenderness for the woman whom he regarded as brought to shame by himself he went out in search of Belcour to enquire whether she was safe and whether the child lived He found him immersed in dissipation and could gain no other intelligence than that Charlotte had left him and that he knew not what was become of her I cannot believe it possible said Montraville that a mind once so pure as Charlotte Temple s should so suddenly become the mansion of vice Beware Belcour continued he beware if you have dared to behave either unjust or dishonourably to that poor girl your life shall pay the forfeit I will revenge her cause He immediately went into the country to the house where he had left Charlotte It was desolate After much enquiry he at length found the servant girl who had lived with her From her he learnt the misery Charlotte had endured from the complicated evils of illness poverty and a broken heart and that she had set out on foot for New York on a cold winter s evening but she could inform him no further Tortured almost to madness by this shocking account he returned to the city but before he reached it the evening was drawing to a close In entering the town he was obliged to pass several little huts the residence of poor women who supported themselves by washing the cloaths of the officers and soldiers It was nearly dark he heard from a neighbouring steeple a solemn toll that seemed to say some poor mortal was going to their last mansion the sound struck on the heart of Montraville and he involuntarily stopped when from one of the houses he saw the appearance of a funeral Almost unknowing what he did he followed at a small distance and as they let the coffin into the grave he enquired of a soldier who stood by and had just brushed off a tear that did honour to his heart who it was that was just buried An please your honour said the man tis a poor girl that was brought from her friends by a cruel man who left her when she was big with child and married another Montraville stood motionless and the man proceeded I met her myself not a fortnight since one night all wet and cold in the streets she went to Madam Crayton s but she would not take her in and so the poor thing went raving mad Montraville could bear no more he struck his hands against his forehead with violence and exclaiming poor murdered Charlotte ran with precipitation towards the place where they were heaping the earth on her remains Hold hold one moment said he Close not the grave of the injured Charlotte Temple till I have taken vengeance on her murderer Rash young man said mister Temple who art thou that thus disturbest the last mournful rites of the dead and rudely breakest in upon the grief of an afflicted father If thou art the father of Charlotte Temple said he gazing at him with mingled horror and amazement if thou art her father I am Montraville Then falling on his knees he continued Here is my bosom I bare it to receive the stroke I merit Strike strike now and save me from the misery of reflexion Alas said mister Temple if thou wert the seducer of my child thy own reflexions be thy punishment I wrest not the power from the hand of omnipotence Look on that little heap of earth there hast thou buried the only joy of a fond father Look at it often and may thy heart feel such true sorrow as shall merit the mercy of heaven He turned from him and Montraville starting up from the ground where he had thrown himself and at that instant remembering the perfidy of Belcour flew like lightning to his lodgings Belcour was intoxicated Montraville impetuous they fought and the sword of the latter entered the heart of his adversary He fell and expired almost instantly Montraville had received a slight wound and overcome with the agitation of his mind and loss of blood was carried in a state of insensibility to his distracted wife A dangerous illness and obstinate delirium ensued during which he raved incessantly for Charlotte but a strong constitution and the tender assiduities of Julia in time overcame the disorder He recovered but to the end of his life was subject to severe fits of melancholy and while he remained at New York frequently retired to the church yard where he would weep over the grave and regret the untimely fate of the lovely Charlotte Temple CHAPTER XXXV CONCLUSION SHORTLY after the interment of his daughter mister Temple with his dear little charge and her nurse set forward for England It would be impossible to do justice to the meeting scene between him his Lucy and her aged father Every heart of sensibility can easily conceive their feelings After the first tumult of grief was subsided missus Temple gave up the chief of her time to her grand child and as she grew up and improved began to almost fancy she again possessed her Charlotte It was about ten years after these painful events that mister and missus Temple having buried their father were obliged to come to London on particular business and brought the little Lucy with them They had been walking one evening when on their return they found a poor wretch sitting on the steps of the door She attempted to rise as they approached but from extreme weakness was unable and after several fruitless efforts fell back in a fit mister Temple was not one of those men who stand to consider whether by assisting an object in distress they shall not inconvenience themselves but instigated by the impulse of a noble feeling heart immediately ordered her to be carried into the house and proper restoratives applied She soon recovered and fixing her eyes on missus Temple cried You know not Madam what you do you know not whom you are relieving or you would curse me in the bitterness of your heart Come not near me Madam I shall contaminate you I am the viper that stung your peace I am the woman who turned the poor Charlotte out to perish in the street Heaven have mercy I see her now continued she looking at Lucy such such was the fair bud of innocence that my vile arts blasted ere it was half blown It was in vain that mister and missus Temple intreated her to be composed and to take some refreshment She only drank half a glass of wine and then told them that she had been separated from her husband seven years the chief of which she had passed in riot dissipation and vice till overtaken by poverty and sickness she had been reduced to part with every valuable and thought only of ending her life in a prison when a benevolent friend paid her debts and released her but that her illness increasing she had no possible means of supporting herself and her friends were weary of relieving her I have fasted said she two days and last night lay my aching head on the cold pavement indeed it was but just that I should experience those miseries myself which I had unfeelingly inflicted on others Greatly as mister Temple had reason to detest missus Crayton he could not behold her in this distress without some emotions of pity He gave her shelter that night beneath his hospitable roof and the next day got her admission into an hospital where having lingered a few weeks she died a striking example that vice however prosperous in the beginning in the
