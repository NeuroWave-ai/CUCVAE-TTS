none	none	 XXVII Blue Ribbon Corn XXVIII The Eleventh Hour To Gene Stratton II A DAUGHTER OF THE LAND CHAPTER I THE WINGS OF MORNING TAKE the wings of Morning Kate Bates followed the narrow footpath rounding the corner of the small country church as the old minister raised his voice slowly and impressively to repeat the command he had selected for his text Fearing that her head would be level with the windows she bent and walked swiftly past the church but the words went with her iterating and reiterating themselves in her brain Once she paused to glance back toward the church wondering what the minister would say in expounding that text She had a fleeting thought of slipping in taking the back seat and listening to the sermon The remembrance that she had not dressed for church deterred her then her face twisted grimly as she again turned to the path for it occurred to her that she had nothing else to wear if she had started to attend church instead of going to see her brother As usual she had left her bed at four o clock for seven hours she had cooked washed dishes made beds swept dusted milked churned following the usual routine of a big family in the country Then she had gone upstairs dressed in clean gingham and confronted her mother I think I have done my share for to day she said Suppose you call on our lady school mistress for help with dinner I m going to Adam s missus Bates lifted her gaunt form to very close six feet of height looking narrowly at her daughter Well what the nation are you going to Adam s at this time a Sunday for she demanded Oh I have a curiosity to learn if

none	none	is one of the eighteen members of this family who gives a cent what becomes of me answered Kate her eyes meeting and looking clearly into her mother s You are not letting yourself think he would give a cent to send you to that fool normal thing are you I am not But it wasn t a fool thing when Mary and Nancy Ellen and the older girls wanted to go You even let Mary go to college two years Mary had exceptional ability said missus Bates I wonder how she convinced you of it None of the rest of us can discover it said Kate What you need is a good strapping Miss I know it but considering the facts that I am larger than you and was eighteen in September I shouldn t advise you to attempt it What is the difference whether I was born in sixty two or forty two Give me the chance you gave Mary and I ll prove to you that I can do anything she has done without having exceptional ability The difference is that I am past sixty now I was stout as an ox when Mary wanted to go to school It is your duty and your job to stay here and do this work To pay for having been born last Not a bit more than if I had been born first Any girl in the family owes you as much for life as I do it is up to the others to pay back in service after they are of age if it is to me I have done my share If Father were not the richest farmer in the county and one of the richest men it would be different He can afford to hire help for you quite as well as he can for himself Hire help Who would I get to do the work here You d have to double your assistants You could not hire two women who would come here and do so much work as I do in a day That is why I decline to give up teaching and stay here to slave at your option for gingham dresses and cowhide shoes of your selection If I were a boy I d work three years more and then I would be given two hundred acres of land have a house and barn built for me and a start of stock given me as every boy in this family has had at twenty one A man is a man He founds a family he runs the Government It is a different matter said missus Bates It surely is in this family But I think even with us a man would have rather a difficult proposition on his hands to found a family without a woman or to run the Government either All right Go on to Adam and see what you get I ll have the satisfaction of knowing that Nancy Ellen gets dinner anyway said Kate as she passed through the door and followed the long path to the gate from there walking beside the road in the direction of her brother s home There were many horses in the pasture and single and double buggies in the barn but it never occurred to Kate that she might ride it was Sunday and the horses were resting So she followed the path beside the fences rounded the corner of the church and went on her way with the text from which the pastor was preaching hammering in her brain She became so absorbed in thought that she scarcely saw the footpath she followed while June flowered and perfumed and sang all around her She was so intent upon the words she had heard that her feet unconsciously followed a well defined branch from the main path leading into the woods from the bridge where she sat on a log and for the unnumbered time reviewed her problem She had worked ever since she could remember Never in her life had she gotten to school before noon on Monday because of the large washings After the other work was finished she had spent nights and mornings ironing when she longed to study seldom finishing before Saturday Summer brought an endless round of harvesting canning drying winter brought butchering heaps of sewing and postponed summer work School began late in the fall and closed early in spring with teachers often inefficient yet because she was a close student and kept her books where she could take a peep and memorize and think as she washed dishes and cooked she had thoroughly mastered all the country school near her home could teach her With six weeks of a summer Normal course she would be as well prepared to teach as any of her sisters were with the exception of Mary who had been able to convince her parents that she possessed two college years worth of ability Kate laid no claim to ability herself but she knew she was as strong as most men had an ordinary brain that could be trained and while she was far from beautiful she was equally as far from being ugly for her skin was smooth and pink her eyes large and blue gray her teeth even and white She missed beauty because her cheekbones were high her mouth large her nose barely escaping a pug but she had a real crown of glory in her hair which was silken fine long and heavy of sunshine gold in colour curling naturally around her face and neck Given pure blood to paint such a skin with varying emotions enough wind to ravel out a few locks of such hair the proportions of a Venus and perfect health any girl could rest very well assured of being looked at twice if not oftener Kate sat on a log a most unusual occurrence for her for she was familiar only with bare hot houses furnished with meagre necessities reeking stables barnyards and vegetable gardens She knew less of the woods than the average city girl but there was a soothing wind a sweet perfume a calming silence that quieted her tense mood and enabled her to think clearly so the review went on over years of work and petty economies amounting to one grand aggregate that gave to each of seven sons house stock and land at twenty one and to each of nine daughters a bolt of muslin and a fairly decent dress when she married as the seven older ones did speedily for they were fine large upstanding girls some having real beauty all exceptionally well trained economists and workers Because her mother had the younger daughters to help in the absence of the elder each girl had been allowed the time and money to prepare herself to teach a country school all of them had taught until they married Nancy Ellen the beauty of the family the girl next older than Kate had taken the home school for the second winter Going to school to Nancy Ellen had been the greatest trial of Kate s life until the possibility of not going to Normal had confronted her Nancy Ellen was almost as large as Kate quite as pink her features assembled in a manner that made all the difference her jet black hair as curly as Kate s her eyes big and dark her lips red As for looking at Kate twice no one ever looked at her at all if Nancy Ellen happened to be walking beside her Kate bore that without protest it would have wounded her pride to rebel openly she did Nancy Ellen s share of the work to allow her to study and have her Normal course she remained at home plainly clothed to loan Nancy Ellen her best dress when she attended Normal but when she found that she was doomed to finish her last year at school under Nancy Ellen to work double so that her sister might go to school early and remain late coming home tired and with lessons to prepare for the morrow some of the spontaneity left Kate s efforts She had a worse grievance when Nancy Ellen hung several new dresses and a wrapper on her side of the closet after her first pay day and furnished her end of the bureau with a white hair brush and a brass box filled with pink powder with a swan s down puff for its application For three months Kate had waited and hoped that at least thank you would be vouchsafed her when it failed for that length of time she did two things she studied so diligently that her father called her into the barn and told her that if before the school she asked Nancy Ellen another question she could not answer he would use the buggy whip on her to within an inch of her life The buggy whip always had been a familiar implement to Kate so she stopped asking slippery questions worked harder than ever and spent her spare time planning what she would hang in the closet and put on her end of the bureau when she had finished her Normal course and was teaching her first term of school Now she had learned all that Nancy Ellen could teach her and much that Nancy Ellen never knew it was time for Kate to be starting away to school Because it was so self evident that she should have what the others had had she said nothing about it until the time came then she found her father determined that she should remain at home to do the housework for no compensation other than her board and such clothes as she always had worn her mother wholly in accord with him and marvel of all Nancy Ellen quite enthusiastic on the subject Her father always had driven himself and his family like slaves while her mother had ably seconded his efforts Money from the sale of chickens turkeys butter eggs and garden truck that other women of the neighbourhood used for extra clothing for themselves and their daughters and to prettify their homes missus Bates handed to her husband to increase the amount necessary to purchase the two hundred acres of land for each son when he came of age The youngest son had farmed his land with comfortable profit and started a bank account while his parents and two sisters were still saving and working to finish the last payment Kate thought with bitterness that if this final payment had been made possibly there would have been money to spare for her but with that thought came the knowledge that her father had numerous investments on which he could have realized and made the payments had he not preferred that they should be a burden on his family Take the wings of morning repeated Kate with all the emphasis the old minister had used Hummm I wonder what kind of wings Those of a peewee would scarcely do for me I d need the wings of an eagle to get me anywhere and anyway it wasn t the wings of a bird I was to take it was the wings of morning I wonder what the wings of morning are and how I go about taking them God knows where my wings come in by the ache in my feet I seem to have walked mostly Oh what ARE the wings of morning Kate stared straight before her sitting absorbed and motionless Close in front of her a little white moth fluttered over the twigs and grasses A kingbird sailed into view and perched on a brush heap preparatory to darting after the moth While the bird measured the distance and waited for the moth to rise above the entangling grasses with a sweep and a snap a smaller bird very similar in shape and colouring flashed down catching the moth and flying high among the branches of a big tree Aha You missed your opportunity said Kate to the kingbird She sat straighter suddenly Opportunity she repeated Here is where I am threatened with missing mine Opportunity I wonder now if that might not be another name for the wings of morning Morning is winging its way past me the question is do I sit still and let it pass or do I take its wings and fly away Kate brooded on that awhile then her thought formulated into words again It isn t as if Mother were sick or poor she is perfectly well and stronger than nine women out of ten of her age Father can afford to hire all the help she needs there is nothing cruel or unkind in leaving her and as for Nancy Ellen why does the fact that I am a few years younger than she make me her servant Why do I cook for her and make her bed and wash her clothes while she earns money to spend on herself And she is doing everything in her power to keep me at it because she likes what she is doing and what it brings her and she doesn t give a tinker whether I like what I am doing or not or whether I get anything I want out of it or not or whether I miss getting off to Normal on time or not She is blame selfish that s what she is so she won t like the jolt she s going to get but it will benefit her soul her soul that her pretty face keeps her from developing so I shall give her a little valuable assistance Mother will be furious and Father will have the buggy whip convenient but I am going I don t know how or when but I am GOING Who has a thirst for knowledge in Helicon may slake it If he has still the Roman will to find a way or make it Kate arose tall and straight and addressed the surrounding woods Now you just watch me find a way or make it she said I am taking the wings of morning observe my flight See me cut curves and circles and sail and soar around all the other Bates girls the Lord ever made one named Nancy Ellen in particular It must be far past noon and I ve much to do to get ready I fly Kate walked back to the highway but instead of going on she turned toward home When she reached the gate she saw Nancy Ellen dressed her prettiest sitting beneath a cherry tree reading a book in very plain view from the road As Kate came up the path Hello said Nancy Ellen Wasn t Adam at home I don t know answered Kate I was not there You weren t Why where were you asked Nancy Ellen Oh I just took a walk answered Kate Right at dinner time on Sunday Well I ll be switched cried Nancy Ellen Pity you weren t oftener when you most needed it said Kate passing up the walk and entering the door Her mother asked the same questions so Kate answered them Well I am glad you came home said missus Bates There was no use tagging to Adam with a sorry story when your father said flatly that you couldn t go But I must go urged Kate I have as good a right to my chance as the others If you put your foot down and say so Mother Father will let me go Why shouldn t I have the same chance as Nancy Ellen Please Mother let me go You stay right where you are There is an awful summer s work before us said missus Bates There always is answered Kate But now is just my chance while you have Nancy Ellen here to help you She has some special studying to do and you very well know that she has to attend the County Institute and take the summer course of training for teachers So do I said Kate stubbornly You really will not help me Mother I ve said my say Your place is here Here you stay answered her mother All right said Kate I ll cross you off the docket of my hopes and try Father Well I warn you you had better not He has been nagged until his patience is lost said missus Bates Kate closed her lips and started in search of her father She found him leaning on the pig pen watching pigs grow into money one of his most favoured occupations He scowled at her drawing his huge frame to full height I don t want to hear a word you have to say he said You are the youngest and your place is in the kitchen helping your mother We have got the last installment to pay on Hiram s land this summer March back to the house and busy yourself with something useful Kate looked at him from his big boned weather beaten face to his heavy shoes then turned without a word and went back toward the house She went around it to the cherry tree and with no preliminaries said to her sister Nancy Ellen I want you to lend me enough money to fix my clothes a little and pay my way to Normal this summer I can pay it all back this winter I ll pay every cent with interest before I spend any on anything else Why you must be crazy said Nancy Ellen Would I be any crazier than you when you wanted to go asked Kate But you were here to help Mother said Nancy Ellen And you are here to help her now persisted Kate But I ve got to fix up my clothes for the County Institute said Nancy Ellen I ll be gone most of the summer I have just as much right to go as you had said Kate Father and Mother both say you shall not go answered her sister I suppose there is no use to remind you that I did all in my power to help you to your chance You did no more than you should have done said Nancy Ellen And this is no more than you should do for me in the circumstances said Kate You very well know I can t Father and Mother would turn me out of the house said Nancy Ellen I d be only too glad if they would turn me out said Kate You can let me have the money if you like Mother wouldn t do anything but talk and Father would not strike you or make you go he always favours you He does nothing of the sort I can t and I won t so there cried Nancy Ellen Won t is the real answer so there said Kate She went into the cellar and ate some cold food from the cupboard and drank a cup of milk Then she went to her room and looked over all of her scanty stock of clothing laying in a heap the pieces that needed mending She took the clothes basket to the wash room which was the front of the woodhouse in summer built a fire heated water and while making it appear that she was putting the clothes to soak as usual she washed everything she had that was fit to use hanging the pieces to dry in the building Watch me fly muttered Kate I don t seem to be cutting those curves so very fast but I m moving I believe now having exhausted all home resources that Adam is my next objective He is the only one in the family who ever paid the slightest attention to me maybe he cares a trifle what becomes of me but Oh how I dread Agatha However watch me take wing If Adam fails me I have six remaining prospects among my loving brothers and if none of them has any feeling for me or faith in me there yet remain my seven dear brothers in law before I appeal to the tender mercies of the neighbours but how I dread Agatha Yet I fly CHAPTER II AN EMBRYO MIND READER KATE was far from physical flight as she pounded the indignation of her soul into the path with her substantial feet Baffled and angry she kept reviewing the situation as she went swiftly on her way regardless of dust and heat She could see no justice in being forced into a position that promised to end in further humiliation and defeat of her hopes If she only could find Adam at the stable as she passed and talk with him alone Secretly she well knew that the chief source of her dread of meeting her sister in law was that to her Agatha was so funny that ridiculing her had been regarded as perfectly legitimate pastime For Agatha WAS funny but she had no idea of it and could no more avoid it than a bee could avoid being buzzy so the manner in which her sisters in law imitated her and laughed at her none too secretly was far from kind While she never guessed what was going on she realized the antagonism in their attitude and stoutly resented it Adam was his father s favourite son a stalwart fine appearing big man silent honest and forceful the son most after the desires of the father s heart yet Adam was the one son of the seven who had ignored his father s law that all of his boys were to marry strong healthy young women poor women working women Each of the others at coming of age had contracted this prescribed marriage as speedily as possible first asking father Bates the girl afterward If father Bates disapproved the girl was never asked at all And the reason for this docility on the part of these big matured men lay wholly in the methods of father Bates He gave those two hundred acres of land to each of them on coming of age and the same sum to each for the building of a house and barn and the purchase of stock gave it to them in words and with the fullest assurance that it was theirs to improve to live on to add to Each of them had seen and handled his deed each had to admit he never had known his father to tell a lie or deviate the least from fairness in a deal of any kind each had been compelled to go in the way indicated by his father for years but not a man of them held his own deed These precious bits of paper remained locked in the big wooden chest beside the father s bed while the land stood on the records in his name the taxes they paid him each year he himself carried to the county clerk so that he was the largest landholder in the county and one of the very richest men It must have been extreme unction to his soul to enter the county office and ask for the assessment on those little parcels of land of mine Men treated him very deferentially and so did his sons Those documents carefully locked away had the effect of obtaining ever ready help to harvest his hay and wheat whenever he desired to make his least wish quickly deferred to to give him authority and the power for which he lived and worked earlier later and harder than any other man of his day and locality Adam was like him as possible up to the time he married yet Adam was the only one of his sons who disobeyed him but there was a redeeming feature Adam married a slender tall slip of a woman four years his senior who had been teaching in the Hartley schools when he began courting her She was a prim fussy woman born of a prim father and a fussy mother so what was to be expected Her face was narrow and set her body and her movements almost rigid her hair always parted lifted from each side and tied on the crown fell in stiff little curls the back part hanging free Her speech as precise as her movements was formed into set habit through long study of the dictionary She was born antagonistic to whatever existed no matter what it was So surely as every other woman agreed on a dress a recipe a house anything whatever so surely Agatha thought out and followed a different method the disconcerting thing about her being that she usually finished any undertaking with less exertion ahead of time and having saved considerable money She could have written a fine book of synonyms for as certainly as any one said anything in her presence that she had occasion to repeat she changed the wording to six syllabled mouthfuls delivered with ponderous circumlocution She subscribed to papers and magazines which she read and remembered And she danced When other women thought even a waltz immoral and shocking perfectly stiff her curls exactly in place Agatha could be seen and frequently was seen waltzing on the front porch in the arms of and to a tune whistled by young Adam whose full name was Adam Alcibiades Bates In his younger days when discipline had been required Kate once had heard her say to the little fellow Adam Alcibiades ascend these steps and proceed immediately to your maternal ancestor Kate thought of this with a dry smile as she plodded on toward Agatha s home hoping she could see her brother at the barn but she knew that most probably she would ascend the steps and proceed to the maternal ancestor of Adam Bates threed Then she would be forced to explain her visit and combat both Adam and his wife for Agatha was not a nonentity like her collection of healthful hard working sisters in law Agatha worked if she chose and she did not work if she did not choose Mostly she worked and worked harder than any one ever thought She had a habit of keeping her house always immaculate finishing her cleaning very early and then reading in a conspicuous spot on the veranda when other women were busy with their most tiresome tasks Such was Agatha whom Kate dreaded meeting with every reason for Agatha despite curls bony structure language and dance was the most powerful factor in the whole Bates family with her father in law and all because when he purchased the original two hundred acres for Adam and made the first allowance for buildings and stock Agatha slipped the money from Adam s fingers in some inexplainable way and spent it all for stock because forsooth Agatha was an only child and her prim father endowed her she said so herself with three hundred acres of land better in location and more fertile than that given to Adam land having on it a roomy and comfortable brick house completely furnished a large barn and also stock so that her place could be used to live on and farm while Adam s could be given over to grazing herds of cattle which he bought cheaply fattened and sold at the top of the market If each had brought such a farm into the family with her father Bates could have endured six more prim angular becurled daughters in law very well indeed for land was his one and only God His respect for Agatha was markedly very high for in addition to her farm he secretly admired her independence of thought and action and was amazed by the fact that she was about her work when several of the blooming girls he had selected for wives for his sons were confined to the sofa with a pain while not one of them schemed planned connived with her husband and piled up the money as Agatha did therefore she stood at the head of the women of the Bates family while she was considered to have worked miracles in the heart of Adam Bates for with his exception no man of the family ever had been seen to touch a woman either publicly or privately to offer the slightest form of endearment assistance or courtesy Women are to work and to bear children said the elder Bates Put them at the first job when they are born and at the second at eighteen and keep them hard at it At their rate of progression several of the Bates sons and daughters would produce families that with a couple of pairs of twins would equal the sixteen of the elder Bates but not so Agatha She had one son of fifteen and one daughter of ten and she said that was all she intended to have certainly it was all she did have but she further aggravated matters by announcing that she had had them because she wanted them at such times as she intended to and that she had the boy first and five years the older so that he could look after his sister when they went into company Also she walked up and sat upon Adam s lap whenever she chose ruffled his hair pulled his ears and kissed him squarely on the mouth with every appearance of having help while the dance on the front porch with her son or daughter was of daily occurrence And anything funnier than Agatha prim and angular with never a hair out of place stiffly hopping Money Musk and Turkey In The Straw or the Blue Danube waltz anything funnier than that never happened But the two Adams junior and threed watched with reverent and adoring eyes for she was MOTHER and no one else on earth rested so high in their respect as the inflexible woman they lived with That she was different from all the other women of her time and location was hard on the other women Had they been exactly right they would have been exactly like her So Kate thinking all these things over her own problem acutely advanced and proceeded She advanced past the closed barn and stock in the pasture past the garden flaming June past the dooryard up the steps down the hall into the screened back porch dining room and proceeded to take a chair while the family finished the Sunday night supper at which they were seated Kate was not hungry and she did not wish to trouble her sister in law to set another place so she took the remaining chair against the wall behind Agatha facing Adam threed across the table and with Adam junior in profile at the head and little Susan at the foot Then she waited her chance Being tired and aggressive she did not wait long I might as well tell you why I came she said bluntly Father won t give me money to go to Normal as he has all the others He says I have got to stay at home and help Mother Well Mother is getting so old she needs help said Adam junior as he continued his supper Of course she is said Kate We all know that But what is the matter with Nancy Ellen helping her while I take my turn at Normal There wasn t a thing I could do last summer to help her off that I didn t do even to lending her my best dress and staying at home for six Sundays because I had nothing else fit to wear where I d be seen No one said a word Kate continued Then Father secured our home school for her and I had to spend the winter going to school to her when you very well know that I always studied harder and was ahead of her even after she d been to Normal And I got up early and worked late and cooked and washed and waited on her while she got her lessons and reports ready and fixed up her nice new clothes and now she won t touch the work and she is doing all she can to help Father keep me from going I never knew Father to need much help on anything he made up his mind to said Adam Kate sat very tense She looked steadily at her brother but he looked quite as steadily at his plate The back of her sister in law was fully as expressive as her face Her head was very erect her shoulders stiff and still not a curl moved as she poured Adam s tea and Susan s milk Only Adam threed looked at Kate with companionable eyes as if he might feel a slight degree of interest or sympathy so she found herself explaining directly to him Things are blame unfair in our family anyway she said bitterly You have got to be born a boy to have any chance worth while if you are a girl it is mighty small and if you are the youngest by any mischance you have none at all I don t want to harp things over but I wish you would explain to me why having been born a few years after Nancy Ellen makes me her slave and cuts me out of my chance to teach and to have some freedom and clothes They might as well have told Hiram he was not to have any land and stay at home and help Father because he was the youngest boy it would have been quite as fair but nothing like that happens to the boys of this family it is always the girls who get left I have worked for years knowing every cent I saved and earned above barely enough to cover me would go to help pay for Hiram s land and house and stock but he wouldn t turn a hand to help me neither will any of the rest of you Then what are you here for asked Adam Because I am going to give you and every other brother and sister I have the chance to REFUSE to loan me enough to buy a few clothes and pay my way to Normal so I can pass the examinations and teach this fall And when you have all refused I am going to the neighbours until I find someone who will loan me the money I need A hundred dollars would be plenty I could pay it back with two months teaching with any interest you say Kate paused short of breath her eyes blazing her cheeks red Adam went steadily on with his supper Agatha appeared stiffer and more uncompromising in the back than before which Kate had not thought possible But the same dull red on the girl s cheeks had begun to burn on the face of young Adam Suddenly he broke into a clear laugh Oh Ma you re too funny he cried I can read your face like a book I bet you ten dollars I can tell you just word for word what you are going to say I dare you let me You know I can Still laughing his eyes dancing a picture to see he stretched his arm across the table toward her and his mother adored him however she strove to conceal the fact from him Ten dollars she scoffed When did we become so wealthy I ll give you one dollar if you tell me exactly what I was going to say The boy glanced at his father Oh this is too easy he cried It s like robbing the baby s bank And then to his mother You were just opening your lips to say Give it to her If you don t I will And you are even a little bit more of a brick than usual to do it It s a darned shame the way all of them impose on Kate There was a complete change in Agatha s back Adam junior laid down his fork and stared at his wife in deep amazement Adam threed stretched his hand farther toward his mother Give me that dollar he cajoled Well I am not concealing it in the sleeve of my garments she said If I have one it is reposing in my purse in juxtaposition to the other articles that belong there and if you receive it it will be bestowed upon you when I deem the occasion suitable Young Adam s fist came down with a smash I get the dollar he triumphed I TOLD you so I KNEW she was going to say it Ain t I a dandy mind reader though But it is bully for you Father because of course if Mother wouldn t let Kate have it you d HAVE to but if you DID it might make trouble with your paternal land grabber and endanger your precious deed that you hope to get in the sweet by and by But if Mother loans the money Grandfather can t say a word because it is her very own and didn t cost him anything and he always agrees with her anyway Hurrah for hurrah Kate Nancy Ellen may wash her own petticoat in the morning while I take you to the train You ll let me Father You did let me go to Hartley alone once I ll be careful I won t let a thing happen I ll come straight home And oh my dollar you and me I ll put you in the bank and let you grow to three You may go said his father promptly You shall proceed according to your Aunt Katherine s instructions said his mother at the same time Katie get your carpet sack When do we start demanded young Adam Morning will be all right with me you blessed youngun said Kate but I don t own a telescope or anything to put what little I have in and Nancy Ellen never would spare hers she will want to go to County Institute before I get back You may have mine said Agatha You are perfectly welcome to take it wherever your peregrinations lead you and return it when you please I shall proceed to my chamber and formulate your check immediately You are also welcome to my best hat and cape and any of my clothing or personal adornments you can use to advantage Oh Agatha I wish you were as big as a house like me said Kate joyfully I couldn t possibly crowd into anything you wear but it would almost tickle me to death to have Nancy Ellen know you let me take your things when she won t even offer me a dud of her old stuff I never remotely hoped for any of the new You shall have my cape and hat anyway The cape is new and very fashionable Come upstairs and try the hat said Agatha The cape was new and fashionable as Agatha had said it would not fasten at the neck but there would be no necessity that it should during July and August while it would improve any dress it was worn with on a cool evening The hat Kate could not possibly use with her large broad face and mass of hair but she was almost as pleased with the offer as if the hat had been most becoming Then Agatha brought out her telescope in which Kate laid the cape while Agatha wrote her a check for one hundred and twenty dollars and told her where and how to cash it The extra twenty was to buy a pair of new walking shoes some hose and a hat before she went to her train When they went downstairs Adam junior had a horse hitched and Adam threed drove her to her home where at the foot of the garden they took one long survey of the landscape and hid the telescope behind the privet bush Then Adam drove away quietly Kate entered the dooryard from the garden and soon afterward went to the wash room and hastily ironed her clothing Nancy Ellen had gone to visit a neighbour girl so Kate risked her remaining until after church in the evening She hurried to their room and mended all her own clothing she had laid out Then she deliberately went over Nancy Ellen s and helped herself to a pair of pretty nightdresses such as she had never owned a white embroidered petticoat the second best white dress and a most becoming sailor hat These she made into a parcel and carried to the wash room brought in the telescope and packed it hiding it under a workbench and covering it with shavings After that she went to her room and wrote a note and then slept deeply until the morning call She arose at once and went to the wash room but instead of washing the family clothing she took a bath in the largest tub and washed her hair to a state resembling spun gold During breakfast she kept sharp watch down the road When she saw Adam threed coming she stuck her note under the hook on which she had seen her father hang his hat all her life and carrying the telescope in the clothes basket covered with a rumpled sheet she passed across the yard and handed it over the fence to Adam climbed that same fence and they started toward Hartley Kate put the sailor hat on her head and sat very straight an anxious line crossing her forehead She was running away and if discovered there was the barest chance that her father might follow and make a most disagreeable scene before the train pulled out He had gone to a far field to plow corn and Kate fervently hoped he would plow until noon which he did Nancy Ellen washed the dishes and went into the front room to study while missus Bates put on her sunbonnet and began hoeing the potatoes Not one of the family noticed that Monday s wash was not on the clothes line as usual Kate and Adam drove as fast as they dared and on reaching town cashed the check decided that Nancy Ellen s hat would serve thus saving the price of a new one for emergencies that might arise bought the shoes and went to the depot where they had an anxious hour to wait I expect Grandpa will be pretty mad said Adam I am sure there is not the slightest chance but that he will be said Kate Dare you go back home when school is over he asked Probably not she answered What will you do he questioned When I investigated sister Nancy Ellen s bureau I found a list of the School Supervisors of the county so I am going to put in my spare time writing them about my qualifications to teach their schools this winter All the other girls did well and taught first class schools I shall also I am not a bit afraid but that I may take my choice of several When I finish it will be only a few days until school begins so I can go hunt my boarding place and stay there Mother would let you stay at our house said Adam Yes I think she would after yesterday but I don t want to make trouble that might extend to Father and your father I had better keep away Yes I guess you had said Adam If Grandfather rows he raises a racket But maybe he won t Maybe Wouldn t you like to see what happens when Mother come in from the potatoes and Nancy Ellen comes out from the living room and Father comes to dinner all about the same time Adam laughed appreciatively Wouldn t I just he cried Kate you like my mother don t you I certainly do She has been splendid I never dreamed of such a thing as getting the money from her I didn t either said Adam until I became a mind reader Kate looked straight into his eyes How about that Adam she asked Adam chuckled She didn t intend to say a word She was going to let the Bateses fight it out among themselves Her mouth was shut so tight it didn t look as if she could open it if she wanted to I thought it would be better for you to borrow the money from her so Father wouldn t get into a mess and I knew how fine she was so I just SUGGESTED it to her That s all Adam you re a dandy cried Kate I am having a whole buggy load of fun and you ought to go said he It s all right Don t you worry I ll take care of you Why thank you Adam said Kate That is the first time any one ever offered to take care of me in my life With me it always has been pretty much of a go it alone proposition What of Nancy Ellen s did you take he asked Why didn t you get some gloves Your hands are so red and work worn Mother s never look that way Your mother never has done the rough field work I do and I haven t taken time to be careful They do look badly I wish I had taken a pair of the lady s gloves but I doubt if she would have survived that I understand that one of the unpardonable sins is putting on gloves belonging to any one else Then the train came and Kate climbed aboard with Adam s parting injunction in her ears Sit beside an open window on this side So she looked for and found the window and as she seated herself she saw Adam on the outside and leaned to speak to him again Just as the train started he thrust his hand inside dropped his dollar on her lap and in a tense whisper commanded her Get yourself some gloves Then he ran Kate picked up the dollar while her eyes dimmed with tears Why the fine youngster she said The Jim dandy fine youngster Adam could not remember when he ever had been so happy as he was driving home He found his mother singing his father in a genial mood so he concluded that the greatest thing in the world to make a whole family happy was to do something kind for someone else But he reflected that there would be far from a happy family at his grandfather s and he was right Grandmother Bates came in from her hoeing at eleven o clock tired and hungry expecting to find the wash dry and dinner almost ready There was no wash and no odour of food She went to the wood shed and stared unbelievingly at the cold stove the tubs of soaking clothes She turned and went into the kitchen where she saw no signs of Kate or of dinner then she lifted up her voice and shouted Nancy Ellen Nancy Ellen came in a hurry Why Mother what is the matter she cried Matter yourself exclaimed missus Bates Look in the wash room Why aren t the clothes on the line Where is that good for nothing Kate Nancy Ellen went to the wash room and looked She came back pale and amazed Maybe she is sick she ventured She never has been but she might be Maybe she has lain down On Monday morning And the wash not out You simpleton cried missus Bates Nancy Ellen hurried upstairs and came back with bulging eyes Every scrap of her clothing is gone and half of mine She s gone to that fool Normal thing Where did she get the money cried missus Bates I don t know said Nancy Ellen She asked me yesterday but of course I told her that so long as you and Father decided she was not to go I couldn t possibly lend her the money Did you look if she had taken it Nancy Ellen straightened Mother I didn t need do that You said she took your clothes said missus Bates I had hers this time last year She ll bring back clothes Not here she won t Father will see that she never darkens these doors again This is the first time in his life that a child of his has disobeyed him Except Adam when he married Agatha and he strutted like a fighting cock about that Well he won t strut about this and you won t either even if you are showing signs of standing up for her Go at that wash while I get dinner Dinner was on the table when Adam Bates hung his hat on its hook and saw the note for him He took it down and read FATHER I have gone to Normal I borrowed the money of a woman who was willing to trust me to pay it back as soon as I earned it Not Nancy Ellen of course She would not even loan me a pocket handkerchief though you remember I stayed at home six weeks last summer to let her take what she wanted of mine Mother I think you can get Sally Whistler to help you as cheaply as any one and that she will do very well Nancy Ellen I have taken your second best hat and a few of your things but not half so many as I loaned you I hope it makes you mad enough to burst I hope you get as mad and stay as mad as I have been most of this year while you taught me things you didn t know yourself and I cooked and washed for you so you could wear fine clothes and play the lady KATE Adam Bates read that note to himself stretching every inch of his six feet six his face a dull red his eyes glaring Then he turned to his wife and daughter Is Kate gone Without proper clothing and on borrowed money he demanded I don t know said missus Bates I was hoeing potatoes all forenoon Listen to this he thundered Then he slowly read the note aloud But someway the spoken words did not have the same effect as when he read them mentally in the first shock of anger When he heard his own voice read off the line I hope it makes you mad enough to burst there was a catch and a queer gurgle in his throat missus Bates gazed at him anxiously Was he so surprised and angry he was choking Might it be a stroke It was It was a master stroke He got no farther than taught me things you didn t know yourself when he lowered the sheet threw back his head and laughed as none of his family ever had seen him laugh in his life laughed and laughed until his frame was shaken and the tears rolled Finally he looked at the dazed Nancy Ellen Get Sally Whistler nothing he said You hustle your stumps and do for your mother what Kate did while you were away last summer And if you have any common decency send your sister as many of your best things as you had of hers at least Do you hear me CHAPTER III PEREGRINATIONS PEREGRINATIONS laughed Kate turning to the window to hide her face Oh Agatha you are a dear but you are too funny Even a Fourth of July orator would not have used that word I never heard it before in all of my life outside spelling school Then she looked at the dollar she was gripping and ceased to laugh The dear lad she whispered He did the whole thing She was going to let us fight it out I could tell by her back and Adam wouldn t have helped me a cent quite as much because he didn t want to as because Father wouldn t have liked it Fancy the little chap knowing he can wheedle his mother into anything and exactly how to go about it I won t spend a penny on myself until she is paid and then I ll make her a present of something nice just to let her and Nancy Ellen see that I appreciate being helped to my chance for I had reached that point where I would have walked to school and worked in somebody s kitchen before I d have missed my opportunity I could have done it but this will be far pleasanter and give me a much better showing Then Kate began watching the people in the car with eager curiosity for she had been on a train only twice before in her life She decided that she was in a company of young people and some even of middle age going to Normal She also noticed that most of them were looking at her with probably the same interest she found in them Then at one of the stations a girl asked to sit with her and explained that she was going to Normal so Kate said she was also The girl seemed to have several acquaintances on the car for she left her seat to speak with them and when the train stopped at a very pleasant city and the car began to empty itself on the platform Kate was introduced by this girl to several young women and men near her age A party of four going to board close the school with a woman they knew about invited Kate to go with them and because she was strange and shaken by her experiences she agreed All of them piled their luggage on a wagon to be delivered so Kate let hers go also Then they walked down a long shady street and entered a dainty and comfortable residence a place that seemed to Kate to be the home of people of wealth She was assigned a room with another girl such a pleasant girl but a vague uneasiness had begun to make itself felt so before she unpacked she went back to the sitting room and learned that the price of board was eight dollars a week Forty eight dollars for six weeks She would not have enough for books and tuition Besides Nancy Ellen had boarded with a family on Butler Street whose charge was only five fifty Kate was eager to stay where these very agreeable young people did she imagined herself going to classes with them and having association that to her would be a great treat but she never would dare ask for more money She thought swiftly a minute and then made her first mistake Instead of going to the other girls and frankly confessing that she could not afford the prices they were paying she watched her chance picked up her telescope and hurried down the street walking swiftly until she was out of sight of the house Then she began inquiring her way to Butler Street and after a long hot walk found the place The rooms and board were very poor but Kate felt that she could endure whatever Nancy Ellen had so she unpacked and went to the Normal School to register and learn what she would need On coming from the building she saw that she would be forced to pass close by the group of girls she had deserted and this was made doubly difficult because she could see that they were talking about her Then she understood how foolish she had been and as she was struggling to summon courage to explain to them she caught these words plainly Who is going to ask her for it I am said the girl who had sat beside Kate on the train I don t propose to pay it myself Then she came directly to Kate and said briefly Fifty cents please For what stammered Kate Your luggage You changed your boarding place in such a hurry you forgot to settle and as I made the arrangement I had to pay it Do please excuse me said Kate I was so bewildered I forgot Certainly said the girl and Kate dropped the money into the extended hand and hurried past her face scorched red with shame for one of them had said That s a good one I wouldn t have thought it of her Kate went back to her hot stuffy room and tried to study but she succeeded only in being miserable for she realized that she had lost her second chance to have either companions or friends by not saying the few words of explanation that would have righted her in the opinion of those she would meet each day for six weeks It was not a good beginning while the end was what might have been expected A young man from her neighbourhood spoke to her and the girls seeing asked him about Kate learning thereby that her father was worth more money than all of theirs put together Some of them had accepted the explanation that Kate was bewildered and had acted hastily but when the young man finished Bates history they merely thought her mean and left her severely to herself so her only recourse was to study so diligently and recite so perfectly that none of them could equal her and this she did In acute discomfort and with a sore heart Kate passed her first six weeks away from home She wrote to each man on the list of school directors she had taken from Nancy Ellen s desk Some answered that they had their teachers already engaged others made no reply One bright spot was the receipt of a letter from Nancy Ellen saying she was sending her best dress to be very careful of it and if Kate would let her know the day she would be home she would meet her at the station Kate sent her thanks wore the dress to two lectures and wrote the letter telling when she would return As the time drew nearer she became sickeningly anxious about a school What if she failed in securing one What if she could not pay back Agatha s money What if she had taken the wings of morning and fallen in her flight In desperation she went to the Superintendent of the Normal and told him her trouble He wrote her a fine letter of recommendation and she sent it to one of the men from whom she had not heard the director of a school in the village of Walden seven miles east of Hartley being seventeen miles from her home thus seeming to Kate a desirable location also she knew the village to be pretty and the school one that paid well Then she finished her work the best she could and disappointed and anxious entered the train for home When the engine whistled at the bridge outside Hartley Kate arose lifted her telescope from the rack overhead and made her way to the door so that she was the first person to leave the car when it stopped As she stepped to the platform she had a distinct shock for her father reached for the telescope while his greeting and his face were decidedly friendly for him As they walked down the street Kate was trying wildly to think of the best thing to say when he asked if she had a school But he did not ask Then she saw in the pocket of his light summer coat a packet of letters folded inside a newspaper and there was one long official looking envelope that stood above the others far enough that she could see Miss K of the address Instantly she decided that it was her answer from the School Director of Walden and she was tremblingly eager to see it She thought an instant and then asked Have you been to the post office Yes I got the mail he answered Will you please see if there are any letters for me she asked When we get home he said I am in a hurry now Here s a list of things Ma wants and don t be all day about getting them Kate s lips closed to a thin line and her eyes began to grow steel coloured and big She dragged back a step and looked at the loosely swaying pocket again She thought intently a second As they passed several people on the walk she stepped back of her father and gently raised the letter enough to see that the address was to her Instantly she lifted it from the others slipped it up her dress sleeve and again took her place beside her father until they reached the store where her mother did her shopping Then he waited outside while Kate hurried in and ripping open the letter found a contract ready for her to sign for the Walden school The salary was twenty dollars a month more than Nancy Ellen had received for their country school the previous winter and the term four months longer Kate was so delighted she could have shouted Instead she went with all speed to the stationery counter and bought an envelope to fit the contract which she signed and writing a hasty note of thanks she mailed the letter in the store mail box then began her mother s purchases This took so much time that her father came into the store before she had finished demanding that she hurry so in feverish haste she bought what was wanted and followed to the buggy On the road home she began to study her father she could see that he was well pleased over something but she had no idea what could have happened she had expected anything from verbal wrath to the buggy whip so she was surprised but so happy over having secured such a good school at higher wages than Nancy Ellen s that she spent most of her time thinking of herself and planning as to when she would go to Walden where she would stay how she would teach and Oh bliss unspeakable what she would do with so much money for two month s pay would more than wipe out her indebtedness to Agatha and by getting the very cheapest board she could endure after that she would have over three fourths of her money to spend each month for books and clothes She was intently engaged with her side of the closet and her end of the bureau when she had her first glimpse of home even preoccupied as she was she saw a difference Several loose pickets in the fence had been nailed in place The lilac beside the door and the cabbage roses had been trimmed so that they did not drag over the walk while the yard had been gone over with a lawn mower Kate turned to her father Well for land s sake she said I wanted a lawn mower all last summer and you wouldn t buy it for me I wonder why you got it the minute I was gone I got it because Nancy Ellen especially wanted it and she has been a mighty good girl all summer he said If that is the case then she should be rewarded with the privilege of running a lawn mower said Kate Her father looked at her sharply but her face was so pleasant he decided she did not intend to be saucy so he said No doubt she will be willing to let you help her all you want to Not the ghost of a doubt about that laughed Kate and I always wanted to try running one too They look so nice in pictures and how one improves a place I hardly know this is home Now if we only had a fresh coat of white paint we could line up with the neighbours I have been thinking about that said mister Bates and Kate glanced at him doubting her hearing He noticed her surprise and added in explanation Paint every so often saves a building It s good economy Then let s economize immediately said Kate And on the barn too It is even more weather beaten than the house I ll see about it the next time I go to town said mister Bates so Kate entered the house prepared for anything and wondering what it all meant for wherever she looked everything was shining the brightest that scrubbing and scouring could make it shine the best of everything was out and in use not that it was much but it made a noticeable difference Her mother greeted her pleasantly with a new tone of voice while Nancy Ellen was transformed Kate noticed that immediately She always had been a pretty girl now she was beautiful radiantly beautiful with a new shining beauty that dazzled Kate as she looked at her No one offered any explanation while Kate could see none At last she asked What on earth has happened I don t understand Of course you don t laughed Nancy Ellen You thought you ran the whole place and did everything yourself so I thought I d just show you how things look when I run them You are a top notcher said Kate Figuratively and literally I offer you the palm Let the good work go on I highly approve but I don t see how you found time to do all this and go to Institute I didn t go to Institute said Nancy Ellen You didn t But you must cried Kate Oh must I Well since you have decided to run your affairs as you please in spite of all of us just suppose you let me run mine the same way Only I rather enjoy having Father and Mother approve of what I do Kate climbed the stairs with this to digest as she went so while she put away her clothing she thought things over but saw no light She would go to Adam s to return the telescope to morrow possibly he could tell her As she hung her dresses in the closet and returned Nancy Ellen s to their places she was still more amazed for there hung three pretty new wash dresses one of a rosy pink that would make Nancy Ellen appear very lovely What was the reason Kate wondered The Bates family never did anything unless there was some purpose in it what was the purpose in this And Nancy Ellen had not gone to Institute She evidently had worked constantly and hard yet she was in much sweeter frame of mind than usual She must have spent almost all she had saved from her school on new clothes Kate could not solve the problem so she decided to watch and wait She also waited for someone to say something about her plans but no one said a word so after waiting all evening Kate decided that they would ask before they learned anything from her She took her place as usual and the work went on as if she had not been away but she was happy even in her bewilderment If her father noticed the absence of the letter she had slipped from his pocket he said nothing about it as he drew the paper and letters forth and laid them on the table Kate had a few bad minutes while this was going on she was sure he hesitated an instant and looked closely at the letters he sorted but when he said nothing she breathed deeply in relief and went on being joyous It seemed to her that never had the family been in such a good natured state since Adam had married Agatha and her three hundred acres with house furniture and stock She went on in ignorance of what had happened until after Sunday dinner the following day Then she had planned to visit Agatha and Adam It was very probable that it was because she was dressing for this visit that Nancy Ellen decided on Kate s enlightenment for she could not have helped seeing that her sister was almost stunned at times Kate gave her a fine opening As she stood brushing her wealth of gold with full length sweeps of her arm she was at an angle that brought her facing the mirror before which Nancy Ellen sat training waves and pinning up loose braids Her hair was beautiful and she slowly smiled at her image as she tried different effects of wave loose curl braids high piled or flat Across her bed lay a dress that was a reproduction of one that she had worn for three years but a glorified reproduction The original dress had been Nancy Ellen s first departure from the brown and gray gingham which her mother always had purchased because it would wear well and when from constant washing it faded to an exact dirt colour it had the advantage of providing a background that did not show the dirt Nancy Ellen had earned the money for a new dress by raising turkeys so when the turkeys went to town to be sold for the first time in her life Nancy Ellen went along to select the dress No one told her what kind of dress to get because no one imagined that she would dare buy any startling variation from what always had been provided for her But Nancy Ellen had stood facing a narrow mirror when she reached the gingham counter and the clerk taking one look at her fresh beautiful face with its sharp contrasts of black eyes and hair rose tinted skin that refused to tan and red cheeks and lips began shaking out delicate blues pale pinks golden yellows He called them chambray insisted that they wore for ever and were fadeless which was practically the truth On the day that dress was like to burst its waist seams it was the same warm rosy pink that transformed Nancy Ellen from the disfiguration of dirt brown to apple and peach bloom wild roses and swamp mallow a girl quite as pretty as a girl ever grows and much prettier than any girl ever has any business to be The instant Nancy Ellen held the chambray under her chin and in an oblique glance saw the face of the clerk the material was hers no matter what the cost which does not refer to the price by any means Knowing that the dress would be an innovation that would set her mother storming and fill Kate with envy which would probably culminate in the demand that the goods be returned and exchanged for dirt brown when she reached home Nancy Ellen climbed from the wagon and told her father that she was going on to Adam s to have Agatha cut out her dress so that she could begin to sew on it that night Such commendable industry met his hearty approval so he told her to go and he would see that Kate did her share of the work Wise Nancy Ellen came home and sat her down to sew on her gorgeous frock while the storm she had feared raged in all its fury but the goods was cut and could not be returned Yet through it a miracle happened Nancy Ellen so appreciated herself in pink that the extreme care she used with that dress saved it from half the trips of a dirt brown one to the wash board and the ironing table while marvel of marvels it did not shrink it did not fade also it wore like buckskin The result was that before the season had passed Kate was allowed to purchase a pale blue which improved her appearance quite as much in proportion as pink had Nancy Ellen s neither did the blue fade nor shrink nor require so much washing for the same reason Three years the pink dress had been Nancy Ellen s PIECE DE RESISTANCE now she had a new one much the same yet conspicuously different This was a daring rose colour full and wide peeping white embroidery trimming and big pearl buttons really a beautiful dress made in a becoming manner Kate looked at it in cheerful envy Never mind The coming summer she would have a blue that would make that pink look silly From the dress she turned to Nancy Ellen barely in time to see her bend her head and smirk broadly smilingly approvingly at her reflection in the glass For mercy sake what IS the matter with you demanded Kate ripping a strand of hair in sudden irritation Oh something lovely answered her sister knowing that this was her chance to impart the glad tidings herself if she lost it Agatha would get the thrill of Kate s surprise So Nancy Ellen opened her drawer and slowly produced and set upon her bureau a cabinet photograph of a remarkably strong featured handsome young man Then she turned to Kate and smiled a slow challenging smile Kate walked over and picked up the picture studying it intently but in growing amazement Who is he she asked finally My man answered Nancy Ellen possessively triumphantly Kate stared at her Honest to God she cried in wonderment Honest said Nancy Ellen Where on earth did you find him demanded Kate Picked him out of the blackberry patch said Nancy Ellen Those darn blackberries are always late said Kate throwing the picture back on the bureau Ain t that just my luck You wouldn t touch the raspberries I had to pick them every one myself But the minute I turn my back you go pick a man like that out of the blackberry patch I bet a cow you wore your pink chambray and carried grandmother s old blue bowl Certainly said Nancy Ellen and my pink sun bonnet I think maybe the bonnet started it Kate sat down limply on the first chair and studied the toes of her shoes At last she roused and looked at Nancy Ellen waiting in smiling complaisance as she returned the picture to her end of the bureau Well why don t you go ahead cried Kate in a thick rasping voice Empty yourself Who is he Where did he come from WHY was he IN our blackberry patch Has he really been to see you and is he courting you in earnest But of COURSE he is There s the lilac bush the lawn mower the house to be painted and a humdinger dress Is he a millionaire For Heaven s sake tell me Give me some chance I did meet him in the blackberry patch He s a nephew of Henry Lang and his name is Robert Gray He has just finished a medical course and he came here to rest and look at Hartley for a location because Lang thinks it would be such a good one And since we met he has decided to take an office in Hartley and he has money to furnish it and to buy and furnish a nice house Great Jehoshaphat cried Kate And I bet he s got wings too I do have the rottenest luck You act for all the world as if it were a foregone conclusion that if you had been here you d have won him Nancy Ellen glanced in the mirror and smiled while Kate saw the smile She picked up her comb and drew herself to full height If anything ever was a foregone conclusion she said it is a foregone conclusion that if I HAD been here I d have picked the blackberries and so I d have had the first chance at him at least Much good it would have done you cried Nancy Ellen Wait until he comes and you see him You may do your mushing in private said Kate I don t need a demonstration to convince me He looks from the picture like a man who would be as soft as a frosted pawpaw Nancy Ellen s face flamed crimson You hateful spite cat she cried Then she picked up the picture and laid it face down in her drawer while two big tears ran down her cheeks Kate saw those also Instantly she relented You big silly goose she said Can t you tell when any one is teasing I think I never saw a finer face than the one in that picture I m jealous because I never left home a day before in all my life and the minute I do here you go and have such luck Are you really sure of him Nancy Ellen Well he asked Father and Mother and I ve been to visit his folks and he told them and I ve been with him to Hartley hunting a house and I m not to teach this winter so I can have all my time to make my clothes and bedding Father likes him fine so he is going to give me money to get all I need He offered to himself Kate finished her braid pulled the combings from the comb and slowly wrapped the end of her hair as she digested these convincing facts She swung the heavy braid around her head placed a few pins then crossed to her sister and laid a shaking hand on her shoulder Her face was working strongly Nancy Ellen I didn t mean one ugly word I said You gave me an awful surprise and that was just my bald ugly Bates way of taking it I think you are one of the most beautiful women I ever have seen alive or pictured I have always thought you would make a fine marriage and I am sure you will I haven t a doubt that Robert Gray is all you think him and I am as glad for you as I can be You can keep house in Hartley for two with scarcely any work at all and you can have all the pretty clothes you want and time to wear them Doctors always get rich if they are good ones and he is sure to be a good one once he gets a start If only we weren t so beastly healthy there are enough Bates and Langs to support you for the first year And I ll help you sew and do all I can for you Now wipe up and look your handsomest Nancy Ellen arose and put her arms around Kate s neck a stunningly unusual proceeding Thank you she said That is big and fine of you But I always have shirked and put my work on you I guess now I ll quit and do my sewing myself Then she slipped the pink dress over her head and stood slowly fastening it as Kate started to leave the room Seeing her go I wish you would wait and meet Robert she said I have told him about what a nice sister I have I think I ll go on to Adam s now said Kate I don t want to wait until they go some place and I miss them I ll do better to meet your man after I become more accustomed to bare facts anyway By the way is he as tall as you Yes said Nancy Ellen laughing He is an inch and a half taller Why Oh I hate seeing a woman taller than her husband and I ve always wondered where we d find men to reach our shoulders But if they can be picked at random from the berry patch So Kate went on her way laughing lifting her white skirts high from the late August dust She took a short cut through the woods and at a small stream with sure foot crossed the log to within a few steps of the opposite bank There she stopped for a young man rounded the bushes and set a foot on the same log then he and Kate looked straight into each other s eyes Kate saw a clean shaven forceful young face with strong lines and good colouring clear gray eyes sandy brown hair even hard white teeth and broad shoulders a little above her own The man saw Kate dressed in her best and looking her best Slowly she extended her hand I bet a picayune you are my new brother Robert she said The young man gripped her hand firmly held it and kept on looking in rather a stunned manner at Kate Well aren t you she asked trying to withdraw the hand I never never would have believed it he said Believed what asked Kate leaving the hand where it was That there could be two in the same family said he But I m as different from Nancy Ellen as night from day said Kate besides woe is me I didn t wear a pink dress and pick you from the berry patch in a blue bowl Then the man released her hand and laughed You wouldn t have had the slightest trouble if you had been there he said Except that I should have inverted my bowl said Kate calmly I am looking for a millionaire riding a milk white steed and he must be much taller than you and have black hair and eyes

none	none	brother I will see you this evening Then Kate went down the path to deliver the telescope render her thanks make her promise of speedy payment and for the first time tell her good news about her school She found that she was very happy as she went and quite convinced that her first flight would prove entirely successful CHAPTER IV A QUESTION OF CONTRACTS HELLO Folks cried Kate waving her hand to the occupants of the veranda as she went up the walk Glad to find you at home That is where you will always find me unless I am forced away on business said her brother as they shook hands Agatha was pleased with this and stiff as steel she bent the length of her body toward Kate and gave her a tight lipped little peck on the cheek I came over as soon as I could said Kate as she took the chair her brother offered to thank you for the big thing you did for me Agatha when you lent me that money If I had known where I was going or the help it would be to me I should have gone if I d had to walk and work for my board Why I feel so sure of myself I ve learned so much that I m like the girl fresh from boarding school The only wonder is that one small head can contain it all Thank you over and over and I ve got a good school so I can pay you back the very first month I think If there are things I must have I can pay part the first month and the remainder the second I am eager for pay day I can t even picture the bliss of having that much money in my fingers all my own to do with as I please Won t it be grand In the same breath said Agatha Procure yourself some clothes Said Adam Start a bank account Said Kate Right you are I shall do both Even our little Susan has a bank account said Adam junior proudly Which is no reflection whatever on me laughed Kate Susan did not have the same father and mother I had I d like to see a girl of my branch of the Bates family start a bank account at ten No I guess she wouldn t admitted Adam dryly But have you heard that Nancy Ellen has started cried Kate Only think A lawn mower The house and barn to be painted All the dinge possible to remove scoured away inside She must have worn her fingers almost to the bone And really Agatha have you seen the man He s as big as Adam and just fine looking I m simply consumed with envy Miss Medira Dora Ann cast her net and catched a man recited Susan from the top step at which they all laughed No I have not had the pleasure of casting my optics upon the individual of Nancy Ellen s choice said Agatha primly but Miss Amelia Lang tells me he is a very distinguished person of quite superior education in a medical way I shall call him if I ever have the misfortune to fall ill again I hope you will tell Nancy Ellen that we shall be very pleased to have her bring him to see us some evening and if she will let me know a short time ahead I shall take great pleasure in compounding a cake and freezing custard Of course I shall tell her and she will feel a trifle more stuck up than she does now if that is possible laughed Kate in deep amusement She surely was feeling fine Everything had come out so splendidly That was what came of having a little spirit and standing up for your rights Also she was bubbling inside while Agatha talked Kate wondered how Adam survived it every day She glanced at him to see if she could detect any marks of shattered nerves then laughed outright Adam was the finest physical specimen of a man she knew He was good looking also and spoke as well as the average better in fact for from the day of their marriage Agatha sat on his lap each night and said these words My beloved to day I noted an error in your speech It would put a former teacher to much embarrassment to have this occur in public In the future will you not try to remember that you should say have gone instead of have went As she talked Agatha rumpled Adam s hair pulled off his string tie upon which she insisted even when he was plowing laid her hard little face against his and held him tight with her frail arms so that Adam being part human as well as part Bates held her closely also and said these words You bet your sweet life I will And what is more he did He followed a furrow the next day softly muttering over to himself Langs have gone to town I have gone to work The birds have gone to building nests So Adam seldom said have went or made any other error in speech that Agatha had once corrected As Kate watched him leaning back in his chair vital a study in well being the supremest kind of satisfaction on his face she noted the flash that lighted his eye when Agatha offered to freeze a custard How like Agatha Any other woman Kate knew would have said make ice cream Agatha explained to them that when they beat up eggs added milk sugar and corn starch it was custard When they used pure cream sweetened and frozen it was iced cream Personally she preferred the custard but she did not propose to call it custard cream It was not correct Why persist in misstatements and inaccuracies when one knew better So Agatha said iced cream when she meant it and frozen custard when custard it was but every other woman in the neighbourhood had she acted as she felt would have slapped Agatha s face when she said it this both Adam and Kate well knew so it made Kate laugh despite the fact that she would not have offended Agatha purposely I think I think said Agatha that Nancy Ellen has much upon which to congratulate herself More education would not injure her but she has enough that if she will allow her ambition to rule her and study in private and spend her spare time communing with the best writers she can make an exceedingly fair intellectual showing while she surely is a handsome woman With a good home and such a fine young professional man as she has had the good fortune to attract she should immediately put herself at the head of society in Hartley and become its leader to a much higher moral and intellectual plane than it now occupies Bet she has a good time said young Adam He s awful nice Son said Agatha awful means full of awe A cyclone a cloudburst a great conflagration are awful things By no stretch of the imagination could they be called nice But Ma if a cyclone blew away your worst enemy wouldn t it be nice Adam junior and Kate laughed Not the trace of a smile crossed Agatha s pale face The words do not belong in contiguity she said They are diametrically opposite in meaning Please do not allow my ears to be offended by hearing you place them in propinquity again I ll try not to Ma said young Adam then Agatha smiled on him approvingly When did you meet mister Gray Katherine she asked On the foot log crossing the creek beside Lang s line fence Near the spot Nancy Ellen first met him I imagine How did you recognize him Nancy Ellen had just been showing me his picture and telling me about him Great Day but she s in love with him And so he is with her if Lang s conclusions from his behaviour can be depended upon They inform me that he can be induced to converse on no other subject The whole arrangement appeals to me as distinctly admirable And you should see the lilac bush and the cabbage roses said Kate And the strangest thing is Father He is peaceable as a lamb She is not to teach but to spend the winter sewing on her clothes and bedding and Father told her he would give her the necessary money She said so And I suspect he will He always favoured her because she was so pretty and she can come closer to wheedling him than any of the rest of us excepting you Agatha It is an innovation surely Mother is nearly as bad Father furnishing money for clothes and painting the barn is no more remarkable than Mother letting her turn the house inside out If it had been I Father would have told me to teach my school this winter buy my own clothes and linen with the money I had earned and do my sewing next summer But I am not jealous It is because she is handsome and the man fine looking and with such good prospects There you have it said Adam emphatically If it were you marrying Jim Lang to live on Lang s west forty you WOULD pay your own way But if it were you marrying a fine looking young doctor who will soon be a power in Hartley no doubt it would tickle Father s vanity until he would do the same for you I doubt it said Kate I can t see the vanity in Father You can t said Adam junior bitterly Maybe not You have not been with him in the Treasurer s office when he calls for the tax on those little parcels of land of mine He looks every inch of six feet six then and swells like a toad To hear him you would think sixteen hundred and fifty acres of the cream of this county could be tied in a bandanna and carried on a walking stick he is so casual about it And those men fly around like buttons on a barn door to wait on him and it s Mister Bates this and Mister Bates that until it turns my stomach Vanity He rolls in it He eats it He risks losing our land for us that some of us have slaved over for twenty years to feed that especial vein of his vanity Where should we be if he let anything happen to those deeds How refreshing cried Kate I love to hear you grouching I hear nothing else from the women of the Bates family but I didn t even know the men had a grouch Are Peter and John and Hiram and the other boys sore too I should say they are But they are too diplomatic to say so They are afraid to cheep I just open my head and say right out loud in meeting that since I ve turned in the taxes and insurance for all these years and improved my land more than fifty per cent I d like to own it and pay my taxes myself like a man I d like to have some land under any conditions said Kate but probably I never shall And I bet you never get a flipper on that deed until Father has crossed over Jordan which with his health and strength won t be for twenty five years yet at least He s performing a miracle that will make the other girls rave when he gives Nancy Ellen money to buy her outfit but they won t dare let him hear a whisper of it They ll take it all out on Mother and she ll be afraid to tell him Afraid Mother afraid of him Not on your life She is hand in glove with him She thinks as he does and helps him in everything he undertakes That s so too Come to think of it she isn t a particle afraid of him She agrees with him perfectly It would be interesting to hear them having a private conversation They never talk a word before us But they always agree and they heartily agree on Nancy Ellen s man that is plainly to be seen It will make a very difficult winter for you Katherine said Agatha When Nancy Ellen becomes interested in dresses and table linen and bedding she will want to sew all the time and leave the cooking and dishes for you as well as your schoolwork Kate turned toward Agatha in surprise But I won t be there I told you I had taken a school You taken a school shouted Adam Why didn t they tell you that Father has signed up for the home school for you Good Heavens said Kate What will be to pay now Did you contract for another school cried Adam I surely did said Kate slowly I signed an agreement to teach the village school in Walden It s a brick building with a janitor to sweep and watch fires only a few blocks to walk and it pays twenty dollars a month more than the home school where you can wade snow three miles build your own fires and freeze all day in a little frame building at that I teach the school I have taken And throw our school out of a teacher Father could be sued and probably will be said Adam And throw the housework Nancy Ellen expected you to do on her said Agatha at the same time I see said Kate Well if he is sued he will have to settle He wouldn t help me a penny to go to school I am of age the debt is my own and I don t owe it to him He s had all my work has been worth all my life and I ve surely paid my way I shall teach the school I have signed for You will get into a pretty kettle of fish said Adam Agatha will you sell me your telescope for what you paid for it and get yourself a new one the next time you go to Hartley It is only a few days until time to go to my school it opens sooner than in the country and closes later The term is four months longer so I earn that much more I haven t gotten a telescope yet You can add it to my first payment You may take it said Agatha but hadn t you better reconsider Katherine Things are progressing so nicely and this will upset everything for Nancy Ellen That taking the home school will upset everything for me doesn t seem to count It is late late to find teachers and I can be held responsible if I break the contract I have made Father can stand the racket better than I can When he wouldn t consent to my going he had no business to make plans for me I had to make my own plans and go in spite of him he might have known I d do all in my power to get a school Besides I don t want the home school or the home work piled on me My hands look like a human being s for the first time in my life then I need all my time outside of school to study and map out lessons I am going to try for a room in the Hartley schools next year or the next after that surely They sha n t change my plans and boss me I am going to be free to work and study and help myself like other teachers A grand row this will be commented young Adam And as usual Kate will be right while all of them will be trying to use her to their advantage Ma has done her share Now it is your turn Pa Ain t you going to go over and help her What could I do demanded his father The mischief is done now Well if you can t do anything to help you can let me have the buggy to drive her to Walden if they turn her out Forcibly invite her to proceed to her destination you mean son said Agatha Yes Ma that is exactly what I mean said young Adam Do I get the buggy Yes you may take my private conveyance But do nothing to publish the fact There is no need to incur antagonism if it can be avoided Kate I ll be driving past the privet bush about nine in the morning If you need me hang a white rag on it and I ll stop at the corner of the orchard I shall probably be standing in the road waiting for you said Kate Oh I hope not said Agatha Looks remarkably like it to me said Kate Then she picked up the telescope said good bye to each of them and in acute misery started back to her home This time she followed the footpath beside the highway She was so busy with her indignant thought that she forgot to protect her skirts from the dust of wayside weeds while in her excitement she walked so fast her face was red and perspiring when she approached the church Oh dear I don t know about it said Kate to the small silent building I am trying to follow your advice but it seems to me that life is very difficult any way you go at it If it isn t one thing it is another An hour ago I was the happiest I have ever been in my life only look at me now Any one who wants the wings of morning may have them for all of me It seems definitely settled that I walk carry a load and fight for the chance to do even that A big tear rolled down either side of Kate s nose and her face twisted in self pity for an instant But when she came in sight of home her shoulders squared the blue gray of her eyes deepened to steel and her lips set in a line that was an exact counterpart of her father s when he had made up his mind and was ready to drive his family with their consent or without it As she passed the vegetable garden there was no time or room for flowers in a Bates garden Kate looking ahead could see Nancy Ellen and Robert Gray beneath the cherry trees She hoped Nancy Ellen would see that she was tired and dusty and should have time to brush and make herself more presentable to meet a stranger and so Nancy Ellen did for which reason she immediately arose and came to the gate followed by her suitor whom she at once introduced Kate was in no mood for words one glance at her proved to Robert Gray that she was tired and dusty that there were tear marks dried on her face They hastily shook hands but neither mentioned the previous meeting Excusing herself Kate went into the house saying she would soon return Nancy Ellen glanced at Robert and saw the look of concern on his face I believe she has been crying she said And if she has it s something new for I never saw a tear on her face before in my life Truly he questioned in amazement Why of course The Bates family are not weepers So I have heard said the man rather dryly Nancy Ellen resented his tone Would you like us better if we were I couldn t like you better than I do but because of what I have heard and seen it naturally makes me wonder what could have happened that has made her cry We are rather outspoken and not at all secretive said Nancy Ellen carelessly you will soon know Kate followed the walk around the house and entered at the side door finding her father and mother in the dining room reading the weekly papers Her mother glanced up as she entered What did you bring Agatha s telescope back with you for she instantly demanded For a second Kate hesitated It had to come she might as well get it over Possibly it would be easier with them alone than if Nancy Ellen were present It is mine she said It represents my first purchase on my own hook and line You are not very choicy to begin on second hand stuff Nancy Ellen would have had a new one No doubt said Kate But this will do for me Her father lowered his paper and asked harshly What did you buy that thing for Kate gripped the handle and braced herself To pack my clothes in when I go to my school next week she said simply What he shouted What cried her mother I don t know why you seem surprised said Kate Surely you knew I went to Normal to prepare myself to teach Did you think I couldn t find a school Now look here young woman shouted Adam Bates you are done taking the bit in your teeth Nancy Ellen is not going to teach this winter I have taken the home school for you you will teach it That is settled I have signed the contract It must be fulfilled Then Nancy Ellen will have to fulfill it said Kate I also have signed a contract that must be fulfilled I am of age and you had no authority from me to sign a contract for me For an instant Kate thought there was danger that the purple rush of blood to her father s head might kill him He opened his mouth but no distinct words came Her face paled with fright but she was of his blood so she faced him quietly Her mother was quicker of wit and sharper of tongue Where did you get a school Why didn t you wait until you got home she demanded I am going to teach the village school in Walden said Kate It is a brick building has a janitor I can board reasonably near my work and I get twenty dollars more a month than our school pays while the term is four months longer Well it is a pity about that but it makes no difference said her mother Our home school has got to be taught as Pa contracted and Nancy Ellen has got to have her chance What about my chance asked Kate evenly Not one of the girls even Exceptional Ability ever had as good a school or as high wages to start on If I do well there this winter I am sure I can get in the Hartley graded schools next fall Don t you dare nickname your sister cried missus Bates shrilly You stop your impudence and mind your father Ma you leave this to me said Adam Bates thickly Then he glared at Kate as he arose stretching himself to full height You ve signed a contract for a school he demanded I have said Kate Why didn t you wait until you got home and talked it over with us he questioned I went to you to talk over the subject to going said Kate You would not even allow me to speak How was I to know that you would have the slightest interest in what school I took or where When did you sign this contract he continued Yesterday afternoon in Hartley said Kate Aha Then I did miss a letter from my pocket When did you get to be a thief he demanded Oh Father cried Kate It was my letter I could see my name on the envelope I ASKED you for it before I took it From behind my back like the sneak thief you are You are not fit to teach in a school where half the scholars are the children of your brothers and sisters and you are not fit to live with honest people Pack your things and be off Now This afternoon asked Kate This minute he cried All right You will be surprised at how quickly I can go said Kate She set down the telescope and gathered a straw sunshade and an apron from the hooks at the end of the room opened the dish cupboard and took out a mug decorated with the pinkest of wild roses and the reddest and fattest of robins bearing the inscription in gold For a Good Girl on a banner in its beak Kate smiled at it grimly as she took the telescope and ran upstairs It was the work of only a few minutes to gather her books and clothing and pack the big telescope then she went down the front stairs and left the house by the front door carrying in her hand everything she possessed on earth As she went down the walk Nancy Ellen sprang up and ran to her while Robert Gray followed You ll have to talk to me on the road said Kate I am forbidden the house which also means the grounds I suppose She walked across the road set the telescope on the grass under a big elm tree and sat down beside it I find I am rather tired she said Will you share the sofa with me Nancy Ellen lifted her pink skirt and sat beside Kate Robert Gray stood looking down at them What in the world is the matter asked Nancy Ellen You know of course that Father signed a contract for me to teach the home school this winter explained Kate Well I am of age and he had no authority from me so his contract isn t legal None of you would lift a finger to help me get away to Normal how was I to know that you would take any interest in finding me a school while I was gone I thought it was all up to me so I applied for the school in Walden got it and signed the contract to teach it It is a better school at higher wages I thought you would teach here I can t break my contract Father is furious and has ordered me out of the house So there you are or rather here I am Well it isn t much of a joke said Nancy Ellen thinking intently What she might have said had they been alone Kate always wondered What she did say while her betrothed looked at her with indignant eyes was possibly another matter It proved to be merely Oh Kate I am so sorry So am I said Kate If I had known what your plans were of course I should gladly have helped you out If only you had written me and told me I wanted to surprise you said Nancy Ellen You have said Kate Enough to last a lifetime I don t see how you figured You knew how late it was You knew it would be nip and tuck if I got a school at all Of course we did We thought you couldn t possibly get one this late so we fixed up the scheme to let you have my school and let me sew on my linen this winter We thought you would be as pleased as we were I am too sorry for words said Kate If I had known your plan I would have followed it even though I gave up a better school at a higher salary But I didn t know I thought I had to paddle my own canoe so I made my own plans Now I must live up to them because my contract is legal while Father s is not I would have taught the school for you in the circumstances but since I can t so far as I am concerned the arrangement I have made is much better The thing that really hurts the worst aside from disappointing you is that Father says I was not honest in what I did But what DID you do cried Nancy Ellen So Kate told them exactly what she had done Of course you had a right to your own letter when you could see the address on it and it was where you could pick it up said Robert Gray Kate lifted dull eyes to his face Thank you for so much grace at any rate she said I don t blame you a bit said Nancy Ellen In the same place I d have taken it myself You wouldn t have had to said Kate I m too abrupt too much like the gentleman himself You would have asked him in a way that would have secured you the letter with no trouble Nancy Ellen highly appreciated these words of praise before her lover She arose immediately Maybe I could do something with him now she said I ll go and see You shall do nothing of the kind said Kate I am as much Bates as he is I won t be taunted afterward that he turned me out and that I sent you to him to plead for me I ll tell him you didn t want me to come that I came of my own accord offered Nancy Ellen And he won t believe you said Kate Would you consent for me to go asked Robert Gray Certainly not I can look out for myself What shall you do asked Nancy Ellen anxiously That is getting slightly ahead of me said Kate If I had been diplomatic I could have evaded this until morning Adam threed is to be over then prepared to take me anywhere I want to go What I have to face now is a way to spend the night without letting the neighbours know that I am turned out How can I manage that Nancy Ellen and Robert each began making suggestions but Kate preferred to solve her own problems I think she said that I shall hide the telescope under the privet bush there isn t going to be rain to night and then I will go down to Hiram s and stay all night and watch for Adam when he passes in the morning Hiram always grumbles because we don t come oftener Then we will go with you said Nancy Ellen It will be a pleasant evening walk and we can keep you company and pacify my twin brother at the same time So they all walked to the adjoining farm on the south and when Nancy Ellen and Robert were ready to start back Kate said she was tired and she believed she would stay until morning which was agreeable to Hiram and his wife a girlhood friend of Kate s As Nancy Ellen and Robert walked back toward home How is this going to come out he asked anxiously It will come out all right said Nancy Ellen serenely Kate hasn t a particle of tact She is Father himself all over again It will come out this way he will tell me that Kate has gone back on him and I shall have to teach the school and I will say that is the ONLY solution and the BEST thing to do Then I shall talk all evening about how provoking it is and how I hate to change my plans and say I am afraid I shall lose you if I have to put off our wedding to teach the school and things like that Nancy Ellen turned a flushed sparkling face to Robert smiling quizzically and to morrow I shall go early to see Serena Woodruff who is a fine scholar and a good teacher but missed her school in the spring by being so sick she was afraid to contract for it She is all right now and she will be delighted to have the school and when I know she will take it then I shall just happen to think of her in a day or two and I ll suggest her after I ve wailed a lot more and Father will go to see her of his own accord and it will all be settled as easy as falling off a chunk only I shall not get on so fast with my sewing because of having to help Mother but I shall do my best and everything will be all right The spot was secluded Robert Gray stopped to tell Nancy Ellen what a wonderful girl she was He said he was rather afraid of such diplomacy He foresaw clearly that he was going to be a managed man Nancy Ellen told him of course he was all men were the thing was not to let them know it Then they laughed and listened to a wood robin singing out his little heart in an evening song that was almost as melodious as his spring performances had been CHAPTER V THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER EARLY in the morning Kate set her young nephew on the gate post to watch for his cousin and he was to have a penny for calling at his approach When his lusty shout came Kate said good bye to her sister in law paid the penny kissed the baby and was standing in the road when Adam stopped He looked at her inquiringly Well it happened she said He turned me out instanter with no remarks about when I might return if ever while Mother cordially seconded the motion It s a good thing Adam that you offered to take care of me because I see clearly that you are going to have it to do Of course I will said Adam promptly And of course I can Do you want to go to Hartley for anything Because if you don t we can cut across from the next road and get to Walden in about fifteen miles while it s seventeen by Hartley but if you want to go we can for I needn t hurry I ve got a box of lunch and a feed for my horse in the back of the buggy Mother said I was to stay with you until I saw you settled in your room if you had to go and if you do she is angry with Grandpa and she is going to give him a portion of her mentality the very first time she comes in contact with him She said so Yes I can almost hear her said Kate struggling to choke down a rising laugh She will never know how I appreciate what she has done for me but I think talking to Father will not do any good Home hasn t been so overly pleasant It s been a small dark cramped house dingy and hot when it might have been big airy and comfortable well furnished and pretty as Father s means would allow and as all the neighbours always criticize him for not having it it s meant hard work and plenty of it ever since I was set to scouring the tinware with rushes at the mature age of four but it s been home all the home I have had and it hurts more than I can tell you to be ordered out of it as I was but if I do well and make a big success maybe he will let me come back for Christmas or next summer s vacation If he won t Ma said you could come to our house said Adam That s kind of her but I couldn t do it said Kate She SAID you could persisted the boy But if I did it and Father got as mad as he was last night and tore up your father s deed then where would I be asked Kate You d be a sixteenth of two hundred acres better off than you are now said Adam Possibly laughed Kate but I wouldn t want to become a land shark that way Look down the road Who is it asked Adam Nancy Ellen with my telescope answered Kate I am to go all right All right then we will go said the boy angrily But it is a blame shame and there is no sense to it as good a girl as you have been and the way you have worked Mother said at breakfast there was neither sense nor justice in the way Grandpa always has acted and she said she would wager all she was worth that he would live to regret it She said it wasn t natural and when people undertook to controvert ain t that a peach Bet there isn t a woman in ten miles using that word except Ma nature they always hurt themselves worse than they hurt their victims And I bet he does too and I for one don t care I hope he does get a good jolt just to pay him up for being so mean Don t Adam don t cautioned Kate I mean it cried the boy I know you do That s the awful thing about it said Kate I am afraid every girl he has feels the same way and from what your father said yesterday even the sons he favours don t feel any too good toward him You just bet they don t They are every one as sore as boiled owls Pa said so and he knows for they all talk it over every time they meet He said they didn t feel like men they felt like a lot of spanked school boys They needn t worry said Kate Every deed is made out Father reads them over whenever it rains They ll all get their land when he dies It is only his way Yes and THIS is only his way too and it s a dern poor way said Adam Pa isn t going to do this way at all Mother said he could go and live on his land and she d stay home with Susan and me if he tried it And when I am a man I am going to do just like Pa and Ma because they are the rightest people I know only I am not going to save QUITE so close as Pa and if I died for it I never could converse or dance like Ma I should hope not said Kate and then added hastily it s all right for a lady but it would seem rather sissy for a man I believe Yes I guess it would but it is language let me tell you when Ma cuts loose said Adam Hello Nancy Ellen said Kate as Adam stopped the buggy Put my telescope in the back with the horse feed Since you have it I don t need ask whether I am the Prodigal Daughter or not I see clearly I am Nancy Ellen was worried until she was pale Kate she said I never have seen Father so angry in all my life I thought last night that in a day or two I could switch the school over to Serena Woodruff and go on with my plans but Father said at breakfast if the Bates name was to stand for anything approaching honour a Bates would teach that school this winter or he d know the reason why And you know how easy it is to change him Oh Kate won t you see if that Walden trustee can t possibly find another teacher and let you off I know Robert will be disappointed for he s rented his office and bought a house and he said last night to get ready as soon after Christmas as I could Oh Kate won t you see if you can t possibly get that man to hire another teacher Why Nancy Ellen said Kate Nancy Ellen with a twitching face looked at Kate If Robert has to wait months there in Hartley handsome as he is and he has to be nice to everybody to get practice and you know how those Hartley girls are Yes Nancy Ellen I know said Kate I ll see what I can do Is it understood that if I give up the school and come back and take ours Father will let me come home Yes oh yes cried Nancy Ellen Well nothing goes on guess work I ll hear him say it myself said Kate She climbed from the buggy Nancy Ellen caught her arm Don t go in there Don t you go there she cried He ll throw the first thing he can pick up at you Mother says he hasn t been asleep all night Pooh said Kate How childish I want to hear him say that and he ll scarcely kill me She walked swiftly to the side door Father she said Nancy Ellen is afraid she will lose Robert Gray if she has to put off her marriage for months Kate stepped back quickly as a chair crashed against the door facing She again came into view and continued so she asked me if I would get out of my school and come back if I could Kate dodged another chair when she appeared again To save the furniture of which we have none too much I ll just step inside she said When her father started toward her she started around the dining table talking as fast as she could he lunging after her like a furious bull She asked me to come back and teach the school to keep her from putting off her wedding because she is afraid to If I can break my contract there may I come back and help her out here The pace was going more swiftly each round it was punctuated at that instant by a heavy meat platter aimed at Kate s head She saw it picked up and swayed so it missed I guess that is answer enough for me she panted racing on A lovely father you are no wonder your daughters are dishonest through fear of you no wonder your wife has no mind of her own no wonder your sons hate you and wish you would die so they could have their deeds and be like men instead of spanked school boys as they feel now no wonder the whole posse of us hate you Directly opposite the door Kate caught the table and drew it with her to bar the opening As it crashed against the casing half the dishes flew to the floor in a heap When Adam Bates pulled it from his path he stepped in a dish of fried potatoes and fell heavily Kate reached the road climbed in the buggy and said the Nancy Ellen You d better hide Cut a bundle of stuff and send it to me by Adam and I ll sew my fingers to the bone for you every night Now drive like sin Adam As Adam Bates came lurching down the walk in fury the buggy dashed past and Kate had not even time to turn her head to see what happened Take the first turn she said to Adam I ve done an awful thing What did you do cried the boy Asked him as nicely as I could but he threw a chair at me Something funny happened to me and I wasn t afraid of him at all I dodged it and finished what I was saying and another chair came so the two Bates went at it Oh Kate what did you do cried Adam Went inside and ran around the dining table while I told him what all his sons and daughters think of him Spanked school boys and all Did you tell him my father said that he demanded No I had more sense left than that said Kate I only said all his boys FELT like that Then I pulled the table after me to block the door and smashed half the dishes and he slipped in the fried potatoes and went down with a crash Bloody Murder cried young Adam aghast Me too said Kate I ll never step in that house again while he lives I ve spilled the beans now That you have said Adam slacking his horse to glance back He is standing in the middle of the road shaking his fist after you Can you see Nancy Ellen asked Kate No She must have climbed the garden fence and hidden behind the privet bush Well she better make it a good long hide until he has had plenty of time to cool off He d have killed me if he had caught me after he fell and wasted all those potatoes already cooked Kate laughed a dry hysterical laugh but the boy sat white faced and awed Never mind said Kate seeing how frightened he was When he has had plenty of time he ll cool off but he ll never get over it I hope he doesn t beat Mother because I was born Oh drat such a man said young Adam I hope something worse that this happens to him If ever I see Father begin to be the least bit like him as he grows older I shall Well what shall you do asked Kate as he paused Tell Ma cried young Adam emphatically Kate leaned her face in her hands and laughed When she could speak she said Do you know Adam I think that would be the very best thing you could do Why of course said Adam They drove swiftly and reached Walden before ten o clock There they inquired their way to the home of the Trustee but Kate said nothing about giving up the school She merely made a few inquiries asked for the key of the schoolhouse and about boarding places She was directed to four among which she might choose Where would you advise me to go she asked the Trustee Well now folks differ said he All those folks is neighbours of mine and some might like one and some might like another best I COULD say this I think Means would be the cheapest Knowls the dearest but the last teacher was a good one an she seemed well satisfied with the Widder Holt I see said Kate smiling Then she and young Adam investigated the schoolhouse and found it far better than any either of them had ever been inside It promised every comfort and convenience compared with schools to which they had been accustomed so they returned the keys inquired about the cleaning of the building and started out to find a boarding place First they went to the cheapest but it could be seen at a glance that it was too cheap so they eliminated that Then they went to the most expensive but it was obvious from the house and grounds that board there would be more than Kate would want to pay I d like to save my digestion and have a place in which to study where I won t freeze said Kate but I want to board as cheaply as I can This morning changes my plans materially I shall want to go to school next summer part of the time but the part I do not I shall have to pay my way so I mustn t spend money as I thought I would Not one of you will dare be caught doing a thing for me To make you safe I ll stay away but it will cost me money that I d hoped to have for clothes like other girls It s too bad said Adam but I ll stick to you and so will Ma Of course you will you dear boy said Kate Now let s try our third place it is not far from here Soon they found the house but Kate stopped short on sight of it Adam there has been little in life to make me particular she said but I draw the line at that house I would go crazy in a house painted bright red with brown and blue decoration It should be prohibited by law Let us hunt up the Widder Holt and see how her taste in colour runs The joke is on you said Adam when they had found the house It was near the school on a wide shady street across which big maples locked branches There was a large lot filled with old fruit trees and long grass with a garden at the back The house was old and low having a small porch in front but if it ever had seen paint it did not show it at that time It was a warm linty gray the shingles of the old roof almost moss covered The joke IS on me said Kate I shall have no quarrel with the paint here and will you look at that Adam looked where Kate pointed across the street and nodded That ought to be put in a gold frame he said I think so too said Kate I shouldn t be a bit surprised if I stay where I can see it They were talking of a deep gully facing the house and running to a levee where the street crossed A stream ran down it dipped under a culvert turned sharply and ran away to a distant river spanning which they could see the bridge Tall old forest trees lined the banks shrubs and bushes grew in a thicket There were swaying clambering vines and a babel of bird notes over the seed and berry bearing bushes Let s go inside and if we agree then we will get some water and feed the horse and eat our lunch over there said Kate Just the thing said young Adam Come and we will proceed to the residence of missus Holt and investigate her possibilities How do you like that That is fine said Kate gravely It is said Adam promptly because it is Ma And whatever is Ma is right Good for you cried Kate I am going to break a Bates record and kiss you good bye when you go I probably shan t have another in years Come on They walked up the grassy wooden walk stepped on the tiny vine covered porch and lifted and dropped a rusty old iron knocker Almost at once the door opened to reveal a woman of respectable appearance a trifle past middle age She made Kate think of dried sage because she had a dried out look and her complexion hair and eyes were all that colour She was neat and clean while the hall into which she invited them was clean and had a wholesome odour Kate explained her errand missus Holt breathed a sigh of relief Well thank goodness I was before handed she said The teacher stayed here last year and she was satisfied so I ast the Trustee to mention me to the new teacher Nobody was expecting you until the last of the week but I says to myself always take time by the fetlock Samantha always be ready so last week I put in scouring my spare room to beat the nation and it s all ready so s you can walk right in Thank you said Kate rather resenting the assumption that she was to have no option in the matter I have four places on my list where they want the teacher so I thought I would look at each of them and then decide My ain t we choicey said missus Holt in sneering tones Then she changed instantly and in suave commendation went on That s exactly right That s the very thing fer you to do After you have seen what Walden has to offer then a pretty young thing like you can make up your mind where you will have the most quiet fer your work the best room and be best fed One of the greatest advantages here fer a teacher is that she can be quiet an not have her room rummaged Every place else that takes boarders there s a lot of children here there is only me and my son and he is grown and will be off to his medical work next week fer the year so all your working time here you d be alone with me This is the room That surely would be a great advantage because I have much studying to do said Kate as they entered the room With one glance she liked it It was a large room with low ceiling quaintly papered in very old creamy paper scattered with delicately cut green leaves but so carefully had the room been kept that it was still clean There were four large windows to let in light and air freshly washed white curtains hanging over the deep green shades The floor was carpeted with a freshly washed rag carpet stretched over straw the bed was invitingly clean and looked comfortable there was a wash stand with bowl and pitcher soap and towels a small table with a lamp a straight backed chair and a rocking chair missus Holt opened a large closet having hooks for dresses at one end and shelves at the other On the top of these there were a comfort and a pair of heavy blankets Your winter covers said missus Holt indicating these and there is a good stove I take out in summer to make more room and set up as soon as it gets cold and that is a wood box She pointed out a shoe box covered with paper similar to that on the walls Kate examined the room carefully the bed the closet and tried the chairs Behind the girl missus Holt with compressed lips forgetting Adam s presence watched in evident disapproval I want to see the stove said Kate It is out in the woodhouse It hasn t been cleaned up for the winter yet Then it won t be far away Let s look at it Almost wholly lacking experience Kate was proceeding by instinct in exactly the same way her father would have taken through experience missus Holt hesitated then turned Oh very well she said leading the way down the hall through the dining room which was older in furnishing and much more worn but still clean and wholesome as were the small kitchen and back porch From it there was only a step to the woodhouse where on a little platform across one end sat two small stoves for burning wood one so small as to be tiny Kate walked to the larger lifted the top looked inside tried the dampers and drafts and turning said That is very small It will require more wood than a larger one missus Holt indicated dry wood corded to the roof We git all our wood from the thicket across the way That little strip an this lot is all we have left of father s farm We kept this to live on and sold the rest for town lots all except that gully which we couldn t give away But I must say I like the trees and birds better than mebby I d like people who might live there we always git our wood from it and the shade an running water make it the coolest place in town Yes I suppose they do said Kate She took one long look at everything as they returned to the hall The Trustee told me your terms are four dollars and fifty cents a week furnishing food and wood she said and that you allowed the last teacher to do her own washing on Saturday for nothing Is that right The thin lips drew more tightly missus Holt looked at Kate from head to foot in close scrutiny I couldn t make enough to pay the extra work at that she said I ought to have a dollar more to really come out even I ll have to say five fifty this fall If that is the case good bye said Kate Thank you very much for showing me Five fifty is what I paid at Normal it is more than I can afford in a village like this She turned away followed by Adam They crossed the street watered the horse at the stream placed his food conveniently for him and taking their lunch box seated themselves on a grassy place on the bank and began eating Wasn t that a pretty nice room asked Adam Didn t you kind of hate to give it up I haven t the slightest intention of giving it up answered Kate That woman is a skin flint and I don t propose to let her beat me No doubt she was glad to get four fifty last fall She s only trying to see if she can wring me for a dollar more If I have to board all next summer I shall have to watch every penny or I ll not come out even let alone saving anything I ll wager you a nickel that before we leave she comes over here and offers me the room at the same price she got last winter I hope you are right said Adam How do you like her Got a grouch nasty temper mean disposition clean house good room good cook maybe lives just on the edge of comfort by daily skimping summarized Kate If she comes are you going to try it asked Adam Yes I think I shall It is nearest my purse and requirements and if the former teacher stayed there it will seem all right for me but she isn t going to put that little stove in my room It wouldn t heat the closet How did you like her Not much said Adam promptly If glaring at your back could have killed you you would have fallen dead when you examined the closet and bedding and stove She honeyed up when she had to but she was mad as hops I nearly bursted right out when she talked about taking time by the fetlock I wanted to tell her she looked like she had and almost got the life kicked out of her doing it but I thought I d better not Kate laughed Yes I noticed she said but I dared not look at you I was afraid you d laugh Isn t this a fine lunch Bet your life it is said Adam Ma never puts up any other kind I wish someone admired me as much as you do your mother Adam said Kate Well you be as nice as Ma and somebody is sure to said he But I never could said Kate Oh yes you could said Adam if you would only set yourself to do it and try with all your might to be like her Look quick That must be her Medical Course man Kate glanced across the way and saw a man she thought to be about thirty years of age He did not resemble his mother in any particular if he was the son of missus Holt He was above the average man in height having broad rather stooping shoulders dark hair and eyes He stopped at the gate and stood a few seconds looking at them so they could not very well study him closely then he went up the walk with loose easy stride and entered the house Yes that is her son said Kate That is exactly the way a man enters a house that belongs to him That isn t the way I am going to enter my house said Adam Now what shall we do Rest half an hour while they talk it over and then get ready to go very deliberately If she doesn t come across literally and figuratively we hunt another boarding place I half believe she will come said Adam She is watching us I can see her pull back the blind of her room to peep Keep looking ahead Don t let her think you see her Let s go up the creek and investigate this ravine Isn t it a lovely place Yes I m glad you got it said Adam that is if she come across I will think of you as having it to look at in summer and this winter my what rabbit hunting there will be and how pretty it will look So they went wandering up the ravine sometimes on one bank sometimes crossing stepping stones or logs to the other looking talking until a full hour had passed when they returned to the buggy Adam began changing the halter for the bridle while Kate shook out the lap robe Nickel please whispered Kate Adam glanced across the street to see missus Holt coming She approached them and with no preliminaries said I have been telling my son about you an he hates so bad to go away and leave me alone for the winter that he says to take you at the same as the last teacher even if I do lose money on it Oh you wouldn t do that missus Holt said Kate carelessly Of course it is for you to decide I like the room and if the board was right for the other teacher it will be for me If you want me to stay I ll bring my things over and take the room at once If not I ll look farther Come right over said missus Holt cordially I am anxious to git on the job of mothering such a sweet young lady What will you have for your supper Whatever you are having said Kate I am not accustomed to ordering my meals Adam come and help me unpack In half an hour Kate had her dresses on the hooks her underclothing on the shelves her books on the table her pencils and pen in the robin cup and was saying goodbye to Adam and telling him what to tell his father mother and Nancy Ellen if he could get a stolen interview with her on the way home He also promised to write Kate what happened about the home school and everything in which she would be interested Then she went back to her room sat in the comfortable rocking chair and with nothing in the world she was obliged to do immediately she stared at the opposite wall and day by day reviewed the summer She sat so long and stared at the wall so intently that gradually it dissolved and shaped into the deep green ravine across the way which sank into soothing darkness and the slowly lightened until a peep of gold came over the tree tops and then a red sun crept up having a big wonderful widespread wing on each side of it Kate s head fell with a jerk which awakened her so she arose removed her dress washed and brushed her hair put on a fresh dress and taking a book she crossed the street and sat on the bank of the stream again which she watched instead of reading as she had intended CHAPTER VI KATE S PRIVATE PUPIL AT FIRST Kate merely sat in a pleasant place and allowed her nerves to settle after the short nap she had enjoyed in the rocking chair It was such a novel experience for her to sit idle that despite the attractions of growing things running water and singing birds she soon veered to thoughts of what she would be doing if she were at home and that brought her to the fact that she was forbidden her father s house so if she might not go there she was homeless As she had known her father for nearly nineteen years for she had a birth anniversary coming in a few days she felt positive that he never would voluntarily see her again while with his constitution he would live for years She might as well face the fact that she was homeless and prepare to pay her way all the year round She wondered why she felt so forlorn and what made the dull ache in her throat She remembered telling Nancy Ellen before going away to Normal that she wished her father would drive her from home Now that was accomplished She was away from home in a place where there was not one familiar face object or plan of life but she did not wish for it at all She devoutly wished that she were back at home even if she were preparing supper in order that Nancy Ellen might hem towels She wondered what they were saying her mind was crystal clear as to what they were doing She wondered if Nancy Ellen would send Adam threed with a parcel of cut out sewing for her to work on She resolved to sew quickly and with stitches of machine like evenness if it came She wondered if Nancy Ellen would be compelled to put off her wedding and teach the home school in order that it might be taught by a Bates as her father had demanded She wondered if Nancy Ellen was forced to this uncongenial task whether it would sour the wonderful sweetness developed by her courtship and make her so provoked that she would not write or have anything to do with her They were nearly the same age they had shared rooms and until recently beds and whatever life brought them now Kate lifted her head and ran her hand against her throat to ease the ache gathering there more intensely every minute With eyes that did not see she sat staring at the sheer walls of the ravine as it ran toward the east where the water came tumbling and leaping down over stones and shale bed When at last she arose she had learned one lesson not in the History she carried No matter what its disadvantages are having a home of any kind is vastly preferable to having none And the casualness of people so driven by the demands of living and money making that they do not take time even to be slightly courteous and kind no matter how objectionable it may be still that even that is better than their active displeasure So she sat brooding and going over and over the summer arguing her side of the case honestly trying to see theirs until she was mentally exhausted and still had accomplished nothing further than arriving at the conclusion that if Nancy Ellen was forced to postpone her wedding she would turn against her and influence Robert Gray in the same feeling Then Kate thought of Him She capitalized him in her thought for after nineteen years of Bates men Robert Gray would seem a deified creature to their women She reviewed the scene at the crossing log while her face flushed with pleasure If she had remained at home and had gone after the blackberries as it was sure as fate that she would have done then she would have met him first and he would have courted her instead of Nancy Ellen Suddenly Kate shook herself savagely and sat straight Why you big fool she said Nancy Ellen went to the berry patch in a pink dress wearing a sunbonnet to match and carrying a blue bowl Think of the picture she made But if I had gone I d have been in a ragged old dirt coloured gingham Father s boots and his old straw hat jammed down to my ears I d have been hot and in a surly temper rebelling because I had the berries to pick He would have taken one look at me jumped the fence and run to Lang s for dear life Better cut that idea right out So Kate cut that idea out at once but the operation was painful because when one turns mental surgeon and operates on the ugly spots in one s disposition there is no anaesthetic nor is the work done with skilful hands so the wounds are numerous and leave ugly scars but Kate was ruthless She resolved never to think of that brook scene again In life as she had lived it she would not have profited by having been first at the berry patch Yet she had a right to think of Robert Gray s face grave in concern for her his offers to help the influence he would have in her favour with Nancy Ellen Of course if he was forced to postpone his wedding he would not be pleased but it was impossible that the fears which were tormenting Nancy Ellen would materialize into action on his part No sane man loved a woman as beautiful as her sister and cast her aside because of a few months enforced waiting the cause of which he so very well knew but it would make both of them unhappy and change their beautiful plans after he even had found and purchased the house Still Nancy Ellen said that her father was making it a point of honour that a Bates should teach the school because he had signed the contract for Kate to take the place Nancy Ellen had intended to fill and then changed her plans He had sworn that a Bates should teach the school Well Hiram had taken the county examination as all pupils of the past ten years had when they finished the country schools It was a test required to prove whether they had done their work well Hiram held a certificate for a year given him by the County Superintendent when he passed the examinations He had never used it He could teach he was Nancy Ellen s twin School did not begin until the first of November He could hire help with his corn if he could not finish alone He could arise earlier than usual and do his feeding and milking he could clean the stables haul wood on Saturday and Sunday if he must for the Bates family looked on Sunday more as a day of rest for the horses and physical man than as one of religious observances They always worked if there was anything to be gained by it Six months being the term he would be free by the first of May surely the money would be an attraction while Nancy Ellen could coach him on any new methods she had learned at Normal Kate sprang to her feet ran across the street and entering the hall hurried to her room She found missus Holt there in the act of closing her closet door Kate looked at her with astonished eyes I was just telling my son missus Holt said rather breathlessly that I would take a peep and see if I had forgot to put your extra covers on the shelf Kate threw her book on the bed and walked to the table She had experienced her share of battle for the day No children to rummage passed through her brain It was the final week of hot dry August weather while a point had been made of calling her attention to the extra cover when the room had been shown her She might have said these things but why say them The shamed face of the woman convicted her of rummaging as she had termed it Without a word Kate sat down beside the table drew her writing material before her and began addressing an envelope to her brother Hiram missus Holt left the room disliking Kate more than if she had said what the woman knew she thought Kate wrote briefly convincingly covering every objection and every advantage she could conceive and then she added the strongest plea she could make What Hiram would do she had no idea As with all Bates men land was his God but it required money to improve it He would feel timid about making a first attempt to teach after he was married and a father of a child but Nancy Ellen s marriage would furnish plausible excuse all of the family had done their school work as perfectly as all work they undertook he could teach if he wanted to would he want to If he did at least she would be sure of the continued friendship of her sister and Robert Gray Suddenly Kate understood what that meant to her as she had not realized before She was making long strides toward understanding herself which is the most important feature of any life She sent a line of pleading to her sister in law a word of love to the baby and finishing her letter started to post it as she remembered the office was only a few steps down the street In the hall it occurred to her that she was the Teacher now and so should be an example Possibly the women of Walden did not run bareheaded down the street on errands She laid the letter on a small shelf of an old hatrack and stepped back to her room to put on her hat Her return was so immediate that missus Holt had the letter in her fingers when Kate came back and was reading the address so intently that with extended hand the girl said in cold tones My letter please before the woman realized she was there Their eyes met in a level look missus Holt s mouth opened in ready excuse but this time Kate s temper overcame her better judgment Can you read it clearly without your glasses she asked politely I wouldn t for the world have you make a mistake as to whom my letter is addressed It goes to my brother Hiram Bates youngest son of Adam Bates Bates Corners Hartley Indiana I was going to give it to my son so that he could take it to the office said missus Holt And I am going to take it myself as I know your son is down town and I want it to go over on the evening hack so it will be sure to go out early in the morning Surprise overcame missus Holt s discomfiture Land sakes she cried Bates is such a common name it didn t mean a thing to me Be you a daughter of Adam Bates the Land King of Bates Corners I be said Kate tersely Well I never All them hundreds of acres of land an money in the bank an mortgages on half his neighbours Whut the nation An no more of better clo s an you got An teachin school I never heard of the like in all my days If you have Bates history down so fine you should know that every girl of the entire Bates family has taught from the time she finished school until she married Also we never buy more clothing than we need or of the kind not suitable for our work This may explain why we own some land and have a few cents in the Bank My letter please Kate turned and went down the street a dull red tingeing her face I could hate that woman cordially without half trying she said The house was filled with the odour of cooking food when she returned and soon she was called to supper As she went to the chair indicated for her a step was heard in the hall Kate remained standing and when a young man entered the room missus Holt at once introduced her son George He did not take the trouble to step around the table and shake hands but muttered a gruff howdy do and seating himself at once picked up the nearest dish and began filling his plate His mother would have had matters otherwise Why George she chided What s your hurry Why don t you brush up and wait on Miss Bates first Oh if she is going to be one of the family he said she will have to learn to get on without much polly foxing Grub is to eat We can all reach at a table of this size Kate looked at George Holt with a searching glance Surely he was almost thirty of average height appeared strong and as if he might have a forceful brain but he was loosely jointed and there was a trace of domineering selfishness on his face that was repulsive to her I could hate that MAN cordially without half trying she thought to herself smiling faintly at the thought The sharp eyes of missus Holt detected the smile She probably would have noticed it if Kate had merely thought of smiling Why do you smile my dear she asked in melting tone Oh I was feeling so at home answered Kate suavely Father and the boys hold exactly those opinions and practise them in precisely the same way only if I were to think about it at all I should think that a man within a year of finishing a medical course would begin exercising politeness with every woman he meets I believe a doctor depends on women to be most of his patients and women don t like a rude doctor Rot said George Holt Miss Bates is exactly right said his mother Ain t I been tellin you the whole endurin time that you d never get a call unless you practised manners as well as medicine Ain t I now Yes you have he said angrily But if you think all of a sudden that manners are so essential why didn t you hammer some into me when you had the whip hand and could do what you pleased You didn t find any fault with my manners then How of all the world was I to know that you d grow up and go in for doctorin I s pos d then you d take the farm an run it like your pa did stead of forcin me to sell it off by inches to live an then you wastin half the money Go it Mother said George Holt rudely Tell all you know and then piece out with anything you can think of that you don t missus Holt s face flushed crimson She looked at Kate and said vindictively If you want any comfort in life never marry and bring a son inter the world You kin humour him and cook for him an work your hands to the bone fur him and sell your land and spend all you can raise educatin him for half a dozen things an him never stickin to none or payin back a cent but sass in your old age Go it Mother you re doing fine said George If you keep on Miss Bates will want to change her boarding place before morning It will not be wholly your mother s fault if I do said Kate I would suggest that if we can t speak civilly we eat our supper in silence This is very good food I could enjoy it if I had a chance She helped herself to another soda biscuit and a second piece of fried chicken and calmly began eating them That s a good idy said missus Holt Then why don t you practice it said her son Thereupon began a childish battle for the last word Kate calmly arose picked up her plate walked from the room down the hall and entering her own room closed the door quietly You fool You great big dunderheaded fool cried missus Holt Now you have done it for the thousandth time She will start out in less than no time to find some place else to stay an who could blame her Don t you know who she is Ain t you sense in your head If there was ever a girl you ort to go after and go quick an hard there she is What That big beef What for asked George You idjit You idjit Don t you sense that she s a daughter of Adam Bates Him they call the Land King Ain t you sense ner reason Drive her from the house will you An me relyin on sendin you half her board money to help you out You fool Why under the Heavens didn t you tell me How could I know No danger but the bowl is upset and it s all your fault She should be worth ten thousand maybe twenty I never knew till jist before supper I got it frum a letter she wrote to her brother I d no chanct to tell you Course I meant to first chanct I had but you go to work an upset everything before I get a chanct You never did amount to anything an you never will Oh well now stop that I didn t know I thought she was just common truck I ll fix it up with her right after supper Now shut up You can t do it It s gone too far She ll leave the house inside fifteen minutes said missus Holt Well I ll just show you he boasted George Holt pushed back his plate wiped his mouth brushed his teeth at the washing place on the back porch and sauntered around the house to seat himself on the front porch steps Kate saw him there and remained in her room When he had waited an hour he arose and tapped on her door Kate opened it Miss Bates he said I have been doing penance an hour I am very sorry I was such a boor I was in earnest when I said I didn t get the gad when I needed it I had a big disappointment to day and I came in sore and cross I am ashamed of myself but you will never see me that way again I know I will make a failure of my profession if I don t be more polite than Mother ever taught me to be Won t you let me be your scholar too Please do come over to the ravine where it is cool and give me my first lesson I need you dreadfully Kate was desperately in need of human companionship in that instant herself someone who could speak and sin and suffer and repent As she looked straight in the face of the man before her she saw not him being rude and quarrelling pettily with his mother but herself racing around the dining table pursued by her father raving like an insane man Who was she to judge or to refuse help when it was asked She went with him and missus Holt listening and peering from the side of the window blind of her room across the hall watched them cross the road and sit beside each other on the bank of the ravine in what seemed polite and amicable conversation So she heaved a deep sigh of relief and went to wash the dishes and plan breakfast Better feed her up pretty well til she gits the habit of staying here and mebby the rest who take boarders will be full she said to herself Time enough to go at skimpin when she s settled and busy an I get the whip hand But in planning to get the whip hand missus Holt reckoned without Kate She had been under the whip hand all her life Her dash to freedom had not been accomplished without both mental and physical hurt She was doing nothing but going over her past life minutely and as she realized more fully with each review how barren and unlovely it had been all the strength and fresh young pride in her arose in imperative demand for something better in the future She listened with interest to what George Holt said to her All her life she had been driven by a man of inflexible will his very soul inoculated with greed for possessions which would give him power his body endowed with unfailing strength to meet the demands he made on it and his heart wholly lacking in sentiment but she did not propose to start her new life by speaking of her family to strangers George Holt s experiences had been those of a son spoiled by a weak woman one day petted the next bribed the next nagged again left to his own devices for days with strong inherited tendencies to be fought tendencies to what he did not say Looking at his heavy jaw and swarthy face Kate supplied temper and not much inclination to work He had asked her to teach him she would begin by setting him an example in the dignity of self control then she would make him work How she would make that big strong man work As she sat there on the bank of the ravine with a background of delicately leafed bushes and the light of the setting sun on her face and her hair George Holt studied her closely mentally and physically and would have given all he possessed if he had not been so hasty He saw that she had a good brain and courage to follow her convictions while on closer study he decided that she was moulded on the finest physical lines of any woman he ever had seen also his study of medicine taught him to recognize glowing health and to set a right estimate on it Truly he was sorry to the bottom of his soul but he did not believe in being too humble He said as much in apology as he felt forced and then set himself the task of calling out and parading the level best he could think up concerning himself or life in general He had tried farming teaching merchandise and law before he had decided his vocation was medicine On account of Robert Gray Kate was much interested in this but when she asked what college he was attending he said he was going to a school in Chicago that was preparing to revolutionize the world of medicine Then he started on a hobby that he had ridden for months paying for the privilege so Kate learned with surprise and no small dismay that in a few months a man could take a course in medicine that would enable him to cure any ill to which the human flesh is heir as he expressed it without knowing anything of surgery or drugs or using either Kate was amazed and said so at once She disconcertingly inquired what he would do with patients who had sustained fractured skulls developed cancers or been exposed to smallpox But the man before her proposed to deal with none of those disagreeable things or their like He was going to make fame and fortune in the world by treating mental and muscular troubles He was going to be a Zonoletic Doctor He turned teacher and spelled it for her because she never had heard the word Kate looked at George Holt long and with intense interest while her mind was busy with new thoughts On her pillow that night she decided that if she were a man driven by a desire to heal the suffering of the world she would be the man who took the long exhaustive course of training that enabled him to deal with accidents contagions and germ developments He looked at her with keen appreciation of her physical freshness and mental strength and manoeuvred patiently toward the point where he would dare ask blankly how many there were in her family and on exactly how many acres her father paid tax He decided it would not do for at least a week yet possibly he could raise the subject casually with someone down town who would know so that he need never ask her at all Whatever the answer might be it was definitely settled in his own mind that Kate was the best chance he had ever had or probably ever would have He mapped out his campaign This week before he must go he would be her pupil and her slave The holiday week he would be her lover In the spring he would propose and in the fall he would marry her and live on the income from her land ever afterward It was a glowing prospect so glowing that he seriously considered stopping school at once so that her could be at the courting part of his campaign three times a day and every evening He was afraid to leave for fear people of the village would tell the truth about him He again studied Kate carefully and decided that during the week that was coming by deft and energetic work he could so win her approval that he could make her think that she knew him better than outsiders did So the siege began Kate had decided to try making him work to see if he would or was accustomed to it He was sufficiently accustomed to it that he could do whatever she suggested with facility that indicated practice and there was no question of his willingness He urged her to make suggestions as to what else he could do after he had made all the needed repairs about the house and premises Kate was enjoying herself immensely before the week was over She had another row of wood corded to the shed roof in case the winter should be severe She had the stove she thought would warm her room polished and set up while he was there to do it She had the back porch mended and the loose board in the front walk replaced She borrowed buckets and cloths and impressed George Holt for the cleaning of the school building which she superintended Before the week was over she had every child of school age who came to the building to see what was going on scouring out desks blacking stoves raking the yard even cleaning the street before the building Across the street from his home George sawed the dead wood from the trees and then with three days to spare Kate turned her attention to the ravine She thought that probably she could teach better there in the spring than in the school building She and George talked it over He raised all the objections he could think of that the townspeople would while entirely agreeing with her himself but it was of no use She over ruled the proxy objections he so kindly offered her so he was obliged to drag his tired body up the trees on both banks for several hundred yards and drop the dead wood Kate marshalled a corps of boys who would be her older pupils and they dragged out the dry branches saved all that were suitable for firewood and made bonfires from the remainder They raked the tin cans and town refuse of years from the water and banks and induced the village delivery man to haul the stuff to the river bridge and dump it in the deepest place in the stream They cleaned the creek bank to the water s edge and built rustic seats down the sides They even rolled boulders to the bed and set them where the water would show their markings and beat itself to foam against them missus Holt looked on in breathless amazement and privately expressed to her son her opinion of him in terse and vigorous language He answered laconically Has a fish got much to say about what happens to it after you get it out of the water No snapped missus Holt and neither have you if you kill yourself to get it Do I look killed inquired her son No You look the most like a real man I ever saw you she conceded And Kate Bates won t need glasses for forty years yet he said as he went back to his work in the ravine Kate was in the middle of the creek helping plant a big stone He stood a second watching her as she told the boys surrounding her how best to help her then he turned away a dull red burning his cheek I ll have her if I die for it he muttered but I hope to Heaven she doesn t think I am going to work like this for her every day of my life As the villagers sauntered past and watched the work of the new teacher many of them thought of things at home they could do that would improve their premises greatly and a few went home and began work of like nature That made their neighbours places look so unkempt that they were forced to trim and rake and mend in turn so by the time the school began the whole village was busy in a crusade that extended to streets and alleys while the new teacher was the most popular person who had ever been there Without having heard of such a thing Kate had started Civic Improvement George Holt leaned against a tree trunk and looked down at her as he rested Do you suppose there is such a thing as ever making anything out of this he asked A perfectly lovely public park for the village yes money selling it for anything no It s too narrow a strip cut too deeply with the water the banks too steep Commercially I can t see that it is worth ten cents Cheering It is the only thing on earth that truly and wholly belongs to me The road divided the land Father willed everything on the south side to Mother so she would have the house and the land on this side was mine I sold off all I could to Jasper Linn to add to his farm but he would only buy to within about twenty rods of the ravine The land was too rocky and poor So about half a mile of this comprises my earthly possessions Do you keep up the taxes she asked No I ve never paid them he said carelessly Then don t be too sure it is yours she said Someone may have paid them and taken the land You had better look it up What for he demanded It is beautiful It is the shadiest coolest place in town Having it here doubles the value of your mother s house across the street In some way some day it might turn out to be worth something I can t see how he said Some of the trees may become valuable when lumber gets scarcer as it will when the land grows older Maybe a stone quarry could be opened up if the stone runs back as far as you say A lot of things might make it valuable If I were you I would go to Hartley quietly to morrow and examine the records and if there are back taxes I d pay them I ll look it up anyway he agreed You surely have made another place of it It will be wonderful by spring I can think of many uses for it said Kate Here comes your mother to see how we are getting along Instead she came to hand Kate a letter she had brought from the post office while doing her marketing Kate took the letter saw at a glance that it was from Nancy Ellen and excusing herself she went to one of the seats they had made and turning her face so that it could not be seen she read DEAR KATE You can prepare yourself for the surprise of your life Two Bates men have done something for one of their women I hope you will survive the shock it almost finished me and Mother is still speechless I won t try to prepare you I could not Here it is Father raged for three days and we got out of his way like scared rabbits I saw I had to teach so I said I would but I had not told Robert because I couldn t bear to Then up came Hiram and offered to take the school for me Father said no I couldn t get out of it that way Hiram said I had not seen him or sent him any word and I could prove by mother I hadn t been away from the house so Father believed him He said he wanted the money to add two acres to his land from the Simms place that would let his stock down to water on the far side of his land where it would be a great convenience and give him a better arrangement of fields so he could make more money You know Father He shut up like a clam and only said Do what you please If a Bates teaches the school it makes my word good So Hiram is going to teach for me He is brushing up a little nights and I am helping him on theory and I am wild with joy and so is Robert I shall have plenty of time to do all my sewing and we shall be married at or after Christmas Robert says to tell you to come to see him if you ever come to Hartley He is there in his office now and it is lonesome but I am busy and the time will soon pass I might as well tell you that Father said right after you left that you should never enter his house again and Mother and I should not speak your name before him I do hope he gets over it before the wedding Write me how you like your school and where you board Maybe Robert and I can slip off and drive over to see you some day But that would make Father so mad if he found out that he would not give me the money he promised so we had better not but you come to see us as soon as we get in our home Love from both NANCY ELLEN Kate read the joyful letter slowly It contained all she hoped for She had not postponed Nancy Ellen s wedding That was all she asked She had known she would not be forgiven so soon there was slight hope she ever would Her only chance thought Kate lay in marrying a farmer having about a thousand acres of land If she could do that her father would let her come home again sometime She read the letter slowly over then tearing it in long strips she cross tore them and sifted the handful of small bits on the water where they started a dashing journey toward the river missus Holt narrowly watching her turned with snaky gleaming eyes to her son and whispered A ha Miss Smart Alec has a secret CHAPTER VII HELPING NANCY ELLEN AND ROBERT TO ESTABLISH A HOME THE remainder of the time before leaving George Holt spent in the very strongest mental and physical effort to show Kate how much of a man he was He succeeded in what he hoped he might do He so influenced her in his favour that during the coming year whenever any one showed signs of criticising him Kate stopped them by commendation based upon what she supposed to be knowledge of him With the schoolhouse and grounds cleaned as they never had been before the parents and pupils naturally expected new methods During the week spent in becoming acquainted with the teacher the parents heartily endorsed her while the pupils liked her cordially It could be seen at a glance that she could pick up the brawniest of them and drop him from the window if she chose The days at the stream had taught them her physical strength while at the same time they had glimpses of her mental processes The boys learned many things that they must not lie or take anything which did not belong to them that they must be considerate and manly if they were to be her friends yet not one word had been said on any of these subjects As she spoke to them they answered her and soon spoke in the same way to each other She was very careful about each statement she made often adducing convenient proof so they saw that she was always right and never exaggerated The first hour of this made the boys think the second they imitated the third they instantly obeyed She started in to interest and educate these children she sent them home to investigate more subjects the first day than they had ever carried home in any previous month Boys suddenly began asking their fathers about business girls questioned their mothers about marketing and housekeeping The week of Christmas vacation was going to be the hardest everyone expected the teacher to go home for the Holidays Many of them knew that her sister was marrying the new doctor of Hartley When Kate was wondering how she could possibly conceal the rupture with her family Robert Gray drove into Walden and found her at the schoolhouse She was so delighted to see him that she made no attempt to conceal her joy He had driven her way for exercise and to pay her a call When he realized from her greeting how she had felt the separation from her family he had an idea that he at once propounded Kate I have come to ask a favour of you he said Granted laughed Kate Whatever can it be Just this I want you to pack a few clothes drive to Hartley with me and do what you can to straighten out the house so there won t be such confusion when Nancy Ellen gets there Kate stared at him in a happy daze Oh you blessed Robert Gray What a Heavenly idea she cried Of course it wouldn t be possible for me to fix Nancy Ellen s house the way she would but I could put everything where it belonged I could arrange well enough and I could have a supper ready so that you could come straight home Then you will do it he asked Do it cried Kate Do it Why I would be willing to pay you for the chance to do it How do you think I m to explain my not going home for the Holidays and to my sister s wedding and retain my self respect before my patrons I didn t think of it in that way he said I m crazy said Kate Take me quickly How far along are you House cleaned blinds up stoves all in coal and wood cellar stocked carpets down and furniture all there but not unwrapped or in place Dishes delivered but not washed cooking utensils there but not cleaned Enough said laughed Kate You go marry Nancy Ellen I shall have the house warm arranged so you can live in it and the first meal ready when you come Does Nancy Ellen know you are here No I have enough country practice that I need a horse I m trying this one I think of you often so I thought I d drive out How are you making it Kate Just fine so far as the school goes I don t particularly like the woman I board with Her son is some better yes he is much better And Robert what is a Zonoletic Doctor A poor fool too lazy to be a real doctor with no conscience about taking people s money for nothing he said As bad as THAT asked Kate Worse Why he said Oh I only wondered said Kate Now I am ready here but I must run to the house where I board a minute It s only a step You watch where I go and drive down She entered the house quietly and going back to the kitchen she said The folks have come for me missus Holt I don t know exactly when I shall be back but in plenty of time to start school If George goes before I return tell him Merry Christmas for me He ll be most disappointed to death said missus Holt I don t see why he should said Kate calmly You never have had the teacher here at Christmas We never had a teacher that I wanted before said missus Holt while Kate turned to avoid seeing the woman s face as she perjured herself You re like one of the family George is crazy about you He wrote me to be sure to keep you Couldn t you possibly stay over Sunday No I couldn t said Kate Who came after you asked missus Holt doctor Gray answered Kate That new doctor at Hartley Why be you an him friends missus Holt had followed down the hall eagerly waiting in the doorway Kate glanced at her and felt sudden pity The woman was warped Everything in her life had gone wrong Possibly she could not avoid being the disagreeable person she was Kate smiled at her Worse than that she said We be relations in a few days He s going to marry my sister Nancy Ellen next Tuesday Kate understood the indistinct gurgle she heard to be approving so she added He came after me early so I could go to Hartley and help get their new house ready for them to live in after the ceremony Did your father give them the house asked missus Holt eagerly No doctor Gray bought his home said Kate How nice What did your father give them Kate s patience was exhausted You ll have to wait until I come back she said I haven t the gift of telling about things before they have happened Then she picked up her telescope and saying good bye left the house As they drove toward Hartley I m anxious to see your house said Kate Did you find one in a good neighbourhood The very best I think said the doctor That is all one could offer Nancy Ellen I m so glad for her And I m glad for you too She ll make you a beautiful wife in every way She s a good cook she knows how to economize and she s too pretty for words if she IS my sister I heartily agree with you said the doctor But I notice you put the cook first and the beauty last You will too before you get through with it answered Kate Here we are said he soon after they entered Hartley I ll drive around the block so you can form an idea of the location Kate admired every house in the block the streets and trees the one house Robert Gray had selected in every particular They went inside and built fires had lunch together at the hotel and then Kate rolled up her sleeves and with a few yards of cheese cloth for a duster began unwrapping furniture and standing it in the room where it belonged Robert moved the heavy pieces then he left to call on a patient and spend the evening with Nancy Ellen So Kate spent several happy days setting Nancy Ellen s new home in order From basement to garret she had it immaculate and shining No Bates girl not even Agatha ever had gone into a home having so many comforts and conveniences Kate felt lonely the day she knew her home was overcrowded with all their big family she sat very still thinking of them during the hour of the ceremony she began preparing supper almost immediately because Robert had promised her that he would not eat any more of the wedding feast than he could help and he would bring Nancy Ellen as soon afterward as possible Kate saw them drive to the gate and come up the walk together As they entered the door Nancy Ellen was saying Why how does the house come to be all lighted up Seems to me I smell things to eat Well if the table isn t all set There was a pause and then Nancy Ellen s clear voice called Kate Kate Where are you Nobody else would be THIS nice to me You dear girl where are you I ll get to stay until I go back to school was Kate s mental comment as she ran to clasp Nancy Ellen in her arms while they laughed and very nearly cried together so that the doctor felt it incumbent upon him to hug both of them Shortly afterward he said There is a fine show in town to night and I have three tickets Let s all go Let s eat before we go said Nancy Ellen I haven t had time to eat a square meal for a week and things smell deliciously They finished their supper leisurely stacked the dishes and went to the theatre where they saw a fair performance of a good play which was to both of the girls a great treat When they returned home Kate left Nancy Ellen and Robert to gloat over the carpets they had selected as they appeared on their floors to arrange the furniture and re examine their wedding gifts while she slipped into the kitchen and began washing the dishes and planning what she would have for breakfast But soon they came to her and Nancy Ellen insisted on wiping the dishes while Robert carried them to the cupboard Afterward they sat before their fireplace and talked over events since the sisters separation Nancy Ellen told about getting ready for her wedding life at home the school the news of the family the Kate drew a perfect picture of the Walden school her boarding place missus Holt the ravine the town and the people with the exception of George Holt him she never mentioned After Robert had gone to his office the following morning Kate said to Nancy Ellen Now I wish you would be perfectly frank with me As if I could be anything else laughed the bride All right then said Kate What I want is this that these days shall always come back to you in memory as nearly perfect as possible Now if my being here helps ever so little I like to stay and I ll be glad to cook and wash dishes while you fix your house to suit you But if you d rather be alone I ll go back to Walden and be satisfied and happy with the fine treat this has been I can look everyone in the face now talk about the wedding and feel all right Nancy Ellen said slowly I shan t spare you until barely time to reach your school Monday morning And I m not keeping you to work for me either We ll do everything together and then we ll plan how to make the house pretty and go see Robert in his office and go shopping I ll never forgive you if you go Why Nancy Ellen said Kate then fled to the kitchen too happy to speak further None of them ever forgot that week It was such a happy time that all of them dreaded its end but when it came they parted cheerfully and each went back to work the better for the happy reunion Kate did not return to Walden until Monday then she found missus Holt in an evil temper Kate could not understand it She had no means of knowing that for a week George had nagged his mother unceasingly because Kate was gone on his return and would not be back until after time for him to go again The only way for him to see her during the week he had planned to come out openly as her lover was to try to find her at her home or at her sister s He did not feel that it would help him to go where he never had been asked His only recourse was to miss a few days of school and do extra work to make it up but he detested nothing in life as he detested work so the world s happy week had been to them one of constant sparring and unhappiness for which missus Holt blamed Kate Her son had returned expecting to court Kate Bates strenuously his disappointment was not lightened by his mother s constant nagging Monday forenoon she went to market and came in gasping Land sakes she cried as she panted down the hall I ve got a good one on that impident huzzy now You better keep your mouth shut and not gossip about her he said Everyone likes her No they don t for I hate her worse n snakes If it wa n t for her money I d fix her so s at she d never marry you in kingdom come George Holt clenched his big fist Just you try it he threatened Just you try that You ll live to see the day you d thank me if I did She ain t been home Mind you she ain t been HOME She never seen her sister married at all Tilly Nepple has a sister living near the Bates who worked in the kitchen She s visitin at Tilly s now Miss High and Mighty never seen her sister married at all An it looked mighty queer her comin here a week ahead of time in the fall Looks like she d done somepin she don t DARE go home No wonder she tears every scrap of mail she gets to ribbons an burns it I told you she had a secret If ever you d listen to me Why you re crazy he exclaimed I did listen to you What you told me was that I should go after her with all my might So I did it Now you come with this Shut it up Don t let her get wind of it for the world And Tilly Nepple s sister says old Land King Bates never give his daughter a cent an he never gives none of his girls a cent It s up to the men they marry to take keer of them The old skin flint What you want to do is to go long to your schoolin if you reely are going to make somepin of yourself at last an let that big strap of a girl be do Now stop shouted George Holt Scenting another scandal are you Don t you dare mar Kate Bates standing or her reputation in this town or we ll have a time like we never had before If old Bates doesn t give his girls anything when they marry they ll get more when he dies And so far as money is concerned this has gone PAST money with me I m going to marry Kate Bates as soon as ever I can and I ve got to the place where I d marry her if she hadn t a cent If I can t take care of her she can take care of me I am crazy about her an I m going to have her so you keep still an do all you can to help me or you ll regret it It s you that will regret it she said Stop your nagging I tell you or I ll come at you in a way you won t like he cried You do that every day you re here said missus Holt starting to the kitchen to begin dinner Kate appeared in half an hour fresh and rosy also prepared for one of her little pupils had said Tilly Nepple s sister say you wasn t at your sister s wedding at all Did you cry cause you couldn t go Instantly Kate comprehended what must be town gossip so she gave the child a happy solution of the question bothering her and went to her boarding house forewarned She greeted both missus Holt and her son cordially then sat down to dinner in the best of spirits The instant her chance came missus Holt said Now tell us all about the lovely wedding But I wasn t managing the wedding said Kate cheerfully I was on the infare job Mother and Nancy Ellen put the wedding through You know our house isn t very large and close relatives fill it to bursting I ve seen the same kind of wedding about every eighteen months all my life I had a NEW job this time and one I liked better She turned to George Of course your mother told you that doctor Gray came after me He came to ask me as an especial favour to go to his new house in Hartley and do what I could to arrange it and to have a supper ready I was glad I d seen six weddings that I can remember all exactly alike there s nothing to them but brushing those new carpets unwrapping nice furniture and placing it washing pretty new dishes untying the loveliest gifts and arranging them THAT was something new in a Bates wedding Oh but I had a splendid time George Holt looked at his mother in too great disgust to conceal his feelings ANOTHER gilt edged scandal gone sky high he said Then he turned to Kate One of the women who worked in your mother s kitchen is visiting here and she started a great hullabaloo because you were not at the wedding You probably haven t got a leg left to stand on I suspect the old cats of Walden have chewed them both off and all the while you were happy and doing the thing any girl would much rather have done Lord I hate this eternal picking How did you come back Kate doctor Gray brought me I should think it would have made talk your staying there with him commented missus Holt Fortunately the people of Hartley seem reasonably busy attending their own affairs said Kate Doctor Gray had been boarding at the hotel all fall so he just went on living there until after the wedding George glared at his mother but she avoided his eyes and laughing in a silly half confused manner she said How much money did your father give the bride I can t tell you in even dollars and cents said Kate Nancy Ellen didn t say Kate saw the movement of George s foot under the table and knew that he was trying to make his mother stop asking questions so she began talking to him about his work As soon as the meal was finished he walked with her to school visiting until the session began He remained three days and before he left he told Kate he loved her and asked her to be his wife She looked at him in surprise and said Why I never thought of such a thing How long have you been thinking about it Since the first instant I saw you he declared with fervour Hum Matter of months said Kate Well when I have had that much time I will tell you what I think about it CHAPTER VIII THE HISTORY OF A LEGHORN HAT Kate finished her school in the spring then went for a visit with Nancy Ellen and Robert before George Holt returned She was thankful to leave Walden without having seen him for she had decided without giving the matter much thought that he was not the man she wanted to marry In her heart she regretted having previously contracted for the Walden school another winter because she felt certain that with the influence of doctor Gray she could now secure a position in Hartley that would enable her either to live with or to be near her sister With this thought in mind she tried to make the acquaintance of teachers in the school who lived in Hartley and she soon became rather intimate with one of them It was while visiting with this teacher that Kate spoke of attending Normal again in an effort to prepare herself still better for the work of the coming year Her new friend advised against it She said the course would be only the same thing over again with so little change or advancement that the trip was not worth the time and money it would cost She proposed that Kate go to Lake Chautauqua and take the teachers course where all spare time could be put in attending lectures and concerts and studying the recently devised methods of education Kate went from her to Nancy Ellen and Robert determined at heart to go She was pleased when they strongly advised her to and offered to help her get ready Aside from having paid Agatha and for her board Kate had spent almost nothing on herself She figured the probable expenses of the trip for a month what it would cost her to live until school began again if she were forced to go to Walden and then spent all her remaining funds on the prettiest clothing she had ever owned Each of the sisters knew how to buy carefully then the added advantage of being able to cut and make their own clothes made money go twice as far as where a dressmaker had to be employed When everything they had planned was purchased neatly made and packed in a trunk into which Nancy Ellen slipped some of her prettiest belongings Kate made a trip to a milliner s shop to purchase her first real hat She had decided on a big wide brimmed Leghorn far from cheap While she was trying the effect of flowers and ribbon on it the wily milliner slipped up and with the hat on Kate s golden crown looped in front a bow of wide black velvet ribbon and drooped over the brim a long exquisitely curling ostrich plume Kate had one good view of herself before she turned her back on the temptation You look lovely in that said the milliner Don t you like it I certainly do said Kate I look the best in that hat with the black velvet and the plume I ever did but there s no use to look twice I can t afford it Oh but it is very reasonable We haven t a finer hat in the store nor a better plume said the milliner She slowly waved it in all its glory before Kate s beauty hungry eyes Kate turned so she could not see it Please excuse one question Are you teaching in Walden this winter asked the milliner Yes said Kate I have signed the contract for that school Then charge the hat and pay for it in September I d rather wait for my money than see you fail to spend the summer under that plume It really is lovely against your gold hair Get thee behind me Satan quoted Kate No I never had anything charged and never expect to Please have the black velvet put on and let me try it with the bows set and sewed All right said the milliner but I m sorry She was so sorry that she carried the plume to the work room and when she walked up behind Kate who sat waiting before the mirror and carefully set the hat on her head at exactly the right angle the long plume crept down one side and drooped across the girl s shoulder I will reduce it a dollar more she said and send the bill to you at Walden the last week of September Kate moved her head from side to side lifted and dropped her chin Then she turned to the milliner You should be killed she said The woman reached for a hat box No I shouldn t she said Waiting that long I ll not make much on the hat but I ll make a good friend who will come again and bring her friends What is your name please Kate took one look at herself smooth pink cheeks gray eyes gold hair the sweeping wide brim the trailing plume Miss Katherine Eleanor Bates she said Bates Corners Hartley Indiana Please call my carriage The milliner laughed heartily That s the spirit of seventy six she commended I d be willing to wager something worth while that this very hat brings you the carriage before fall if you show yourself in it in the right place It s a perfectly stunning hat Shall I send it or will you wear it Kate looked in the mirror again You may put a fresh blue band on the sailor I was wearing and send that to doctor Gray s when it is finished she said And put in a fancy bow for my throat of the same velvet as the hat please I ll surely pay you the last week of September And if you can think up an equally becoming hat for winter You just bet I can young lady said the milliner to herself as Kate walked down the street From afar Kate saw Nancy Ellen on the veranda so she walked slowly to let the effect sink in but it seemed to make no impression until she looked up at Nancy Ellen s very feet and said Well how do you like it Good gracious cried Nancy Ellen I thought I was having a stylish caller I didn t know you Why I never saw YOU walk that way before You wouldn t expect me to plod along as if I were plowing with a thing like this on my head would you I wouldn t expect you to have a thing like that on your head but since you have I don t mind telling you that you are stunning in it said Nancy Ellen Better and better laughed Kate sitting down on the step The milliner said it was a stunning HAT The goose said Nancy Ellen You become that hat Kate quite as much as the hat becomes you The following day dressed in a linen suit of natural colour with the black bow at her throat the new hat in a bandbox and the renewed sailor on her head Kate waved her farewells to Nancy Ellen and Robert on the platform then walked straight to the dressing room of the car and changed the hats Nancy Ellen had told her this was NOT the thing to do She should travel in a plain untrimmed hat and when the dust and heat of her journey were past she should bathe put on fresh clothing and wear such a fancy hat only with her best frocks in the afternoon Kate need not have been told that Right instincts and Bates economy would have taught her the same thing but she had a perverse streak in her nature She had SEEN herself in the hat The milliner who knew enough of the world and human nature to know how to sell Kate the hat when she never intended to buy it and knew she should not in the way she did had said that before fall it would bring her a carriage which put into bald terms meant a rich husband Now Kate liked her school and she gave it her full attention she had done and still intended to keep on doing first class work in the future but her school or anything pertaining to it was not worth mentioning beside Nancy Ellen s HOME and the deep understanding and strong feeling that showed so plainly between her and Robert Gray Kate expected to marry by the time she was twenty or soon after all Bates girls had most of them had married very well indeed She frankly envied Nancy Ellen while it never occurred to her that any one would criticise her for saying so Only one thing could happen to her that would surpass what had come to her sister If only she could have a man like Robert Gray and have him on a piece of land of their own Kate was a girl but no man of the Bates tribe ever was more deeply bitten by the lust for land She was the true daughter of her father in more than one way If that very expensive hat was going to produce the man why not let it begin to work from the very start If her man was somewhere only waiting to see her and the hat would help him to speedy recognition why miss a change She thought over the year and while she deplored the estrangement from home she knew that if she had to go back to one year ago giving up the present and what it had brought and promised to bring for a reconciliation with her father she would not voluntarily return to the old driving nagging overwork and skimping missing every real comfort of life to buy land in which she never would have any part You get your knocks taking the wings of morning thought Kate to herself but after all it is the only thing to do Nancy Ellen says Sally Whistler is pleasing Mother very well why should I miss my chance and ruin my temper to stay at home and do the work done by a woman who can do nothing else Kate moved her head slightly to feel if the big beautiful hat that sat her braids so lightly was still there Go to work you beauty thought Kate Do something better for me than George Holt I ll have him to fall back on if I can t do better but I think I can Yes I m very sure I can If you do your part you lovely plume I KNOW I can Toward noon the train ran into a violent summer storm The sky grew black the lightning flashed the wind raved the rain fell in gusts The storm was at its height when Kate quit watching it and arose preoccupied with her first trip to a dining car thinking about how little food she could order and yet avoid a hunger headache The twisting whirlwind struck her face as she stepped from the day coach to go to the dining car She threw back her head and sucked her lungs full of the pure rain chilled air She was accustomed to being out in storms she liked them One second she paused to watch the gale sweeping the fields the next a twitch at her hair caused her to throw up her hands and clutch wildly at nothing She sprang to the step railing and leaned out in time to see her wonderful hat whirl against the corner of the car hold there an instant with the pressure of the wind then slide down draw under and drop across the rail where passing wheels ground it to pulp Kate stood very still a second then she reached up and tried to pat the disordered strands of hair into place She turned and went back into the day coach opened the bandbox and put on the sailor She resumed her old occupation of thinking things over All the joy had vanished from the day and the trip Looking forward it had seemed all right to defy custom and Nancy Ellen s advice and do as she pleased Looking backward she saw that she had made a fool of herself in the estimation of everyone in the car by not wearing the sailor which was suitable for her journey and would have made no such mark for a whirling wind She found travelling even easier than any one had told her Each station was announced When she alighted there were conveyances to take her and her luggage to a hotel patronized almost exclusively by teachers near the schools and lecture halls Large front suites and rooms were out of the question for Kate but luckily a tiny corner room at the back of the building was empty and when Kate specified how long she would remain she secured it at a less figure than she had expected to pay She began by almost starving herself at supper in order to save enough money to replace her hat with whatever she could find that would serve passably and be cheap enough That far she proceeded stoically but when night settled and she stood in her dressing jacket brushing her hair something gave way Kate dropped on her bed and cried into her pillow as she never had cried before about anything It was not ALL about the hat While she was at it she shed a few tears about every cruel thing that had happened to her since she could remember that she had borne tearlessly at the time It was a deluge that left her breathless and exhausted When she finally sat up she found the room so close she gently opened her door and peeped into the hall There was a door opening on an outside veranda running across the end of the building and the length of the front As she looked from her door and listened intently she heard the sound of a woman s voice in choking stifled sobs in the room having a door directly across the narrow hall from hers My Lord THERE S TWO OF US said Kate She leaned closer listening again but when she heard a short groan mingled with the sobs she immediately tapped on the door Instantly the sobs ceased and the room became still Kate put her lips to the crack and said in her off hand way It s only a school marm rooming next you If you re ill could I get anything for you Will you please come in asked a muffled voice Kate turned the knob and stepping inside closed the door after her She could dimly see her way to the dresser where she found matches and lighted the gas On the bed lay in a tumbled heap a tiny elderly Dresden china doll woman She was fully dressed even to her wrap bonnet and gloves one hand clutched her side the other held a handkerchief to her lips Kate stood an instant under the light studying the situation The dark eyes in the narrow face looked appealingly at her The woman tried to speak but gasped for breath Kate saw that she had heart trouble The remedy Where is it she cried The woman pointed to a purse on the dresser Kate opened it took out a small bottle and read the directions In a second she was holding a glass to the woman s lips soon she was better She looked at Kate eagerly Oh please don t leave me she gasped Of course not said Kate instantly I ll stay as long as you want me She bent over the bed and gently drew the gloves from the frail hands She untied and slipped off the bonnet She hunted keys in the purse opened a travelling bag and found what she required Then slowly and carefully she undressed the woman helped her into a night robe and stooping she lifted her into a chair until she opened the bed After giving her time to rest Kate pulled down the white wavy hair and brushed it for the night As she worked she said a word of encouragement now and again when she had done all she could see to do she asked if there was more The woman suddenly clung to her hand and began to sob wildly Kate knelt beside the bed stroked the white hair patted the shoulder she could reach and talked very much as she would have to a little girl Please don t cry she begged It must be your heart you ll surely make it worse I m trying said the woman but I ve been scared sick I most certainly would have died if you hadn t come to me and found the medicine Oh that dreadful Susette How could she The clothing Kate had removed from the woman had been of finest cloth and silk Her hands wore wonderful rings A heavy purse was in her bag Everything she had was the finest that money could buy while she seemed as if a rough wind never had touched her She appeared so frail that Kate feared to let her sleep without knowing where to locate her friends She should be punished for leaving you alone among strangers said Kate indignantly If I only could learn to mind John sighed the little woman He never liked Susette But she was the very best maid I ever had She was like a loving daughter until all at once on the train among strangers she flared out at me and simply raved Oh it was dreadful And knowing you were subject to these attacks she did the thing that would precipitate one and then left you alone among strangers How wicked How cruel said Kate in tense indignation John didn t want me to come But I used to be a teacher and I came here when this place was mostly woods with my dear husband Then after he died through the long years of poverty and struggle I would read of the place and the wonderful meetings but I could never afford to come Then when John began to work and made good so fast I was dizzy half the time with his successes I didn t think about the place But lately since I ve had everything else I could think of something possessed me to come back here and take a suite among the women and men who are teaching our young people so wonderfully and to sail on the lake and hear the lectures and dream my youth over again I think that was it most of all to dream my youth over again to try to relive the past There now you have told me all about it said Kate stroking the white forehead in an effort to produce drowsiness close your eyes and go to sleep I haven t even BEGUN to tell you said the woman perversely If I talked all night I couldn t tell you about John How big he is and how brave he is and how smart he is and how he is the equal of any business man in Chicago and soon if he keeps on he will be worth as much as some of them more than any one of his age who has had a lot of help instead of having his way to make alone and a sick old mother to support besides No I couldn t tell you in a week half about John and he didn t want me to come If I would come then he wanted me to wait a few days until he finished a deal so he could bring me but the minute I thought of it I was determined to come you know how you get I know how badly you want to do a thing you have set your heart on admitted Kate I had gone places with Susette in perfect comfort I think the trouble was that she tried from the first to attract John About the time we started he let her see plainly that all he wanted of her was to take care of me she was pretty and smart so it made her furious She was pampered in everything as no maid I ever had before John is young yet and I think he is very handsome and he wouldn t pay any attention to her You see when other boys were going to school and getting acquainted with girls by association even when he was a little bit of a fellow in knee breeches I had to let him sell papers and then he got into a shop and he invented a little thing and then a bigger and bigger yet and then he went into stocks and things and he doesn t know anything about girls only about sick old women like me He never saw what Susette was up to You do believe that I wasn t ugly to her don t you You COULDN T be ugly if you tried said Kate The woman suddenly began to sob again this time slowly as if her forces were almost spent She looked to Kate for the sympathy she craved and for the first time really saw her closely Why you dear girl she cried Your face is all tear stained You ve been crying yourself Roaring in a pillow admitted Kate But my dear forgive me I was so upset with that dreadful woman Forgive me for not having seen that you too are in trouble Won t you please tell me Of course said Kate I lost my new hat But my dear Crying over a hat When it is so easy to get another How foolish said the woman Yes but you didn t see the hat said Kate And it will be far from easy to get another with this one not paid for yet I m only one season removed from sunbonnets so I never should have bought it at all The woman moved in bed and taking one of Kate s long crinkly braids she drew the wealth of gold through her fingers repeatedly Tell me about your hat she said So to humour this fragile woman and to keep from thinking of her own trouble Kate told the story of her Leghorn hat and ostrich plume and many things besides for she was not her usual terse self with her new friend who had to be soothed to forgetfulness Kate ended I was all wrong to buy such a hat in the first place I couldn t afford it it was foolish vanity I m not really good looking I shouldn t have flattered myself that I was Losing it before it was paid for was just good for me Never again will I be so foolish Why my dear don t say such things or think them chided the little woman You had as good a right to a becoming hat as any girl Now let me ask you one question and then I ll try to sleep You said you were a teacher Did you come here to attend the Summer School for Teachers Yes said Kate Would it make any great difference to you if you missed a few days she asked Not the least said Kate Well then you won t be offended will you if I ask you to remain with me and take care of me until John comes I could send him a message to night that I am alone and bring him by this time to morrow but I know he has business that will cause him to lose money should he leave and I was so wilful about coming I dread to prove him right so conclusively the very first day That door opens into a room reserved for Susette if only you d take it and leave the door unclosed to night and if only you would stay with me until John comes I could well afford to pay you enough to lengthen your stay as long as you d like and it makes me so happy to be with such a fresh young creature Will you stay with me my dear I certainly will said Kate heartily If you ll only tell me what I should do I m not accustomed to rich ladies you know I m not myself said the little woman but I do seem to take to being waited upon with the most remarkable facility CHAPTER IX A SUNBONNET GIRL WITH the first faint light of morning Kate slipped to the door to find her charge still sleeping soundly It was eight o clock when she heard a movement in the adjoining room and went again to the door This time the woman was awake and smilingly waved to Kate as she called Good morning Come right in I was wondering if you were regretting your hasty bargain Not a bit of it laughed Kate I am here waiting to be told what to do first I forgot to tell you my name last night It is Kate Bates I m from Bates Corners Hartley Indiana The woman held out her hand I m so very glad to meet you Miss Bates she said My name is Mariette Jardine My home is in Chicago They shook hands smiling at each other and then Kate said Now missus Jardine what shall I do for you first I will be dressed I think and then you may bring up the manager until I have an understanding with him and give him a message I want sent and an order for our breakfast I wonder if it wouldn t be nice to have it served on the corner of the veranda in front of our rooms under the shade of that big tree I think that would be famous said Kate They ate together under the spreading branches of a giant maple tree where they could see into the nest of an oriole that brooded in a long purse of gray lint and white cotton cord They could almost reach out and touch it The breakfast was good nicely served by a neat maid evidently doing something so out of the ordinary that she was rather stunned but she was a young person of some self possession for when she removed the tray missus Jardine thanked her and gave her a coin that brought a smiling Thank you very much If you want your dinner served here and will ask for Jennie Weeks I d like to wait on you again Thank you said missus Jardine I shall remember that I don t like changing waiters each meal It gives them no chance to learn what I want or how I want it Then she and Kate slowly walked the length of the veranda several times while she pointed out parts of the grounds they could see that remained as she had known them formerly and what were improvements When missus Jardine was tired they returned to the room and she lay on the bed while they talked of many things talked of things with which Kate was familiar and some concerning which she unhesitatingly asked questions until she felt informed missus Jardine was so dainty so delicate yet so full of life so well informed so keen mentally that as she talked she kept Kate chuckling most of the time She talked of her home life her travels her friends her son She talked of politics religion and education then she talked of her son again She talked of social conditions Civic Improvement and Woman s Rights then she came back to her son until Kate saw that he was the real interest in the world to her The mental picture she drew of him was peculiar One minute missus Jardine spoke of him as a man among men pushing fighting forcing matters to work to his will so Kate imagined him tall broad and brawny indefatigable in his undertakings the next his mother was telling of such thoughtfulness such kindness such loving care that Kate s mental picture shifted to a neat exacting little man purely effeminate as men ever can be but whatever she thought some right instinct prevented her from making a comment or asking a question Once she sat looking far across the beautiful lake with such an expression on her face that missus Jardine said to her What are you thinking of my dear Kate said smilingly Oh I was thinking of what a wonderful school I shall teach this winter Tell me what you mean said missus Jardine Why with even a month of this I shall have riches stored for every day of the year said Kate None of my pupils ever saw a lake 
4289_21393_000056_000006	train-clean-360	that I know 
none	none	of I shall tell them of this with its shining water its rocky shady sandy shore lines of the rowboats and steam boats and the people from all over the country Before I go back I can tell them of wonderful lectures concerts educational demonstrations here I shall get much from the experiences of other teachers I shall delight my pupils with just you In what way asked missus Jardine Oh I shall tell them of a dainty little woman who know everything From you I shall teach my girls to be simple wholesome tender and kind to take the gifts of God thankfully reverently yet with self respect From you I can tell them what really fine fabrics are and about laces and linens When the subjects arise as they always do in teaching I shall describe each ring you wear each comb and pin even the handkerchiefs you carry and the bags you travel with To teach means to educate and it is a big task but it is almost painfully interesting Each girl of my school shall go into life a gentler daintier woman more careful of her person and speech because of my having met you Isn t that a fine thought Why you darling cried missus Jardine Life is always having lovely things in store for me Yesterday I thought Susette s leaving me as she did was the most cruel thing that ever happened to me To day I get from it this lovely experience If you are straight from sunbonnets as you told me last night where did you get these advanced ideas If sunbonnets could speak many of them would tell of surprising heads they have covered laughed Kate Life deals with women much the same as with men If we go back to where we start history can prove to you that there are ten sunbonnets to one Leghorn hat in the high places of the world Not to entertain me but because I am interested my dear will you tell me about your particular sunbonnet asked missus Jardine Kate sat staring across the blue lake with wide eyes a queer smile twisting her lips At last she said slowly Well then my sunbonnet is in my trunk I m not so far away from it but that it still travels with me It s blue chambray made from pieces left from my first pretty dress It is ruffled and has white stitching I made it myself The head that it fits is another matter I didn t make that or its environment or what was taught it until it was of age and had worked out its legal time of service to pay for having been a head at all But my head is now free in my own possession ready to go as fast and far on the path of life as it develops the brains to carry it You d smile if I should tell you what I d ask of life if I could have what I want I scarcely think so Please tell me You ll be shocked warned Kate Just so it isn t enough to set my heart rocking again said missus Jardine We ll stop before that laughed Kate Then if you will have it I want of life by the time I am twenty a man of my stature dark eyes and hair because I am so light I want him to be honest forceful hard working with a few drops of the milk of human kindness in his heart and the same ambitions I have And what ARE your ambitions asked missus Jardine To own and to cultivate and to bring to the highest state of efficiency at least two hundred acres of land with convenient and attractive buildings and pedigreed stock and to mother at least twelve perfect physical and mental boys and girls Oh my soul cried missus Jardine falling back in her chair her mouth agape My dear you don t MEAN that You only said that to shock me But why should I wish to shock you I sincerely mean it persisted Kate You amazing creature I never heard a girl talk like that before said missus Jardine But you can t look straight ahead of you any direction you turn without seeing a girl working for dear life to attract the man she wants if she can t secure him some other man and in lieu of him any man at all in preference to none Life shows us woman on the age old quest every day everywhere we go why be so secretive about it Why not say honestly what we want and take it if we can get it At any rate that is the most important thing inside my sunbonnet I knew you d be shocked But I am not shocked at what you say I agree with you What I am shocked at is your ideals I thought you d want to educate yourself to such superiority over common woman that you could take the platform and backed by your splendid physique work for suffrage or lecture to educate the masses I think more could be accomplished with selected specimens by being steadily on the job than by giving an hour to masses I m not much interested in masses They are too abstract for me I prefer one stern reality And as for Woman s Rights if anybody gives this woman the right to do anything more than she already has the right to do there ll surely be a scandal missus Jardine lay back in her chair laughing You are the most refreshing person I have met in all my travels Then to put it baldly you want of life a man a farm and a family You comprehend me beautifully said Kate All my life I ve worked like a towhead to help earn two hundred acres of land for someone else I think there s nothing I want so much as two hundred acres of land for myself I d undertake to do almost anything with it if I had it I know I could if I had the shoulder to shoulder real man You notice it will take considerable of a man to touch shoulders with me I m a head taller than most of them missus Jardine looked at her speculatively Ummm she murmured Kate laughed For eighteen years I have been under marching orders said Kate Over a year ago I was advised by a minister to take the wings of morning so I took wing I started on one grand flight and fell ker smash in short order Life since has been a series of battering my wings until I have almost decided to buy some especially heavy boots and walk the remainder of the way As a concrete example I started out yesterday morning wearing a hat that several very reliable parties assured me would so assist me to flight that I might at least have a carriage Where oh where are my hat and my carriage now The carriage non est The hat I am humbly hoping some little country girl who has lived a life as barren as mine will find the remains and retrieve the velvet bow for a hair ribbon As for the man that Leghorn hat was supposed to symbolize he won t even look my way when I appear in my bobby little sailor He s as badly crushed out of existence as my beautiful hat You never should have been wearing such a hat to travel in my dear murmured missus Jardine Certainly not said Kate I knew it My sister told me that Common sense told me that But what has that got to do with the fact that I WAS wearing the hat I guess I have you there Far from it said missus Jardine If you re going to start out in life calmly ignoring the advice of those who love you and the dictates of common sense the result will be that soon the wheels of life will be grinding you instead of a train making bag rags of your hat Hummm said Kate There IS food for reflection there But wasn t it plain logic that if the hat was to bring the man it should be worn where at any minute he might see it But my dear my dear If such a man as a woman like you should have had seen you wearing that hat in the morning on a railway train he would merely have thought you prideful and extravagant You would have been far more attractive to any man I know in your blue sunbonnet I surely have learned that lesson said Kate Hereafter sailors or sunbonnets for me in the morning Now what may I do to add to your comfort Leave me for an hour until I take a nap and then we ll have lunch and go to a lecture I can go to day perfectly well after an hour s rest So Kate went for a very interesting walk around the grounds When she returned missus Jardine was still sleeping so she wrote Nancy Ellen telling all about her adventure but not a word about losing her hat Then she had a talk with Jennie Weeks whom she found lingering in the hall near her door When at last that nap was over a new woman seemed to have developed missus Jardine was so refreshed and interested the remainder of the day that it was easier than before for Kate to see how shocked and ill she had been As she helped dress her for lunch Kate said to missus Jardine I met the manager as I was going to post a letter to my sister so I asked him always to send you the same waiter He said he would and I d like you to pay particular attention to her appearance and the way she does her work Why asked missus Jardine I met her in the hall as I came back from posting my letter so we visited a little as the country folks say She has taught one winter of country school a small school in an out county She s here waiting table two hours three times a day to pay for her room and board In the meantime she attends all the sessions and studies as much as she can but she s very poor material for a teacher I pity her pupils She s a little thing bright enough in her way but she has not much initiative not strong enough for the work and she has not enough spunk She ll never lead the minds of school children anywhere that will greatly benefit them And your deduction is That she would make you a kind careful obedient maid who is capable enough to be taught to wash your hair and manicure you with deftness and who would serve you for respect as well as hire I think it would be a fine arrangement for you and good for her This surely is kind of you said missus Jardine I ll keep strict watch of Jennie Weeks If I could find a really capable maid here and not have to wire John to bring one I d be so glad It does so go against the grain to prove to a man that he has a right to be more conceited than he is naturally As they ate lunch Kate said to missus Jardine I noticed one thing this morning that is going to be balm to my soul I passed many teachers and summer resorters going to the lecture halls and coming from them and half of them were bareheaded so my state will not be remarkable until I can get another hat God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform laughingly quoted missus Jardine You thought losing that precious hat was a calamity but if you hadn t lost it you probably would have slept soundly while I died across the hall My life is worth the price of a whole millinery shop to me I think you value the friendship we are developing I foresee I shall get a maid who will not disgrace my in public you will have a full summer here now truly isn t all this worth many hats Of course It s like a fairy tale said Kate Still you didn t see the hat But you described it in a truly graphic manner said missus Jardine When I am the snowiest of great grandmothers I shall still be telling small people about the outcome of my first attempt at vanity laughed Kate The third morning dawned in great beauty a misty moisty morning missus Jardine called it The sun tried to shine but could not quite pierce the intervening clouds so on every side could be seen exquisite pictures painted in delicate pastel colours Kate fresh and rosy wearing a blue chambray dress was a picture well worth seeing missus Jardine kept watching her so closely that Kate asked at last Have you made up your mind yet No and I am afraid I never shall answered missus Jardine You are rather an astonishing creature You re so big so vital you absorb knowledge like a sponge takes water And for the same purpose laughed Kate That it may be used for the benefit of others Tell me some more about me I find me such an interesting subject No doubt admitted missus Jardine Not a doubt about that We are all more interested in ourselves than in any one else in this world until love comes then we soon learn to a love man more than life and when a child comes we learn another love so clear so high so purifying that we become of no moment at all and live only for those we love You speak for yourself and a class of women like you answered Kate gravely I m very well acquainted with many women who have married and borne children and who are possibly more selfish than before The Great Experience never touched them at all There was a tap at the door Kate opened it and delivered to missus Jardine a box so big that it almost blocked the doorway missus Jardine lifted from the box a big Leghorn hat of weave so white and fine it almost seemed like woven cloth instead of braid There was a bow in front but the bow was nested in and tied through a web of flowered gold lace One velvet end was slightly long and concealed a wire which lifted one side of the brim a trifle beneath which was fastened a smashing big pale pink velvet rose There was an ostrich plume even longer than the other broader blacker as wonderful a feather as ever dropped from the plumage of a lordly bird missus Jardine shook the hat in such a way as to set the feather lifting and waving after the confinement of the box With slender sure fingers she set the bow and lace as they should be and touched the petals of the rose She inspected the hat closely shook it again and held it toward Kate A very small price to pay for the breath of life which I was rapidly losing she said Do me the favour to accept it as casually as I offer it Did I understand your description anywhere near right Is this your hat Thank you said Kate It is just the speaking image of my hat but it s a glorified sublimated celestial image What I described was merely a hat This is what I think I have lately heard Nancy Ellen mention as a creation Wheuuuuuu She went to the mirror arranged her hair set the hat on her head and turned Gracious Heaven said missus Jardine My dear I understand NOW why you wore that hat on your journey I wore that hat said Kate as an ascension stalk wears its crown of white lilies as a bobolink wears its snowy courting crest as a bride wears her veil but please take this from me to night lest I sleep in it That night missus Jardine felt tired enough to propose resting in her room with Jennie Weeks where she could be called so for the first time Kate left her and donning her best white dress and the hat attended a concert At its close she walked back to the hotel with some of the other teachers stopping there talked a few minutes in the hall went to the office desk for mail and slowly ascended the stairs thinking intently What she thought was If I am not mistaken my hat did a small bit of execution to night She stepped to her room to lock the door and stopped a few minutes to arrange the clothing she had discarded when she dressed hurriedly before going to the concert then the letters in her hand she opened missus Jardine s door A few minutes before there had been a tap on that same door Come in said missus Jardine expecting Kate or Jennie Weeks She slowly lifted her eyes and faced a tall slender man standing there John Jardine what in the world are you doing here she demanded after the manner of mothers and what in this world has happened to you Does it show on me like that he stammered Was your train in a wreck Are you in trouble she asked Something shows plainly enough but I don t understand what it is Are you all right Mother He advanced a step looking intently at her Of course I m all right You can see that for yourself The question is what s the matter with you If you will have it there is something the matter Since I saw you last I have seen a woman I want to marry that s all unless I add that I want her so badly that I haven t much sense left Now you have it No I don t have it and I won t have it What designing creature has been trying to intrigue you now she demanded Not any one She didn t see me even I saw her I ve been following her for nearly two hours instead of coming straight to you as I always have So you see where I am I expect you won t forgive me but since I m here you must know that I could only come on the evening train He crossed the room knelt beside the chair and took it and its contents in his arms Are you going to scold me he asked I am she said I am going to take you out and push you into the deepest part of the lake I m so disappointed Why John for the first time in my life I ve selected a girl for you the very most suitable girl I ever saw and I hoped and hoped for three days that when you came you d like her Of course I wasn t so rash as to say a word to her But I ve thought myself into a state where I m going to be sick with disappointment But wait Mother wait until I can manage to meet the girl I ve seen Wait until I have a chance to show her to you he begged I suppose I shall be forced she said I ve always dreaded it now here it comes Oh why couldn t it have been Kate Why did she go to that silly concert If only I d kept her here and we d walked down to the station I d half a mind to Then the door opened and Kate stepped into the room She stood still looking at them John Jardine stood up looking at her His mother sat staring at them in turn Kate recovered first Please excuse me she said She laid the letters on a small table and turned to go John caught his mother s hand closer when he found himself holding it If you know the young lady Mother he said why don t you introduce us Oh I was so bewildered by your coming she said Kate dear let me present my son Kate crossed the room and looking straight into each other s eyes they shook hands and found chairs How was your concert my dear asked missus Jardine I don t think it was very good said Kate Not at all up to my expectations How did you like it mister Jardine Was that a concert he asked It was supposed to be said Kate Thank you for the information he said I didn t see it I didn t hear it I don t know where I was This is most astonishing said Kate missus Jardine looked at her son her eyes two big imperative question marks He nodded slightly My soul she cried then lay back in her chair half laughing half crying until Kate feared she might have another attack of heart trouble CHAPTER X JOHN JARDINE S COURTSHIP THE following morning they breakfasted together under the branches of the big maple tree in a beautiful world missus Jardine was so happy she could only taste a bite now and then when urged to Kate was trying to keep her head level and be natural John Jardine wanted to think of everything and succeeded fairly well It seemed to Kate that he could invent more ways to spend money and spend it with freer hand than any man she ever had heard of but she had to confess that the men she had heard about were concerned with keeping their money not scattering it Did you hear unusual sounds when John came to bid me good night asked missus Jardine of Kate Yes laughed Kate I did And I m sure I made a fairly accurate guess as to the cause What did you think asked missus Jardine I thought mister Jardine had missed Susette and you d had to tell him said Kate You re quite right It s a good thing she went on and lost herself in New York I m not at all sure that he doesn t contemplate starting out to find her yet Let Susette go said Kate We re interested in forgetting her There s a little country school teacher here who wants to take her place and it will be the very thing for your mother and for her too She s the one serving us notice her in particular If she s a teacher how does she come to be serving us he asked I m a teacher how do I come to be dining with you said Kate This is such a queer world when you go adventuring in it Jennie had a small school in an out county a widowed mother and a big family to help support so she figured that the only way she could come here to try to prepare herself for a better school was to work for her room and board She serves the table two hours three times a day and studies between times She tells me that almost every waiter in the dining hall is a teacher Please watch her movements and manner and see if you think her suitable Goodness knows she isn t intended for a teacher I like her very much said John Jardine I ll engage her as soon as we finish Kate smiled but when she saw the ease and dexterity with which he ended Jennie Weeks work as a waiter and installed her as his mother s maid making the least detail all right with his mother with Jennie with the manager she realized that there had been nothing for her to smile about Jennie was delighted and began her new undertaking earnestly with sincere desire to please Kate helped her all she could while missus Jardine developed a fund of patience commensurate with the need of it She would have endured more inconvenience than resulted from Jennie s inexperienced hands because of the realization that her son and the girl she had so quickly learned to admire were on the lake rambling the woods or hearing lectures together When she asked him how long he could remain he said as long as she did When she explained that she was enjoying herself thoroughly and had no idea how long she would want to stay he said that was all right he had only had one vacation in his life it was time he was having another When she marvelled at this he said Now look here Mother let s get this business straight right at the start I told you when I came I d seen the woman I wanted If you want me to go back to business the way to do it is to help me win her But I don t want you to go back to business I want you to have a long vacation and learn all you can from the educational advantages here It s too late for me to learn more than I get every day by knocking around and meeting people I ve tried books two or three times and I ve given them up I can t do it I ve waited too long I ve no way to get down to it I can t remember to save my soul But you can remember anything on earth about a business deal she urged Of course I can I was born with a business head It was remember or starve and see you starve If I d had the books at the time they would have helped now it s too late and I ll never try it again that s settled Much as I want to marry Miss Bates she ll have to take me or leave me as I am I can t make myself over for her or for you I would if I could but that s one of the things I can t do and I admit it If I m not good enough for her as I am she ll have the chance to tell me so the very first minute I think it s proper to ask her John you are good enough for the best woman on earth There never was a better lad it isn t that and you know it I am so anxious that I can scarcely wait but you must wait You must give her time and go slowly and you must be careful oh so very careful She s a teacher and a student she came here to study I ll fix that I can rush things so that there ll be no time to study You ll make a mistake if you try it You d far better let her go her own way and only appear when she has time for you she advised That s a fine idea he cried A lot of ice I d cut sitting back waiting for a signal to run after a girl like a poodle The way to do is the same as with any business deal See what you want overcome anything in your way and get it I d go crazy hanging around like that You ve always told me I couldn t do the things in business I said I would and I ve always proved to you that I could by doing them Now watch me do this You know I ll do anything to help you John You know how proud I am of you how I love you I realize now that I ve talked volumes to Kate about you I ve told her everything from the time you were a little boy and I slaved for you until now when you slave for me Including how many terms I d gone to school Yes I even told her that she said Well what did she seem to think about it he asked I don t know what she thought she didn t say anything There was nothing to say It was a bare handed fight with the wolf in those days I m sure I made her understand that she said Well I ll undertake to make her understand this he said Are you sure that Jennie Weeks is taking good care of you Jennie is well enough and is growing better each day now be off to your courting but if you love me remember and be careful she said Remember one particular thing you mean he asked She nodded her lips closed You bet I will he said All there is of me goes into this Isn t she a wonder Mother missus Jardine looked closely at the big man who was all the world to her so like her in mentality so like his father with his dark hair and eyes and big well rounded frame looked at him with the eyes of love then as he left her to seek the girl she had learned to love she shut her eyes and frankly and earnestly asked the Lord to help her son to marry Kate Bates One morning as Kate helped missus Jardine into her coat and gloves preparing for one of their delightful morning drives she said to her missus Jardine may I ask you a REAL question Of course you may said missus Jardine and I shall give you a real answer if it lies in my power You ll be shocked warned Kate Shock away laughed missus Jardine By now I flatter myself that I am so accustomed to you that you will have to try yourself to shock me It s only this said Kate If you were a perfect stranger standing back and looking on not acquainted with any of the parties merely seeing things as they happen each day would it be your honest opinion would you say that I am being COURTED missus Jardine laughed until she was weak When she could talk she said Yes my dear under the conditions and in the circumstances you mention I would cheerfully go on oath and testify that you are being courted more openly more vigorously and as tenderly as I ever have seen woman courted in all my life I always thought that John s father was a master hand at courting but John has him beaten in many ways Yes my dear you certainly are being courted assiduously Now then on that basis said Kate just one more question and we ll proceed with our drive From the same standpoint would you say from your observation and experience that the mother of the man had any insurmountable objection to the proceedings missus Jardine laughed again Finally she said No my dear It s my firm conviction that the mother of the man in the case would be so delighted if you should love and marry her son that she would probably have a final attack of heart trouble and pass away from sheer joy Thank you said Kate I wasn t perfectly sure having had no experience whatever and I didn t want to make a mistake That drive was wonderful over beautiful country roads through dells and across streams and hills They stopped where they pleased gathering flowers and early apples visiting with people they met lunching wherever they happened to be If it weren t for wishing to hear John A Logan to night said Kate I d move that we drive on all day I certainly am having the grandest time She sat with her sailor hat filled with Early Harvest apples a big bunch of Canadian anemones in her belt a little stream at her feet July drowsy fullness all around her congenial companions taking the wings of morning paid after all Why do you want to hear him so much asked John Kate looked up at him in wonder Don t you want to see and hear him she asked He hesitated a thoughtful expression on his face Finally he said I can t say that I do Will you tell me why I should You should because he was one of the men who did much to preserve our Union he may tell us interesting things about the war Where were you when it was the proper time for you to be studying the speech of Logan s ancestor in McGuffey s Fourth That must have been the year I figured out the improved coupling pin in the C N W shops wouldn t you think Mother Somewhere near my dear she said So they drove back as happily as they had set out made themselves fresh and while awaiting the lecture hour Kate again wrote to Robert and Nancy Ellen telling plainly and simply all that had occurred She even wrote John Jardine s mother is of the opinion that he is courting me I am so lacking in experience myself that I scarcely dare venture an opinion but it has at times appealed to me that if he isn t really he certainly must be going through the motions Nancy Ellen wrote I have read over what you say about John Jardine several times Then I had Robert write Bradstreet s and look him up He is rated so high that if he hasn t a million right now he soon will have You be careful and do your level best Are your clothes good enough Shall I send more of my things You know I ll do anything to help you Oh yes that George Holt from your boarding place was here the other day hunting you He seemed determined to know where you were and when you would be back and asked for your address I didn t think you had any time for him and I couldn t endure him or his foolish talk about a new medical theory so I said you d no time for writing and were going about so much I had no idea if you d get a letter if he sent one and I didn t give him what he wanted He ll probably try general delivery but you can drop it in the lake I want you to be sure to change your boarding place this winter if you teach but I haven t an idea you will Hadn t you better bring matters to a close if you can and let the Director know Love from us both NANCY ELLEN Kate sat very still holding this letter in her hand when John Jardine came up and sat beside her She looked at him closely He was quite as good looking as his mother thought him in a brawny masculine way but Kate was not seeking the last word in mental or physical refinement She was rather brawny herself and perfectly aware of the fact She wanted intensely to learn all she could she disliked the idea that any woman should have more stored in her head than she but she had no time to study minute social graces and customs She wanted to be kind to be polite but she told missus Jardine flatly the she didn t give a flip about being overly nice which was the exact truth That required subtleties beyond Kate s depth for she was at times alarmingly casual So she held her letter and thought about John Jardine As she thought she decided that she did not know whether she was in love with him or not she thought she was She liked being with him she liked all he did for her she would miss him if he went away she would be proud to be his wife but she did wish that he were interested in land instead of inventions and stocks and bonds Stocks and bonds were almost as evanescent as rainbows to Kate Land was something she could understand and handle Maybe she could interest him in land if she could that would be ideal What a place his wealth would buy and fit up She wondered as she studied John Jardine what was in his head if he truly intended to ask her to be his wife and since reading Nancy Ellen s letter when She should let the Trustee know if she were not going to teach the school again but someway she rather wanted to teach the school When she started anything she did not know how to stop until she finished She had so much she wanted to teach her pupils the coming winter Suddenly John asked Kate if you could have anything you wanted what would you have Two hundred acres of land she said How easy laughed John rising to find a seat for his mother who was approaching them What do you think of that Mother A girl who wants two hundred acres of land more than anything else in the world What is better asked missus Jardine I never heard you say anything about land before Certainly not said his mother and I m not saying anything about it now for myself but I can see why it means so much to Kate why it s her natural element Well I can t he said I meet many men in business who started on land and most of them were mighty glad to get away from it What s the attraction Kate waved her hand toward the distance Oh merely sky and land and water and trees and birds and flowers and fruit and crops and a few other things scarcely worth mentioning she said lightly I m not in the mood to talk bushels seed and fertilization just now but I understand them they are in my blood I think possibly the reason I want two hundred acres of land for myself is because I ve been hard on the job of getting them for other people ever since I began to work at about the age of four But if you want land personally why didn t you work to get it for yourself asked John Jardine Because I happened to be the omega of my father s system answered Kate missus Jardine looked at her interestedly She had never mentioned her home or parents before The older woman did not intend to ask a word but if Kate was going to talk she did not want to miss one Kate evidently was going to talk for she continued You see my father is land mad and son crazy He thinks a BOY of all the importance in the world a GIRL of none whatever He has the biggest family of any one we know From birth each girl is worked like a man or a slave from four in the morning until nine at night Each boy is worked exactly the same way the difference lies in the fact that the girls get plain food and plainer clothes out of it the boys each get two hundred acres of land buildings and stock that the girls have been worked to the limit to help pay for they get nothing personally worth mentioning I think I have two hundred acres of land on the brain and I think this is the explanation of it It s a pre natal influence at our house while we nurse eat sleep and above all WORK it afterward She paused and looked toward John Jardine calmly I think she said that there s not a task ever performed on a farm that I haven t had my share in I have plowed hoed seeded driven reapers and bound wheat pitched hay and hauled manure chopped wood and sheared sheep and boiled sap if you can mention anything else go ahead I bet a dollar I ve done it Well what do you think of that he muttered looking at her wonderingly If you ask me and want the answer in plain words I think it s a shame said Kate If it were ONE HUNDRED acres of land and the girls had as much and were as willing to work it as the boys are well and good But to drive us like cattle and turn all we earn into land for the boys is another matter I rebelled last summer borrowed the money and went to Normal and taught last winter I m going to teach again this winter but last summer and this are the first of my life that I haven t been in the harvest fields at this time Women in the harvest fields of Land King Bates are common as men and wagons and horses but not nearly so much considered The women always walk on Sunday to save the horses and often on week days Mother has it hammered into me that it isn t polite to ask questions said John but I d like to ask one Go ahead said Kate Ask fifty What do I care How many boys are there in your family There are seven said Kate and if you want to use them as a basis for a land estimate add two hundred and fifty for the home place Sixteen hundred and fifty is what Father pays tax on besides the numerous mortgages and investments He s the richest man in the county we live in at least he pays the most taxes Mother and son looked at each other in silence They had been thinking her so poor that she would be bewildered by what they had to offer But if two hundred acres of land were her desire there was a possibility that she was a women who was not asking either ease or luxury of life and would refuse it if it were proffered I hope you will take me home with you and let me see all that land and how it is handled said John Jardine I don t own an acre I never even have thought of it but there is no reason why I or any member of my family shouldn t have all the land they want Mother do you feel a wild desire for two hundred acres of land Same kind of a desire that took you to come here No I don t said missus Jardine All I know about land is that I know it when I see it and I know if I think it s pretty but I can see why Kate feels that she would like that amount for herself after having helped earn all those farms for her brothers If it s land she wants I hope she speedily gets all she desires in whatever location she wants it and then I hope she lets me come to visit her and watch her do as she likes with it Surely said Kate you are invited right now as soon as I ever get the land I ll give you another invitation And of course you may go home with me mister Jardine and I ll show you each of what Father calls those little parcels of land of mine But the one he lives on we shall have to gaze at from afar because I m a Prodigal Daughter When I would leave home in spite of him for the gay and riotous life of a school marm he ordered me to take all my possessions with me which I did in one small telescope I was not to enter his house again while he lived I was glad to go he was glad to have me while I don t think either of us has changed our mind since Teaching school isn t exactly gay but I ll fill my tummy with quite a lot of symbolical husks before he ll kill the fatted calf for me They ll be glad to see you at my brother Adam s and my sister Nancy Ellen would greatly enjoy meeting you Surely you may go home with me if you d like I can think of only one thing I d like better he said We ve been such good friends here and had such a good time it would be the thing I d like best to take you home with us and show you where and how we live Mother did you ever invite Kate to visit us I have often and she has said that she would replied missus Jardine I think it would be nice for her to go from here with us and then you can take her home whenever she fails to find us interesting How would that suit you for a plan my dear I think that would be a perfect ending to a perfect summer said Kate I can t see an objection in any way Thank you very much Then we ll call that settled said John Jardine CHAPTER XI A BUSINESS PROPOSITION MID AUGUST saw them on their way to Chicago Kate had taken care of missus Jardine a few days while Jennie Weeks went home to see her mother and arrange for her new work She had no intention of going back to school teaching She preferred to brush missus Jardine s hair button her shoes write her letters and read to her In a month Jennie had grown so deft at her work and made herself so appreciated that she was practically indispensable to the elderly woman and therefore the greatest comfort to John Immediately he saw that his mother was properly cared for sympathetically and even lovingly he made it his business to smooth Jennie s path in every way possible In turn she studied him and in many ways made herself useful to him Often she looked at him with large and speculative eyes as he sat reading letters or papers or smoking The world was all right with Kate when they crossed the sand dunes as they neared the city She was sorry about the situation in her home but she smiled sardonically as she thought how soon her father would forget his anger when he heard about the city home and the kind of farm she could have merely by consenting to take it She was that sure of John Jardine yet he had not asked her to marry him He had seemed on the verge of it a dozen times and then had paused as if better judgment told him it would be wise to wait a little longer Now Kate had concluded that there was a definite thing he might be waiting for since that talk about land She thought possibly she understood what it was He was a business man he knew nothing else he said so frankly He wanted to show her his home his business his city his friends and then he required he had almost put it into words that he be shown her home and her people Kate not only acquiesced she approved She wanted to know as much of a man she married as Nancy Ellen had known and Robert had taken her to his home and told his people she was his betrothed wife before he married her Kate s eyes were wide open and her brain busy as they entered a finely appointed carriage and she heard John say Rather sultry Home down the lake shore George She wished their driver had not been named George but after all it made no difference There could not be a commoner name than John and she knew of but one that she liked better For the ensuing three days she lived in a Lake Shore home of wealth She watched closely not to trip in the heavy rugs and carpets She looked at wonderful paintings and long shelves of books She never had touched such china or tasted such food or seen so good service She understood why John had opposed his mother s undertaking the trip without him for everyone in the house seemed busy serving the little woman Jennie Weeks was frankly enchanted My sakes she said to Kate If I m not grateful to you for getting me into a place like this I wouldn t give it up for all the school teaching in the world I m going to snuggle right in here and make myself so useful I won t have to leave until I die I hope you won t turn me out when to come to take charge Don t you think you re presuming said Kate Jennie drew back with a swift apology but there was a flash in the little eyes and a spiteful look on the small face as she withdrew Then Kate was shown each of John s wonderful inventions To her they seemed almost miracles because they were so obvious so simple yet brought such astounding returns She saw offices and heard the explanation of big business but did not comprehend farther than that when an invention was completed the piling up of money began Before the week s visit was over Kate was trying to fit herself and her aims and objects of life into the surroundings with no success whatever She felt housed in cribbed confined frustrated When she realized that she was becoming plainly cross she began keen self analysis and soon admitted to herself that she did not belong there Kate watched with keen eyes Repeatedly she tried to imagine herself in such surroundings for life a life sentence she expressed it for soon she understood that it would be to her a prison The only way she could imagine herself enduring it at all was to think of the promised farm and when she began to think of that on Jardine terms she saw that it would mean to sit down and tell someone else what she wanted done There would be no battle to fight Her mind kept harking back to the day when she had said to John that she hoped there would be a lake on the land she owned and he had answered casually If there isn t a lake make one Kate thought that over repeatedly Make one Make a lake It would have seemed no more magical to her if he had said Make a cloud Make a star or Make a rainbow What on earth would I do with myself with my time with my life pondered Kate She said Good bye to missus Jardine and Jennie Weeks and started home with John still pondering When the train pulled into Hartley Nancy Ellen and Robert were on the platform to meet them From that time Kate was on solid ground She was reckoning in terms she could comprehend All her former assurance and energy came back to her She almost wished the visit were over and that she were on the way to Walton to clean the school house She was eager to roll her sleeves and beat a tub of soapy clothes to foam and boil them snowy white She had a desire she could scarcely control to sweep and dust and cook She had been out of the environment she thought she disliked and found when she returned to it after a wider change than she could have imagined that she did not dislike it at all It was her element her work what she knew She could attempt it with sure foot capable hand and certain knowledge Sunday morning she said to Nancy Ellen as they washed the breakfast dishes while the men smoked on the veranda Nancy Ellen I don t believe I was ever cut out for a rich woman If I have got a chance I wish YOU had it and I had THIS This just suits my style to a T Tell me about it said Nancy Ellen Kate told all she could remember You don t mean to say you didn t LIKE it cried Nancy Ellen I didn t say anything said Kate but if I were saying exactly what I feel you d know I despise it all Why Kate Barnes cried the horrified Nancy Ellen Whatever do you mean I haven t thought enough to put it to you clearly said Kate but someway the city repels me Facilities for manufacturing something start a city It begins with the men who do the work and the men who profit from that work living in the same coop It expands and goes on and grows on that basis It s the laborer living on his hire and the manufacturer living on the laborer s productions coming in daily contact The contrast is too great the space is too small Somebody is going to get the life crowded out of him at every turn and it isn t always the work hand in the factory The money kings eat each other for breakfast every day As for work we always thought we worked You should take a peep into the shops and factories I ve seen this week Work Why we don t know what work is and we waste enough food every day to keep a workman s family and we re dressed liked queens in comparison with them right now Do you mean to say if he asks you It was a small explosion I mean to say if he asks me buy me that two hundred acres of land where I want it build me the house and barns I want and guarantee that I may live there as I please and I ll marry you to morrow If it s Chicago Never I haven t stolen murdered or betrayed who should I be imprisoned Why you hopeless anarchist said Nancy Ellen I am going to tell John Jardine on you Do urged Kate Sound him on the land question It s our only hope of a common foundation Have you send Agatha word that we will be out this afternoon I have said Nancy Ellen And I don t doubt that now even now she is in the kitchen how would she put it Compounding a cake said Kate while Adam is in the cellar freezing a custard Adam threed will be raking the yard afresh and Susan will be sweeping the walks steadily from now until they sight us coming down the road What you bet Agatha asked John his intentions I almost wish she would she added He has some but there is a string to them in some way and I can t just make out where or why it is Not even a guess asked Nancy Ellen Not even a guess with any sense to it I ve thought it was coming repeatedly but I ve got a stubborn Bates streak and I won t lift a finger to help him He ll speak up loud and plain or there will be no connubial bliss for us as Agatha says I think he has ideas about other things than freight train gear According to his programme we must have so much time to become acquainted I must see his home and people he must see mine If there s more after that I m not informed Like as not there is It may come after we get back to night I can t say Have you told him asked Nancy Ellen Not the details but the essentials He knows that I can t go home It came up one day in talking about land I guess they had thought before that my people were poor as church mice I happened to mention how much land I had helped earn for my brothers and they seemed so interested I finished the job Well after they had heard about the Land King it made a noticeable difference in their treatment of me Not that they weren t always fine but it made I scarcely know how to put it it was so intangible but it was a difference an added respect You bet money is a power I can see why Father hangs on to those deeds when I get out in the world They are his compensation for his years of hard work the material evidence that he has succeeded in what he undertook He d show them to John Jardine with the same feeling John showed me improved car couplers brakes and air cushions They stand for successes that win the deference of men Out in the little bit of world I ve seen I notice that men fight bleed and die for even a tiny fraction of deference Aren t they funny What would I care Well I D care a lot said Nancy Ellen Kate surveyed her slowly Yes I guess you would They finished the dishes and went to church because Robert was accustomed to going They made a remarkable group Then they went to the hotel for dinner so that the girls would not have to prepare it and then in a double carriage Robert had secured for the occasion they drove to Bates Corners and as Kate said Viewed the landscape o er Those eight pieces of land none under two hundred acres some slightly over all in the very highest state of cultivation with modern houses barns outbuildings and fine stock grazing in the pastures made an impressive picture It was probably the first time that any of the Bates girls had seen it all at once and looked on it merely as a spectacle They stopped at Adam s last and while Robert was busy with the team and John had alighted to help him Nancy Ellen revealing tight lips and unnaturally red cheeks leaned back to Kate This is about as mean a trick and as big a shame as I ve ever seen she said hotly You know I was brought up with this and I never looked at it with the eyes of a stranger before If ever I get my fingers on those deeds I ll make short work of them And a good job too assented Kate instantly Look out There comes Adam I d just as soon tell him so as not whispered Nancy Ellen Which would result in the deeds being recorded to morrow and spoiling our trip to day and what good would it do you said Kate None of course Nothing ever does a Bates girl any good unless she gets out and does it for herself retorted Nancy Ellen spitefully There there said Robert as he came to help Nancy Ellen protect her skirts in alighting I was afraid this trip would breed discontent What s the trouble asked John as he performed the same service for Kate Oh the girls are grouching a little because they helped earn all this and are to be left out of it explained Robert in a low voice Let s get each one of them a farm that will lay any of these completely in the shade suggested John All right for you if you can do it said Robert laughing but I ve gone my limit for the present Besides if you gave each of them two hundred acres of the Kingdom of Heaven it wouldn t stop them from feeling that they had been defrauded of their birthright here How would you feel if you was served the same way asked John and even as she shook hands with Adam and introduced John Jardine Kate found herself wishing that he had said were As the girls had predicted the place was immaculate the yard shady and cool from the shelter of many big trees the house comfortable convenient the best of everything in sight Agatha and Susan were in new white dresses while Adam junior and threed wore tan and white striped seersucker coats and white duck trousers It was not difficult to feel a glow of pride in the place and people Adam made them cordially welcome You undoubtedly are blessed with good fortune said Agatha Won t you please enlighten us concerning your travels Katherine So Kate told them everything she could think of that she thought would interest and amuse them even outlining for Agatha speeches she had heard made by doctor Vincent Chaplain McCabe Jehu DeWitt Miller a number of famous politicians teachers and ministers Then all of them talked about everything Adam took John and Robert to look over the farm whereupon Kate handed over her hat for Agatha to finger and try on And how long will it be my dear said Agatha to Kate before you enter connubial bliss My goodness I m glad you asked me that while the men are at the barn said Kate mister Jardine hasn t said a word about it himself so please be careful what you say before him Agatha looked at Kate in wonder You amaze me she said Why he regards you as if he would devour you He hasn t proposed for your hand you say Surely you re not giving him proper encouragement She isn t giving him any further than allowing him to be around said Nancy Ellen Do enlighten me cried the surprised Agatha How astonishing Why Kate my dear there is a just and proper amount of encouragement that MUST be given any self respecting youth before he makes his declarations You surely know that No I do not know it said Kate I thought it was a man s place to speak up loud and plain and say what he had to propose Oh dear wailed Agatha wringing her thin hands her face a mirror of distress Oh dear I very much fear you will lose him Why Katherine after a man has been to see you a certain number of times and evidenced enough interest in you my dear there are a thousand strictly womanly ways in which you can lend his enterprise a little only a faint amount of encouragement just enough to allow him to recognize that he is not not er repulsive to you But how many times must he come and how much interest must he evince asked Kate I can scarcely name an exact number said Agatha That is personal You must decide for yourself what is the psychological moment at which he is to be taken Have you even signified to him that you that you that you could be induced even to CONTEMPLATE marriage
4289_21393_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Kate 
none	none	heartily I told his mother that it was the height of my ambition to marry by the time I m twenty I told her I wanted a man as tall as I am two hundred acres of land and at least twelve babies Agatha collapsed suddenly She turned her shocked face toward Nancy Ellen Great Day of Rest she cried No wonder the man doesn t propose When the men returned from their stroll Agatha and Susan served them with delicious frozen custard and Angel s food cake Then they resumed their drive passing Hiram s place last At the corner Robert hesitated and turned to ask Shall we go ahead Kate Certainly said Kate I want mister Jardine to see where I was born and spent my time of legal servitude I suppose we daren t stop I doubt if Mother would want to see me and I haven t the slightest doubt that Father would NOT but he has no jurisdiction over the road It s the shortest way and besides I want to see the lilac bush and the cabbage roses As they approached the place Nancy Ellen turned Father s standing at the gate What shall we do There s nothing you can do but drive straight ahead and you and Robert speak to him said Kate Go fast Robert He touched the team and at fair speed they whirled past the white house at the gate of which stiffly erect stood a brawny man of six feet six his face ruddy and healthy in appearance He was dressed as he prepared himself to take a trip to pay his taxes or to go to Court He stood squarely erect with stern forbidding face looking directly at them Robert spoke to him and Nancy Ellen leaned forward and waved calling Father that she might be sure he knew her but he gave not the slightest sign of recognition They carried away a distinct picture of him at his best physically and in appearance at his worst mentally There you have it said Kate bitterly I d be safe in wagering a thousand dollars if I had it that Agatha or the children told at Hiram s or to Mother s girl that we were coming They knew we would pass about this time Mother was at the side door watching and Father was in his Sunday best waiting to show us what would happen if we stopped and that he never changes his mind It didn t happen by accident that he was standing there dressed that way What do you think Nancy Ellen That he was watching for us said Nancy Ellen But why do you suppose that he did it asked Kate He thought that if he were NOT standing guard there we might stop in the road and at least call Mother out He wanted to be seen and seen at his best but as always in command showing his authority Don t mind said John Jardine It s easy to understand the situation Thank you said Kate I hope you ll tell your mother that I can t bear her to think that the trouble is wholly my fault No danger of that he said Mother thinks there s nobody in all the world like you and so do I Nancy Ellen kicked Robert s shin to let him know that she heard Kate was very depressed for a time but she soon recovered and they spent a final happy evening together When John had parted from Robert and Nancy Ellen with the arrangement that he was to come again the following Saturday evening and spend Sunday with them he asked Kate to walk a short distance with him He seemed to be debating some proposition in his mind that he did not know how to approach Finally he stopped abruptly and said Kate Mother told me that she told you how I grew up We have been together most of every day for six weeks I have no idea how a man used to women goes at what I want so I can only do what I think is right and best and above all honest and fair I d be the happiest I ve ever been to do anything on earth I ve got the money to do for you There s a question I m going to ask you the next time I come You can think over all you know of me and of Mother and of what we have and are and be ready to tell me how you feel about everything next Sunday There s one question I want to ask you before I go In case we can plan for a life together next Sunday what about my mother Whatever pleases her best of course said Kate Any arrangement that you feel will make her happy will be all right with me in the event we agree on other things He laughed shortly This sounds cold blooded and business like he said But Mother s been all the world to me until I met you I must be sure about her and one other thing I ll write you about that this week If that is all right with you you can get ready for a deluge I ve held in as long as I can Kate will you kiss me good bye That s against the rules said Kate That s getting the cart before the horse I know it he said But haven t I been an example for six weeks Only one Please They were back at doctor Gray s gate standing in the deep shelter of a big maple Kate said I ll make a bargain with you I ll kiss you to night and if we come to an agreement next Sunday night you shall kiss me Is that all right The reply was so indistinct Kate was not sure of it but she took his face between her hands and gave him exactly the same kind of kiss she would have given Adam threed She hesitated an instant then gave him a second You may take that to your mother she said and fled up the walk CHAPTER XII TWO LETTERS NANCY ELLEN and Robert were sitting on the side porch not seeming in the least sleepy when Kate entered the house As she stepped out to them she found them laughing mysteriously 
5005-21379-0001	train-other-500	Take this chair Kate said Nancy Ellen Come on Robert let s go stand under the maple tree and let her see whether she can see us If you re going to rehearse any momentous moment of your existence said Kate
5005-21379-0002	train-other-500	I shouldn t think of even being on the porch I shall keep discreetly in the house even going at once to bed Good night Pleasant dreams Now we ve made her angry said Robert
5005-21379-0003	train-other-500	I think there WAS a little touch of asperity as Agatha would say in that said Nancy Ellen but Kate has a good heart She ll get over it before morning
5005-21379-0004	train-other-500	Would Agatha use such a common word as little asked Robert Indeed no said Nancy Ellen She would say infinitesimal But all the same he kissed her
5005-21379-0005	train-other-500	If she didn t step up and kiss him never again shall I trust my eyes said the doctor Hush cautioned Nancy Ellen She s provoked now if she hears that she ll never forgive us
5005-21379-0006	train-other-500	Kate did not need even a hint to start her talking in the morning The day was fine a snappy tinge of autumn in the air her head and heart were full
5005-21379-0007	train-other-500	Nancy Ellen would understand and sympathize of course Kate told her all there was to tell And even at that said Nancy Ellen he hasn t just come out right square and said Kate
5005-21379-0008	train-other-500	will you marry me as I understand it Same here laughed Kate He said he had to be sure about his mother and there was one other thing he d write me about this week and he d come again next Sunday
5005-21379-0009	train-other-500	then if things were all right with me the deluge And what is the other thing asked Nancy Ellen There he has me guessing
5005-21379-0010	train-other-500	We had six long lovely weeks of daily association at the lake I ve seen his home and his inventions and as much of his business as is visible to the eye of a woman who doesn t know a tinker about business
5005-21379-0011	train-other-500	His mother has told me minutely of his life every day since he was born I think She insists that he never paid the slightest attention to a girl before and he says the same so
none	none	 there can t be any hidden ugly feature to mar my joy 
5005-21379-0012	train-other-500	He is thoughtful quick kind a self made business man He looks well enough he acts like a gentleman
none	none	 he seldom makes a mistake in speech 
5005-21379-0013	train-other-500	He doesn t say enough to MAKE any mistakes I haven t yet heard him talk freely give an opinion or discuss a question said Nancy Ellen Neither have I
5005-21379-0014	train-other-500	said Kate He s very silent thinking out more inventions maybe The worst thing about him is a kind of hard headed self assurance
5005-21379-0015	train-other-500	He got it fighting for his mother from boyhood He knew she would freeze and starve if he didn t take care of her he HAD to do it He soon found he could It took money to do what he had to do
5005-21379-0016	train-other-500	He got the money Then he began performing miracles with it He lifted his mother out of poverty he dressed her in purple and fine linen
5005-21379-0017	train-other-500	he housed her in the same kind of home other rich men of the Lake Shore Drive live in and gave her the same kind of service As most men do when things begin to come their way
5005-21379-0018	train-other-500	he lived for making money alone He was so keen on the chase he wouldn t stop to educate and culture himself
none	none	 he drove headlong on and on 
5005-21379-0019	train-other-500	piling up more far more than any one man should be allowed to have so you can see that it isn t strange that he thinks there s nothing on earth that money can t do
5005-21379-0020	train-other-500	You can see THAT sticking out all over him At the hotel on boats on the trains anywhere we went he pushed straight for the most conspicuous place
5005-21379-0021	train-other-500	the most desirable thing the most expensive I almost prayed sometimes that in some way he would strike ONE SINGLE THING that he couldn t make come his way with money but
5005-21379-0022	train-other-500	he never did No I haven t an idea what he has in his mind yet but he s going to write me about it this week and if I agree to whatever it is he is coming Sunday
5005-21379-0023	train-other-500	then he has threatened me with a deluge whatever he means by that He means providing another teacher for Walden taking you to Chicago shopping for a wonderful trousseau
5005-21379-0024	train-other-500	marrying you in his Lake Shore palace no doubt Well if that s what he means by a deluge said Kate he ll find the flood coming his way
5005-21379-0025	train-other-500	He ll strike the first thing he can t do with money I shall teach my school this winter as I agreed to I shall marry him in the clothes I buy with what I earn I shall marry him quietly here
5005-21379-0026	train-other-500	or at Adam s or before a Justice of the Peace if neither of you wants me He can t pick me up and carry me away and dress me and marry me as if I were a pauper
5005-21379-0027	train-other-500	You re RIGHT about it said Nancy Ellen I don t know how we came to be so different I should do at once any way he suggested to get such a fine looking man and that much money
none	none	 That it would be a humiliation to me all my after life 
5005-21379-0028	train-other-500	I wouldn t think about until the humiliation began and then I d have no way to protect myself You re right But I d get out of teaching this winter if I could I d love to have you here
5005-21379-0029	train-other-500	But I must teach to the earn money for my outfit I ll have to go back to school in the same old sailor Don t you care laughed Nancy Ellen We know a secret That we do
5005-21379-0030	train-other-500	agreed Kate Wednesday Kate noticed Nancy Ellen watching for the boy Robert had promised to send with the mail as soon as it was distributed
5005-21379-0031	train-other-500	because she was herself Twice Thursday Kate hoped in vain that the suspense would be over It had to end Friday if John were coming Saturday night
5005-21379-0032	train-other-500	She began to resent the length of time he was waiting It was like him to wait until the last minute and then depend on money to carry him through He is giving me a long time to think things over
5005-21379-0033	train-other-500	Kate said to Nancy Ellen when there was no letter in the afternoon mail Thursday It may have been lost or delayed said Nancy Ellen It will come to morrow surely Both of them
5005-21379-0034	train-other-500	saw the boy turn in at the gate Friday morning Each saw that he carried more than one letter Nancy Ellen was on her feet and nearer to the door she stepped to it and took the letters
5005-21379-0035	train-other-500	giving them a hasty glance as she handed them to Kate Two she said tersely One with the address written in the clear bold hand of a gentleman
none	none	 and one the straggle of a country clod hopper 
5005-21379-0036	train-other-500	Kate smiled as she took the letters I ll wager my hat which is my most precious possession she said that the one with the beautifully written address comes from the clod hopper and the straggle
5005-21379-0037	train-other-500	from the gentleman She glanced at the stamping and addresses and smiled again So it proves she said While I m about it I ll see what the clod hopper has to say
5005-21379-0038	train-other-500	and then I shall be free to give my whole attention to the gentleman Oh Kate how can you cried Nancy Ellen Way I m made I spect said Kate Anyway
none	none	 that s the way this is going to be done 
5005-21379-0039	train-other-500	She dropped the big square letter in her lap and ran her finger under the flap of the long thin beautifully addressed envelope and drew forth several quite as perfectly written sheets
5005-21379-0040	train-other-500	She read them slowly and deliberately sometimes turning back a page and going over a part of it again
5005-21379-0041	train-other-500	When she finished she glanced at Nancy Ellen while slowly folding the sheets Just for half a cent I d ask you to read this she said
none	none	 I certainly shan t pay anything for the privilege 
5005-21379-0042	train-other-500	but I ll read it if you want me to offered Nancy Ellen All right go ahead said Kate It might possibly teach you that you can t always judge a man by appearance or hastily
5005-21379-0043	train-other-500	though just why George Holt looks more like a clod hopper
none	none	 than Adam or Hiram 
5005-21379-0044	train-other-500	or Andrew it passes me to tell She handed Nancy Ellen the letter and slowly ripped open the flap of the heavy white envelope
5005-21379-0045	train-other-500	She drew forth the sheet and sat an instant with it in her fingers watching the expression of Nancy Ellen s face while she read the most restrained yet impassioned plea
5005-21379-0046	train-other-500	that a man of George Holt s nature and opportunities could devise to make to a woman after having spent several months in the construction of it It was a masterly letter perfectly composed spelled and written
none	none	 for among his other fields of endeavour 
5005-21379-0047	train-other-500	George Holt had taught several terms of country school and taught them with much success
none	none	 so that he might have become a fine instructor had it been in his blood to stick to anything long enough to make it succeed 
5005-21379-0048	train-other-500	After a page as she turned the second sheet Nancy Ellen glanced at Kate and saw that she had not opened the creased page in her hands She flamed with sudden irritation You do beat the band she cried
5005-21379-0049	train-other-500	You ve watched for two days and been provoked because that letter didn t come
none	none	 Now you ve got it there you sit like a mummy and let your mind be so filled with this idiotic drivel 
5005-21379-0050	train-other-500	that you re not ever reading John Jardine s letter that is to tell you what both of us are crazy to know If you were in any mood to be fair and honest
none	none	 you d admit that you never read a finer letter than THAT 
5005-21379-0051	train-other-500	said Kate As for THIS I never was so AFRAID in all my life Look at that She threw the envelope in Nancy Ellen s lap That is the very first line of John Jardine s writing
5005-21379-0052	train-other-500	I have ever seen she said Do you see anything about it to ENCOURAGE me to go farther You Goose cried the exasperated Nancy Ellen
5005-21379-0053	train-other-500	I suppose he transacts so much business he scarcely ever puts pen to paper
none	none	 What s the difference how he writes Look at what he is and what he does 
5005-21379-0054	train-other-500	Go on and read his letter Kate arose and walked to the window turning her back to Nancy Ellen who sat staring at her while she read John Jardine s letter
none	none	 Once Nancy Ellen saw Kate throw up her head and twist her neck 
5005-21379-0055	train-other-500	as if she were choking then she heard a great gulping sob down in her throat finally Kate turned and stared at her with dazed incredulous eyes Slowly she dropped the letter
5005-21379-0056	train-other-500	deliberately set her foot on it and leaving the room climbed the stairs Nancy Ellen threw George Holt s letter aside and snatched up John Jardine s
none	none	 She read 
5005-21379-0057	train-other-500	MY DEREST KATE
none	none	 I am a day late with this becos as I told you I have no schooling and in writing a letter is where I prove it 
5005-21379-0058	train-other-500	so I never write them but it was not fare to you for you not to know what kind of a letter I would write if I did write one
none	none	 so here it is very bad no dout but the best I can possably do which has got nothing 
5005-21379-0059	train-other-500	at all to do with my pashion for you and the aughful time I will have till I here from you If you can stand for this telagraf me and I will come first train
5005-21379-0060	train-other-500	and we will forget this and I will never write another letter With derest love from Mother and from me all the love of my hart Forever yours only JOHN JARDINE The writing
5005-21379-0061	train-other-500	would have been a discredit to a ten year old schoolboy Nancy Ellen threw the letter back on the floor with a stiffly extended finger she poked it into the position in which she thought she had found it
5005-21379-0062	train-other-500	and slowly stepped back Great God she said amazedly What does the man mean Where does that dainty and wonderful little mother come in She must be a regular parasite
5005-21379-0063	train-other-500	to take such ease and comfort for herself out of him and not see that he had time and chance to do better than THAT for himself Kate will never endure it never in the world
5005-21379-0064	train-other-500	And by the luck of the very Devil there comes that school proof thing in the same mail from that abominable George Holt and Kate reads it FIRST It s too bad I can t believe it What
none	none	 did his mother mean 
5005-21379-0065	train-other-500	Suddenly Nancy Ellen began to cry bitterly between sobs she could hear Kate as she walked from closet and bureau
none	none	 to her trunk which she was packing 
5005-21379-0066	train-other-500	The lid slammed heavily and a few minutes later Kate entered the room dressed for the street Why are you weeping she asked casually Her eyes were flaming
5005-21379-0067	train-other-500	her cheeks scarlet and her lips twitching Nancy Ellen sat up and looked at her She pointed to the letter I read that she said Well what do I care said Kate
5005-21379-0068	train-other-500	If he has no more respect for me than to write me such an insult as that why should I have the respect for him to protect him in it Publish it in the paper if you want to Kate
5005-21379-0069	train-other-500	what are you going to do demanded Nancy Ellen Three things said Kate slowly putting on her long silk gloves First I m going to telegraph John Jardine that I never shall see him again
5005-21379-0070	train-other-500	if I can possibly avoid it Second I m going to send a drayman to get my trunk and take it to Walden Third I m going to start out and walk miles
5005-21379-0071	train-other-500	I don t know or care where but in the end I m going to Walden to clean the schoolhouse and get ready for my winter term of school Oh Kate you are such a fine teacher Teach him
5005-21379-0072	train-other-500	Don t be so hurried Take more time to think You will break his heart pleaded Nancy Ellen Kate threw out both hands palms down P a
none	none	 s h 
5005-21379-0073	train-other-500	a u g h h a r t d o u t d e r e she slowly spelled out the letters
5005-21379-0074	train-other-500	What about my heart and my pride Think I can respect that or ask my children to respect it But thank you and Robert and come after me as often as you can
5005-21379-0075	train-other-500	as a mercy to me If John persists in coming to try to buy me as he thinks he can buy anything he wants you needn t let him come to Walden for probably
5005-21379-0076	train-other-500	I won t be there until I have to and I won t see him or his mother so he needn t try to bring her in Say good bye to Robert for me
5005-21379-0077	train-other-500	She walked from the house head erect shoulders squared and so down the street from sight In half an hour a truckman came for her trunk
5005-21379-0078	train-other-500	so Nancy Ellen made everything Kate had missed into a bundle to send with it When she came to the letters she hesitated I guess she didn t want them she said I ll just keep them awhile
5005-21379-0079	train-other-500	and if she doesn t ask about them the next time she comes I ll burn them Robert must go after her every Friday evening and we ll keep her until Monday and do all we can to cheer her
5005-21379-0080	train-other-500	and this very day he must find out all there is to know about that George Holt That IS the finest letter I ever read she does kind of stand up for him and in the reaction
5005-21379-0081	train-other-500	impulsive as she is and self confident of course she wouldn t but you never can tell what kind of fool a girl will make of herself in some cases
5005-21379-0082	train-other-500	Kate walked swiftly finished two of the errands she set out to do then her feet carried her three miles from Hartley on the Walden road before she knew where she was
5005-21379-0083	train-other-500	so she proceeded to the village missus Holt was not at home but the house was standing open Kate found her room cleaned shining and filled with flowers
5005-21379-0084	train-other-500	She paid the drayman opened her trunk and put away her dresses laying out all the things which needed washing
none	none	 then she bathed 
5005-21379-0085	train-other-500	put on heavy shoes and old skirt and waist and crossing the road sat in a secluded place in the ravine and looked stupidly at the water She noticed that everything was as she had left it in the spring
none	none	 with many fresher improvements made no doubt to please her 
5005-21379-0086	train-other-500	She closed her eyes leaned against a big tree and slow cold and hot shudders alternated in shaking her frame
5005-21379-0087	train-other-500	She did not open her eyes when she heard a step and her name called She knew without taking the trouble to look that George had come home found her luggage in her room
5005-21379-0088	train-other-500	and was hunting for her She heard him come closer and knew when he seated himself that he was watching her but she did not care enough even to move Finally
5005-21379-0089	train-other-500	she shifted her position to rest herself opened her eyes and looked at him without a word He returned her gaze steadily smiling gravely She had never seen him looking so well
5005-21379-0090	train-other-500	He had put in the summer grooming himself he had kept up the house and garden and spent all his spare time on the ravine and farming on the shares with his mother s sister who lived three miles east of them
5005-21379-0091	train-other-500	At last she roused herself and again looked at him I had your letter this morning she said I was wondering about that he replied Yes I got it just before I started
5005-21379-0092	train-other-500	said Kate Are you surprised to see me No he answered After last year we figured you might come the last of this week or the first of next so we got your room ready Monday
5005-21379-0093	train-other-500	Thank you said Kate It s very clean and nice I hope soon to be able to offer you such a room and home as you should have he said I haven t opened my office yet
5005-21379-0094	train-other-500	It was late and hot when I got home in June and Mother was fussing about this winter that she had no garden and didn t do her share at Aunt Ollie s so I have farmed most of the summer and lived on hope but
none	none	 I ll start in and make things fly this fall and by spring I ll be sailing around with a horse and carriage 
5005-21379-0095	train-other-500	like the best of them You bet I am going to make things hum so I can offer you anything you want You haven t opened an office yet she asked for the sake of saying something and because a practical thing would naturally suggest itself to her
5005-21379-0096	train-other-500	I haven t had a breath of time he said in candid disclaimer Why don t you ask me what s the matter Didn t figure that it was any of my business in the first place he said and I have a pretty fair idea in the second
5005-21379-0097	train-other-500	But how could you have she asked in surprise When your sister wouldn t give me your address she hinted that you had all the masculine attention you cared for then
5005-21379-0098	train-other-500	Tilly Nepple visited town again last week and she had been sick and called doctor Gray
none	none	 She asked him about you and he told what I fine time you had at Chautauqua and Chicago 
5005-21379-0099	train-other-500	with the rich new friends you d made I was watching for you about this time and I just happened to be at the station in Hartley last Saturday when you got off the train with your fine gentleman
5005-21379-0100	train-other-500	so I stayed over with some friends of mine and I saw you several times Sunday I saw that I d practically no chance with you at all but I made up my mind
5005-21379-0101	train-other-500	I d stick until I saw you marry him so I wrote just as I would if I hadn t known there was another man in existence That was a very fine letter said Kate It is a very fine
5005-21379-0102	train-other-500	deep sincere love that I am offering you said George Holt Of course I could see prosperity sticking out all over that city chap but it didn t bother me much because I knew that you of all women
none	none	 would judge a man on his worth 
5005-21379-0103	train-other-500	A rising young professional man is not to be sneered at at least until he makes his start and proves what he can do I couldn t get an early start because
5005-21379-0104	train-other-500	I ve always had to work just as you ve seen me last summer and this so I couldn t educate myself so fast
none	none	 but I ve gone as fast and far as I could 
5005-21379-0105	train-other-500	Kate winced This was getting on places that hurt and to matters she well understood but she was the soul of candour You did very well to educate yourself as you have
5005-21379-0106	train-other-500	with no help at all she said I ve done my best in the past
none	none	 I m going to do marvels in the future 
5005-21379-0107	train-other-500	and whatever I do it is all for you and yours for the taking he said grandiosely Thank you said Kate But are you making that offer when you can t help seeing that I m in deep trouble
none	none	 A thousand times over he said 
5005-21379-0108	train-other-500	All I want to know about your trouble is whether there is anything a man of my size and strength can do to help you Not a thing said Kate in the direction of slaying a gay deceiver
5005-21379-0109	train-other-500	if that s what you mean The extent of my familiarities with John Jardine
none	none	 consists in voluntarily kissing him twice last Sunday night 
5005-21379-0110	train-other-500	for the first and last time once for himself and once for his mother whom I have since ceased to respect George Holt was watching her with eyes lynx sharp but Kate never saw it
5005-21379-0111	train-other-500	When she mentioned her farewell of Sunday night a queer smile swept over his face and instantly disappeared I should thing any girl might be permitted that much in saying a final good bye to a man
5005-21379-0112	train-other-500	who had shown her a fine time for weeks he commented casually But I didn t know I was saying good bye explained Kate I expected him back in a week and that I would then arrange to marry him
5005-21379-0113	train-other-500	That was the agreement we made then
none	none	 As she began to speak 
5005-21379-0114	train-other-500	George Holt s face flashed triumph at having led her on at what she said it fell perceptibly
none	none	 but he instantly controlled it and said casually 
5005-21379-0115	train-other-500	In any event it was your own business It was said Kate I had given no man the slightest encouragement I was perfectly free
none	none	 John Jardine was courting me openly in the presence of his mother 
5005-21379-0116	train-other-500	and any one who happened to be around I intended to marry him I liked him as much as any man need be liked I don t know whether it was the same feeling Nancy Ellen had for Robert Gray or not
5005-21379-0117	train-other-500	but it was a whole lot of feeling of some kind I was satisfied with it and he would have been I meant to be a good wife to him and a good daughter to his mother
5005-21379-0118	train-other-500	and I could have done much good in the world and extracted untold pleasure from the money he would have put in my power to handle All was going merry as a marriage bell and then this morning came my Waterloo in the same post with your letter
5005-21379-0119	train-other-500	Do you know what you are doing cried George Holt roughly losing self control with hope YOU ARE PROVING TO ME AND ADMITTING TO YOURSELF THAT YOU NEVER LOVED THAT MAN AT ALL You were flattered
none	none	 and tempted with position and riches 
5005-21379-0120	train-other-500	but your heart was not his or you would be mighty SURE of it don t you forget that I am not interested in analyzing exactly what I felt for him said Kate
5005-21379-0121	train-other-500	It made small difference then it makes none at all now
none	none	 I would have married him gladly and I would have been to him all a good wife is to any man 
5005-21379-0122	train-other-500	then in a few seconds I turned squarely against him and lost my respect for him You couldn t marry me to him
none	none	 if he were the last and only man on earth 
5005-21379-0123	train-other-500	but it hurt terribly let me tell you that George Holt suddenly arose and went to Kate He sat down close beside her and leaned toward her
5005-21379-0124	train-other-500	There isn t the least danger of my trying to marry you to him he said because I am going to marry you myself at the very first opportunity Why not now Why not have a simple ceremony somewhere at once
5005-21379-0125	train-other-500	and go away until school begins and forget him having a good time by ourselves Come on Kate let s do it We can go stay with Aunt Ollie and if he comes trying to force himself on you he ll get what he deserves
none	none	 He ll learn that there is something on earth he can t buy with his money 
5005-21379-0126	train-other-500	But I don t love you said Kate Neither did you love him retorted George Holt I can prove it by what you say Neither did you love him but you were going to marry him
5005-21379-0127	train-other-500	and use all his wonderful power of position and wealth and trust to association to BRING love You can try that with me As for wealth who cares We are young and strong and we have a fine chance in the world
5005-21379-0128	train-other-500	You go on and teach this year
none	none	 and I ll get such a start that by next year you can be riding around in your carriage proud as Pompey Of course we could make it all right as to a living said Kate Big and strong as we are 
5005-21379-0129	train-other-500	but Then the torrent broke At the first hint that she would consider his proposal George Holt drew her to him and talked volumes of impassioned love to her He gave her no chance to say anything
5005-21379-0130	train-other-500	he said all there was to say himself he urged that Jardine would come and she should not be there He begged he pleaded he reasoned Night found Kate sitting on the back porch at Aunt Ollie s
5005-21379-0131	train-other-500	with a confused memory of having stood beside the little stream with her hand in George Holt s while she assented to the questions of a Justice of the Peace in the presence of the School Director and missus Holt
5005-21379-0132	train-other-500	She knew that immediately thereafter they had walked away along a hot dusty country road she had tried to eat something that tasted like salted ashes
5005-21379-0133	train-other-500	She could hear George s ringing laugh of exultation breaking out afresh every few minutes
none	none	 in sudden irritation at the latest guffaw she clearly remembered one thing in her dazed and bewildered state she had forgotten to tell him that she was a Prodigal Daughter CHAPTER XIII THE BRIDE ONLY one memory in the ten days that followed before her school began ever stood out clearly and distinctly with Kate That was the morning of the day after she married George Holt She saw Nancy Ellen and Robert at the gate so she went out to speak with them Nancy Ellen was driving she held the lines and the whip in her hands Kate in dull apathy wondered why they seemed so deeply agitated Both of them stared at her as if she might be a maniac Is this thing in the morning paper true cried Nancy Ellen in a high shrill voice that made Kate start in wonder She did not take the trouble to evade by asking what thing she merely made assent with her head You are married to that that Nancy Ellen choked until she could not say what It s TIME to stop since I am married to him said Kate gravely You rushed in and married him without giving Robert time to find out and tell you what everybody knows about him demanded Nancy Ellen I married him for what I knew about him myself said Kate We shall do very well Do well cried Nancy Do well You ll be hungry and in rags the rest of your life Don t Nancy Ellen don t plead Robert This is Kate s affair wait until you hear what she has to say before you go further I don t care what she has to say cried Nancy Ellen I m saying my say right now This is a disgrace to the whole Bates family We may not be much but there isn t a lazy gambling drunken loafer among us and there won t be so far as I m concerned She glared at Kate who gazed at her in wonder You really married this lout she demanded I told you I was married said Kate patiently for she saw that Nancy Ellen was irresponsible with anger You re going to live with him you re going to stay in Walden to live she cried That is my plan at present said Kate Well see that YOU STAY THERE said Nancy Ellen You can t bring that that creature to my house and if you re going to be his wife you needn t come yourself That s all I ve got to say to you you shameless crazy Nancy Ellen you shall not cried Robert Gray deftly slipping the lines from her fingers and starting the horse full speed Kate saw Nancy Ellen s head fall forward and her hands lifted to cover her face She heard the deep tearing sob that shook her and then they were gone She did not know what to do so she stood still in the hot sunshine trying to think but her brain refused to act at her will When the heat became oppressive she turned back to the shade of a tree sat down and leaned against it There she got two things clear after a time She had married George Holt there was nothing to do but make the best of it But Nancy Ellen had said that if she lived with him she should not come to her home Very well She had to live with him since she had consented to marry him so she was cut off from Robert and Nancy Ellen She was now a prodigal indeed And those things Nancy Ellen had said she was wild with anger She had been misinformed Those things could not be true Shouldn t you be in here helping Aunt Ollie asked George s voice from the front step where he seated himself with his pipe Yes in a minute said Kate rising Did you see who came No I was out doing the morning work Who was it he asked Nancy Ellen and Robert she answered He laughed hilariously Brought them in a hurry didn t we Why didn t they come in They came to tell me said Kate slowly that if I had married you yesterday as I did that they felt so disgraced that I wasn t to come to their home again Disgraced he cried his colour rising Well what s the matter with me Not the things they said I fervently hope Well they have some assurance to come out here and talk about me and you ve got as much to listen and then come and tell me about it he cried It was over in a minute said Kate I d no idea what they were going to say They said it and went Oh I can t spare Nancy Ellen she s all I had Kate sank down on the step and covered her face George took one long look at her arose and walked out of hearing He went into the garden and watched from behind a honeysuckle bush until he saw her finally lift her head and wipe her eyes then he sauntered back and sat down on the step beside her That s right he said Cry it out and get it over It was pretty mean of them to come out here and insult you and tell any lie they could think up and then drive away and leave you but don t mind they ll soon get over it Nobody ever keeps up a fuss over a wedding long Nancy Ellen never told a lie in her life said Kate She has too much self respect What she said she THOUGHT was true My only chance is that somebody has told her a lie You know best if they did Of course they did he broke in glibly Haven t you lived in the same house with me long enough to know me better than any one else does You can live in the same house with people and know less about them than any one else for that matter said Kate but that s neither here nor there We re in this together we got to get on the job and pull and make a success out of it that will make all of them proud to be our friends That s the only thing left for me As I know the Bates once they make up their minds they never change With Nancy Ellen and Father both down on me I m a prodigal for sure What he cried loudly What Is your father in this too Did he send you word you couldn t come home either This is a hell of a mess Speak up Kate closed her lips looked at him with deep scorn and walked around the corner of the house For a second he looked after her threateningly then he sprang to his feet and ran to her catching her in his arms Forgive me dearest he cried That took the wind out of my sails until I was a brute You d no business to SAY a thing like that Of course we can t have the old Land King down on us We ve got to have our share of that land and money to buy us a fine home in Hartley and fix me up the kind of an office I should have We ll borrow a rig and drive over to morrow and fix things solid with the old folks You bet I m a star spangled old persuader look what I did with you You stop cried Kate breaking from his hold You will drive me crazy You re talking as if you married me expecting land and money from it I haven t been home in a year and my father would deliberately kill me if I went within his reach Well score one for little old scratchin pickin Mammy he cried She SAID you had a secret Kate stood very still looking at him so intently that a sense of shame must have stirred in his breast Look here Kate he said roughly Mother did say you had a secret and she hinted at Christmas that the reason you didn t go home was because your folks were at outs with you and you can ask her if I didn t tell her to shut up and leave you alone that I was in love with you and I d marry you and we d get along all right even if you were barred from home and didn t get a penny I just dare you to ask her It s no matter said Kate wearily I d rather take your word All right you take it for that s the truth he said But what was the rumpus How did you come to have a racket with your old man Over my wanting to teach said Kate Then she explained in detail Pother Don t you fret about that said George I m taking care of you now and I ll see that you soon get home and to Grays too that s all buncombe As for your share of your father s estate you watch me get it You are his child and there is law There s law that allows him to deed his land to his sons before he dies and that is exactly what he has done said Kate The Devil you say shouted George Holt stepping back to stare at her You tell that at the Insane Asylum or the Feeble Minded Home I ve seen the records I know to the acre how much land stands in your father s name Don t try to work that on me my lady I am not trying to work anything on you said Kate dully wondering to herself why she listened why she went on with it I m merely telling you In Father s big chest at the head of his bed at home lies a deed for two hundred acres of land for each of his seven sons all signed and ready to deliver He keeps the land in his name on record to bring him distinction and feed his vanity He makes the boys pay the taxes and ko tow and help with his work he keeps them under control but the land is theirs none of the girls get a penny s worth of it George Holt cleared his face with an effort Well we are no worse off than the rest of them then he said trying to speak naturally and cheerfully But don t you ever believe it Little old Georgie will sleep with this in his night cap awhile and it s a problem he will solve if he works himself to death on it But that is Father s affair said Kate You had best turn your efforts and lie awake nights thinking how to make enough money to buy some land for us yourself Certainly Certainly I see myself doing it laughed George Holt And now knowing how you feel and feeling none to good myself we are going to take a few days off and go upstream fishing I ll take a pack of comforts to sleep on and the tackle and some food and we will forget the whole bunch and go have a good time There s a place not so far away where I have camped beside a spring since I was a little shaver and it s quiet and cool Go get what you can t possibly exist without nothing more But we must dig the potatoes protested Kate Let them wait until we get back it s a trifle early anyway he said Stop objecting and get ready I ll tell Aunt Ollie We re chums Whatever I do is always all right with her Come on This is our wedding trip Not much like the one you had planned no doubt but one of some kind So they slipped beneath the tangle of vines and bushes and following the stream of the ravine they walked until mid afternoon when they reached a spot that was very lovely a clear clean spring grassy bank a sheltered cave in floored with clean sand warm and golden From the depths of the cave George brought an old frying pan and coffee pot He spread a comfort on the sand of the cave for a bed produced coffee steak bread butter and fruit from his load and told Kate to make herself comfortable while he got dinner They each tried to make allowances for and to be as decent as possible with the other with the result that before they knew it they were having a good time at least they were keeping the irritating things they thought to themselves and saying only the pleasant ones After a week which George enjoyed to the fullest extent while Kate made the best of everything they put away the coffee pot and frying pan folded the comforts and went back to Aunt Ollie s for dinner then to Walden in the afternoon Because missus Holt knew they would be there that day she had the house clean and the best supper she could prepare ready for them She was in a quandary as to how to begin with Kate She heartily hated her She had been sure the girl had a secret now she knew it for if she did not attend the wedding of her sister if she had not been at home all summer if her father and mother never mentioned her name or made any answer to any one who did there was a reason and a good reason Of course a man as rich as Adam Bates could do no wrong whatever the trouble was Kate was at fault she had done some terrible thing Hidin in the bushes spat missus Holt Hidin in the bushes Marry a man who didn t know he was goin to be married an hour before unbeknownst to her folks an wouldn t even come in the house an have a few of the neighbours in Nice doin s for the school ma am Nice prospect for George missus Holt hissed like a copperhead which was a harmless little creature compared with her as she scraped and slashed and dismembered the chicken she was preparing to fry She had not been able even by running into each store in the village and the post office to find one person who would say a word against Kate The girl had laid her foundations too well The one thing people could and did say was How could she marry George Holt The worst of them could not very well say it to his mother They said it frequently to each other and then supplied the true answers Look how he spruced up after she came Look how he worked Look how he ran after and waited on her Look how nice he has been all summer Plenty was being said in Walden but not one word of it was for the itching ears of missus Holt They had told her how splendid Kate was how they loved her how glad they were that she was to have the school again how fortunate her son was how proud she should be until she was almost bursting with repressed venom She met them at the gate after their week s camping They were feeling in splendid health the best spirits possible in the circumstances but appearing dirty and disreputable They were both laughing as they approached the gate Purty lookin bride you be missus Holt spat at Kate Yes aren t I laughed Kate But you just give me a tub of hot soapsuds and an hour and you won t know me How are you Things look as if you were expecting us Hump said missus Holt Kate laughed and went into the house George stepped in front of his mother Now you look here he said I know every nasty thing your mind has conjured up that you d LIKE to say and have other folks say about Kate And I know as well as if you were honest enough to tell me that you haven t been able to root out one living soul who would say a single word against her Swallow your secret Swallow your suspicions Swallow your venom and forget all of them Kate is as fine a woman as God ever made and anybody who has common sense knows it She can just MAKE me if she wants to and she will she s coming on fine much faster and better than I hoped for Now you drop this Stop it Do you hear He passed her and hurried up the walk In an hour both George and Kate had bathed and dressed in their very best Kate put on her prettiest white dress and George his graduation suit Then together they walked to the post office for their mail which George had ordered held before they left Carrying the bundle they entered several stores on trifling errands and then went home They stopped and spoke to everyone Kate kissed all her little pupils she met and told them to come to see her and to be ready to help clean the schoolhouse in the morning Word flew over town swiftly The Teacher was back wearing the loveliest dress and nicer than ever and she had invited folks to come to see her Kate and George had scarcely finished their supper when the first pair of shy little girls came for their kisses and to bring Teacher a bunch of flowers and a pretty pocket handkerchief from each They came in flocks each with flowers most with a towel or some small remembrance then the elders began to come merchants with comforts blankets and towels hardware men with frying pans flat irons and tinware By ten o clock almost everyone in Walden had carried Kate some small gift wished her joy all the more earnestly because they felt the chances of her ever having it were so small and had gone their way leaving her feeling better than she had thought possible She slipped into her room alone and read two letters one a few typewritten lines from John Jardine saying he had been at Hartley also at Walden and having found her married and gone there was nothing for him to do but wish that the man she married had it in his heart to guard her life and happiness as he would have done He would never cease to love her and if at any time in her life there was anything he could do for her would she please let him know Kate dropped the letter on her dresser with a purpose and let it lie there The other was from Robert He said he was very sorry but he could do nothing with Nancy Ellen at present He hoped she would change later If there was ever anything he could do to let him know Kate locked that letter in her trunk She wondered as she did so why both of them seemed to think she would need them in the future She felt perfectly able to take care of herself Monday morning George carried Kate s books to school for her saw that she was started on her work in good shape then went home put on his old clothes and began the fall work at Aunt Ollie s Kate wearing her prettiest blue dress forgot even the dull ache in her heart as she threw herself into the business of educating those young people She worked as she never had before She seemed to have developed fresh patience new perception keener penetration she made the dullest of them see her points and interested the most inattentive She went home to dinner feeling better She decided to keep on teaching a few years until George was well started in his practice if he ever got started He was very slow in action it seemed to her compared with his enthusiasm when he talked CHAPTER XIV STARTING MARRIED LIFE FOR two weeks Kate threw herself into the business of teaching with all her power She succeeded in so interesting herself and her pupils that she was convinced she had done a wise thing Marriage did not interfere with her teaching she felt capable and independent so long as she had her salary George was working and working diligently to prepare for winter whenever she was present or could see results With her first month s salary she would buy herself a warm coat a wool suit an extra skirt for school and some waists If there was enough left she would have another real hat Then for the remainder of the year she would spend only for the barest necessities and save to help toward a home something like Nancy Ellen s Whenever she thought of Nancy Ellen and Robert there was a choking sensation in her throat a dull ache where she had been taught her heart was located For two weeks everything went as well as Kate hoped then missus Holt began to show the results of having been partially bottled up for the first time in her life She was careful to keep to generalities which she could claim meant nothing if anything she said was taken up by either George or Kate George was too lazy to quarrel unless he was personally angered Kate thought best to ignore anything that did not come in the nature of a direct attack So long as missus Holt could not understand how some folks could see their way to live off of other folks or why a girl who had a chance to marry a fortune would make herself a burden to a poor man Kate made the mistake of ignoring her Thus emboldened she soon became personal It seemed as if she spent her spare time and mental force thinking up suggestive sarcastic things to say where Kate could not help hearing them She paid no attention unless the attack was too mean and premeditated but to her surprise she found that every ugly malicious word the old woman said lodged in her brain and arose to confront her at the most inopportune times in the middle of a recitation or when she roused enough to turn over in her bed at night The more vigorously she threw herself into her school work the more she realized a queer lassitude creeping over her She kept squaring her shoulders lifting her chin and brushing imaginary cobwebs from before her face The final Friday evening of the month she stopped at the post office and carried away with her the bill for her Leghorn hat mailed with nicely conceived estimate as to when her first check would be due Kate visited the Trustee and smiled grimly as she slipped the amount in an envelope and gave it to the hack driver to carry to Hartley on his trip the following day She had intended all fall to go with him and select a winter headpiece that would be no discredit to her summer choice but a sort of numbness was in her bones so she decided to wait until the coming week before going She declined George s pressing invitation to go along to Aunt Ollie s and help load and bring home a part of his share of their summer s crops on the ground that she had some work to prepare for the coming week Then Kate went to her room feeling faint and heavy She lay there most of the day becoming sorrier for herself and heavier every passing hour By morning she was violently ill when she tried to leave her bed dizzy and faint All day she could not stand Toward evening she appealed to George either to do something for her himself or to send for the village doctor He asked her a few questions and then laughing coarsely told her that a doctor would do her no good and that it was very probable that she would feel far worse before she felt better Kate stared at him in dumb wonder But my school she cried My school I must be able to go to school in the morning Could that spring water have been infected with typhus I ve never been sick like this before I should hope not said George And then he told her bluntly what caused her trouble Kate had been white to begin with now she slowly turned greenish as she gazed at him with incredulous eyes Then she sprang to her feet But I can t be ill she cried I can t There is my school I ve got to teach Oh what shall I do George had a very clear conception of what she could do but he did not intend to suggest it to her She could think of it and propose it herself She could not think of anything at that minute because she fainted and fell half on the bed half in his arms as he sprang to her He laid her down and stood a second smiling triumphantly at her unheeding face Easy snap for you this winter Georgie my boy he muttered I don t see people falling over each other to get to you for professional services and it s hard work anyway Zonoletics are away above the head of these country ignoramuses blue mass and quinine are about their limit He took his time to bathe Kate s face Presently she sat up then fell on the pillow again Better not try that warned George You ll hurt yourself and you can t make it You re out of the game you might as well get used to it I won t be out of the game cried Kate I can t be What will become of my school Oh George could you possibly teach for me only for a few days until I get my stomach settled Why I d like to help you he said but you see how it is with me I ve got my fall work finished up and I m getting ready to open my office next week I m going to rent that nice front room over the post office But George you must said Kate You ve taught several terms You ve a license You can take it until this passes If you have waited from June to October to open your office you can wait a few more days Suppose you OPEN the office and patients don t come or we haven t the school what would we LIVE on What would I buy things with and pay doctor bills Why didn t you think of that before you got married What was your rush anyway I can t figure it to save my soul he said George the school can t go she cried If what you say is true and I suspect it is I must have money to see me through Then set your wits to work and fix things up with your father he said casually Kate arose tall and straight standing unwaveringly as she looked at him in blazing contempt So she said This is the kind of man you are I m not so helpless as you think me I have a refuge I know where to find it You ll teach my school until I m able to take it myself if the Trustee and patrons will allow you or I ll sever my relations with you as quickly as I formed them You have no practice I have grave doubts if you can get any this is our only chance for the money we must have this winter Go ask the Trustee to come here until I can make arrangements with him Then she wavered and rolled on the bed again George stood looking at her between narrowed eyelids Tactics I use with Mother don t go with you old girl he said to himself Thing of fire and tow stubborn as an ox won t be pushed a hair s breadth old Bates over again alike as two peas But I ll break you damn you I ll break you only I WANT that school Lots easier than kneading somebody s old stiff muscles while the money is sure Oh I go after the Trustee all right He revived Kate and telling her to keep quiet and not excite herself he explained that it was a terrible sacrifice to him to put off opening his office any longer she must forgive him for losing self control when he thought of it but for her dear sake he would teach until she was better possibly she would be all right in a few days and then she could take her work again Because she so devoutly hoped it Kate made that arrangement with the Trustee Monday she lay half starved yet gagging and ill while George went to teach her school As she contemplated that she grew sicker than she had been before When she suddenly marshalled all the facts she knew of him she stoutly refused to think of what Nancy Ellen had said when she reviewed his character and disposition and thought of him taking charge of the minds of her pupils Kate suddenly felt she must not allow that to happen she must not Then came another thought even more personal and terrible a thought so disconcerting she mercifully lost consciousness again She sent for the village doctor and found no consolation from her talk with him She was out of the school that was settled No harpy ever went to its meat with one half the zest missus Holt found in the situation With Kate so ill she could not stand on her feet half the time so ill she could not reply with no spirit left to appeal to George what more could be asked missus Holt could add to every grievance she formerly had that of a sick woman in the house for her to wait on She could even make vile insinuations to Kate prostrate and helpless that she would not have dared otherwise She could prepare food that with a touch of salt or sugar where it was not supposed to be would have sickened a well person One day George came in from school and saw a bowl of broth sitting on a chair beside Kate s bed Can t you drink it he asked Do if you possibly can he urged You ll get so weak you ll be helpless I just can t said Kate Things have such a sickening sweetish taste or they are bitter or sour not a thing is as it used to be I simply can t A curious look crept over George s face He picked up the bowl and tasted the contents Instantly his face went black he started toward the kitchen Kate heard part of what happened but she never lifted her head After a while he came back with more broth and a plate of delicate toast Try this he said I made it myself Kate ate ravenously That s good she cried I ll tell you what I m going to do he said I m going to take you out to Aunt Ollie s for a week after school to night Want to go Yes Oh yes cried Kate All right he said I know where I can borrow a rig for an hour Get ready if you are well enough if you are not I ll help you after school That week with Aunt Ollie remained a bright spot in Kate s memory The October days were beginning to be crisp and cool Food was different She could sleep she could eat many things Aunt Ollie knew to prepare especially soon she could walk and be outdoors She was so much better she wrote George a note asking him to walk out and bring her sewing basket and some goods she listed and in the afternoons the two women cut and sewed quaint enticing little garments George found Kate so much better when he came that he proposed she remain another week Then for the first time he talked to her about her theory of government and teaching until she realized that the School Director had told him he was dissatisfied with him so George was trying to learn her ways Appalled at what might happen if he lost the school Kate made notes talked at length begged him to do his best and to come at once if anything went wrong He did come and brought the school books so she went over the lessons with him and made marginal notes of things suggested to her mind by the text for him to discuss and elucidate The next time he came he was in such good spirits she knew his work had been praised so after that they went over the lessons together each evening Thinking of what would help him also helped fill her day He took her home greatly improved in much better spirits to her room cleaned and ready for winter with all of her things possible to use in place so that it was much changed prettier and more convenient As they drove in she said of him George what about it Did your mother purposely fix my food so I could not eat it Oh I wouldn t say that he said You know neither of you is violently attached to the other She ll be more careful after this I m sure she will Why have you been sick asked Kate as soon as she saw missus Holt She seemed so nervous and appeared so badly Kate was sorry for her but she could not help noticing how she kept watch on her son She seemed to keep the width of the room and a piece of furniture between them while her cooking was so different that it was not in the least necessary for George to fix things for Kate himself as he had suggested Everything was so improved Kate felt better She began to sew to read to sit for long periods in profound thought then to take walks that brought back her strength and colour So through the winter and toward the approach of spring they lived in greater comfort With Kate s help George was doing so well with the school that he was frequently complimented by the parents That he was trying to do good work and win the approval of both pupils and parents was evident to Kate Once he said to her that he wondered if it would be a good thing for him to put in an application for the school the coming winter Kate stared at him in surprise But your profession she objected You should be in your office and having enough practice to support us by then Yes I should he said But this is a new thing and you know how these clodhoppers are If I came as near living in the country and worked at farming as much as you do that s the last thing I would call any human being said Kate I certainly do know how they are and what I know convinces me that you need not look to them for any patients You seem to think I won t have any from any source he said hotly I confess myself dubious said Kate You certainly are or you wouldn t be talking of teaching Well I ll just show you he cried I m waiting said Kate But as we must live in the meantime and it will be so long before I can earn anything again and so much expense possibly it would be a good idea to have the school to fall back on if you shouldn t have the patients you hope for this summer I think you have done well with the school Do your level best until the term closes and you may have a chance Laughing scornfully he repeated his old boast I ll just show you Go ahead said Kate And while you are at it be generous Show me plenty But in the meantime save every penny you can so you ll be ready to pay the doctor s bills and furnish your office I love you advice it s so Batesy he said I have money saved for both contingencies you mention but I ll tell you what I think and about this I m the one who knows I ve told you repeatedly winter is my best time I ve lost the winter trying to help you out and I ve little chance until winter comes again It takes cold weather to make folks feel what ails their muscles and my treatment is mostly muscular To save so we can get a real start wouldn t it be a good idea for you to put part of your things in my room take what you must have and fix Mother s bedroom for you let her move her bed into her living room and spare me all you can of your things to fix up your room for my office this summer That would save rent it s only a few steps from downtown and when I wasn t busy with patients I could be handy to the garden and to help you If your mother is willing I ll do my share said Kate although the room s cramped and where I ll put the small party when he comes I don t know but I ll manage someway The big objection to it is that it will make it look to people as if it were a makeshift instead of starting a real business Real was the wrong word It was the red rag that started George raging until to save her self respect Kate left the room Later in the day he announced that his mother was willing she would clean the living room and move in that day How Kate hated the tiny room with its one exterior wall only one small window its scratched woodwork and soiled paper she could not say She felt physically ill when she thought of it and when she thought of the heat of the coming summer she wondered what she would do but all she could do was to acquiesce She made a trip downtown and bought a quart of white paint and a few rolls of dainty fresh paper She made herself ill with turpentine odours in giving the woodwork three coats and fell from a table almost killing herself while papering the ceiling There was no room for her trunk the closet would not hold half her clothes her only easy chair was crowded out she was sheared of personal comfort at a clip just at a time when every comfort should have been hers George ordered an operating table on which to massage his patients a few other necessities and in high spirits went about fixing up his office and finishing his school He spent hours in the woodshed with the remainder of Kate s white paint making a sign to hang in front of the house He was so pathetically anxious for a patient after he had put his table in place hung up his sign and paid for an announcement in the county paper and the little Walden sheet that Kate was sorry for him On a hot July morning missus Holt was sweeping the front porch when a forlorn specimen of humanity came shuffling up the front walk and asked to see doctor Holt missus Holt took him into the office and ran to the garden to tell George his first patient had come His face had been flushed from pulling weeds but it paled perceptibly as he started to the back porch to wash his hands Do you know who it is Mother he asked It s that old Peter Mines she said an he looks fit to drop Peter Mines said George He s had about fifty things the matter with him for about fifty years Then you re a made man if you can even make him think he feels enough better so s he ll go round talking about it said missus Holt shrewdly George stood with his hands dripping water an instant thinking deeply Well said for once old lady he agreed You are just exactly right He hurried to his room and put on his coat A patient that will be a big boom for me he boasted to Kate as he went down the hall missus Holt stood listening at the hall door Kate walked around the dining room trying to occupy herself Presently cringing groans began to come from the room mingling with George s deep voice explaining and trying to encourage the man Then came a wild shriek and then silence Kate hurried out to the back walk and began pacing up and down in the sunshine She did not know it but she was praying A minute later George s pallid face appeared at the back door You come in here quick and help me he demanded What s the matter asked Kate He s fainted His heart I think He s got everything that ever ailed a man he said Oh George you shouldn t have touched him said Kate Can t you see it will make me if I can help him Even Mother could see that he cried But if his heart is bad the risk of massaging him is awful said Kate as she hurried after George Kate looked at the man on the table ran her hand over the heart region and lifted terrified eyes to George Do you think he stammered Sure of it she said but we can try Bring your camphor bottle and some water she cried to missus Holt For a few minutes they worked frantically Then Kate stepped back I m scared and I don t care who knows it she said I m going after doctor James No you are not cried George You just hold yourself I ll have him out in a minute Begin at his feet and rub the blood up to his heart They are swollen to a puff he s got no circulation said Kate Oh George how could you ever hope to do anything for a man in this shape with MUSCULAR treatment You keep still and rub for God s sake he cried frantically Can t you see that I am ruined if he dies on this table No I can t said Kate Everybody would know that he was practically dying when he came here Nobody will blame you only you never should have touched him George I AM going after doctor James Well go then he said wildly Kate started missus Holt blocked the doorway You just stop Missy she cried You re away too smart trying to get folks in here and ruin my George s chances You just stay where you are till I think what to do to put the best face on this He may not be really gone The doctor might save him cried Kate missus Holt looked long at the man He s deader an a doornail she said You stay where you are Kate picked her up by the shoulders set her to one side ran from the room and down the street as fast as possible She found the doctor in his office with two patients She had no time to think or temporize Get your case and come to our house quick doctor she cried An old man they call Peter Mines came to see George and his heart has failed Please hurry Heart eh said the doctor Well wait a minute No use to go about a bad heart without digitalis He got up and put on his hat told the men he would be back soon and went to the nearest drug store Kate followed The men who had been in the office came also Doctor hurry she panted I m so frightened You go to some of the neighbours and stay away from there he said Hurry begged Kate Oh do hurry She was beside him as they sped down the street and at his shoulder as they entered the room With one glance she lurched against the casing and then she plunged down the hall entered her room closed the door behind her and threw herself on the bed She had only a glance but in that glance she had seen Peter Mines sitting fully clothed his hat on his head his stick in his hands in her easy chair the operating table folded and standing against the wall missus Holt holding the camphor bottle to Peter s nose while George had one hand over Peter s heart the other steadying his head The doctor swung the table in place and with George s help laid Peter on it then began tearing open his clothes As they worked the two men followed into the house to see if they could do anything and excited neighbours began to gather George and his mother explained how Peter had exhausted himself walking two miles from the country that hot morning how he had entered the office tottering with fatigue and had fallen in the chair in a fainting condition Everything was plausible until a neighbour woman eager to be the centre of attention for a second cried Yes we all see him come more n an hour ago and when he begin to let out the yells we says to each other THERE George has got his first patient sure An we all kind of waited to see if he d come out better The doctor looked at her sharply More than an hour ago he said You heard cries Yes more n a good hour ago Yes we all heard him yell jist once good and loud she said The doctor turned to George Before he could speak his mother intervened That was our Kate done the yellin she said She was scart crazy from the start He jest come in and set in the chair and he s been there ever since You didn t give him any treatment Holt asked the doctor Again missus Holt answered Never touched him Hadn t even got time to get his table open Wa n t nothing he could a done for him anyway Peter was good as gone when he got here His fool folks never ought a let him out this hot day sick as he was The doctor looked at George at his mother long at Peter He surely was too sick to walk that far in this heat he said But to make sure I ll look him over George you help me Clear the room of all but these two men HE began minutely examining Peter s heart region Then he rolled him over and started to compress his lungs Long white streaks marked the puffy red of the swollen dropsical flesh The doctor examined the length of the body and looked straight into George Holt s eyes No use he said Bill go to the phone in my office and tell Coroner Smith to get here from Hartley as soon as he can All that s left to do here is to obey the law and have a funeral Better some of the rest of you go tell his folks I ve done all I can do It s up to the Coroner now The rest of you go home and keep still till he comes When he and George were left alone he said tersely Of course you and your mother are lying You had this man stripped he did cry out and he did die from the pain of the treatment you tried to give him in his condition By the way where s your wife This is a bad thing for her right now Come let s find her and see what state she is in Together they left the room and entered Kate s door As soon as the doctor was busy with her George slipped back into the closed room rolled Peter on his back and covered him in the hope that the blood would settle until it would efface the marks of his work before the Coroner arrived By that time the doctor was too busy to care much what happened to Peter Mines he was a poor old soul better off as he was Across Kate s unconscious body he said to George Holt I m going to let the Coroner make what he pleases out of this solely for your wife s sake But two things take down that shingle Take it down now and never put it up again if you want me to keep still I ll give you what you paid for that table It s a good one Get him out as soon as you can Set him in another room I ve got to have missus Holt where I can work And send Sarah Nepple here to help me Move fast This is going to be a close call And the other thing I ve heard you put in an application for our school this winter Withdraw it Now move So they set Peter in the living room cleaned Kate s room quickly and moved in her bed By the time the Coroner arrived the doctor was too busy to care what happened On oath he said a few words that he hoped would make life easier for Kate and at the same time pass muster for truth told the Coroner what witnesses to call and gave an opinion as to Peter s condition He also added that he was sure Peter s family would be very glad he was to suffer no more and then he went back to Kate who was suffering entirely too much for safety Then began a long vigil that ended at midnight with Kate barely alive and Sarah Nepple the Walden mid wife trying to divide a scanty wardrobe between a pair of lusty twins CHAPTER XV A NEW IDEA KATE slowly came back to consciousness She was conscious of her body sore from head to foot with plenty of pain in definite spots Her first clear thought was that she was such a big woman it seemed to her that she filled the room when she was one bruised ache from head to heels Then she became conscious of a moving bundle on the bed beside her and laid her hand on it to reassure herself The size and shape of the bundle were not reassuring Oh Lord groaned Kate Haven t You any mercy at all It was Your advice I followed when I took wing and started out in life A big sob arose in her throat while at the same time she began to laugh weakly doctor James heard her from the hall and entered hastily At the sight of him Kate s eyes filled with terrified remembrance Her glance swept the room and rested on her rocking chair Take that out of here she cried Take it out split it into kindling wood and burn it All right said doctor James calmly I ll guarantee that you never see it again Is there anything else you want You you didn t The doctor shook his head Very sorry he said but there wasn t a thing could be done Where is he she asked in a whisper His people took him home immediately after the Coroner s inquest which found that he died from heart failure brought on by his long walk in the heat Kate stared at him with a face pitiful to behold You let him think THAT she whispered again I did said the old doctor I thought and still think that for the sake of you and yours he waved toward the bundle it was the only course to pursue Thank you said Kate You re very kind But don t you think that I and mine are going to take a lot of shielding The next man may not be so kindly disposed Besides is it right Is it honest It is for you said the doctor You had nothing to do with it If you had things would not have gone as they did As for me I feel perfectly comfortable about it in my conscience which is my best guide All I had to do was to let them tell their story I perjured myself only to the extent of testifying that you knew nothing about it The Coroner could well believe that George and his mother could easily manage the remainder Kate waved toward the bundle Am I supposed to welcome and love them A poet might expect you to said the doctor In the circumstances I do not I shall feel that you have done your whole duty if you will try to nurse them when the time comes You must have a long rest and they must grow some before you ll discover what they mean to you There s always as much chance that they ll resemble your people as that they will not The boy will have dark hair and eyes I think but he looks exactly like you The girl is more Holt Where is George she asked He was completely upset said the doctor I suggested that he go somewhere to rest up a few days so he took his tackle and went fishing and to the farm Shouldn t he have stayed and faced it asked Kate There was nothing for him to face except himself Kate said the doctor Kate shook her head She looked ghastly ill Doctor she said couldn t you have let me die And left your son and your little daughter to them he asked No Kate I couldn t have let you die because you ve your work in the world under your hand right now He said that because when he said left your son and your little daughter to them Kate had reached over and laid her hand possessively defensively on the little squirming bundle which was all doctor James asked of her Presently she looked the doctor straight in the face Exactly what do you know she asked Everything said the doctor And you Everything said Kate There was a long silence Then Kate spoke slowly That George didn t know that he shouldn t have touched that man proves him completely incompetent she said That he did and didn t have the courage to face the results proves him lacking in principle He s not fit for either work to which he aspires You are talking too much said the doctor Nurse Nepple is in charge here and Aunt Ollie George s mother went to the farm to cook for him You re in the hands of two fine women who will make you comfortable You have escaped lasting disgrace with your skirts clear now rest and be thankful I can t rest until I know one thing said Kate You re not going to allow George to kill any one else No said the doctor I regretted telling him very much but I had to tell him THAT could not happen And about the school she asked I half thought he might get it He WON T said the doctor I m in a position to know that Now try to take some rest Kate waved toward the babies Will you please take them away until they need me she asked Of course said the doctor But don t you want to see them Kate There isn t a mark or blemish on either of them The boy weighs seven pounds and the girl six they seem as perfect as children can be You needn t worry about that said Kate Twins are a Bates habit My mother had three pairs always a boy and a girl always big and sound as any children mine will be all right too The doctor started to turn back the blanket Kate turned her head away Don t you think I have had about enough at present she asked I d stake my life that as a little further piece of my punishment the girl looks exactly like missus Holt By Jove said the doctor I couldn t just think who it was He carried the babies from the room lowered the blinds and Kate tried to sleep and did sleep because she was so exhausted she could not keep awake Later in the evening Aunt Ollie slipped in and said George was in the woodhouse almost crying himself to death and begging to see her You tell him I m too sick to be seen for at least a week said Kate But my dear he s so broken up he feels so badly begged Aunt Ollie So do I said Kate I feel entirely too badly to be worried over seeing him I must take the babies now I do wish you would persisted Aunt Ollie Well I won t said Kate I don t care if I never see him again He knows WHY he is crying ask him I ll wager they ain t a word of truth in that tale they re telling she said Kate looked straight at her Well for their sakes and my sake and the babies sake don t TALK about it You poor thing said Aunt Ollie I ll do anything in the world to help you If ever you need me just call on me I ll go start him back in a hurry He came every night but Kate steadily refused until she felt able to sit up in a chair to see him or his mother when she came to see the babies She had recovered rapidly was over the painful part of nursing the babies and had a long talk with Aunt Ollie before she consented to see George At times she thought she never could see him again at others she realized her helplessness She had her babies to nurse for a year there was nothing she could think of she knew to do that she could do and take proper care of two children She was tied hand and foot as Aunt Ollie said And yet it was Aunt Ollie who solved her problem for her Sitting beside the bed one day she said to Kate My dear do you know that I m having a mighty good time I guess I was lonesomer than I thought out there all alone so much and the work was nigh to breaking me during the long cold winter I got a big notion to propose somepin to you that might be a comfort to all of us Propose away said Kate I m at my wit s end Well what would you think of you and George taking the land working it on the shares and letting me have this room an live in Walden awhile Kate sat straight up in bed Oh Aunt Ollie Would you she cried Would you That would be a mercy to me it would give George every chance to go straight if there is a straight impulse in him Yes I will said Aunt Ollie and you needn t feel that I am getting the little end of the bargain either The only unpleasant thing about it will be my sister and I ll undertake to manage her I read a lot an I can always come to see you when mortal sperrits will bear her no more She ll be no such trial to me as she is to you You re an angel said Kate You ve given me hope where I had not a glimmer If I have George out there alone away from his mother I can bring out all the good there is in him and we can get some results out of life or I can assure myself that it is impossible so that I can quit with a clear conscience I do thank you All right then I ll go out and begin packing my things and see about moving this afternoon I ll leave my stoves and beds and tables and chairs for you you can use your wedding things and be downright comfortable I ll like living in town a spell real well So once more Kate saw hope a beckoning star in the distance and ruffled the wings of the spirit preparatory to another flight only a short humble flight this time close earth but still as full of promise as life seemed to hold in any direction for her She greeted George casually and as if nothing had happened when she was ready to see him You re at the place where words are not of the slightest use to me she said I m giving you one and a final chance to ACT This seems all that is open to us Go to work like a man and we will see what we can make of our last chance Kate was so glad when she sat in the carriage that was to take her from the house and the woman she abominated that she could scarcely behave properly She clasped Adam tightly in her arms and felt truly his mother She reached over and tucked the blanket closer over Polly but she did not carry her because she resembled her grandmother while Adam was a Bates George drove carefully He was on behaviour too good to last but fortunately both women with him knew him well enough not to expect that it would When they came in sight of the house Kate could see that the grass beside the road had been cut the trees trimmed and Oh joy the house freshly painted a soft creamy white she liked with a green roof Aunt Ollie explained that she furnished the paint and George did the work He had swung oblong clothes baskets from the ceiling of a big cheery old fashioned bedroom for a cradle for each baby and established himself in a small back room adjoining the kitchen Kate said nothing about the arrangement because she supposed it had been made to give her more room and that George might sleep in peace while she wrestled with two tiny babies There was no doubt about the wrestling The babies seemed of nervous temperament sleeping in short naps and lightly Kate was on her feet from the time she reached her new home working when she should not have worked so that the result developed cross babies each attacked with the colic which raged every night from six o clock until twelve and after both frequently shrieking at the same time George did his share by going to town for a bottle of soothing syrup which Kate promptly threw in the creek Once he took Adam and began walking the floor with him extending his activities as far as the kitchen In a few minutes he had the little fellow sound asleep and he did not waken until morning then he seemed to droop and feel listless When he took the baby the second time and made the same trip to the kitchen Kate laid Polly on her bed and silently followed She saw George lay the baby on the table draw a flask from his pocket pour a spoon partly full filling it the remainder of the way from the teakettle As he was putting the spoon to the baby s lips Kate stepped beside him and taking it she tasted the contents Then she threw the spoon into the dishpan standing near and picked up the baby I knew it she said Only I didn t know what He acted like a drugged baby all last night and to day Since when did you begin carrying that stuff around with you and feeding it to tiny babies It s a good thing doctor James recommended it He said it was harmful to let them strain themselves crying and very hard on you You could save yourself a lot he urged I need saving all right said Kate but I haven t a picture of myself saving myself by drugging a pair of tiny babies He slipped the bottle back in his pocket Kate stood looking at him so long and so intently he flushed and set the flask on a shelf in the pantry It may come in handy some day when some of us have a cold he said Kate did her best but she was so weakened by nursing both of the babies by loss of sleep and overwork in the house that she was no help whatever to George in getting in the fall crops and preparing for spring She had lost none of her ambition but there was a limit to her capacity In the spring the babies were big and lusty eating her up and crying with hunger until she was forced to resort to artificial feeding in part which did not agree with either of them As a saving of time and trouble she decided to nurse one and feed the other It was without thought on her part almost by chance yet the chance was that she nursed Adam and fed Polly Then the babies began teething so that she was rushed to find time to prepare three regular meals a day and as for the garden and poultry she had planned George did what he pleased about them which was little if anything He would raise so much to keep from being hungry he would grow so many roots and so much cabbage for winter he would tend enough corn for a team and to fatten pork right there he stopped and went fishing while the flask was in evidence on the pantry shelf only two days Kate talked crop rotation new seed fertilization until she was weary George heartily agreed with her but put nothing of it all into practice As soon as the babies are old enough to be taken out she said things will be better I just can t do justice to them and my work too Three pairs My poor mother And she s alive yet I marvel at it So they lived and had enough to eat and were clothed but not one step did they advance toward Kate s ideals of progression economy accumulation George always had a little money more than she could see how he got from the farming There were a few calves and pigs to sell occasionally she thought possibly he saved his share from them For four years Kate struggled valiantly to keep pace with what her mother always had done and had required of her at home but she learned long before she quit struggling that farming with George was hopeless So at last she became so discouraged she began to drift into his way of doing merely what would sustain them and then reading fishing or sleeping the remainder of the time She began teaching her children while very small and daily they had their lessons after dinner while their father slept Kate thought often of what was happening to her she hated it she fought it but with George Holt for a partner she could not escape it She lay awake nights planning ways to make a start toward prosperity she propounded her ideas at breakfast To save time in getting him early to work she began feeding the horses as soon as she was up so that George could go to work immediately after breakfast but she soon found she might as well save her strength He would not start to harness until he had smoked mostly three quarters of an hour That his neighbours laughed at him and got ahead of him bothered him not at all All they said and all Kate said went as he expressed it in at one ear out at the other One day in going around the house Kate was suddenly confronted by a thing she might have seen for three years but had not noticed Leading from the path of bare hard beaten earth that ran around the house through the grass was a small forking path not so wide and well defined yet a path leading to George s window She stood staring at it a long time with a thoughtful expression on her face That night she did not go to bed when she went to her room Instead she slipped out into the night and sitting under a sheltering bush she watched that window It was only a short time until George crawled from it went stealthily to the barn and a few minutes later she saw him riding barebacked on one of the horses he had bridled down the footpath beside the stream toward town She got up and crossing the barnyard shut the gate after him and closed the barn door She went back to the house and closed his window and lighting a lamp set it on his dresser in front of his small clock His door was open in the morning when she passed it on her way to the kitchen so she got breakfast instead of feeding the horses He came in slowly furtively watching her She worked as usual saying no unpleasant word At length he could endure it no longer Kate he said I broke a bolt in the plow yesterday and I never thought of it until just as I was getting into bed so to save time I rode in to Walden and got another last night Ain t I a great old economist though You are a great something she said Economist would scarcely be my name for it Really George can t you do better than that Better than what he demanded Better than telling such palpable lies she said Better than crawling out windows instead of using your doors like a man better than being the most shiftless farmer of your neighbourhood in the daytime because you have spend most of your nights God and probably all Walden know how The flask and ready money I never could understand give me an inkling Anything else he asked sneeringly Nothing at present said Kate placidly I probably could find plenty if I spent even one night in Walden when you thought I was asleep Go if you like he said If you think I m going to stay here working like a dog all day year in and year out to support a daughter of the richest man in the county and her kids you fool yourself If you want more than you got call on your rich folks for it If you want to go to town either night or day go for all I care Do what you damn please that s what I am going to do in the future and I m glad you know it I m tired climbing through windows and slinking like a dog I ll come and go like other men after this I don t know what other men you are referring to said Kate You have a monopoly of your kind in this neighbourhood there is none other like you You crawl and slink as to the manner born Don t you go too far he menaced with an ugly leer Keep that for your mother laughed Kate You need never try a threat with me I am stronger than you are and you may depend upon it I shall see that my strength never fails me again I know now that you are all Nancy Ellen said you were Well if you married me knowing it what are you going to do about it he sneered I didn t know it then I thought I knew you I thought she had been misinformed said Kate in self defence Well he said insultingly if you hadn t been in such a big hurry you could soon have found out all you wanted to know I took advantage of it but I never did understand your rush You never will said Kate Then she arose and went to see if the children had wakened All day she was thinking so deeply she would stumble over the chairs in her preoccupation George noticed it and it frightened him After supper he came and sat on the porch beside her Kate he said as usual you are making mountains out of mole hills It doesn t damn a fellow forever to ride or walk I almost always walk into town in the evening to see the papers and have a little visit with the boys Work all day in a field is mighty lonesome a man has got the have a little change I don t deny a glass of beer once in awhile or a game of cards with the boys occasionally but if you have lived with me over five years here and never suspected it before it can t be so desperately bad can it Come now be fair It s no difference whether I am fair or unfair Kate said wearily It explains why you simply will not brace up and be a real man and do a man s work in the world and achieve a man s success Who can get anywhere splitting everything in halves he demanded The most successful men in this neighbourhood got their start exactly that way she said Ah well farming ain t my job anyway he said I always did hate it I always will If I could have a little capital to start with I know a trick that would suit you and make us independent in no time Kate said no word and seeing she was not going to he continued I ve thought about this till I ve got it all down fine and it s a great scheme you ll admit that even angry as you are It is this get enough together to build a saw mill on my strip of ravine A little damming would make a free water power worth a fortune I could hire a good man to run the saw and do the work and I could take a horse and ride or drive around among the farmers I know and buy up timber cheaper than most men could get it I could just skin the eyes out of them Did it ever occur to you that you could do better by being honest asked Kate wearily Aw well Smarty you know I didn t mean that literally he scoffed You know I only meant I could talk and jolly and buy at bed rock prices I know where to get the timber and the two best mill men in the country we are near the railroad it s the dandiest scheme that ever struck Walden What do you think about it I think if Adam had it he d be rich from it in ten years she said quietly Then you DO think it s a bully idea he cried You WOULD try it if we had a chance I might said Kate You know he cried jumping up in excitement I ve never mentioned this to a soul but I ve got it all thought out Would you go to see your brother Adam and see if you could get him to take an interest for young Adam He could manage the money himself I wouldn t go to a relative of mine for a cent even if the children were starving said Kate Get and keep THAT clear in your head But you think there is something in it he persisted I know there is said Kate with finality In the hands of the right man and with the capital to start Kate you can be the meanest he said I didn t intend to be in this particular instance she said But honestly George what have I ever seen of you in the way of financial success in the past that would give me hope for the future I know it he said but I ve never struck exactly the right thing This is what I could make a success of and I would make a good big one you bet Kate I ll not go to town another night I ll stop all that He drew the flask from his pocket and smashed it against the closest tree And I ll stop all there ever was of that even to a glass of beer on a hot day if you say so if you ll stand by me this once more if I fail this time I ll never ask you again honest I won t If I had money I d try it keeping the building in my own name and keeping the books myself but I ve none and no way to get any as you know she said I can see what could be done but I m helpless I M NOT said George I ve got it all worked out You see I was doing something useful with my head if I wasn t always plowing as fast as you thought I should If you ll back me if you ll keep books if you ll handle the money until she is paid back I know Aunt Ollie will sell enough of this land to build the mill and buy the machinery She could keep the house and orchard and barn and a big enough piece say forty acres to live on and keep all of us in grub She and Mother could move out here she said the other day she was tired of town and getting homesick and we could go to town to put the children in school and be on the job I won t ever ask you and Mother to live together again Kate will you go in with me Will you talk to Aunt Ollie Will you let me show you and explain and prove to you I won t be a party to anything that would even remotely threaten to lose Aunt Ollie s money for her she said She s got nobody on earth but me It s all mine in the end Why not let me have this wonderful chance with it Kate will you he begged I ll think about it she conceded If I can study out a sure honourable way I ll promise to think Now go out there and hunt the last scrap of that glass the children may cut their feet in the morning Then Kate went in to bed If she had looked from her window she might have seen George scratching matches and picking pieces of glass from the grass When he came to the bottom of the bottle with upstanding jagged edges containing a few drops he glanced at her room saw that she was undressing in the dark and lifting it he poured the liquid on his tongue to the last drop that would fall CHAPTER XVI THE WORK OF THE SUN BEFORE Kate awakened the following morning George was out feeding the horses cattle and chickens doing the milking and working like the proverbial beaver By the time breakfast was ready he had convinced himself that he was a very exemplary man while he expected Kate to be convinced also He stood ready and willing to forgive her for every mean deceit and secret sin he ever had committed or had it in his heart to commit in the future All the world was rosy with him he was flying with the wings of hope straight toward a wonderful achievement that would bring pleasure and riches first to George Holt then to his wife and children then to the old aunt he really cared more for than any one else Incidentally his mother might have some share while he would bring such prosperity and activity to the village that all Walden would forget every bad thing it had ever thought or known of him and delight to pay him honour Kate might have guessed all this when she saw the pails full of milk on the table and heard George whistling Hail the Conquering Hero Comes as he turned the cows into the pasture but she had not slept well Most of the night she had lain staring at the ceiling her brain busy with calculations computations most of all with personal values She dared not be a party to anything that would lose Aunt Ollie her land that was settled but if she went into the venture herself if she kept the deeds in Aunt Ollie s name the bank account in hers drew all the checks kept the books would it be safe Could George buy timber as he thought could she herself if he failed The children were old enough to be in school now she could have much of the day she could soon train Polly and Adam to do even more than sweep and run errands the scheme could be materialized in the Bates way without a doubt but could it be done in a Bates way hampered and impeded by George Holt Was the plan feasible after all She entered into the rosy cloud enveloping the kitchen without ever catching the faintest gleam of its hue George came to her the instant he saw her and tried to put his arm around her Kate drew back and looked at him intently Aw come on now Kate he said Leave out the heroics and be human I ll do exactly as you say about everything if you will help me wheedle Aunt Ollie into letting me have the money Kate stepped back and put out her hands defensively A rare bargain she said and one eminently worthy of you You ll do what I say if I ll do what you say without the slightest reference as to whether it impoverishes a woman who has always helped and befriended you You make me sick What s biting you now he demanded sullenly Kate stood tall and straight before and above him If you have a good plan if you can prove that it will work what is the necessity for wheedling anybody Why not state what you propose in plain unequivocal terms and let the dear old soul who has done so much for us already decide what she will do That s what I meant That s all I meant he cried In that case wheedle is a queer word to use I believe you d throw up the whole thing I believe you d let the chance to be a rich woman slip through your fingers if it all depended on your saying only one word you thought wasn t quite straight he cried half in assertion half in question I honour you in that belief said Kate I most certainly would Then you turn the whole thing down You won t have anything to do with it he cried plunging into stoop shouldered mouth sagging despair Oh I didn t SAY that said Kate Give me time Let me think I ve got to know that there isn t a snare in it from the title of the land to the grade of the creek bed Have you investigated that Is your ravine long enough and wide enough to dam it high enough at our outlet to get your power and yet not back water on the road and the farmers above you Won t it freeze in winter and can you get strong enough power from water to run a large saw I doubt it Oh gee I never thought about that he cried And if it would work did you figure the cost of a dam into your estimate of the building and machinery He snapped his fingers in impatience By heck he cried I forgot THAT too But that wouldn t cost much Look what we did in that ravine just for fun Why we could build that dam ourselves Yes strong enough for conditions in September but what about the January freshet she said Croak Croak You blame old raven cried George And have you thought continued Kate that there is no room on the bank toward town to set your mill and it wouldn t be allowed there if there were You bet I have he said defiantly I m no such slouch as you think me I ve even stepped off the location Then said Kate will you build a bridge across the ravine to reach it or will you buy a strip from Linn and build a road George collapsed with a groan That s the trouble with you said Kate You always build your castle with not even sand for a foundation The most nebulous of rosy clouds serve you as perfectly as granite blocks Before you go glimmering again double your estimate to cover a dam and a bridge and a lot of incidentals that no one ever seems able to include in a building contract And whatever you do keep a still head until we get these things figured and have some sane idea of what the venture would cost How long will it take he said sullenly I haven t an idea I d have to go the Hartley and examine the records and be sure that there was no flaw in the deeds to the land but the first thing is to get a surveyor and know for sure if you have a water power that will work and not infringe on your neighbours A thing like this can t be done in a few minutes persuasive conversation It will take weeks It really seemed as if it would take months Kate went to Walden that afternoon set the children playing in the ravine while she sketched it made the best estimate she could of its fall and approved the curve on the opposite bank which George thought could be cleared for a building site and lumber yard Then she added a location for a dam and a bridge site and went home to figure and think The further she went in these processes the more hopeless the project seemed She soon learned that there must be an engine with a boiler to run the saw The dam could be used only to make a pond to furnish the water needed but at that it would be cheaper than to dig a cistern or well She would not even suggest to Aunt Ollie to sell any of the home forty The sale of the remainder at the most hopeful price she dared estimate would not bring half the money needed and it would come in long time payments Lumber bricks machinery could not be had on time of any length while wages were cash every Saturday night It simply can t be done said Kate and stopped thinking about it so far as George knew He was at once plunged into morose moping he became sullen and indifferent about the work ugly with Kate and the children until she was driven almost frantic and projects nearly as vague as some of George s began to float through her head One Saturday morning Kate had risen early and finished cleaning up her house baking and scrubbing porches She had taken a bath to freshen and cool herself and was standing before her dresser tucking the last pins in her hair when she heard a heavy step on the porch and a loud knock on the screen door She stood at an angle where she could peep she looked as she reached for her dress What she saw carried her to the door forgetful of the dress Adam junior stood there white and shaken steadying himself against the casing Adam cried Kate Is Mother He shook his head Father she panted He nodded seeming unable to speak Kate s eyes darkened and widened She gave Adam another glance and opened the door Come in she said When did it happen How did he get hurt In that moment she recalled that she had left her father in perfect health she had been gone more than seven years In that time he could not fail to illness how he had been hurt was her first thought As she asked the question she stepped into her room and snatched up her second best summer dress waiting for Adam to speak as she slipped into it But speaking seemed to be a very difficult thing for Adam He was slow in starting and words dragged and came singly Yesterday tired big dinner awful hot sunstroke He s gone she cried Adam nodded in that queer way again Why did you come Does Mother want me the questions leaped from Kate s lips her eyes implored him Adam was too stricken to heed his sister s unspoken plea Course he said All there your place I want you Only one in the family not stark mad Kate straightened tensely and looked at him again All right she said I can throw a few things in my telescope write the children a note to take to their father in the field and we can stop in Walden and send Aunt Ollie out to cook for them I can go as well as not for as long as Mother wants me Hurry said Adam In her room Kate stood still a second her eyes narrow her underlip sucked in her heart almost stopped Then she said aloud Father s sons have wished he would die too long for his death to strike even the most tolerant of them like that Something dreadful has happened I wonder to my soul She waited until they were past Hartley and then she asked suddenly Adam what is the matter Then Adam spoke I am one of a pack of seven poor fools and every other girl in the family has gone raving mad so I thought I d come after you and see if you had sense or reason or justice left in you What do you want of me she asked dazedly I want you to be fair to be honest to do as you d be done by You came to me when you were in trouble he reminded her Kate could not prevent the short laugh that sprang to her lips nor what she said And you would not lift a finger young Adam MADE his MOTHER help me Why don t you go to George for what you want Adam lost all self control and swore sulphurously I thought you d be different he said but I see you are going to be just like the rest of the Stop that said Kate You re talking about my sisters and yours Stop this wild talk and tell me exactly what is the matter I m telling nothing said Adam You can find out what is the matter and go it with the rest of them when you get there Mother said this morning she wished you were there because you d be the only SANE one in the family so I thought I d bring you but I wish now I hadn t done it for it stands to reason that you will join the pack and run as fast as the rest of the wolves FROM a prairie fire or TO a carcass asked Kate I told you you could find out when you got there I m not going to have them saying I influenced you or bribed you he said Do you really think that they think you could Adam asked Kate wonderingly I have said all I m going to say said Adam and then he began driving his horse inhumanely fast for the heat was deep slow and burning Adam is there any such hurry asked Kate You know you are abusing your horse dreadfully Adam immediately jerked the horse with all his might and slashed the length of its body with two long stripes that rapidly raised in high welts so Kate saw that he was past reasoning with and said no other word She tried to think who would be at home how they would treat her the Prodigal who had not been there in seven years and suddenly it occurred to Kate that if she had known all she now knew in her youth and had the same decision to make again as when she knew nothing she would have taken wing just as she had She had made failures she had hurt herself mind and body but her honour her self respect were intact Suddenly she sat straight She was glad that she had taken a bath worn a reasonably decent dress and had a better one in the back of the buggy She would cut the Gordian knot with a vengeance She would not wait to see how they treated her she would treat them As for Adam s state there was only one surmise she could make and that seemed so incredible she decided to wait until her mother told her all about whatever the trouble was As they came in sight of the house queer feelings took possession of Kate She struggled to think kindly of her father she tried to feel pangs of grief over his passing She was too forthright and had too good memory to succeed Home had been so unbearable that she had taken desperate measures to escape it but as the white house with its tree and shrub filled yard could be seen more plainly Kate suddenly was filled with the strongest possessive feeling she ever had known It was home It was her home Her place was there even as Adam had said She felt a sudden revulsion against herself that she had stayed away seven years she should have taken her chances and at least gone to see her mother She leaned from the buggy and watched for the first glimpse of the tall gaunt dark woman who had brought their big brood into the world and stood squarely with her husband against every one of them in each thing he proposed Now he was gone No doubt he had carried out his intentions No doubt she was standing by him as always Kate gathered her skirts but Adam passed the house driving furiously as ever and he only slackened speed when he was forced to at the turn from the road to the lane He stopped the buggy in the barnyard got out and began unharnessing the horse Kate sat still and watched him until he led it away then she stepped down and started across the barnyard down the lane leading to the dooryard As she closed the yard gate and rounded a widely spreading snowball bush her heart was pounding wildly What was coming How would the other boys act if Adam the best balanced man of them all was behaving as he was How would her mother greet her With the thought Kate realized that she was so homesick for her mother that she would do or give anything in the world to see her Then there was a dragging step a short sharp breath and wheeling Kate stood facing her mother She had come from the potato patch back of the orchard carrying a pail of potatoes in each hand Her face was haggard her eyes bloodshot her hair falling in dark tags her cheeks red with exertion They stood facing each other At the first glimpse Kate cried Oh Mother and sprang toward her Then she stopped while her heart again failed her for from the astonishment on her mother s face Kate saw instantly that she was surprised and had neither sent for nor expected her She was nauseatingly disappointed Adam had said she was wanted had been sent for Kate s face was twitching her lips quivering but she did not hesitate more than an instant I see you were not expecting me she said I m sorry Adam came after me I wouldn t have come if he hadn t said you sent for me Kate paused a minute hopefully Her mother looked at her steadily I m sorry Kate repeated I don t know why he said that By that time the pain in her heart was so fierce she caught her breath sharply and pressed her hand hard against her side Her mother stooped set down the buckets and taking off her sunbonnet wiped the sweat from her lined face with the curtain Well I do she said tersely Why demanded Kate To see if he could use you to serve his own interests of course answered her mother He lied good and hard when he said I sent for you I didn t I probably wouldn t a had the sense to do it But since you are here I don t mind telling you that I never was so glad to see any one in all my born days missus Bates drew herself full height set her lips stiffened her jaw and again used the bonnet skirt on her face and neck Kate picked up the potatoes to hide the big tears that gushed from her eyes and leading the way toward the house she said Come over here in the shade Why should you be out digging potatoes Oh they s enough here and willing enough said missus Bates Slipped off to get away from them It was the quietest and the peacefullest out there Kate I d most liked to stay all day but it s getting on to dinner time and I m short of potatoes Never mind the potatoes said Kate Let the folks serve themselves if they are hungry She went to the side of the smoke house picked up a bench turned up there and carrying it to the shady side of a widely spreading privet bush she placed it where it would be best screened from both house and barn Then setting the potatoes in the shade she went to her mother put her arm around her and drew her to the seat She took her handkerchief and wiped her face smoothed back her straggled hair and pulling out a pin fastened the coil better Now rest a bit she said and then tell me why you are glad to see me and exactly what you d like me to do here Mind I ve been away seven years and Adam told me not a word except that Father was gone Humph All missed the mark again commented missus Bates dryly They all said he d gone to fill you up and get you on his side Mother what is the trouble asked Kate Take your time and tell me what has happened and what YOU want not what Adam wants missus Bates relaxed her body a trifle but gripped her hands tightly together in her lap Well it was quick work she said It all came yesterday afternoon just like being hit by lightning Pa hadn t failed a particle that any one could see Ate a big dinner of ham an boiled dumplings an him an Hiram was in the west field It was scorchin hot an first Hiram saw Pa was down Sam Langley was passin an helped get him in an took our horse an ran for Robert He was in the country but Sam brought another doctor real quick an he seemed to fetch Pa out of it in good shape so we thought he d be all right mebby by morning though the doctor said he d have to hole up a day or two He went away promisin to send Robert back and Hiram went home to feed I set by Pa fanning him an putting cloths on his head All at once he began to chill We thought it was only the way a body was with sunstroke and past pilin on blankets we didn t pay much attention He SAID he was all right so I went to milk Before I left I gave him a drink an he asked me to feel in his pants pocket an get the key an hand him the deed box till he d see if everything was right Said he guessed he d had a close call You know how he was I got him the box and went to do the evening work I hurried fast as I could Coming back clear acrost the yard I smelt burning wool an I dropped the milk an ran I dunno no more about just what happened an you do The house was full of smoke Pa was on the floor most to the sitting room door his head and hair and hands awfully burned his shirt burned off laying face down and clear gone The minute I seen the way he laid I knew he was gone The bed was pourin smoke and one little blaze about six inches high was shootin up to the top I got that out and then I saw most of the fire was smothered between the blankets where he d thrown them back to get out of the bed I dunno why he fooled with the lamp It always stood on the little table in his reach but it was light enough to read fine print All I can figure is that the light was going out of his EYES an he thought IT WAS GETTIN DARK so he tried to light the lamp to see the deeds He was fingerin them when I left but he didn t say he couldn t see them The lamp was just on the bare edge of the table the wick way up an blackened the chimney smashed on the floor the bed afire Those deeds are burned gasped Kate All of them Are they all gone Every last one said missus Bates Well if ONE is gone thank God they all are said Kate Her mother turned swiftly and caught her arm Say that again she cried eagerly Maybe I m WRONG about it but it s what I think said Kate If the boys are crazy over all of them being gone they d do murder if part had theirs and the others had not missus Bates doubled over on Kate s shoulder suddenly and struggled with an inward spasm You poor thing said Kate This is dreadful All of us know how you loved him how you worked together Can you think of anything I can do Is there any special thing the matter I m afraid whispered missus Bates Oh Katie I m so afraid You know how SET he was you know how he worked himself and all of us he had to know what he was doing when he fought the fire till the shirt burned off him her voice dropped to a harsh whisper what do you s pose he s doing now Any form of religious belief was a subject that never had been touched upon or talked of in the Bates family Money was their God work their religion Kate looked at her mother curiously You mean you believe in after life she asked Why I suppose there must be SOMETHING she said I think so myself said Kate I always have I think there is a God and that Father is facing Him now and finding out for the first time in his experience that he is very small potatoes and what he planned and slaved for amounted to nothing in the scheme of the universe I can t imagine Father being subdued by anything on earth but it appeals to me that he will cut a pathetic figure before the throne of an Almighty God A slow grin twisted missus Bates lips Well wherever he went she said I guess he found out pretty quick that he was some place at last where he couldn t be boss I m very sure he has said Kate and I am equally sure the discipline will be good for him But his sons His precious sons What are they doing Taking it according to their bent said missus Bates Adam is insane Hiram is crying Have you had a lawyer asked Kate What for We all know the law on this subject better than we know our a b c s Did your deed for this place go too asked Kate Yes said missus Bates but mine was recorded none of the others were I get a third and the rest will be cut up and divided share and share alike among ALL OF YOU equally I think it s going to kill Adam and ruin Andrew It won t do either But this is awful I can see how the boys feel and really Mother this is no more fair to them than things always have been for the girls By the way what are they doing Same as the boys acting out their natures Mary is openly rejoicing So is Nancy Ellen Hannah and Bertha at least can see the boys side The others say one thing before the boys and another among themselves In the end the girls will have their shares and nobody can blame them I don t myself but I think Pa will rise from his grave when those farms are torn up Don t worry said Kate He will have learned by now that graves are merely incidental and that he has no option on real estate where he is Leave him to his harp and tell me what you want done I want you to see that it was all accidental I want you to take care of me I want you should think out the FAIR thing for all of us to DO I want you to keep sane and cool headed and shame the others into behaving themselves And I want you to smash down hard on their everlasting why didn t you do this and why didn t you do that I reckon I ve been told five hundred times a ready that I shouldn t a give him the deeds Josie say it an then she sings it NOT GIVE THEM TO HIM How could I help giving them to him He d a got up and got them himself if I hadn t You have cut out something of a job for me said Kate but I ll do my best Anyway I can take care of you Come on into the house now and let me clean you up and then I ll talk the rest of them into reason if you stand back of me and let them see I m acting for you You go ahead said missus Bates I ll back whatever you say But keep them off of me Keep them off of me After Kate had bathed her mother helped her into fresh clothes and brushed her hair she coaxed her to lie down and by diplomatic talk and stroking her head finally soothed her to sleep Then she went down and announced the fact asked them all to be quiet and began making her way from group to group in an effort to restore mental balance and sanity After Kate had invited all of them to go home and stay until time for the funeral Sunday morning and all of them had emphatically declined and eagerly had gone on straining the situation to the breaking point Kate gave up and began setting the table When any of them tried to talk or argue with her she said conclusively I shall not say one word about this until Monday Then we will talk things over and find where we stand and what Mother wants This would be much easier for all of us if you d all go home and calm down and plan out what you think would be the fair and just thing to do Before evening Kate was back exactly where she left off for when missus Bates came downstairs her nerves quieted by her long sleep she asked Kate what would be best about each question that arose while Kate answered as nearly for all of them as her judgment and common sense dictated but she gave the answer in her own way and she paved the way by making a short sharp speech when the first person said in her hearing that Mother never should have given him the deeds Not one of them said that again while at Kate s suggestion mentally and on scraps of paper every single one of them figured that one third of sixteen hundred and fifty was five hundred and fifty subtracted from sixteen hundred and fifty this left one thousand one hundred which divided by sixteen gave sixty eight and three fourths This result gave Josie the hysterics strong and capable though she was made Hiram violently ill so that he resorted to garden palings for a support while Agatha used her influence suddenly and took Adam junior home As she came to Kate to say that they were going Agatha was white as possible her thin lips compressed a red spot burning on either cheek Adam and I shall take our departure now Katherine she said standing very stiffly her head held higher than Kate ever had thought it could be lifted Kate put her arm around her sister in law and gave her a hearty hug Tell Adam I ll do what I think is fair and just and use all the influence I have to get the others to do the same she said Fruitless said Agatha Fruitless Reason and justice have departed from this abode I shall hasten my pace and take Adam where my influence is paramount The state of affairs here is deplorable perfectly deplorable I shall not be missed and I shall leave my male offspring to take the place of his poor defrauded father Adam threed was now a tall handsome young man of twenty two quite as fond of Kate as ever He wiped the dishes and when the evening work was finished they talked with missus Bates until they knew her every wish The children had planned for a funeral from the church because it was large enough to seat the family and friends in comfort but when they mentioned this to missus Bates she delivered an ultimatum on the instant You ll do no such thing she cried Pa never went to that church living I ll not sanction his being carried there feet first when he s helpless And we ll not scandalize the neighbours by fighting over money on Sunday either You ll all come Monday morning if you want anything to say about this If you don t I ll put through the business in short order I m sick to my soul of the whole thing I ll wash my hands of it as quick as possible So the families all went to their homes Kate helped her mother to bed and then she and Adam threed tried to plan what would be best for the morrow afterward they sat down and figured until almost dawn There s no faintest possibility of pleasing everyone said Kate The level best we can do is to devise some scheme whereby everyone will come as nearly being satisfied as possible Can Aunt Josie and Aunt Mary keep from fighting across the grave asked Adam Only Heaven knows said Kate CHAPTER XVII THE BANNER HAND SUNDAY morning Kate arose early and had the house clean and everything ready when the first carriage load drove into the barnyard As she helped her mother to dress missus Bates again evidenced a rebellious spirit Nancy Ellen had slipped upstairs and sewed fine white ruching in the neck and sleeves of her mother s best dress her only dress in fact aside from the calicoes she worked in Kate combed her mother s hair and drew it in loose waves across her temples As she produced the dress missus Bates drew back What did you stick them gew gaws onto my dress for she demanded I didn t said Kate Oh it was Nancy Ellen Well I don t see why she wanted to make a laughing stock of me said missus Bates She didn t said Kate Everyone is wearing ruching now she wanted her mother to have what the best of them have Humph said missus Bates Well I reckon I can stand it until noon but it s going to be a hot dose Haven t you a thin black dress Mother asked Kate No said missus Bates I haven t but you can make a pretty safe bet that I will have one before I start anywhere again in such weather as this That s the proper spirit said Kate There comes Andrew Let me put your bonnet on She set the fine black bonnet Nancy Ellen had bought on missus Bates head at the proper angle and tied the long wide silk ribbon beneath her chin missus Bates sat in martyr like resignation Kate was pleased with her mother s appearance Look in the mirror she said See what a handsome lady you are I ain t seen in a looking glass since I don t know when said missus Bates Why should I begin now Chances are at you have rigged me up until I ll set the neighbours laughing or else to saying that I didn t wait until the breath was out of Pa s body to begin primping Nonsense Mother said Kate Nobody will say or think anything Everyone will recognize Nancy Ellen s fine Spencerian hand in that bonnet and ruching Now for your veil missus Bates arose from her chair and stepped back There there Katie she said You ve gone far enough I ll be sweat to a lather in this dress I ll wear the head riggin because I ve go to or set the neighbours talkin how mean Pa was not to let me have a bonnet and between the two I d rather they d take it out on me than on him She steadied herself by the chair back and looked Kate in the eyes Pa was always the banner hand to boss everything she said He was so big and strong and so all fired sure he was right I never contraried him in the start so before I knowed it I was waiting for him to say what to do and then agreeing with him even when I knowed he was WRONG So goin we got along FINE but it give me an awful smothered feeling at times Kate stood looking at her mother intently her brain racing for she was thinking to herself Good Lord She means that to preserve the appearance of self respect she systematically agreed with him whether she thought he was right or wrong because she was not able to hold her own against him Nearly fifty years of life like that Kate tossed the heavy black crepe veil back on the bed Mother she said here alone and between us if I promise never to tell a living soul will you tell me the truth about that deed business missus Bates seemed so agitated Kate added I mean how it started If you thought it was right and a fair thing to do Yes I ll tell you that said missus Bates It was not fair and I saw it I saw it good and plenty There was no use to fight him that would only a drove him to record them but I was sick of it an I told him so Kate was pinning her hat I have planned for you to walk with Adam she said Well you can just change THAT plan so far as I am concerned said missus Bates with finality I ain t a goin with Adam Somebody had told him about the deeds before he got here He came in ravin and he talked to me something terrible He was the first to say I shouldn t a give Pa the box NOT GIVE IT TO HIM An he went farther than that till I just rose up an called him down proper but I ain t feelin good at him an I ain t goin with him I am goin with you I want somebody with me that understands me and feels a little for me an I want the neighbours to see that the minute I m boss such a fine girl as you has her rightful place in her home I ll go with you or I ll sit down on this chair and sit here But you didn t send for me said Kate No I hadn t quite got round to it yet but I was coming I d told all of them that you were the only one in the lot who had any sense and I d said I WISHED you were here and as I see it I d a sent for you yesterday afternoon about three o clock I was coming to it fast I didn t feel just like standing up for myself but I d took about all fault finding it was in me to bear Just about three o clock I d a sent for you Katie sure as God made little apples All right then said Kate but if you don t tell them they ll always say I took the lead Well they got to say something said missus Bates Most of em would die if they had to keep their mouths shut awhile but I ll tell them fast enough Then she led the way downstairs There were enough members of the immediate family to pack the front rooms of the house the neighbours filled the dining room and dooryard The church choir sang a hymn in front of the house the minister stood on the front steps and read a chapter and told where mister Bates had been born married the size of his family and possessions said he was a good father an honest neighbour and very sensibly left his future with his God Then the choir sang again and all started to their conveyances As the breaking up began outside missus Bates arose and stepped to the foot of the casket She steadied herself by it and said Some time back I promised Pa that if he went before I did at this time in his funeral ceremony I would set his black tin box on the foot of his coffin and unlock before all of you and in the order in which they lay beginning with Adam junior hand each of you boys the deed Pa had made you for the land you live on You all know WHAT happened None of you know just HOW It wouldn t bring the deeds BACK if you did They re gone But I want you boys to follow your father to his grave with nothing in your hearts against HIM He was all for the men I don t ever want to hear any of you criticize him about this or me either He did his best to make you upstanding men in your community his one failing being that he liked being an upstanding man himself so well that he carried it too far but his intentions was the best As for me I d no idea how sick he was and nobody else did I minded him just like all the rest of you always did the BOYS especially From the church I want all of you to go home until to morrow morning and then I want my sons and daughters by BIRTH only to come here and we ll talk things over quietly QUIETLY mind you and decide what to do Katie will you come with me It was not quite a tearless funeral Some of the daughters in law wept from nervous excitement and some of the little children cried with fear but there were no tears from the wife of Adam Bates or his sons and daughters And when he was left to the mercies of time all of them followed missus Bates orders except Nancy Ellen and Robert who stopped to help Kate with the dinner Kate slipped into her second dress and went to work missus Bates untied her bonnet strings and unfastened her dress neck as they started home She unbuttoned her waist going up the back walk and pulled it off at the door Well if I ever put that thing on in July again she said you can use my head for a knock maul Nancy Ellen can t you stop at a store as you come out in the morning and get the goods and you girls run me up a dress that is nice enough to go out in and not so hot it starts me burning before my time Of course I can said Nancy Ellen About what do you want to pay Mother Whatever it takes to get a decent and a cool dress cool mind you said missus Bates an any colour but black Why Mother cried Nancy Ellen it must be black No said missus Bates Pa kept me in black all my life on the supposition it showed the dirt the least There s nothing in that It shows dirt worse an white I got my fill of black You can get a nice cool gray if you want me to wear it Well I never said Nancy Ellen What will the neighbours say What do I care asked missus Bates They ve talked about me all my life I d be kinda lonesome if they s to quit Dinner over Kate proposed that her mother should lie down while they washed the dishes I would like a little rest said missus Bates I guess I ll go upstairs You ll do nothing of the kind said Kate It s dreadfully hot up there Go in the spare room where it is cool we ll keep quiet I am going to stay Tuesday until I move you in there anyway It s smaller but it s big enough for one and you ll feel much better there Oh Katie I m so glad you thought of that cried missus Bates I been thinking and thinking about it and it just seems as if I can t ever steel myself to go into that room to sleep again I ll never enter that door that I don t see You ll never enter it again as your room said Kate I ll fix you up before I go and Sally Whistler told me last evening she would come and make her home with you if you wanted her You like Sally don t you Yes I like her fine said missus Bates Quietly as possible the girls washed the dishes pulled down the blinds closed the front door and slipped down in the orchard with Robert to talk things over Nancy Ellen was stiffly reserved with Kate but she WOULD speak when she was spoken to which was so much better than silence that Kate was happy over it Robert was himself Kate thought she had never liked him so well He seemed to grow even kinder and more considerate as the years passed Nancy Ellen was prettier than Kate ever had seen her but there was a line of discontent around her mouth and she spoke pettishly on slight provocation or none at all Now she was openly brazenly brutally frank in her rejoicing She thought it was the best JOKE that ever happened to the boys and she said so repeatedly Kate found her lips closing more tightly and a slight feeling of revulsion growing in her heart Surely in Nancy Ellen s lovely home cared for and shielded in every way she had no such need of money as Kate had herself She was delighted when Nancy Ellen said she was sleepy and was going to the living room lounge for a nap Then Kate produced her sheet of figures She and Robert talked the situation over and carefully figured on how an adjustment fair to all could be made until they were called to supper After supper Nancy Ellen and Robert went home while Kate and her mother sat on the back porch and talked until Kate had a clear understanding and a definite plan in her mind which was that much improvement over wearing herself out in bitter revilings or selfish rejoicing over her brothers misfortune Her mother listened to all she had to say asked a question occasionally objected to some things and suggested others They arose when they had covered every contingency they could think of and went upstairs to bed even though the downstairs was cooler As she undressed missus Bates said slowly Now in the morning I ll speak my piece first and I ll say it pretty plain I got the whip hand here for once in my life They can t rave and fight here and insult me again as they did Friday night and Saturday till you got here an shut em up I won t stand it that s flat I ll tell em so and that you speak for me because you can figure faster and express yourself plainer but insist that there be no fussing an I ll back you I don t know just what life has been doing to you Katie but Lord it has made a fine woman of you Kate set her lips in an even line and said nothing but her heart was the gladdest it had been in years Her mother continued Seems like Nancy Ellen had all the chance Most folks thought she was a lot the purtiest to start with though I can t say that I ever saw so much difference She s had leisure an pettin and her husband has made a mint o money she s gone all over the country with him and the more chance she has the narrower she grows and the more discontenteder One thing she is awful disappointed about havin no children I pity her about that Is it because she s a twin asked Kate I m afraid so said missus Bates You can t tell much about those things they just seem to happen Robert and Nancy Ellen feel awful bad about it Still she might do for others what she would for her own The Lord knows there are enough mighty nice children in the world who need mothering I want to see your children Katie Are they nice little folks straight and good looking The boy is said Kate The girl is good with the exception of being the most stubborn child I ve ever seen She looks so much like a woman it almost sickens me to think of that I have to drive myself to do her justice What a pity said missus Bates slowly Oh they are healthy happy youngsters said Kate They get as much as we ever did and don t expect any more I have yet to see a demonstrative Bates Humph said missus Bates Well you ought to been here Friday night and I thought Adam came precious near it Saturday Demonstrating power or anger yes said Kate I meant affection And isn t it the queerest thing how people are made Of all the boys Adam is the one who has had the most softening influences and who has made the most money and yet he s acting the worst of all It really seems as if failure and hardship make more of a human being of folks than success You re right said missus Bates Look at Nancy Ellen and Adam Sometimes I think Adam has been pretty much galled with Agatha and her money all these years and it just drives him crazy to think of having still less than she has Have you got your figures all set down to back you up Katie Yes said Kate I ve gone all over it with Robert and he thinks it s the best and only thing that can be done Now go to sleep Each knew that the other was awake most of the night but very few words passed between them They were up early dressed and waiting when the first carriage stopped at the gate Kate told her mother to stay where she would not be worried until she was needed and went down herself to meet her brothers and sisters in the big living room When the last one arrived she called her mother missus Bates came down looking hollow eyed haggard and grim as none of her children ever before had seen her She walked directly to the little table at the end of the room and while still standing she said Now I ve got a few words to say and then I ll turn this over to a younger head an one better at figures than mine I ve said my say as to Pa yesterday Now I ll say THIS for myself I got my start minding Pa and agreeing with him young but you needn t any of you throw it in my teeth now that I did There is only ONE woman among you and no MAN who ever disobeyed him Katie stood up to him once and got seven years from home to punish her and me He wasn t RIGHT then and I knew it as I d often known it before and pretty often since but no woman God ever made could have lived with Adam Bates as his wife and contraried him I didn t mind him any quicker or any oftener than the rest of you keep that pretty clear in your heads and don t one of you dare open your mouth again to tell me as you did Saturday what I SHOULD a done and what I SHOULDN T I ve had the law of this explained to me you all know it for that matter By the law I get this place and one third of all the other land and money I don t know just what money there is at the bank or in notes and mortgages but a sixteenth of it after my third is taken out ain t going to make or break any of you I ve told Katie what I m willing to do on my part and she will explain it and then tell you about a plan she has fixed up As for me you can take it or leave it If you take it well and good if you don t the law will be set in motion to day and it will take its course to the end It all depends on YOU Now two things more At the start what Pa wanted to do seemed to me right and I agreed with him and worked with him But when my girls began to grow up and I saw how they felt and how they struggled and worked and how the women you boys married went ahead of my own girls and had finer homes an carriages and easier times I got pretty sick of it and I told Pa so more n once He just raved whenever I did an he always carried his keys in his pocket I never touched his chest key in my life till I handed him his deed box Friday afternoon But I agree with my girls It s fair and right since things have come out as they have that they should have their shares I would too The other thing is just this I m tired to death of the whole business I want peace and rest and I want it quick Friday and Saturday I was so scared and so knocked out I s pose I d a took it if one of the sucking babies had riz up and commenced to tell me what I should a done and what I shouldn t I m THROUGH with that You will all keep civil tongues in your heads this morning or I ll get up and go upstairs an lock myself in a room till you re gone an if I go it will mean that the law takes its course and if it does there will be three hundred acres less land to divide You ve had Pa on your hands all your lives now you will go civil and you will go easy or you will get a taste of Ma I take no more talk from anybody Katie go ahead with your figures Kate spread her sheet on the table and glanced around the room The Milton County records show sixteen hundred and fifty acres standing in Father s name she said Of these Mother is heir to five hundred and fifty acres leaving one thousand one hundred acres to be divided among sixteen of us which give sixty eight and three fourths acres to each This land is the finest that proper fertilization and careful handling can make Even the poorest is the cream of the country as compared with the surrounding farms As a basis of estimate I have taken one hundred dollars an acre as a fair selling figure Some is worth more some less but that is a good average This would make the share of each of us in cash that could easily be realized six thousand eight hundred and seventy five dollars Whatever else is in mortgages notes and money can be collected as it is due deposited in some bank and when it is all in divided equally among us after deducting Mother s third Now this is the law and those are the figures but I shall venture to say that none of us feel RIGHT about it or ever will An emphatic murmur of approval ran among the boys Mary and Nancy Ellen stoutly declared that they did Oh no you don t said Kate If God made any woman of you so that she feels right and clean in her conscience about this deal he made her WRONG and that is a thing that has not yet been proven of God As I see it here is the boys side from childhood they were told bribed and urged to miss holidays work all week and often on Sunday to push and slave on the promise of this land at twenty one They all got the land and money to stock it and build homes They were told it was theirs required to pay the taxes on it and also to labour at any time and without wages for Father Not one of the boys but has done several hundred dollars worth of work on Father s farm for nothing to keep him satisfied and to insure getting his deed All these years each man has paid his taxes put thousands in improvements in rebuilding homes and barns fertilizing and developing his land Each one of these farms is worth nearly twice what it was the day it was received That the boys should lose all this is no cause for rejoicing on the part of any true woman as a fact no true woman would allow such a thing to happen Speak for yourself cried several of the girls at once Now right here is where we come to a perfect understanding said Kate I did say that for myself but in the main what I say I say for MOTHER Now you will not one of you interrupt me again or this meeting closes and each of you stands to lose more than two thousand dollars which is worth being civil for for quite a while No more of that I say any woman should be ashamed to take advantage of her brother through an accident and rob him of years of work and money he was perfectly justified in thinking was his I for one refuse to do it and I want and need money probably more than any of you To tear up these farms to take more than half from the boys is too much On the other hand for the girls to help earn the land to go with no inheritance at all is even more unfair Now in order to arrive at a compromise that will leave each boy his farm and give each girl the nearest possible to a fair amount figuring in what the boys have spent in taxes and work for Father and what each girl has LOST by not having her money to handle all these years it is necessary to split the difference between the time Adam the eldest has had his inheritance and Hiram the youngest came into possession which by taking from and adding to gives a fair average of fifteen years Now Mother proposes if we will enter into an agreement this morning with no words and no wrangling to settle on this basis she will relinquish her third of all other land and keep only this home farm She even will allow the fifty lying across the road to be sold and the money put into a general fund for the share of the girls She will turn into this fund all money from notes and mortgages and the sale of all stock implements et cetera here except what she wants to keep for her use and the sum of three thousand dollars in cash to provide against old age This releases quite a sum of money and three hundred and fifty acres of land which she gives to the boys to start this fund as her recompense for their work and loss through a scheme in which she had a share in the start She does this only on the understanding that the boys form a pool and in some way take from what they have saved sell timber or cattle or borrow enough money to add to this sufficient to pay to each girl six thousand dollars in cash in three months Now get out your pencils and figure Start with the original number of acres at fifty dollars an acre which is what it cost Father on an average Balance against each other what the boys have lost in tax and work and the girls have lost in not having their money to handle and cross it off Then figure not on a basis of what the boys have made this land worth but on what it cost Father s estate to buy build on and stock each farm Strike the fifteen year average on prices and profits Figure that the girls get all their money practically immediately to pay for the time they have been out of it while each boy assumes an equal share of the indebtedness required to finish out the six thousand after Mother has turned in what she is willing to if this is settled HERE AND NOW Then I understand said Mary that if we take under the law each of us is entitled to sixty eight and three quarter acres and if we take under Mother s proposition we are entitled to eighty seven and a half acres No no E A said Kate the old nickname for Exceptional Ability slipping out before she thought No no Not so You take sixty eight and three quarters under the law Mother s proposition is made ONLY to the boys and only on condition that they settle here and now because she feels responsible to them for her share in rearing them and starting them out as she did By accepting her proposition you lose eight hundred and seventy five dollars approximately The boys lose on the same basis figuring at fifty dollars and acre six thousand five hundred and sixty two dollars and fifty cents plus their work and taxes and minus what Mother will turn in which will be about let me see It will take a pool of fifty four thousand dollars to pay each of us six thousand If Mother raises thirty five thousand plus sale money and notes it will leave about nineteen thousand for the boys which will divide up at nearly two thousand five hundred for them to lose as against less than a thousand for us That should be enough to square matters with any right minded woman even in our positions It will give us that much cash in hand it will leave the boys some of the younger ones in debt for years if they hold their land What more do you want I want the last cent that is coming to me said Mary I thought you would said Kate Yet you have the best home and the most money of any of the girls living on farms I settle under this proposition because it is fair and just and what Mother wants done If she feels that this is defrauding the girls any she can arrange to leave what she has to us at her death which would more than square matters in our favour You hold on there Katie said missus Bates You re going too fast I ll get what s coming to me and hang on to it awhile before I decide which way the cat jumps I reckon you ll all admit that in mothering the sixteen of you doing my share indoors and out and living with PA for all these years I ve earned it I ll not tie myself up in any way I ll do just what I please with mine Figure in all I ve told you to for the rest let be I beg your pardon said Kate You re right of course I ll sign this and I shall expect every sister I have to do the same quickly and cheerfully as the best way out of a bad business that has hurt all of us for years and then I shall expect the boys to follow like men It s the fairest decentest thing we can do let s get it over Kate picked up the pen handed it to her mother signed afterward herself and then carried it to each of her sisters leaving Nancy Ellen and Mary until last All of them signed up to Nancy Ellen She hesitated and she whispered to Kate Did Robert Kate nodded Nancy Ellen thought deeply a minute and then said slowly I guess it is the quickest and best we can do So she signed Mary hesitated longer but finally added her name Kate passed on to the boys beginning with Adam Slowly he wrote his name and as he handed back the paper he said Thank you Kate I believe it s the sanest thing we can do I can make it easier than the younger boys Then HELP them said Kate tersely passing on Each boy signed in turn all of them pleased with the chance It was so much better than they had hoped that it was a great relief which most of them admitted so they followed Adam s example in thanking Kate for all of them knew that in her brain had originated the scheme which seemed to make the best of their troubles Then they sat closer and talked things over calmly and dispassionately It was agreed that Adam and his mother should drive to Hartley the following afternoon and arrange for him to take out papers of administration for her and start the adjustment of affairs They all went home thinking more of each other and Kate especially than ever before missus Bates got dinner while Kate and Nancy Ellen went to work on the cool gray dress so that it would be ready for the next afternoon While her mother was away Kate cleaned the spare bedroom and moved her mother s possessions into it She made it as convenient and comfortable and as pretty as she could but the house was bare to austerity so that her attempt at prettifying was rather a failure Then she opened the closed room and cleaned it after studying it most carefully as it stood The longer she worked the stronger became a conviction that was slowly working its way into her brain When she could do no more she packed her telescope installed Sally Whistler in her father s room and rode to Hartley with a neighbour From there she took the Wednesday hack for Walden CHAPTER XVIII KATE TAKES THE BIT IN HER TEETH THE hackman was obliging for after delivering the mail and some parcels he took Kate to her home While she waited for him she walked the ravine bank planning about the mill which was now so sure that she might almost begin work Surely she might as soon as she finished figuring for she had visited the Court House in Hartley and found that George s deeds were legal and in proper shape Her mind was filled with plans which this time must succeed As she approached the house she could see the children playing in the yard It was the first time she ever had been away from them she wondered if they had missed her She was amazed to find that they were very decidedly disappointed to see her but a few pertinent questions developed the reason Their grandmother had come with her sister she had spent her time teaching them that their mother was cold and hard and abused them by not treating them as other children were treated So far as Kate could see they had broken every rule she had ever laid down for them eaten until their stomachs were out of order and played in their better clothing until it never would be nice again while Polly shouted at her approach Give ME the oranges and candy I want to divide them Silly said Kate This is too soon I ve no money yet it will be a long time before I get any but you shall each have an orange some candy and new clothing when I do Now run see what big fish you can catch Satisfied the children obeyed and ran to the creek Aunt Ollie worried and angered told Adam to tell his father that Mother was home and for him to come and take her and grandmother to Walden at once She had not been able to keep missus Holt from one steady round of mischief but she argued that her sister could do less with her on guard than alone so she had stayed and done her best but she knew how Kate would be annoyed so she believed the best course was to leave as quickly as possible Kate walked into the house spoke to both women and went to her room to change her clothing Before she had finished she heard George s voice in the house demanding Where s our millionaire lady I want a look at her Kate was very tired slowly relaxing from intense nerve strain she was holding herself in check about the children She took a tighter grip and vowed she would not give missus Holt the satisfaction of seeing her disturbed and provoked if she killed herself in the effort at self control She stepped toward the door Here she called in a clear voice the tone of which brought George swiftly What was he worth anyway he shouted Oh millions and millions said Kate sweetly at least I THINK so It was scarcely a time to discuss finances in the face of that horrible accident George laughed Oh you re a good one he cried Think you can keep a thing like that still The cats and the dogs and the chickens of the whole county know about the deeds the old Land King had made for his sons and how he got left on it Served him right too We could here Andrew swear and see Adam beat his horse clear over here That s right Go ahead Put on airs Tell us something we don t KNOW will you Maybe you think I wasn t hanging pretty close around that neighbourhood myself Spying cried Kate Looking for timber he sneered And never in all my life have I seen anything to beat it Sixteen hundred and fifty acres of the best land in the world Your share of land and money together will be every cent of twelve thousand Oh I guess I know what you ve got up your sleeve my lady Come on shell out Let s all go celebrate What did you bring the children Kate was rapidly losing patience in spite of her resolves Myself she said From their appearance and actions goodness knows they needed me I have been to my father s funeral George not to a circus Humph said George And home for the first time in seven years You needn t tell me it wasn t the biggest picnic you ever had And say about those deeds burning up wasn t that too grand Even if my father burned with them she asked George you make me completely disgusted Big hypocrite he scoffed You know you re tickled silly Why you will get ten times as much as you would if those deeds hadn t burned I know what that estate amounts to I know what that land is worth I ll see that you get your share to the last penny that can be wrung out of it You bet I will Things are coming our way at last Now we can build the mill and do everything we planned I don t know as we will build a mill With your fifteen thousand we could start a store in Hartley and do bigger things The thing for you to do right now is to hitch up and take Aunt Ollie and your mother home said Kate I ll talk to you after supper and tell you all there is to know I m dusty and tired now Well you needn t try to fix up any shenanigan for me he said I know to within five hundred dollars of what your share of that estate is worth and I ll see that you get it No one has even remotely suggested that I shouldn t have my share of that estate said Kate While he was gone Kate thought intently as she went about her work She saw exactly what her position was and what she had to do Their talk would be disagreeable but the matter had to gone into and gotten over She let George talk as he would while she finished supper and they ate When he went for his evening work she helped the children scale their fish for breakfast and as they worked she talked to them sanely sensibly explaining what she could avoiding what she could not She put them to bed her heart almost sickened at what they had been taught and told Kate was in no very propitious mood for her interview with George As she sat on the front porch waiting for him she was wishing with all her heart that she was back home with the children to remain forever That of course was out of the question but she wished it She had been so glad to be with her mother again to be of service to hear a word of approval now and then She must be worthy of her mother s opinion she thought just as George stepped on the porch sat on the top step leaned against a pillar and said Now go on tell me all about it Kate thought intently a second Instead of beginning with leaving Friday morning I was at the Court House in Hartley this morning she said You needn t have done that he scoffed I spent most of the day there Monday You bet folks shelled out the books when I told them who I was and what I was after I must say you folks have some little reason to be high and mighty You sure have got the dough No wonder the old man hung on to his deeds himself He wasn t so FAR from a King all right all right You mean you left your work Monday and went to the Court House in Hartley and told who you were and spent the day nosing into my father s affairs before his SONS had done anything or you had any idea WHAT was to be done she demanded Oh you needn t get so high and mighty he said I propose to know just where I am about this I propose to have just what is coming to me to you to the last penny and no Bates man will manage the affair either Suddenly Kate leaned forward I foresee that you ve fixed yourself up for a big disappointment she said My mother and her eldest son will settle my father s estate and when it is settled I shall have exactly what the other girls have Then if I still think it is wise I shall at once go to work building the mill Everything must be shaved to the last cent must be done with the closest economy I MUST come out of this with enough left to provide us a comfortable home Do that from the first profits of the mill he suggested I m no good at counting chickens before they re hatched said Kate Besides the first profits from the mill as you very well know if you would ever stop to think must go to pay for logs to work on and there must always be a good balance for that purpose No I reserve enough from my money to fix the home I want but I shall wait to do it until the mill is working so I can give all my attention to it while you are out looking up timber Of course I can do all of it perfectly well he said And it s a MAN S business You ll make me look like fifty cents if you get out among men and go to doing a thing no woman in this part of the country ever did Why it will look like you didn t TRUST me I can t help how it will look said Kate This is my last and only dollar if I lose it I am out for life I shall take no risk I ve no confidence in your business ability and you know it It need not hurt your pride a particle to say that we are partners that I m going to build the mill while you re going to bring in the timber It s the only way I shall touch the proposition I will give you two hundred dollars for the deed and abstract of the ravine I ll give your mother eight hundred for the lot and house which is two hundred more than it is worth I ll lay away enough to rebuild and refurnish it and with the remainder I ll build the dam bridge and mill just as quickly as it can be done As soon as I get my money we ll buy timber for the mill and get it sawed and dried this winter We can be all done and running by next June Kate how are you going to get all that land sold and the money in hand to divide up that quickly I don t think it ever can be done Land is always sold on time you know he said Kate drew a deep breath THIS land isn t going to be sold she said Most of the boys have owned their farms long enough to have enabled them to buy other land and put money in the bank They re going to form a pool and put in enough money to pay the girls the share they have agreed to take even if they have to borrow it as some of the younger ones will but the older ones will help them so the girls are to have their money in cash in three months I was mighty glad of the arrangement for my part because we can begin at once on our plans for the mill And how much do the girls get he asked darkly Can t say just yet said Kate The notes and mortgages have to be gone over and the thing figured out it will take some time Mother and Adam began yesterday we shall know in a few weeks Sounds to me like a cold blooded Bates steal he cried Who figured out what WAS a fair share for the girls who planned that arrangement Why didn t you insist on the thing going through court the land belong sold and equal divisions of all the proceeds Now if you ll agree not to say a word until I finish I ll show you the figures said Kate I ll tell you what the plan is and why it was made and I ll tell you further that it is already recorded and in action There are no minor heirs We could make an agreement and record it There was no will Mother will administer It s all settled Wait until I get the figures Then slowly and clearly she went over the situation explaining everything in detail When she finished he sat staring at her with a snarling face You signed that he demanded You signed that YOU THREW AWAY AT LEAST HALF YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD You let those lazy scoundrels of brothers of yours hoodwink you and pull the wool over your eyes like that Are you mad Are you stark staring mad No I m quite sane said Kate It is you who are mad You know my figures don t you Those were the only ones used yesterday The whole scheme was mine with help from Mother to the extent of her giving up everything except the home farm You crazy fool he cried springing up Now stop said Kate Stop right there I ve done what I think is right and fair and just and I m happy with the results Act decently I ll stay and build the mill Say one only one more of the nasty insulting things in your head and I ll go in there and wake up the children and we will leave now and on foot Confronted with Kate and her ultimatum George arose and walked down to the road he began pacing back and forth in the moonlight struggling to regain command of himself He had no money He had no prospect of any until Aunt Ollie died and left him her farm He was as he expressed it up against it there Now he was up against it with Kate What she decided upon and proposed to do was all he could do She might shave prices and cut and skimp and haggle to buy material and put up her building at the least possible expense She might sit over books and figure herself blind He would be driving over the country visiting with the farmers booming himself for a fat county office maybe eating big dinners and being a jolly good fellow generally Naturally as breathing there came to him a scheme whereby he could buy at the very lowest figure he could extract then he would raise the price to Kate enough to make him a comfortable income besides his share of the business He had not walked the road long until his anger was all gone He began planning the kind of horse he would have to drive the buggy he would want and a box in it to carry a hatchet a square measures an auger other tools he would need and by Jove it would be a dandy idea to carry a bottle of the real thing Many a farmer for a good cigar and a few swallows of the right thing would warm up and sign such a contract as could be got in no other manner while he would need it on cold days himself George stopped in the moonlight to slap his leg and laugh over the happy thought By George Georgie my boy he said most days will be cold won t they He had no word to say to Kate of his change of feeling in the matter He did not want to miss the chance of twitting her at every opportunity he could invent with having thrown away half her inheritance but he was glad the whole thing was settled so quickly and easily He was now busy planning how he would spend the money Kate agreed to pay him for the ravine but that was another rosy cloud she soon changed in colour for she told him if he was going to be a partner he could put in what money he had as his time was no more valuable than she could make hers teaching school again in other words he could buy his horse and buggy with the price she paid for the location so he was forced to agree He was forced to do a great many things in the following months that he hated but he had to do them or be left out of the proposition altogether missus Bates and Adam administered the Bates estate promptly and efficiently The girls had their money on time the boys adjusted themselves as their circumstances admitted missus Bates had to make so many trips to town before the last paper was signed and the last transfer was made that she felt she could not go any farther so she did not Nancy Ellen had reached the point where she would stop and talk a few minutes to Kate if she met her on the streets of Hartley as she frequently did now but she would not ask her to come home with her because she would not bring herself in contact with George Holt The day Kate went to Hartley to receive and deposit her check and start her bank account her mother asked her if she had any plan as to what she would do with her money Kate told her in detail missus Bates listened with grim face You better leave it in the bank she said and use the interest to help you live or put it in good farm mortgages where you can easily get ten per cent Kate explained again and told how she was doing all the buying how she would pay all bills and keep the books It was no use missus Bates sternly insisted that she should do no such thing In some way she would be defrauded In some way she would lose the money What she was proposing was a man s work Kate had most of her contracts signed and much material ordered she could not stop Sadly she saw her mother turn from her declaring as she went that Kate would lose every cent she had and when she did she need not come hanging around her She had been warned If she lost she could take the consequences For an instant Kate felt that she could not endure it then she sprang after her mother Oh but I won t lose she cried I m keeping my money in my own hands I m spending it myself Please Mother come and see the location and let me show you everything Too late now said missus Bates grimly the thing is done The time to have told me was before you made any contracts You re always taking the bit in your teeth and going ahead Well go But remember as you make your bed so you can lie All right said Kate trying to force a laugh Don t you worry Next time you get into a tight place and want to borrow a few hundreds come to me missus Bates laughed derisively Kate turned away with a faint sickness in her heart and when half an hour later she met Nancy Ellen fresh from an interview with her mother she felt no better far worse in fact for Nancy Ellen certainly could say what was in her mind with free and forceful directness With deft tongue and nimble brain she embroidered all missus Bates had said and prophesied more evil luck in three minutes than her mother could have thought of in a year Kate left them with no promise of seeing either of them again except by accident her heart and brain filled with misgivings Must I always have a fly in my ointment she wailed to herself I thought this morning this would be the happiest day of my life I felt as if I were flying Ye Gods but wings were never meant for me Every time I take them down I come kerflop mostly in a gulf of dark despair as the hymn book says Anyway I ll keep my promise and give the youngsters a treat So she bought each of them an orange some candy and goods for a new Sunday outfit and comfortable school clothing Then she took the hack for Walden feeling in a degree as she had the day she married George Holt As she passed the ravine and again studied the location her spirits arose It WAS a good scheme It would work She would work it She would sell from the yards to Walden and the surrounding country She would see the dealers in Hartley and talk the business over so she would know she was not being cheated in freight rates when she came to shipping She stopped at missus Holt s laid a deed before her for her signature and offered her a check for eight hundred for the Holt house and lot which missus Holt eagerly accepted They arranged to move immediately as the children were missing school She had a deed with her for the ravine which George signed in Walden and both documents were acknowledged but she would not give him the money until he had the horse and buggy he was to use at the gate in the spring He wanted to start out buying at once but that was going too far in the future for Kate While the stream was low and the banks firm Kate built her dam so that it would be ready for spring put in the abutments and built the bridge It was not a large dam and not a big bridge but both were solid well constructed and would serve every purpose Then Kate set men hauling stone for the corner foundations She hoped to work up such a trade and buy so much and so wisely in the summer that she could run all winter so she was building a real mill in the Bates way which way included letting the foundations freeze and settle over winter That really was an interesting and a comfortable winter Kate and George both watched the children s studies at night worked their plans finer in the daytime and lived as cheaply and carefully as they could Everything was going well George was doing his best to promote the mill plan to keep Kate satisfied at home to steal out after she slept and keep himself satisfied in appetite and some ready money in his pockets won at games of chance at which he was an expert and at cards which he handled like a master CHAPTER XIX AS A MAN SOWETH AT THE earliest possible moment in the spring the building of the mill began It was scarcely well under way when the work was stopped by a week of heavy rains The water filled the ravine to dangerous height and the roaring of the dam could be heard all over town George talked of it incessantly He said it was the sweetest music his ears had ever heard Kate had to confess that she like the sound herself but she was fearful over saying much on the subject because she was so very anxious about the stability of the dam There was a day or two of fine weather then the rains began again Kate said she had all the music she desired she proposed to be safe so she went and opened the sluiceway to reduce the pressure on the dam The result was almost immediate The water gushed through lowering the current and lessening the fall George grumbled all day threatening half a dozen times to shut the sluice but Kate and the carpenter were against him so he waited until he came slipping home after midnight his brain in a muddle from drink smoke and cards As he neared the dam he decided that the reason he felt so badly was because he had missed hearing it all day but he would have it to go to sleep by So he crossed the bridge and shut the sluice gate Even as he was doing it the thunder pealed lightning flashed and high Heaven gave him warning that he was doing a dangerous thing but all his life he had done what he pleased there was no probability that he would change then He needed the roar of the dam to quiet his nerves The same roar that put him to sleep awakened Kate She lay wondering at it and fearing She raised her window to listen The rain was falling in torrents while the roar was awful so much worse than it had been when she fell asleep that she had a suspicion of what might have caused it She went to George s room and shook him awake Listen to the dam she cried It will go as sure as fate George did you Oh did you close the sluice gate when you came home He was half asleep and too defiant from drink to take his usual course Sure he said Sweesish mushich ever hearsh Push me shleep He fell back on the pillow and went on sleeping Kate tried again to waken him but he struck at her savagely She ran to her room hurried into a few clothes and getting the lantern started toward the bridge At the gate she stepped into water As far as she could see above the dam the street was covered She waded to the bridge which was under at each end but still bare in the middle where it was slightly higher Kate crossed it and started down the yard toward the dam The earth was softer there and she mired in places almost to her knees At the dam the water was tearing around each end in a mad race carrying earth and everything before it The mill side was lower than the street The current was so broad and deep she could not see where the sluice was She hesitated a second to try to locate it from the mill behind her and in that instant there was a crack and a roar a mighty rush that swept her from her feet and washed away the lantern Nothing saved her but the trees on the bank She struck one clung to it pulled herself higher and in the blackness gripped the tree while she heard the dam going gradually after the first break There was no use to scream no one could have heard her The storm raved on Kate clung to her tree with each flash of lightning trying to see the dam At last she saw that it was not all gone She was not much concerned about herself She knew the tree would hold Eagerly she strained her eyes toward the dam She could feel the water dropping lower while the roar subsided to a wild rush and with flashes of lightning she could see what she thought was at least half of the dam holding firm By that time Kate began to chill She wrapped her arms around the tree and pressing her cheek against the rough bark she cried as hard as she could and did not care God would not hear the neighbours could not She shook and cried until she was worn out By that time the water was only a muddy flow around her ankles if she had a light she could wade back to the bridge and reach home But if she missed the bridge and went into the ravine the current would be too strong for her She held with one arm and tried to wipe her face with the other hand What a fool to cry she said As if there were any more water needed here Then she saw a light in the house and the figures of the children carrying it from room to room so she knew that one of them had awakened for a drink or with the storm and they had missed her Then she could see them at the front door Adam s sturdy feet planted widely apart bracing him as he held up the lamp which flickered in the wind Then she could hear his voice shouting Mother Instantly Kate answered Then she was sorry she had for both of them began to scream wildly There was a second of that then even the children realized its futility She is out there in the water WE GOT TO GET HER said Adam We got to do it He started with the light held high The wind blew it out They had to go back to relight it Kate knew they would burn their fingers and she prayed they would not set the house on fire When the light showed again at the top of her lungs she screamed Adam set the broom on fire and carry it to the end of the bridge the water isn t deep enough to hurt you She tried twice then she saw him give Polly the lamp and run down the hall He came back in an instant with the broom Polly held the lamp high Adam went down the walk to the gate and started up the sidewalk He s using his head said Kate to the tree He s going to wait until he reaches the bridge to start his light so it will last longer THAT is BATES anyway Thank God Adam scratched several matches before he got the broom well ignited then he held it high and by its light found the end of the bridge Kate called to him to stop and plunging and splashing through mud and water she reached the bridge before the broom burned out There she clung to the railing she had insisted upon and felt her way across to the boy His thin cotton night shirt was plastered to his sturdy little body As she touched him Kate lifted him in her arms and almost hugged the life from him You big man she said You could help Mother Good for you Is the dam gone he asked Part of it said Kate sliding her feet before her as she waded toward Polly in the doorway Did Father shut the sluice gate to hear the roar Kate hesitated The shivering body in her arms felt so small to her I spect he did said Adam All day he was fussing after you stopped the roar Then he added casually The old fool ought a known better I spect he was drunk again Oh Adam cried Kate setting him on the porch Oh Adam What makes you say that Oh all of them at school say that scoffed Adam Everybody knows it but you don t they Polly Sure said Polly Most every night but don t you mind Mother Adam and I will take care of you Kate fell on her knees and gathered both of them in a crushing hug for an instant then she helped them into to dry nightgowns and to bed As she covered them she stooped and kissed each of them before she went to warm and put on dry clothes and dry her hair It was almost dawn when she walked to George Holt s door and looked in at him lying stretched in deep sleep You may thank your God for your children she said If it hadn t been for them I know what I would have done to you Then she went to her room and lay down to rest until dawn She was up at the usual time and had breakfast ready for the children As they were starting to school George came into the room Mother said Polly there is a lot of folks over around the dam What shall we tell them Kate s heart stopped She had heard that question before Tell them the truth said Adam scornfully before Kate could answer Tell them that Mother opened the sluiceway to save the dam and Father shut it to hear it roar and it busted Shall I Mother asked Polly A slow whiteness spread over George s face he stared down the hall to look Tell them exactly what you please said Kate only you watch yourself like a hawk If you tell one word not the way it was or in any way different from what happened I ll punish you severely May I tell them I held the lamp while Adam got you out of the water asked Polly That would be true you know George turned to listen his face still whiter Yes that would be true said Kate but if you tell them that the first thing they will ask will be where was your father What will you say then Why we ll say that he was so drunk we couldn t wake him up said Polly conclusively We pulled him an we shook him an we yelled at him Didn t we Adam I was not drunk shouted George Oh yes you were said Adam You smelled all sour like it does at the saloon door George made a rush at Adam The boy spread his feet and put up his hands but never flinched or moved Kate looking on felt something in her heart that never had been there before She caught George s arm as he reached the child You go on to school little folks she said And for Mother s sake try not to talk at all If people question you tell them to ask Mother I d be so proud of you if you would do that I WILL if you ll hold me and kiss me again like you did last night when you got out of the water said Polly It is a bargain said Kate How about you Adam I will for THAT too said Adam but I d like awful well to tell how fast the water went and how it poured and roared while I held the light and you got across Gee if was awful Mother So black and so crashy and so deep I d LIKE to tell But you WON T if I ask you not to queried Kate I will not said Adam Kate went down on her knees again she held out her arms and both youngsters rushed to her After they were gone she and George Holt looked at each other an instant then Kate turned to her work He followed Kate he began No use said Kate If you go out and look at the highest water mark you can easily imagine what I had to face last night when I had to cross the bridge to open the sluice gate or the bridge would have gone too If the children had not wakened with the storm and hunted me I d have had to stay over there until morning if I could have clung to the tree that long First they rescued me and then they rescued YOU if you only but knew it By using part of the money I had saved for the house I can rebuild the dam but I am done with you We re partners no longer Not with business money or in any other way will I ever trust you again Sit down there and eat your breakfast and then leave my sight Instead George put on his old clothing crossed the bridge and worked all day with all his might trying to gather building material out of the water save debris from the dam to clear the village street At noon he came over and got a drink and a piece of bread At night he worked until he could see no longer and then ate some food from the cupboard and went to bed He was up and at work before daybreak in the morning and for two weeks he kept this up until he had done much to repair the work of the storm The dam he almost rebuilt himself as soon as the water lowered to normal again Kate knew what he was trying to do and knew also that in a month he had the village pitying him and blaming her because he was working himself to death and she was allowing it She doggedly went on with her work the contracts were made she was forced to As the work neared completion her faith in the enterprise grew She studied by the hour everything she could find pertaining to the business When the machinery began to arrive George frequently spoke about having timber ready to begin work on but he never really believed the thing which did happen would happen until the first load of logs slowly crossed the bridge and began unloading in the yards A few questions elicited from the driver the reply that he had sold the timber to young Adam Bates of Bates Corners who was out buying right and left and paying cash on condition the seller did his own delivering George saw the scheme and that it was good Also the logs were good while the price was less than he hoped to pay for such timber His soul was filled with bitterness The mill was his scheme He had planned it all Those thieving Bates had stolen his plan and his location and his home and practically separated him from his wife and children It was his mill and all he was getting from it was to work with all his might and not a decent word from morning until night That day instead of working as before he sat in the shade most of the time and that night instead of going to bed he went down town When the mill was almost finished Kate employed two men who lived in Walden but had been working in the Hartley mills for years They were honest men of much experience Kate made the better of them foreman and consulted with him in every step of completing the mill and setting up the machinery She watched everything with sharp eyes often making suggestions that were useful about the placing of different parts as a woman would arrange them Some of these the men laughed at some they were more than glad to accept When the engine was set up the big saw in place George went to Kate See here he said roughly I know I was wrong about the sluice gate I was a fool to shut it with the water that high but I ve learned my lesson I ll never touch it again I ve worked like a dog for weeks to pay for it now where do I come in What s my job how much is my share of the money and when do I get it The trouble with you George is that you have to learn a new lesson about every thing you attempt You can t carry a lesson about one thing in your mind and apply it to the next thing that comes up I know you have worked and I know why It is fair that you should have something but I can t say what just now Having to rebuild the dam and with a number of incidentals that have come up in spite of the best figuring I could do I have been forced to use my money saved for rebuilding the house and even with that I am coming out a hundred or two short I m strapped and until money begins to come in I have none myself The first must go toward paying the men s wages the next for timber If Jim Milton can find work for you go to work at the mill and when we get started I ll pay you what is fair and just you may depend on that If he hasn t work for you you ll have to find a job at something else Do you mean that he asked wonderingly I mean it said Kate After stealing my plan and getting my land for nothing you d throw me out entirely he demanded You entreated me to put all I had into your plan you told me repeatedly the ravine was worth nothing you were not even keeping up the taxes on it until I came and urged you to the dam is used merely for water the engine furnishes the real power and if you are thrown out you have thrown yourself out You have had every chance You are going to keep your nephew on the buying job he asked I am said Kate You can have no job that will give you a chance to involve me financially Then give me Milton s place It s so easy a baby could do it and the wages you have promised him are scandalous said George Kate laughed Oh George she said you can t mean that Of all your hare brained ideas that you could operate that saw is the wildest Oh course you could start the engine and set the saw running I could myself but to regulate its speed to control it with judgment you could no more do it than Polly As for wages Milton is working for less than he got in Hartley because he can be at home and save his hack fare as you know George went over to Jim Milton and after doing all he could see to do and ordering Milton to do several things he thought might be done he said casually Of course I am BOSS around this shack but this is new to me You fellows will have to tell me what to do until I get my bearings As soon as we get to running I ll be yard master and manage the selling and shipping I m good at figures and that would be the best place for me You ll have to settle with missus Holt about that said Jim Milton Of course said George Isn t she a wonder With my help we ll soon wipe the Hartley mills off the map and be selling till Grand Rapids will get her eye peeled With you to run the machinery me to manage the sales and her to keep the books we got a combination to beat the world In the meantime said Jim Milton dryly you might take that scoop shovel and clean the shavings and blocks off this floor Leave me some before the engine to start the first fire and shovel the rest into that bin there where it s handy It isn t safe to start with so much loose dry stuff lying around George went to work with the scoop shovel but he watched every movement Jim Milton made about the engine and machinery Often he dropped the shovel and stood studying things out for himself and asking questions Not being sure of his position Jim Milton answered him patiently and showed him all he wanted to know but he constantly cautioned him not to touch anything or try to start the machinery himself as he might lose control of the gauge and break the saw or let the power run away with him George scoffed at the idea of danger and laughed at the simplicity of the engine and machinery There was little for him to do He hated to be seen cleaning up the debris men who stopped in passing kept telling what a fine fellow young Bates was what good timber he was sending in Several of them told George frankly they thought that was to be his job He was so ashamed of that he began instant improvisation That was the way we first planned things he said boastfully but when it came to working out our plans we found I would be needed here till I learned the business and then I m going on the road I am going to be the salesman To travel dress well eat well flirt with the pretty girls and take big lumber orders will just about suit little old Georgie Wonder you remembered to put the orders in at all said Jim Milton dryly George glared at him Well just remember whom you take orders from he said pompously I take them from missus Holt and nobody else said Milton with equal assurance And I ve yet to hear her say the first word about this wonderful travelling proposition She thinks she will do well to fill home orders and ship to a couple of factories she already has contracts with Sure you didn t dream that travelling proposition George At that instant George wished he could slay Jim Milton All day he brooded and grew sullen and ugly By noon he quit working and went down town By suppertime he went home to prove to his wife that he was all right She happened to be coming across from the mill where she had helped Milton lay the first fire under the boiler ready to touch off and had seen the first log on the set carriage It had been agreed that she was to come over at opening time in the morning and start the machinery She was a proud and eager woman when she crossed the bridge and started down the street toward the gate From the opposite direction came George so unsteady that he was running into tree boxes then lifting his hat and apologizing to them for his awkwardness Kate saw at a glance that he might fall any instant Her only thought was to help him from the street to where children would not see him She went to him and taking his arm started down the walk with him He took off his hat to her also and walked with wavering dignity setting his steps as if his legs were not long enough to reach the walk so that each step ended with a decided thump Kate could see the neighbours watching at their windows and her own children playing on the roof of the woodshed When the children saw their parents they both stopped playing to stare at them Then suddenly shrill and high arose Adam s childish voice Father came home the other night Tried to blow out the lectric light Blew and blew with all his might And the blow almost killed Mother Polly joined him and they sang and shrilled and shrieked it they jumped up and down and laughed and repeated it again and again Kate guided George to his room and gave him a shove that landed him on his bed Then to hush the children she called them to supper They stopped suddenly as soon as they entered the kitchen door and sat sorry and ashamed while she went around her face white her lips closed preparing their food George was asleep The children ate alone as she could take no food Later she cleaned the kitchen put the children to bed and sat on the front porch looking at the mill wondering hoping planning praying unconsciously When she went to bed at ten o clock George was still asleep He awakened shortly after burning with heat and thirst He arose and slipped to the back porch for a drink Water was such an aggravation he crossed the yard went out the back gate and down the alley When he came back up the street he was pompously maliciously dangerously drunk Either less or more would have been better When he came in sight of the mill standing new and shining in the moonlight he was a lord of creation ready to work creation to his will He would go over and see if things were all right But he did not cross the bridge he went down the side street and entered the yard at the back The doors were closed and locked but there was as yet no latch on the sliding windows above the work bench He could push them open from the ground He leaned a board against the side of the mill set his foot on it and pulled himself up so that he could climb on the bench That much achieved he looked around him After a time his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness so that he could see his way plainly Muddled half thoughts began to filter through his brain He remembered he was abused He was out of it He remembered that he was not the buyer for the mill He remembered how the men had laughed when he had said that he was to be the salesman He remembered that Milton had said that he was not to touch the machinery He at once slid from the bench and went to the boiler He opened the door of the fire box and saw the kindling laid ready to light to get up steam He looked at the big log on the set carriage They had planned to start with a splurge in the morning Kate was to open the throttle that started the machinery He decided to show them that they were not so smart He would give them a good surprise by sawing the log That would be a joke on them to brag about the remainder of his life He took matches from his pocket and started the fire It seemed to his fevered imagination that it burned far too slowly He shoved in more kindling shavings ends left from siding This smothered his fire so he made trip after trip to the tinder box piling in armloads of dry inflammable stuff Then suddenly the flames leaped up He slammed shut the door and started toward the saw He could not make it work He jammed and pulled everything he could reach Soon he realized the heat was becoming intense and turned to the boiler to see that the fire box was red hot almost all over white hot in places My God he muttered Too hot Got to cool that down Then he saw the tank and the dangling hose and remembered that he had not filled the boiler Taking down the hose he opened the watercock stuck in the nozzle and turned on the water full force Windows were broken across the street Parts of the fire box boiler and fire flew everywhere The walls blew out the roof lifted and came down the fire raged among the new dry timbers of the mill When her windows blew in Kate was thrown from her bed to the floor She lay stunned a second then dragged herself up to look across the street There was nothing where the low white expanse of roof had spread an hour before while a red glare was creeping everywhere over the ground She ran to George s room and found it empty She ran to the kitchen calling him and found the back door standing open She rushed back to her room and began trying to put on her dress over her nightrobe She could not control her shaking fingers while at each step she cut her feet on broken glass She reached the front door as the children came screaming with fright In turning to warn them about the glass she stumbled on the top step pitched forward headlong then lay still The neighbours carried her back to her bed called the doctor and then saved all the logs in the yard they could The following day when the fire had burned itself out the undertaker hunted assiduously but nothing could be found to justify a funeral CHAPTER XX FOR A GOOD GIRL FOR a week Kate lay so dazed she did not care whether she lived or died then she slowly crept back to life realizing that whether she cared or not she must live She was too young too strong to quit because she was soul sick she had to go on She had life to face for herself and her children She wondered dully about her people but as none of the neighbours who had taken care of her said anything concerning them she realized that they had not been there At first she was almost glad They were forthright people They would have had something to say they would have said it tersely and to the point Adam threed had wound up her affairs speedily by selling the logs he had bought for her to the Hartley mills paying what she owed and depositing the remainder in the Hartley Bank to her credit but that remainder was less than one hundred dollars That winter was a long dreadful nightmare to Kate Had it not been for Aunt Ollie they would have been hungry some of the time they were cold most of it For weeks Kate thought of sending for her mother or going to her then as not even a line came from any of her family she realized that they resented her losing that much Bates money so bitterly that they wished to have nothing to do with her Often she sat for hours staring straight before her trying to straighten out the tangle she had made of her life As if she had not suffered enough in the reality of living she now lived over in day and night dreams hour by hour her time with George Holt and gained nothing thereby All winter Kate brooded barely managing to keep alive and the children in school As spring opened she shook herself arose and went to work It was not planned systematic effective Bates work Piecemeal she did anything she saw needed the doing The children helped to make garden and clean the yard Then all of them went out to Aunt Ollie s and made a contract to plant and raise potatoes and vegetables on shares They passed a neglected garden on the way and learning that the woman of the house was ill Kate stopped and offered to tend it for enough cords of windfall wood to pay her a fair price this to be delivered in mid summer With food and fire assured Kate ripped up some of George s clothing washed pressed turned and made Adam warm clothes for school She even achieved a dress for Polly by making a front and back from a pair of her father s trouser legs and setting in side pieces a yoke and sleeves from one of her old skirts George s underclothing she cut down for both of the children then drew another check for taxes and second hand books While she was in Hartley in the fall paying taxes she stopped at a dry goods store for thread and heard a customer asking for knitted mittens which were not in stock After he had gone she arranged with the merchant for a supply of yarn which she carried home and began to knit into mittens such as had been called for She used every minute of leisure during the day she worked hours into the night and soon small sums began coming her way When she had a supply of teamster s heavy mittens she began on fancy coloured ones for babies and children sometimes crocheting sometimes using needles Soon she started both children on the rougher work with her They were glad to help for they had a lively remembrance of one winter of cold and hunger with no Christmas That there were many things she might have done that would have made more money with less exertion Kate never seemed to realize She did the obvious thing Her brain power seemed to be on a level with that of Adam and Polly When the children began to carry home Christmas talk Kate opened her mouth to say the things that had been said to her as a child then tightly closed it She began getting up earlier sitting up later knitting feverishly Luckily the merchant could sell all she could furnish As the time drew nearer she gathered from the talk of the children what was the deepest desire of their hearts One day a heavy wind driving ice coated trees in the back yard broke quite a large limb from a cherry tree Kate dragged it into the woodhouse to make firewood She leaned it against the wall to wait until the ice melted and as it stood there in its silvery coat she thought how like a small tree the branch was shaped and how pretty it looked After the children had gone to school the next day she shaped it with the hatchet and saw and fastened it in a small box This she carried to her bedroom and locked the door She had not much idea what she was going to do but she kept thinking Soon she found enough time to wrap every branch carefully with the red tissue paper her red knitting wool came in and to cover the box smoothly Then she thought of the country Christmas trees she had seen decorated with popcorn and cranberries She popped the corn at night and the following day made a trip up the ravine where she gathered all the bittersweet berries swamp holly and wild rose seed heads she could find She strung the corn on fine cotton cord putting a rose seed pod between each grain then used the bittersweet berries to terminate the blunt ends of the branches and climb up the trunk By the time she had finished this she was really interested She achieved a gold star for the top from a box lid and a piece of gilt paper Polly had carried home from school With yarn ends and mosquito netting she whipped up a few little mittens stockings and bags She cracked nuts from their fall store and melting a little sugar stirred in the kernels until they were covered with a sweet white glaze Then she made some hard candy and some fancy cookies with a few sticks of striped candy cut in circles and dotted on the top She polished red yellow and green apples and set them under the tree When she made her final trip to Hartley before Christmas the spirit of the day was in the air She breathed so much of it that she paid a dollar and a half for a stout sled and ten cents for a dozen little red candles five each for two oranges and fifteen each for two pretty little books then after long hesitation added a doll for Polly She felt that she should not have done this and said so to herself but knew if she had it to do over she would do the same thing again She shook her shoulders and took the first step toward regaining her old self confidence Pshaw Big and strong as I am and Adam getting such a great boy we can make it she said Then she hurried to the hack and was driven home barely in time to rush her bundles into her room before school was out She could scarcely wait until the children were in bed to open the parcels The doll had to be dressed but Kate was interested in Christmas by that time and so contemplated the spider waisted image with real affection She never had owned a doll herself She let the knitting go that night and cut up an old waist to make white under clothing with touches of lace and a pretty dress Then Kate went to her room tied the doll in a safe place on the tree put on the books and set the candles with pins As she worked she kept biting her lips but when it was all finished she thought it was lovely and so it was As she set the sled in front of the tree she said There little folks I wonder what you will think of that It s the best I can do I ve a nice chicken to roast now if only if only Mother or Nancy Ellen would come or write a line or merely send one word by Tilly Nepple Suddenly Kate lay down on the bed buried her face in the pillow while her shoulders jerked and shook in dry sobs for a long time At last she arose went to the kitchen bathed her face and banked the fires I suppose it is the Bates way she said but it s a cold hard proposition I know what s the matter with all of them They are afraid to come near me or show the slightest friendliness for fear I ll ask them to help support us They needn t worry we can take care of ourselves She set her tree on the living room table arranged everything to the best advantage laid a fire in the stove and went to sleep Christmas eve feeling more like herself than she had since the explosion Christmas morning she had the house warm and the tree ready to light while the children dressed She slipped away their every day clothing and laid out their best instead She could hear them talking as they dressed and knew the change of clothing had filled them with hope She hastily lighted the tree and was setting the table as they entered the dining room Merry Christmas little people she cried in a voice they had not heard in a long time They both rushed to her and Kate s heart stood still as they each hugged her tight kissed her and offered a tiny packet From the size and feeling of these she realized that they were giving her the candy they had received the day before at school Surprises were coming thick and fast with Kate That one shook her to her foundations They loved candy They had so little They had nothing else to give She held them an instant so tightly they were surprised at her then she told them to lay the packages on the living room table until after breakfast Polly opened the door and screamed Adam ran and then both of them stood silently before the brave little tree flaming red touched with white its gold star shining They looked at it and then at each other while Kate watching at an angle across the dining room distinctly heard Polly say in an awed tone Adam hadn t we better pray Kate lifted herself full height and drew a deep breath Well I guess I manage a little Christmas after this she said and maybe a Fourth of July and a birthday and a few other things I needn t be such a coward I believe I can make it From that hour she began trying to think of something she could do that would bring returns more nearly commensurate with the time and strength she was spending She felt tied to Walden because she owned the house and could rely on working on shares with Aunt Ollie for winter food but there was nothing she could do there and take care of the children that would bring more than the most meagre living Still they were living each year more comfortably the children were growing bigger and stronger soon they could help at something if only she could think what The time flew each day a repetition of yesterday s dogged soul tiring grind until some days Kate was close to despair Each day the house grew shabbier things wore out and could not be replaced poverty showed itself more plainly So three more years of life in Walden passed setting their indelible mark on Kate Time and again she almost broke the spell that bound her but she never quite reached the place where her thought cleared her heart regained its courage her soul dared take wing and try another flight When she thought of it I don t so much mind the falling said Kate to herself but I do seem to select the hardest spots to light on Kate sat on the back steps the sun shone her nearest neighbour was spading an onion bed She knew that presently she would get out the rake and spade and begin another year s work but at that minute she felt too hopeless to move Adam came and sat on the step beside her She looked at him and was surprised at his size and apparent strength Someway he gave her hope He was a good boy he had never done a mean sneaking thing that she knew of He was natural normal mischievous but he had not an underhand inclination that she could discover He would make a fine looking big man quite as fine as any of the Bates men even Adam threed was no handsomer than the fourth Adam would be Hope arose in her with the cool air of spring on her cheek and its wine in her nostrils Then out of the clear sky she said it Adam how long are we going to stay in the beggar class Adam jumped and turned surprised eyes toward her Kate was forced to justify herself Of course we give Aunt Ollie half we raise she said but anybody would do that We work hard and we live little if any better than Jasons who have the County Trustee in three times a winter I m big and strong you re almost a man why don t we DO something Why don t we have some decent clothes some money for out work and Kate spoke at random a horse and carriage A horse and carriage repeated Adam staring at her Why not said Kate casually But how cried the amazed boy Why earn the money and buy it said Kate impatiently I m about fed up on earning cabbage and potatoes and skirmishing for wood I d prefer to have a dollar in my pocket and BUY what we need Can t you use your brain and help me figure out a way to earn some MONEY I meant to pretty soon now but I thought I had to go to school a few years yet he said Of course you do said Kate I must earn the money but can t you help me think how Sure said Adam sitting straight and seeming thoughtful but give me a little time What would you could you do I taught before I was married said Kate but methods of teaching change so I d have to have a Normal term to qualify for even this school I could put you and Polly with Aunt Ollie this summer but I wouldn t not if we must freeze and starve together Because of Grandma asked the boy Kate nodded I borrowed money to go once and I could again but I have been away from teaching so long and I don t know what to do with you children The thing I would LIKE would be to find a piece of land somewhere with a house any kind of one on it and take it to rent Land is about all I really know Working for money would be of some interest I am so dead tired working for potatoes Sometimes I see them flying around in the air at night Do you know of any place you would like asked Adam No I don t said Kate but I am going to begin asking and I m going to keep my eyes open I heard yesterday that doctor James intends to build a new house This house is nothing but the lot is in the prettiest place in town Let s sell it to him and take the money and buy us some new furniture and a cow and a team and wagon and a buggy and go on a piece of land and live like other people Seems to me I ll die if I have to work for potatoes any longer I m heart sick of them Don t say a word to anybody but Oh Adam THINK Think HARD Can t you just help me THINK You are sure you want land asked the boy It is all I know said Kate How do you feel about it I want horses and cows and pigs lots of pigs and sheep and lots of white hens said Adam promptly Get the spade and spade the onion bed until I think said Kate And that reminds me we didn t divide the sets last fall Somebody will have to go after them I ll go said Adam but it s awful early It ll snow again Let me go after school Friday and stay over night I d like to go and stay over night with Aunt Ollie Grandma can t say anything to me that I ll listen to You keep Polly and let me go alone Sure I can All right said Kate Spade the bed and let it warm a day It will be good for it But don t tell Polly you re going or she ll want to go along Until Friday night Kate and Adam went around in such a daze of deep thought that they stumbled and ran against each other then came back to their affairs suddenly looking at each other and smiling understandingly After one of these encounters Kate said to the boy You may not arrive at anything Adam but I certainly can t complain that you are not thinking Adam grinned I m not so sure that I haven t got it he said Tell me quick and let me think too said Kate But I can t tell you yet said Adam I have to find out something first Friday evening he wanted to put off his trip until Saturday morning so Kate agreed She was surprised when he bathed and put on his clean shirt and trousers but said not a word She had made some study of child psychology she thought making the trip alone was of so much importance to Adam that he was dressing for the occasion She foresaw extra washing yet she said nothing to stop the lad She waved good bye to him thinking how sturdy and good looking he was as he ran out of the front door Kate was beginning to be worried when Adam had not returned toward dusk Sunday evening and Polly was cross and fretful Finally they saw him coming down the ravine bank carrying his small bundle of sets Kate felt a glow of relief Polly ran to meet him Kate watched as they met and saw Adam take Polly s hand If only they looked as much alike as some twins do I d be thankful said Kate Adam delivered the sets said Aunt Ollie and Grandma were all right that it was an awful long walk and he was tired Kate noticed that his feet were dust covered but his clothes were so clean she said to him You didn t fish much I didn t fish any said Adam not like I always fish he added Had any time to THINK asked Kate You just bet I did said the boy I didn t waste a minute Neither did I said Kate I know exactly what the prettiest lot in town can be sold for Good cried Adam Fine Monday Kate wanted to get up early and stick the sets but Adam insisted that Aunt Ollie said the sign would not be right until Wednesday If they were stuck on Monday or Tuesday they would all grow to top My goodness I knew that said Kate I am thinking so hard I m losing what little sense I had but anyway mere thinking is doing me a world of good I am beginning to feel a kind of rising joy inside and I can t imagine anything else that makes it Adam went to school laughing Kate did the washing and ironing and worked in the garden getting beds ready Tuesday she was at the same occupation when about ten o clock she dropped her spade and straightened a flash of perfect amazement crossing her face She stood immovable save for swaying forward in an attitude of tense listening Hoo hoo Kate ran across the yard and as she turned the corner of the house she saw a one horse spring wagon standing before the gate while a stiff gaunt figure sat bolt upright on the seat holding the lines Kate was at the wheel looking up with a face of delighted amazement Why Mother she cried Why Mother Go fetch a chair and help me down said missus Bates this seat is getting tarnation hard Kate ran after a chair and helped her mother to alight missus Bates promptly took the chair on the sidewalk Just drop the thills she said Lead him back and slip on the halter It s there with his feed Kate followed instructions her heart beating wildly Several times she ventured a quick glance at her mother How she had aged How lined and thin she was But Oh how blessed good it was to see her missus Bates arose and they walked into the house where she looked keenly around while her sharp eyes seemed to appraise everything as she sat down and removed her bonnet Go fetch me a drink she said and take the horse one and then I ll tell you why I came I don t care why you came said Kate but Oh Mother thank God you are here Now now don t get het up cautioned missus Bates Water I said Kate hurried to obey orders then she sank on a chair and looked at her mother missus Bates wiped her face and settled in the chair comfortably They s no use to waste words she said Katie you re the only one in the family that has any sense and sometimes you ain t got enough so s you could notice it without a magnifyin glass but even so you re ahead of the rest of them Katie I m sick an tired of the Neppleses and the Whistlers and being bossed by the whole endurin Bates tribe sick and tired of it so I just came after you Came after me repeated Kate stupidly Yes parrot came after you said missus Bates I told you you d no great amount of sense I m speakin plain ain t I I don t see much here to hold you I want you should throw a few traps whatever you are beholden to in the wagon that s why I brought it and come on home and take care of me the rest of my time It won t be so long I won t interfere much nor be much bother I ve kep the place in order but I m about fashed I won t admit it to the rest of them but I don t seem to mind telling you Katie that I am almost winded Will you come Of course I will said Kate a tide of effulgent joy surging up in her heart until it almost choked her Of course I will Mother but my children won t they worry you Never having had a child about I s pect likely they may said missus Bates dryly Why you little fool I think likely it s the children I am pinin for most though I couldn t a stood it much longer without YOU Will you get ready and come with me to day Yes said Kate if I can make it There s very little here I care for I can have the second hand man give me what he will for the rest and I can get a good price for the lot to day if I say so doctor James wants it to build on I ll go and do the very best I can and when you don t want me any longer Adam will be bigger and we can look out for ourselves Yes I ll get ready at once if you want me to Not much of a haggler are you Katie said missus Bates Why don t you ask what rooms you re to have and what I ll pay you and how much work you ll have to do and if you take charge of the farm and how we share up Kate laughed Mother she said I have been going to school here with the Master of Life for a teacher and I ve learned so many things that really count that I know now NONE of the things you mention are essential You may keep the answers to all those questions I don t care a cent about any of them If you want me and want the children all those things will settle themselves as we come to them I didn t use to understand you but we got well enough acquainted at Father s funeral and I do now Whatever you do will be fair just and right I ll obey you as I shall expect Adam and Polly to Well for lands sakes Katie said missus Bates Life must a been weltin it to you good and proper I never expected to see you as meek as Moses That Holt man wasn t big enough to beat you was he The ways in which he beat me no Bates would understand I had eight years of them and I don t understand them yet but I am so cooked with them that I shall be wild with joy if you truly mean for me to pack up and come home with you for awhile Oh Lordy Katie said missus Bates This whipped out take anything anyway style ain t becomin to a big fine upstanding woman like you Hold up your head child Hold up your head and say what you want an how you want it Honestly Mother I don t want a thing on earth but to go home with you and do as you say for the next ten years said Kate Stiffen up cried missus Bates Stiffen up Don t be no broken reed Katie I don t want you dependin on ME I came to see if you would let ME lean on YOU the rest of the way I wa n t figuring that there was anything on this earth that could get you down so s I was calculatin you d be the very one to hold me up Since you seem to be feeling unaccountably weak in the knees let s see if we can brace them a little Livin with Pa so long must kind of given me a tendency toward nussin a deed I ve got one here I had executed two years ago and I was a coming with it along about now when a little bird tole me to come to day so here I am Take that Katie missus Bates pulled a long sealed envelope from the front of her dress and tossed it in Kate s lap Mother what is this asked Kate in a hushed voice Well if you d rather use your ears than your eyes it s all the same to me said missus Bates The boys always had a mortal itchin to get their fingers on the papers in the case I can t say I don t like the difference and I ve give you every chance too an you WOULDN T demand you WOULDN T specify Well I ll just specify myself I m dead tired of the neighbours taking care of me and all of the children stoppin every time they pass each one orderin or insinuatin according to their lights as to what I should do I ve always had a purty clear idea of what I wanted to do myself Over forty years I sided with Pa to keep the peace NOW I reckon I m free to do as I like That s my side You can tell me yours now Kate shook her head I have nothing to say Jest as well said missus Bates Re hashing don t do any good Come back and come to day but stiffen up That paper you are holding is a warrantee deed to the home two hundred to you and your children after you You take possession to day There s money in the bank to paper an paint and make any little changes you d like such as cutting doors or windows different places floorin the kitchen new or the like Take it an welcome I got more an enough to last me all my days all I ask of you is my room my food and your company Take the farm and do what you pretty please with it But Mother cried Kate The rest of them They d tear me limb for limb I don t DARE take this Oh don t you asked missus Bates Well I still stand for quite a bit at Bates Corners and I say you WILL take that farm and run it as you like It is mine I give it to you We all know it wasn t your fault you lost your money though it was a dose it took some of us a good long time to swallow You are the only one out of your share you settled things fine for the rest of them and they all know it and feel it You ll never know what you did for me the way you put me through Pa s funeral now if you ll just shut up and stick that deed somewhere it won t burn and come home an plant me as successfully as you did Pa you ll have earned all you ll get an something coming Now set us out a bite to eat and let s be off Kate slowly arose and handed back the deed I ll be flying around so lively I might lose that she said you put it where you had it till we get to Hartley and then I ll get a place in the bank vault for it I can t quite take this in just yet but you know I ll do my best for you Mother Tain t likely I d be here else said missus Bates and tea Katie A cup of good strong hot tea would fix me up about proper right now Kate went to the kitchen and began setting everything she had to eat on the table As she worked Polly came flying in the door crying Mother who has come so Kate stepped toward the living room to show the child to her grandmother and as she advanced she saw a queer thing Adam was sitting on his grandmother s lap Her arms were tight around him her face buried in his crisp hair and he was patting her shoulder and telling her he would take care of her while her voice said distinctly Of course you will birdie Then the lad and the old woman laid their heads together and laughed almost hysterically WELL IF THAT ISN T QUICK WORK said Kate to herself Then she presented Polly who followed Adam s lead in hugging the stranger first and looking at her afterward God bless all little children Then Adam ran to tell the second hand man to come at one o clock and doctor James that he might have the keys at three They ate hurriedly Kate set out what she wished to save the children carried things to the wagon she packed while they ran after their books and at three o clock all of them climbed into the spring wagon and started to Bates Corners Kate was the last one in As she climbed on the seat beside her mother and took the lines she handed missus Bates a small china mug to hold for her It was decorated with a very fat robin and on a banner floating from its beak was inscribed For a Good Girl CHAPTER XXI LIFE S BOOMERANG AS THEY drove into Hartley missus Bates drew forth the deed You are right about the bank being a safe place for this she said I ve had it round the house for two years and it s a fair nervous thing to do I wish I d a had sense to put it there and come after you the day I made it But there s no use crying over spilt milk nor fussin with the grease spot it makes salt it down safely now and when you get it done beings as this setting is fairly comfortable take time to run into Harding s and pick up some Sunday school clothes for the children that will tally up with the rest of their relations an get yourself a cheap frock or two that will spruce you up a bit till you have time to decide what you really want Kate passed the lines to her mother and climbed from the wagon She returned with her confidence partly restored and a new look on her face Her mother handed her two dimes I can wait five minutes longer she said Now get two nice oranges and a dime s worth of candy Kate took the money and obeyed orders She handed the packages to her mother as she climbed into the wagon and again took the lines heading the horse toward the old familiar road Her mother twisted around on the seat and gave each of the children an orange and a stick of candy There she said Go on and spoil yourselves past redemption Kate laughed But Mother she said you never did that for us Which ain t saying I never WANTED to said missus Bates sourly You re a child only once in this world it s a little too rough to strip childhood of everything I ain t so certain Bates ways are right that for the rest of my time I m goin to fly in the face of all creation to prove it If God lets me live a few years more I want the faces around me a little less discontenteder than those I ve been used to If God Almighty spares me long enough I lay out to make sure that Adam and Polly will squeeze out a tear or two for Granny when she is laid away I think you are right Mother said Kate It didn t cost anything but we had a real pretty Christmas tree this year and I believe we can do better next time I want the children to love you but don t BUY them Well I d hardly call an orange and a stick of candy traffickin in affection said missus Bates They ll survive it without underminin their principles I ll be bound or yours either Katie let s make a beginning to day LET S WORK WHAT IS RIGHT AND HEALTHY A FAIR PART OF THE DAY AND THEN EACH DAY AND SUNDAY ESPECIALLY LET S PLAY AND REST JUST AS HARD AS WE WORK IT S BEEN ALL WORK AND NO PLAY TILL WE VE BEEN MIGHTY DULL BOYS AT OUR HOUSE I M FREE TO SAY THAT I HANKER FOR A CHANGE BEFORE I DIE Don t speak so often of dying said Kate You re all right You ve been too much alone You ll feel like yourself as soon as you get rested I guess I been thinking about it too much said missus Bates I ain t been so well as I might an not being used to it it worries me some I got to buck up The one thing I CAN T do is to die but I m most tired enough to do it right now I ll be glad when we get home Kate drove carefully but as fast as she dared with her load As they neared Bates Corners the way became more familiar each mile Kate forgot the children forgot her mother forgot ten years of disappointment and failure and began a struggle to realize what was happening to her now The lines slipped down the horse walked slowly the first thing she knew big hot tears splashed on her hand She gathered up the lines drew a deep breath and glanced at her mother meeting her eye fairly Kate tried to smile but her lips were quivering Glad Katie asked missus Bates Kate nodded Me too said missus Bates They passed the orchard There s the house there Polly cried Adam Why Adam how did you know the place asked Kate turning Adam hesitated a second Ain t you told us times a plenty about the house and the lilac and the snowball bush Yes and the cabbage roses added Polly So I have said Kate Mostly last winter when we were knitting Yes this will be home for all the rest of our lives Isn t it grand How will we ever thank Grandmother How will we ever be good enough to pay her Both children thought this a hint so with one accord they arose and fell on missus Bates back and began to pay at once in coin of childhood There there said Kate drawing them away as she stopped the horse at the gate There there you will choke Grandmother missus Bates pushed Kate s arm down Mind your own business will you she said I ain t so feeble that I can t speak for myself awhile yet In a daze Kate climbed down and ran to bring a chair to help her mother The children were boisterously half eating missus Bates up she had both of them in her arms with every outward evidence of enjoying the performance immensely That was a very busy evening for the wagon was to be unpacked all of them were hungry while the stock was to be fed and the milking done missus Bates and Polly attempted supper Kate and Adam went to the barn but they worked very hurriedly for Kate could see how feeble her mother had grown When at last the children were bathed and in bed Kate and her mother sat on the little front porch to smell spring a few minutes before going to rest Kate reached over and took her mother s hand There s no word I know in any language big enough to thank you for this Mother she said The best I can do is make each day as nearly a perfect expression of what I feel as possible missus Bates drew away her hand and used it to wipe her eyes but she said with her usual terse perversity My Kate You re most as wordy as Agatha I m no glibtonguer but I bet you ten dollars it will hustle you some to be any gladder than I am Kate laughed and gave up the thanks question To morrow we must get some onions in she said Have you made any plans about the farm work for this year yet No said missus Bates I was going to leave that till I decided whether I d come after you this spring or wait until next Since I decided to come now I ll just leave your farm to you Handle it as you please Mother what will the other children say implored Kate Humph You are about as well acquainted with them as I am Take a shot at it yourself If it will avoid a fuss we might just say you had to come to stay with me and run the farm for me and let them get used to your being here and bossing things by degrees like the man that cut his dog s tail off an inch at a time so it wouldn t hurt so bad But by inches or at one fell swoop it s going to hurt said Kate Sometimes it seems to me said missus Bates that the more we get HURT in this world the decenter it makes us All the boys were hurt enough when Pa went but every man of them has been a BIGGER BETTER man since Instead of competing as they always did Adam and Andrew and the older beforehandeder ones took hold and helped the younger as you told them to and it s done the whole family a world of good One thing is funny To hear Mary talk now you d think she engineered that plan herself The boys are all thankful and so are the girls I leave it to you Tell them or let them guess it by degrees it s all one to me Tell me about Nancy Ellen and Robert said Kate Robert stands head in Hartley He gets bigger and broader every year He is better looking than a man has any business to be and I hear the Hartley ladies give him plenty of encouragement in being stuck on himself but I think he is true to Nancy Ellen and his heart is all in his work No children That s a burning shame Both of them feel it In a way and strictly between you and me Nancy Ellen is a disappointment to me an I doubt if she ain t been a mite of a one to him He had a right to expect a good deal of Nancy Ellen She had such a good brain and good body and purty face I may miss my guess but it always strikes me that she falls SHORT of what he expected of her He s coined money but she hasn t spent it in the ways he would Likely I shouldn t say it but he strikes me as being just a leetle mite too good for her Oh Mother said Kate Now you lookey here said missus Bates Suppose you was a man of Robert s brains and education and professional ability and you made heaps of money and no children came and you had to see all you earned and stood for and did in a community spent on the SELFISHNESS of one woman How big would you feel What end is that for the ambition and life work of a real man How would you like it I never thought of such a thing said Kate Well mark my word you WILL think of it when you see their home and her clothes and see them together said missus Bates She still loves pretty clothing so well asked Kate She is the best dressed woman in the county and the best looking said missus Bates and that s all there is to her I m free to say with her chances I m ashamed of what she has and hasn t made of herself I d rather stand in your shoes than hers this minute Katie Does she know I m here asked Kate Yes I stopped and told her on my way out this morning said missus Bates I asked them to come out for Sunday dinner and they are coming Did you deliver the invitation by force asked Kate Now none of your meddling said missus Bates I got what I went after and that was all I wanted I ve told her an told her to come to see you during the last three years an I know she WANTED to come but she just had that stubborn Bates streak in her that wouldn t let her change once her mind was made up It did give us a purty severe jolt Kate havin all that good Bates money burn up I scarcely think it jolted any of you more than it did me said Kate dryly No I reckon it didn t said missus Bates But they s no use hauling ourselves over the coals to go into that It s past You went out to face life bravely enough and it throwed you a boomerang that cut a circle and brought you back where you started from Our arrangements for the future are all made Now it s up to us to live so that we get the most out of life for us an the children Those are mighty nice children of yours Kate I take to that boy something amazin and the girl is the nicest little old lady I ve seen in many a day I think we will like knittin and sewin together to the top of our bent My but I m glad you like them Mother said Kate They are all I ve got to show for ten years of my life Not by a long shot Katie said missus Bates Life has made a real woman of you I kept watchin you to day comin over an I was prouder an Jehu of you It s a debatable question whether you have thrown away your time and your money I say you ve got something to show for it that I wish to God the rest of my children had I want you should brace your back and stiffen your neck and make things hum here Get a carpenter first Fix the house the way it will be most convenient and comfortable Then paint and paper and get what new things you like in reason of course in reason and then I want you should get all of us clothes so s there ain t a noticeable difference between us and the others when we come together here or elsewhere Put in a telephone they re mighty handy and if you can scrape up a place I washed in Nancy Ellen s tub a few weeks ago I never was wet all over at once before in my life and I m just itching to try it again I say let s have it if it knocks a fair sized hole in a five hundred dollar bill An if we had the telephone right now we could call up folks an order what we want without ever budgin out of our tracks Go up ahead Katie I ll back you in anything you can think of It won t hurt my feelings a mite if you can think of one or two things the rest of them haven t got yet Can t you think of something that will lay the rest of them clear in the shade I just wish you could Now I m going to bed Kate went with her mother opened her bed pulled out the pins and brushed her hair drew the thin cover over her and blew out the light Then she went past the bed on her way to the door and stooping she kissed her mother for the first time since she could remember Then she lighted a lamp hunted a big sheet of wrapping paper and sitting down beside the living room table she drew a rough sketch of the house For hours she pored over it and when at last she went to bed on the reverse of the sheet she had a drawing that was quite a different affair yet it was the same house with very few and easily made changes that a good contractor could accomplish in a short time In the morning she showed these ideas to her mother who approved all of them but still showed disappointment visibly That s nothing but all the rest of them have she said I thought you could think up some frills that would be new and different Well said Kate would you want to go to the expense of setting up a furnace in the cellar It would make the whole house toasty warm it would keep the bathroom from freezing in cold weather and make a better way to heat the water Now you re shouting cried missus Bates That s it But keep still Don t you tell a soul about it but go on and do it Katie Wade right in What else can you think of A brain specialist for you said Kate I think myself this is enough for a start but if you insist on more there s a gas line passing us out there on the road we could hitch on for a very reasonable sum and do away with lamps and cooking with wood Goody for you That s it cried missus Bates That s the very thing Now brush up your hair your prettiest and put on your new blue dress and take the buggy and you and Adam go see how much of this can be started to day Me and Polly will keep house In a month all of these changes had been made and were in running order the painting was finished new furniture in place a fair start made on the garden while a strong young hired man was not far behind Hiram with his plowing Kate was so tired she almost staggered but she was so happy she arose each morning refreshed and accomplished work enough for three average women before the day was over She suggested to her mother that she use her money from the sale of the Walden home to pay for what furniture she had bought and then none of the others could feel that they were entitled to any share in it at any time missus Bates thought that a good idea so much ill will was saved among the children They all stopped in passing some of them had sharp words to say which Kate instantly answered in such a way that this was seldom tried twice In two months the place was fresh clean convenient and in good taste All of them had sufficient suitable clothing while the farm work had not been neglected enough to hurt the value of the crops In the division of labour Adam and the hired man took the barn and field work missus Bates and Polly the house while Kate threw all her splendid strength wherever it was most needed If a horse was sick she went to the barn and doctored it If the hay was going to get wet she pitched hay If the men had not time for the garden she attended it and hoed the potatoes For a change everything went right missus Bates was happier than she ever had been before taking the greatest interest in the children They had lived for three years in such a manner that they would never forget it They were old enough to appreciate what changes had come to them and to be very keen about their new home and life Kate threw herself into the dream of her heart with all the zest of her being Always she had loved and wanted land Now she had it She knew how to handle it She could make it pay as well as any Bates man for she had man strength and all her life she had heard men discuss and helped men apply man methods There was a strong strain of her father s spirit of driving in Kate s blood but her mother was so tired of it that whenever Kate had gone just so far the older woman had merely to caution Now now Katie to make Kate realized what she was doing and take a slower pace All of them were well happy and working hard but they also played at proper times and in convenient places Kate and her mother went with the children when they fished in the meadow brook or hunted wild flowers in the woods for Polly s bed in the shade of the pear tree beside the garden There were flowers in the garden now as well as vegetables There was no work done on Sunday The children always went to Sunday school and the full term of the District School at Bates Corners They were respected they were prosperous they were finding a joy in life they never before had known while life had taught them how to appreciate its good things as they achieved them The first Christmas missus Bates and Kate made a Christmas tree from a small savine in the dooryard that stood where Kate wanted to set a flowering shrub she had found in the woods Guided by the former year and with a few dollars they decided to spend these women made a real Christmas tree with gifts and ornaments over which missus Bates was much more excited than the children Indeed such is the perversity of children that Kate s eyes widened and her mouth sagged when she heard Adam say in a half whisper to Polly This is mighty pretty but gee Polly there ll never be another tree as pretty as ours last year While Polly answered I was just thinking about it Adam Wasn t it the grandest thing The next Christmas missus Bates advanced to a tree that reached the ceiling with many candles real ornaments and an orange a stocking of candy and nuts and a doll for each girl and a knife for each boy of her grandchildren all of whom she invited for dinner Adam threed sat at the head of the table missus Bates at the foot The tiniest tots that could be trusted without their parents ranged on the Dictionary and the Bible of which the Bates family possessed a fat edition for birth records no one had ever used it for any other purpose until it served to lift Hiram s baby Milly on a level with her roast turkey and cranberry jelly For a year before her party missus Bates planned for it The tree was beautiful the gifts amazing the dinner as Kate cooked and served it a revelation with its big centre basket of red yellow and green apples oranges bananas grapes and flowers None of them ever had seen a table like that Then when dinner was over Kate sat before the fire and in her clear voice with fine inflections she read from the Big Book the story of the guiding star and the little child in the manger Then she told stories and they played games until four o clock and then Adam rolled all of the children into the big wagon bed mounted on the sled runners and took them home Then he came back and finished the day missus Bates could scarcely be persuaded to go to bed When at last Kate went to put out her mother s light and see that her feet were warm and her covers tucked she found her crying Why Mother exclaimed Kate in frank dismay Wasn t everything all right I m just so endurin mad sobbed missus Bates that I could a most scream and throw things Here I am closer the end of my string than anybody knows Likely I ll not see another Christmas I ve lived the most of my life and never knowed there was a time like that on earth to be had There wasn t expense to it we couldn t easy have stood always Now at the end of my tether I go and do this for my grandchildren Tween their little shining faces and me there kept coming all day the little sad disappointed faces of you and Nancy Ellen and Mary and Hannah and Adam and Andrew and Hiram and all the others Ever since he went I ve thought the one thing I COULDN T DO WAS TO DIE AND FACE ADAM BATES but to day I ain t felt so scared of him Seems to me HE has got about as much to account for as I have Kate stood breathlessly still looking at her mother missus Bates wiped her eyes I ain t so mortal certain she said that I don t open up on him and take the first word I think likely I been defrauded out of more that really counts in this world than he has Ain t that little roly poly of Hannah s too sweet Seems like I ll hardly quit feeling her little sticky hands and her little hot mouth on my face when I die and as she went out she whispered in my ear Do it again Grandma Oh please do it again an it s more n likely I ll not get the chance no matter how willing I am Kate I am going to leave you what of my money is left I haven t spent so much and while you live here I wish each year you would have this same kind of a party and pay for it out of that money and call it Grandmother s Party Will you I surely will said Kate And hadn t I better have ALL of them and put some little thing from you on the tree for them You know how Hiram always was wild for cuff buttons and Mary could talk by the hour about a handkerchief with lace on it and Andrew never yet has got that copy of Aesop s Fables he always wanted Shall I Yes said missus Bates Oh yes and when you do it Katie if they don t chain me pretty close in on the other side I think likely I ll be sticking around as near as I can get to you Kate slipped a hot brick rolled in flannel to the cold old feet and turning out the light she sat beside the bed and stroked the tired head until easy breathing told her that her mother was sound asleep Then she went back to the fireplace and sitting in the red glow she told Adam threed PART of what her mother had said Long after he was gone she sat gazing into the slowly graying coals her mind busy with what she had NOT told That spring was difficult for Kate Day after day she saw her mother growing older feebler and frailer And as the body failed up flamed the wings of the spirit carrying her on and on each day keeping her alive when Kate did not see how it could be done With all the force she could gather each day missus Bates struggled to keep going denied that she felt badly drove herself to try to help about the house and garden Kate warned the remainder of the family what they might expect at any hour but when they began coming in oftener bringing little gifts and being unusually kind missus Bates endured a few of the visits in silence then she turned to Kate and said after her latest callers I wonder what in the name of all possessed ails the folks Are they just itching to start my funeral Can t they stay away until you send them word that the breath s out of my body Mother you shock me said Kate They come because they LOVE you They try to tell you so with the little things they bring Most people would think they were neglected if their children did NOT come to see them when they were not so well Not so well cried missus Bates Folly I am as well as I ever was They needn t come snooping around trying to make me think I m not If they d a done it all their lives well and good it s no time for them to begin being cotton mouthed now Mother said Kate gently haven t YOU changed yourself about things like Christmas for example Maybe your children are changing too Maybe they feel that they have missed something they d like to have from you and give back to you before it s too late Just maybe said Kate missus Bates sat bolt upright still but her flashing eyes softened I hadn t just thought of that she said I think it s more than likely Well if it s THAT way I s pose I ve got to button up my lip and stand it but it s about more than I can go when I know that the first time I lose my grip I ll land smash up against Adam Bates and my settlement with him Mother said Kate still more gently I thought we had it settled at the time Father went that each of you would be accountable to GOD not to each other I am a wanderer in darkness myself when it come to talking about God but this I know He is SOMEWHERE and He is REDEEMING love If Father has been in the light of His love all these years he must have changed more far more than you have He ll understand now how wrong he was to force ways on you he knew you didn t think right he ll have more to account to you for than you ever will to him and remember this only neither of you is accountable save to your God missus Bates arose and walked to the door drawn to full height her head very erect The world was at bloom time The evening air was heavily sweet with lilacs and the widely branching old apple trees of the dooryard with loaded with flowers She stepped outside Kate followed Her mother went down the steps and down the walk to the gate Kate kept beside her in reach yet not touching her At the gate she gripped the pickets to steady herself as she stared long and unflinchingly at the red setting sun dropping behind a white wall of bloom Then she slowly turned life s greatest tragedy lining her face her breath coming in short gasps She spread her hands at each side as if to balance herself her passing soul in her eyes and looked at Kate Katherine Eleanor she said slowly and distinctly I m going now I can t fight it off any longer I confess myself I burned those deeds Every one of them Pa got himself afire but he d thrown THEM out of it It was my chance I took it Are you going to tell them Kate was standing as tall and straight as her mother her hands extended the same but not touching her No she said You were an instrument in the hands of God to right a great wrong No I shall never tell a soul while I live In a minute God himself will tell you that you did what He willed you should Well we will see about that right now said missus Bates lifting her face to the sky Into thy hands O Lord into thy hands Then she closed her eyes and ceased to breathe Kate took her into her arms and carried her to her bed CHAPTER XXII SOMEWHAT OF POLLY IF THE spirit of missus Bates hovered among the bloom whitened apple trees as her mortal remains were carried past the lilacs and cabbage rose bushes through a rain of drifting petals she must have been convinced that time had wrought one great change in the hearts of her children They had all learned to weep while if the tears they shed were a criterion of their feelings for her surely her soul must have been satisfied They laid her away with simple ceremony and then all of them went to their homes except Nancy Ellen and Robert who stopped in passing to learn if there was anything they could do for Kate She was grieving too deeply for many words none of them would ever understand the deep bond of sympathy and companionship that had grown to exist between her and her mother She stopped at the front porch and sat down feeling unable to enter the house with Nancy Ellen who was deeply concerned over the lack of taste displayed in Agatha s new spring hat When Kate could endure it no longer she interrupted Why didn t all of them come What for asked Nancy Ellen They had a right to know what Mother had done said Kate in a low voice But what was the use asked Nancy Ellen Adam had been managing the administrator business for Mother and paying her taxes with his of course when she made a deed to you and had it recorded they told him All of us knew it for two years before she went after you And the new furniture was bought with your money so it s yours what was there to have a meeting about Mother didn t understand that you children knew said Kate Sometimes I thought there were a lot of things Mother didn t understand said Nancy Ellen and sometimes I thought she understood so much more than any of the rest of us that all of us would have had a big surprise if we could have seen her brain Yes I believe we would said Kate Do you mind telling me how the boys and girls feel about this Nancy Ellen laughed shortly Well the boys feel that you negotiated such a fine settlement of Father s affairs for them that they owe this to you The girls were pretty sore at first and some of them are nursing their wrath yet but there wasn t a thing on earth they could do All of them were perfectly willing that you should have something after the fire of course most of them thought Mother went too far I think so myself said Kate But she never came near me or wrote me or sent me even one word until the day she came after me I had nothing to do with it All of us know that Kate said Nancy Ellen You needn t worry We re all used to it and we re all at the place where we have nothing to say To escape grieving for her mother Kate worked that summer as never before Adam was growing big enough and strong enough to be a real help He was interested in all they did always after the reason and trying to think of a better way Kate secured the best agricultural paper for him and they read it nights together They kept an account book and set down all they spent and balanced against it all they earned putting the difference which was often more than they hoped for in the bank So the years ran As the children grew older Polly discovered that the nicest boy in school lived across the road half a mile north of them while Adam after a real struggle in his loyal twin soul aided by the fact that Henry Peters usually had divided his apples with Polly before Adam reached her discovered that Milly York across the road half a mile south liked his apples best and was as nice a girl as Polly ever dared to be In a dazed way Kate learned these things from their after school and Sunday talk saw that they nearly reached her shoulder and realized that they were sixteen So quickly the time goes when people are busy happy and working together At least Kate and Adam were happy for they were always working together By tacit agreement they left Polly the easy housework and went themselves to the fields to wrestle with the rugged work of a farm They thought they were shielding Polly teaching her a woman s real work and being kind to her Polly thought they were together because they liked to be doing the farm work because it suited them better while she had known from babyhood that for some reason her mother did not care for her as she did for Adam She thought at first that it was because Adam was a boy Later when she noticed her mother watching her every time she started to speak and interrupting with the never failing caution Now be careful THINK before you speak Are you SURE she wondered why this should happen to her always to Adam never She asked Adam about it but Adam did not know It never occurred to Polly to ask her mother while Kate was so uneasy it never occurred to her that the child would notice or what she would think The first time Polly deviated slightly from the truth she and Kate had a very terrible time Kate felt fully justified the child astonished and abused Polly arrived at the solution of her problem slowly As she grew older she saw that her mother who always was charitable to everyone else was repelled by her grandmother while she loved Aunt Ollie Older still Polly realized that SHE was a reproduction of her grandmother She had only to look at her to see this her mother did not like her grandmother maybe Mother did not like her as well as Adam because she resembled her grandmother By the time she was sixteen Polly had arrived at a solution that satisfied her as to why her mother liked Adam better and always left her alone in the house to endless cooking dishwashing sweeping dusting washing and ironing while she hoed potatoes pitched hay or sheared sheep Polly thought the nicer way would have been to do the housework together and then go to the fields together but she was a good soul so she worked alone and brooded in silence and watched up the road for a glimpse of Henry Peters who liked to hear her talk and to whom it mattered not a mite that her hair was lustreless her eyes steel coloured and her nose like that of a woman he never had seen In her way Polly admired her mother loved her and worked until she was almost dropping for Kate s scant infrequent words of praise So Polly had to be content in the kitchen One day having finished her work two hours before dinnertime she sauntered to the front gate How strange that Henry Peters should be at the end of the field joining their land When he waved she waved back When he climbed the fence she opened the gate They met halfway under the bloomful shade of a red haw Henry wondered who two men he had seen leaving the Holt gate were and what they wanted but he was too polite to ask He merely hoped they did not annoy her Oh no they were only some men to see Mother about some business but it was most kind of him to let her know he was looking out for her She got so lonely Mother never would let her go to the field with her Of course not The field was no place for such a pretty girl there was enough work in the house for her His sister should not work in the field if he had a sister and Polly should not work there if she belonged to him No sir ee Polly looked at Henry with shining young girl eyes and when he said she was pretty her blue gray eyes softened her cheeks pinked up the sun put light in her hair nature had failed to and lo and behold the marvel was wrought plain little Polly became a thing of beauty She knew it instantly because she saw herself in Henry Peters eyes And Henry was so amazed when this wonderful transformation took place in little Polly right there under the red haw tree that his own eyes grew big and tender his cheeks flooded with red blood his heart shook him and he drew to full height and became possessed of an overwhelming desire to dance before Polly and sing to her He grew so splendid Polly caught her breath and then she smiled on him a very wondering smile over the great discovery and Henry grew so bewildered he forgot either to dance or sing as a preliminary He merely just merely reached out and gathered Polly in his arms and held her against him and stared down at her wonderful beauty opening right out under his eyes Little Beautiful said Henry Peters in a hushed choking voice Little Beautiful Polly looked up at him She was every bit as beautiful as he thought her while he was so beautiful to Polly that she gasped for breath How did he happen to look as he did right under the red haw in broad daylight He had been hers of course ever since shy and fearful she had first entered Bates Corners school and found courage in his broad encouraging smile Now she smiled on him the smile of possession that was in her heart Henry instantly knew she always had belonged to him so he grasped her closer and bent his head When Henry went back to the plow and Polly ran down the road with the joy of the world surging in her heart and brain she knew that she was going to have to account to her tired busy mother for being half an hour late with dinner and he knew he was going to have to explain to an equally tired father why he was four furrows short of where he should be He came to book first and told the truth He had seen some men go to the Holts Polly was his little chum and she was always alone all summer so he just walked that way to be sure she was safe His father looked at him quizzically So THAT S the way the wind blows he said Well I don t know where you could find a nicer little girl or a better worker I d always hoped you d take to Milly York but Polly is better she can work three of Milly down Awful plain though This sacrilege came while Henry s lips were tingling with their first kiss and his heart was drunken with the red wine of innocent young love Why Dad you re crazy he cried There isn t another girl in the whole world as pretty and sweet as Polly Milly York She can t hold a candle to Polly Besides she s been Adam s as long as Polly has been mine God bless my soul cried mister Peters How these youngsters to run away with us And are you the most beautiful young man at Bates Corners Henry I m beautiful enough that Polly will put her arms around my neck and kiss me anyway blurted Henry So you and Ma can get ready for a wedding as soon as Polly says the word I m ready right now So am I said mister Peters and from the way Ma complains about the work I and you boys make her I don t think she will object to a little help Polly is a good steady worker Polly ran but she simply could not light the fire set the table and get things cooked on time while everything she touched seemed to spill or slip She could not think what or how to do the usual for the very good reason that Henry Peters was a Prince and a Knight and a Lover and a Sweetheart and her Man she had just agreed to all this with her soul less than an hour ago under the red haw No wonder she was late no wonder she spilled and smeared and red of face she blundered and bungled for the first time in her life Then in came Kate She must lose no time the corn must be finished before it rained She must hurry for the first time dinner was late while Polly was messing like a perfect little fool Kate stepped in and began to right things with practised hand Disaster came when she saw Polly at the well take an instant from bringing in the water to wave in the direction of the Peters farm As she entered the door Kate swept her with a glance Have to upset the bowl as usual she said scathingly Just as I think you re going to make something of yourself and be of some use you begin mooning in the direction of that big gangling Hank Peters Don t you ever let me see you do it again You are too young to start that kind of foolishness I bet a cow he was hanging around here and made you late with dinner He was not He didn t either cried Polly then stopped in dismay her cheeks burning She gulped and went on bravely That is he wasn t here and he didn t make ME late any more than I kept HIM from his work He always watches when there are tramps and peddlers on the road because he knows I m alone I knew he would be watching two men who stopped to see you so I just went as far as the haw tree to tell him I was all right and we got to talking If only Kate had been looking at Polly then But she was putting the apple butter and cream on the table As she did so she thought possibly it was a good idea to have Henry Peters seeing that tramps did not frighten Polly so she missed dawn on the face of her child and instead of what might have been she said Well I must say THAT is neighbourly of him but don t you dare let him get any foolish notions in his head I think Aunt Nancy Ellen will let you stay at her house after this and go to the Hartley High School in winter so you can come out of that much better prepared to teach than I ever was I had a surprise planned for you to night but now I don t know whether you deserve it or not I ll have to think Kate did not think at all After the manner of parents she SAID that but her head was full of something she thought vastly more important just then of course Polly should have her share in it Left alone to wash the dishes and cook supper while her mother went to town it was Polly who did the thinking She thought entirely too much thought bitterly thought disappointedly and finally thought resentfully and then alas Polly thought deceitfully Her mother had said Never let me see you Very well she would be extremely careful that she was NOT seen but before she slept she rather thought she would find a way to let Henry know how she was being abused and about that plan to send her away all the long winter to school She rather thought Henry would have something to say about how his Little Beautiful was being treated Here Polly looked long and searchingly in the mirror to see if by any chance Henry was mistaken and she discovered he was She stared in amazement at the pink cheeked shining eyed girl she saw mirrored She pulled her hair looser around the temples and drew her lips over her teeth Surely Henry was mistaken Little Beautiful was too moderate She would see that he said perfectly lovely the next time and he did CHAPTER XXIII KATE S HEAVENLY TIME ONE evening Kate and Polly went to the front porch to rest until bedtime and found a shining big new trunk sitting there with Kate s initials on the end her name on the check tag and a key in the lock They unbuckled the straps turned the key and lifted the lid That trunk contained underclothing hose shoes two hats a travelling dress with half a dozen extra waists and an afternoon and an evening dress all selected with especial reference to Kate s colouring and made one size larger than Nancy Ellen wore which fitted Kate perfectly There were gloves a parasol and a note which read DEAR KATE Here are some clothes I am going to go North a week after harvest You can be spared then as well as not Come on Let s run away and have one good time all by ourselves It is my treat from start to finish The children can manage the farm perfectly well Any one of her cousins will stay with Polly if she will be lonely Cut loose and come on Kate I am going Of course Robert couldn t be pried away from his precious patients we will have to go alone but we do not care We like it Shall we start about the tenth on the night train which will be cooler NANCY ELLEN We shall said Kate emphatically when she finished the note I haven t cut loose and had a good time since I was married not for eighteen years If the children are not big enough to take care of themselves they never will be I can go as well as not She handed the note to Polly while she shook out dresses and gloated over the contents of the trunk Of course you shall go shouted Polly as she finished the note but even as she said it she glanced obliquely up the road and waved a hand behind her mother s back Sure you shall go cried Adam when he finished the note and sat beside the trunk seeing all the pretty things over again You just bet you shall go Polly and I can keep house fine We don t need any cousins hanging around I ll help Polly with her work and then we ll lock the house and she can come out with me Sure you go We ll do all right Then he glanced obliquely down the road where a slim little figure in white moved under the cherry trees of the York front yard aimlessly knocking croquet balls here and there It was two weeks until time to go but Kate began taking care of herself at once solely because she did not want Nancy Ellen to be ashamed of her She rolled her sleeves down to meet her gloves and used a sunbonnet instead of a sunshade She washed and brushed her hair with care she had not used in years By the time the tenth of July came she was in very presentable condition while the contents of the trunk did the remainder As she was getting ready to go she said to Polly Now do your best while I m away and I am sure I can arrange with Nancy Ellen about school this winter When I get back the very first thing I shall do will be to go to Hartley and buy some stuff to begin on your clothes You shall have as nice dresses as the other girls too Nancy Ellen will know exactly what to get you But she never caught a glimpse of Polly s flushed dissatisfied face or the tightening of her lips that would have suggested to her had she seen them that Miss Polly felt perfectly capable of selecting the clothing she was to wear herself Adam took his mother s trunk to the station in the afternoon In the evening she held Polly on her knee while they drove to doctor Gray s Kate thought the children would want to wait and see them take the train but Adam said that would make them very late getting home they had better leave that to Uncle Robert and go back soon so very soon they were duly kissed and unduly cautioned then started back down a side street that would not even take them through the heart of the town Kate looked after them approvingly Pretty good youngsters she said I told them to go and get some ice cream but you see they are saving the money and heading straight home She turned to Robert Can anything happen to them she asked in evident anxiety Rest in peace Kate laughed the doctor You surely know that those youngsters are going to be eighteen in a few weeks You ve reared them carefully Nothing can or will happen to them that would not happen right under your nose if you were at home They will go from now on according to their inclinations Kate looked at him sharply What do you mean by that she demanded He laughed Nothing serious he said Polly is half Bates so she will marry in a year or two while Adam is all Bates so he will remain steady as the Rock of Ages and strictly on the job Go have your good time and if I possibly can I ll come after you You ll do nothing of the kind said Nancy Ellen with finality You wouldn t leave your patients and you couldn t leave dear missus Southey If you feel that way about it why do you leave me he asked To show the little fool I m not afraid of her for one thing said Nancy Ellen with her head high She was very beautiful in her smart travelling dress while her eyes flashed as she spoke The doctor looked at her approvingly Good he cried I like a plucky woman Go to have a good time Nancy Ellen but don t go for that I do wish you would believe that there isn t a thing the matter with the little woman she s I can go even farther than that said Nancy Ellen dryly I KNOW there isn t a thing the matter with the little woman except that she wants you to look as if you were running after her I d be safe in wagering a thousand dollars that when she hears I m gone she will send for you before to morrow evening You may also wager this he said If she does I shall be very sorry but I m on my way to the country on an emergency call Nancy Ellen I wish you wouldn t Wouldn t go North or wouldn t see what every other living soul in Hartley sees she asked curtly Then she stepped inside to put on her hat and gloves Kate looked at the doctor in dismay Oh Robert she said I give you my word of honour Kate he said If Nancy Ellen only would be reasonable the woman would see shortly that my wife is all the world to me I never have been and never shall be untrue to her Does that satisfy you Of course said Kate I ll do all in my power to talk Nancy Ellen out of that on this trip Oh if she only had children to occupy her time That s the whole trouble in a nutshell said the doctor but you know there isn t a scarcity of children in the world Never a day passes but I see half a dozen who need me sorely But with Nancy Ellen NO CHILD will do unless she mothers it and unfortunately none comes to her Too bad said Kate I m so sorry Cheer her up if you can said the doctor An hour later they were speeding north Nancy Ellen moody and distraught Kate as frankly delighted as any child The spring work was over the crops were fine Adam would surely have the premium wheat to take to the County Fair in September he would work unceasingly for his chance with corn he and Polly would be all right she could see Polly waiting in the stable yard while Adam unharnessed and turned out the horse Kate kept watching Nancy Ellen s discontented face At last she said Cheer up child There isn t a word of truth in it I know it said Nancy Ellen Then why take the way of all the world to start and KEEP people talking asked Kate I m not doing a thing on earth but attending strictly to my own business said Nancy Ellen That s exactly the trouble said Kate You re not You let the little heifer have things all her own way If it were my man and I loved him as you do Robert Gray you can stake your life I should be doing something several things in fact This is interesting said Nancy Ellen For example Kate had not given such a matter a thought She looked from the window a minute her lips firmly compressed Then she spoke slowly Well for one thing I should become that woman s bosom companion About seven times a week I should uncover her most aggravating weakness all unintentionally before the man in the case at the same time keeping myself strictly myself I should keep steadily on doing and being what he first fell in love with Lastly since eighteen years have brought you no fulfillment of the desire of your heart I should give it up and content myself and delight him by taking into my heart and home a couple of the most attractive tiny babies I could find Two are scarcely more trouble than one you can have all the help you will accept the children would never know the difference if you took them as babies and soon you wouldn t either while Robert would be delighted If I were you I d give myself something to work for besides myself and I d give him so much to think about at home that charming young grass widows could go to grass I believe you would said Nancy Ellen wonderingly I believe you would You re might right I would said Kate If I were married to a man like Robert Gray I d fight tooth and nail before I d let him fall below his high ideals It s as much your job to keep him up as it is his to keep himself If God didn t make him a father I would and I d keep him BUSY on the job if I had to adopt sixteen Nancy Ellen laughed as they went to their berths The next morning they awakened in cool Michigan country and went speeding north among evergreen forests and clear lakes mirroring the pointed forest tops and blue sky past slashing splashing streams in which they could almost see the speckled trout darting over the beds of white sand By late afternoon they had reached their destination and were in their rooms bathed dressed and ready for the dinner hour In the evening they went walking coming back to the hotel tired and happy After several days they began talking to people and making friends going out in fishing and boating parties in the morning driving or boating in the afternoon and attending concerts or dances at night Kate did not dance but she loved to see Nancy Ellen when she had a sufficiently tall graceful partner while as she watched the young people and thought how innocent and happy they seemed she asked her sister if they could not possibly arrange for Adam and Polly to go to Hartley a night or two a week that winter and join the dancing class Nancy Ellen was frankly delighted so Kate cautiously skirted the school question in such a manner that she soon had Nancy Ellen asking if it could not be arranged When that was decided Nancy Ellen went to dance while Kate stood on the veranda watching her The lights from the window fell strongly on Kate She was wearing her evening dress of smoky gray soft fabric over shining silk with knots of dull blue velvet and gold lace here and there She had dressed her hair carefully she appeared what she was a splendid specimen of healthy vigorous clean womanhood Pardon me missus Holt said a voice at her elbow but there s only one head in this world like yours so this of course must be you Kate s heart leaped and stood still She turned slowly then held out her hand smiling at John Jardine but saying not a word He took her hand and as he gripped it tightly he studied her frankly Thank God for this he said fervently For years I ve dreamed of you and hungered for the sight of your face but you cut me off squarely so I dared not intrude on you only the Lord knows how delighted I am to see you here looking like this Kate smiled again Come away he begged Come out of this Come walk a little way with me and tell me WHO you are and HOW you are and all the things I think of every day of my life and now I must know It s brigandage Come or I shall carry you Pooh You couldn t laughed Kate Of course I ll come And I don t own a secret Ask anything you want to know How good it is to see you Your mother At rest years ago he said She never forgave me for what I did in the way I did it She said it would bring disaster and she was right I thought it was not fair and honest not to let you know the worst I thought I was too old and too busy and too flourishing to repair neglected years at that date but believe me Kate you waked me up Try the hardest one you know and if I can t spell it I ll pay a thousand to your pet charity Kate laughed spontaneously Are you in earnest she asked I am incomprehensibly immeasurably in earnest he said guiding her down a narrow path to a shrub enclosed railed in platform built on the steep side of a high hill where they faced the moon whitened waves rolling softly in a dancing procession across the face of the great inland sea Here he found a seat I ve nothing to tell he said I lost Mother so I went on without her I learned to spell and a great many other things and I m still making money I never forget you for a day I never have loved and never shall love any other woman That s all about me in a nutshell now go on and tell me a volume tell me all night about you Heavens woman I wish you could see yourself in that dress with the moon on your hair Kate you are the superbest thing I always shall be mad about you Oh if only you could have had a little patience with me I thought I COULDN T learn but of course I COULD But proceed I mustn t let myself go Kate leaned back and looked a long time at the shining white waves and the deep blue sky then she turned to John Jardine and began to talk She told him simply a few of the most presentable details of her life how she had lost her money then had been given her mother s farm about the children and how she now lived He listened with deep interest often interrupting to ask a question and when she ceased talking he said half under his breath And you re now free Oh the wonder of it You re now free Kate had that night to think about the remainder of her life She always sincerely hoped that the moonlight did not bewitch her into leading the man beside her into saying things he seemed to take delight in saying She had no idea what time it was in fact she did not care even what Nancy Ellen thought or whether she would worry The night was wonderful John Jardine had now made a man of himself worthy of all consideration being made love to by him was enchanting She had been occupied with the stern business of daily bread for so long that to be again clothed as other women and frankly adored by such a man as John Jardine was soul satisfying What did she care who worried or what time it was But I m keeping you here until you will be wet with these mists John Jardine cried at last Forgive me Kate I never did have any sense where you were concerned I ll take you back now but you must promise me to meet me here in the morning say at ten o clock I ll take you back now if you ll agree to that There s no reason why I shouldn t said Kate And you re free free he repeated The veranda halls and ballroom were deserted when they returned to the hotel As Kate entered her room Nancy Ellen sat up in bed and stared at her sleepily but she was laughing in high good humour She drew her watch from under her pillow and looked at it Goodness gracious Miss she cried Do you know it s almost three o clock I don t care in the least said Kate if it s four or five I ve had a perfectly heavenly time Don t talk to me I ll put out the light and be quiet as soon as I get my dress off I think likely I ve ruined it What s the difference demanded Nancy Ellen largely You can ruin half a dozen a day now if you want to What do you mean asked Kate Mean laughed Nancy Ellen I mean that I saw John Jardine or his ghost come up to you on the veranda looking as if he d eat you alive and carry you away about nine o clock and you ve been gone six hours and come back having had a perfectly heavenly time What should I mean Go up head Kate You have earned your right to a good time It isn t everybody who gets a second chance in this world Tell me one thing and I ll go to sleep in peace and leave you to moon the remainder of the night if you like Did he say he still loved you Still and yet laughed Kate As I remember his exact words were that he never had loved and never would love any other woman Now are you satisfied Nancy Ellen sprang from the bed and ran to Kate gathering her in her strong arms She hugged and kissed her ecstatically Good Good Oh you darling she cried There ll be nothing in the world you can t have I just know he had gone on making money he was crazy about you Oh Kate this is too good How did I ever think of coming here and why didn t I think of it seven years ago Kate you must promise me you ll marry him before I let you go I ll promise to THINK about it said Kate trying to free herself for despite the circumstances and the hour her mind flew back to a thousand times when only one kind word from Nancy Ellen would have saved her endless pain It was endless for it was burning in her heart that instant At the prospect of wealth position and power Nancy Ellen could smother her with caresses but poverty pain and disgrace she had endured alone I shan t let you go till you promise threatened Nancy Ellen When are you to see him again Ten this morning said Kate You better let me get to bed or I ll look a sight Then promise said Nancy Ellen Kate laid firm hands on the encircling arms Now look here she said shortly it s about time to stop this nonsense There s nothing I can promise you I must have time to think I ve got not only myself but the children to think for And I ve only got till ten o clock so I better get at it Kate s tone made Nancy Ellen step back Kate you haven t still got that letter in your mind have you she demanded No laughed Kate I haven t He offered me a thousand dollars if I could pronounce him a word he couldn t spell and it s perfectly evident he s studied until he is exactly like anybody else No it s not that Then what is it Simpleton there WAS nothing else cried Nancy Ellen Not so much at that time but this is nearly twenty years later and I have the fate of my children in my hands I wish you d go to bed and let me think said Kate Yes and the longer you think the crazier you will act cried Nancy Ellen I know you You better promise me now and stick to it For answer Kate turned off the light but she did not go to bed She sat beside the window and she was still sitting there when dawn crept across the lake and began to lighten the room Then she stretched herself beside Nancy Ellen who roused and looked at her You just coming to bed she cried in wonder At least you can t complain that I didn t think said Kate but Nancy Ellen found no comfort in what she said or the way she said it In fact she arose when Kate did feeling distinctly sulky As they returned to their room from breakfast Kate laid out her hat and gloves and began to get ready to keep her appointment Nancy Ellen could endure the suspense no longer Kate she said in her gentlest tones if you have no mercy on yourself have some on your children You ve no right positively no right to take such a chance away from them Chance for what asked Kate tersely Education travel leisure every opportunity in the world enumerated Nancy Ellen Kate was handling her gloves her forehead wrinkled her eyes narrowed in concentration That is one side of it she said The other is that neither my children nor I have in our blood breeding or mental cosmos the background that it takes to make one happy with money in unlimited quantities So far as I m concerned personally I m happier this minute as I am than John Jardine s money ever could make me I had a fierce struggle with that question long ago since I have had nearly eight years of life I love that is good for my soul the struggle to leave it would be greater now Polly would be happier and get more from life as the wife of big gangling Henry Peters than she would as a millionaire s daughter She d be very suitable in a farmhouse parlour she d be a ridiculous little figure at a ball As for Adam he d turn this down quick and hard Just you try him cried Nancy Ellen For one thing he won t be here at ten o clock said Kate and for another since it involves my becoming the wife of John Jardine it isn t for Adam to decide This decision is strictly my own I merely mention the children because if I married him it would have an inevitable influence on their lives an influence that I don t in the least covet either for them or for myself Nancy Ellen can t you remotely conceive of such a thing as one human being in the world who is SATISFIED THAT HE HAS HIS SHARE and who believes to the depths of his soul that no man should be allowed to amass and to use for his personal indulgence the amount of money that John Jardine does Yes I can cried Nancy Ellen when I see you and the way you act You have chance after chance but you seem to think that life requires of you a steady job of holding your nose to the grindstone It was rather stubby to begin with go on and grind it clear off your face if you like All right said Kate Then I ll tell you definitely that I have no particular desire to marry anybody I like my life immensely as I m living it I m free independent and my children are in the element to which they were born and where they can live naturally and spend their lives helping in the great work of feeding clothing and housing their fellow men I ve no desire to leave my job or take them from theirs to start a lazy shiftless life of self indulgence I don t meddle much with the Bible but I have a profound BELIEF in it and a large RESPECT for it as the greatest book in the world and it says By the sweat of his brow shall man earn his bread or words to that effect I was born a sweater I shall just go on sweating until I die I refuse to begin perspiring at my time of life You big fool cried Nancy Ellen Look out You re in danger of Hell fire when you call me that warned Kate Fire away cried Nancy Ellen with tears in her eyes and voice When I think what you ve gone through Kate stared at her fixedly What do you know about what I ve gone though she demanded in a cold even voice Personally I think you re not qualified to MENTION that subject you better let it rest Whatever it has been it s been of such a nature that I have come out of it knowing when I have my share and when I m well off for me If John Jardine wants to marry me and will sell all he has and come and work on the farm with me I ll consider marrying him To leave my life and what I love to go to Chicago with him I do not feel called on or inclined to do No I ll not marry him and in about fifteen minutes I ll tell him so And go on making a mess of your life such as you did for years said Nancy Ellen drying her red eyes At least it was my life said Kate I didn t mess things for any one else Except your children said Nancy Ellen As you will said Kate rising I ll not marry John Jardine and the sooner I tell him so and get it over the better Good bye I ll be back in half an hour Kate walked slowly to the observation platform where she had been the previous evening with John Jardine and leaning on the railing she stood looking out over the water and down the steep declivity thinking how best she could word what she had to say She was so absorbed she did not hear steps behind her or turn until a sharp voice said You needn t wait any longer He s not coming Kate turned and glanced at the speaker and then around to make sure she was the person being addressed She could see no one else The woman was small light haired her face enamelled dressed beyond all reason and in a manner wholly out of place for morning at a summer resort in Michigan If you are speaking to me will you kindly tell me to whom you refer and give me the message you bring said Kate I refer to mister John Jardine missus Holt said the little woman and then Kate saw that she was shaking and gripping her hands for self control Very well said Kate It will save me an unpleasant task if he doesn t come Thank you and she turned back to the water You certainly didn t find anything unpleasant about being with him half last night said the little woman Kate turned again and looked narrowly at the speaker Then she laughed heartily Well done Jennie she cried Why you are such a fashionable lady such a Dolly Varden I never saw who you were How do you do Won t you sit down and have a chat It s just dawning on me that very possibly from your dress and manner I SHOULD have called you missus Jardine Didn t he tell you cried Jennie He did not said Kate Your name was not mentioned He said no word about being married We have been married since a few weeks after missus Jardine died I taught him the things you turned him down for not knowing I have studied him and waited on him and borne his children and THIS is my reward What are you going to do Go back to the hotel when I finish with this view said Kate I find it almost as attractive by day as it was by night Brazen cried missus Jardine Choose your words carefully said Kate I was here first since you have delivered your message suppose you go and leave me to my view Not till I get ready said missus Jardine Perhaps it will help you to know that I was not twenty feet from you at any time last night and that I stood where I could have touched you while my husband made love to you for hours So said Kate I m not at all surprised That s exactly what I should have expected of you But doesn t it clarify the situation any at least for me when I tell you that mister Jardine gave me no faintest hint that he was married If you heard all we said you surely remember that you were not mentioned missus Jardine sat down suddenly and gripped her little hands Kate studied her intently She wondered what she would look like when her hair was being washed at this thought she smiled broadly That made the other woman frantic You can well LAUGH at me she said I made the banner fool of the ages of myself when I schemed to marry him I knew he loved you He told me so He told me just as he told you last night that he never had loved any other woman and he never would I thought he didn t know himself as I knew him He was so grand to his mother I thought if I taught him and helped him back to self respect and gave him children he must and would love me Well I was mistaken He does not and never will Every day he thinks of you not a night but he speaks your name He thinks all things can be done with money So do you Jennie interrupted Kate Well I ll show you that this CAN T Didn t you hear him exulting because you are now free cried Jennie He thinks he will give me a home the children a big income then secure his freedom and marry you Oh don t talk such rot cried Kate John Jardine thinks no such thing He wouldn t insult me by thinking I thought such a thing That thought belongs where it sprang from right in your little cramped blonde brain Jennie You wouldn t Are you sure you wouldn t cried Jennie leaning forward with hands clutched closely I should say not said Kate The last thing on earth I want is some other woman s husband Now look here Jennie I ll tell you the plain truth I thought last night that John Jardine was as free as I was or I shouldn t have been here with him I thought he was asking me again to marry him and I was not asleep last night thinking it over I came here to tell him that I would not Does that satisfy you Satisfy cried Jennie I hope no other woman lives in the kind of Hell I do It s always the way said Kate when people will insist on getting out of their class You would have gotten ten times more from life as the wife of a village merchant or a farmer than you have as the wife of a rich man Since you re married to him and there are children there s nothing for you to do but finish your job as best you can Rest your head easy about me I wouldn t touch John Jardine married to you I wouldn t touch him with a ten foot pole divorced from you Get that clear in your head and do please go Kate turned again to the water but when she was sure Jennie was far away she sat down suddenly and asked of the lake Well wouldn t that freeze you CHAPTER XXIV POLLY TRIES HER WINGS FINALLY Kate wandered back to the hotel and went to their room to learn if Nancy Ellen was there She was and seemed very much perturbed The first thing she did was to hand Kate a big white envelope which she opened and found to be a few lines from John Jardine explaining that he had been unexpectedly called away on some very important business He reiterated his delight in having seen her and hoped for the same pleasure at no very distant date Kate read it and tossed it on the dresser As she did so she saw a telegram lying opened among Nancy Ellen s toilet articles and thought with pleasure that Robert was coming She glanced at her sister for confirmation and saw that she was staring from the window as if she were in doubt about something Kate thought probably she was still upset about John Jardine and that might as well be gotten over so she said That note was not delivered promptly It is from John Jardine I should have had it before I left He was called away on important business and wrote to let me know he would not be able to keep his appointment but without his knowledge he had a representative on the spot Nancy Ellen seemed interested so Kate proceeded You couldn t guess in a thousand years I ll have to tell you spang It was his wife His wife cried Nancy Ellen But you said So I did said Kate And so he did Since the wife loomed on the horizon I remembered that he said no word to me of marriage he merely said he always had loved me and always would Merely scoffed Nancy Ellen Merely Just merely said Kate He didn t lay a finger on me he didn t ask me to marry him he just merely met me after a long separation and told me that he still loved me The brute said Nancy Ellen He should be killed I can t see it said Kate He did nothing ungentlemanly If we jumped to wrong conclusions that was not his fault I doubt if he remembered or thought at all of his marriage It wouldn t be much to forget I am fresh from an interview with his wife She s an old acquaintance of mine I once secured her for his mother s maid You ve heard me speak of her Impossible John Jardine would not do that cried Nancy Ellen There s a family to prove it said Kate Jennie admits that she studied him taught him made herself indispensable to him and a few weeks after his mother s passing married him after he had told her he did not love her and never could I feel sorry for him Sure Poor defrauded creature said Nancy Ellen What about her Nothing so far as I can see said Kate By her own account she was responsible She should have kept in her own class All right That settles Jennie said Nancy Ellen I saw you notice the telegram from Robert now go on and settle me Is he coming asked Kate No he s not coming said Nancy Ellen Has he eloped with the widder asked Kate flippantly He merely telegraphs that he thinks it would be wise for us to come home on the first train said Nancy Ellen For all I can make of that the elopement might quite as well be in your family as mine Kate held out her hand Nancy Ellen laid the message in it Kate studied it carefully then she raised steady eyes to her sister s face Do you know what I should do about this she asked Catch the first train of course she said Far be it from me said Kate I should at once telegraph him that his message was not clear to kindly particularize We ve only got settled We re having a fine time especially right now Why should we pack up and go home I can t think of any possibility that could arise that would make it necessary for him to send for us Can you I can think of two things said Nancy Ellen I can think of a very pretty confiding little cat of a woman who is desperately infatuated with my husband and I can think of two children fathered by George Holt who might possibly just possibly have enough of his blood in their veins to be like him given opportunity Alone for a week there is barely a FAINT possibility that YOU might be needed Alone for the same week there is the faintest possibility that ROBERT is in a situation where I could help him Kate drew a deep breath Isn t life the most amusing thing she asked I had almost forgotten my wings I guess we d better take them and fly straight home She arose and called the office to learn about trains and then began packing her trunk As she folded her dresses and stuffed them in rather carelessly she said I don t know why I got it into my head that I could go away and have a few days of a good time without something happening at home But you are not sure anything has happened at home This call may be for me said Nancy Ellen It MAY but this is July said Kate I ve been thinking hard and fast It s probable I can put my finger on the spot Nancy Ellen paused and standing erect she looked questioningly at Kate The weak link in my chain at the present minute is Polly said Kate I didn t pay much attention at the time because there wasn t enough of it really to attract attention but since I think I can recall signs of growing discontent in Polly lately She fussed about the work and resented being left in the house while I went to the fields and she had begun looking up the road to Peters so much that her head was slightly turned toward the north most of the time With me away What do you think demanded Nancy Ellen Think very likely she has decided that she ll sacrifice her chance for more schooling and to teach for the sake of marrying a big green country boy named Hank Peters said Kate Thereby keeping in her own class suggested Nancy Ellen Kate laughed shortly Exactly she said I didn t aspire to anything different for her from what she has had but I wanted her to have more education and wait until she was older Marriage is too hard work for a girl to begin at less than eighteen If it is Polly and she has gone away with Hank Peters they ve no place to go but his home and if ever she thought I worked her too hard she ll find out she has played most of her life when she begins taking orders from missus Amanda Peters You know her She never can keep a girl more than a week and she s always wanting one If Polly has tackled THAT job God help her Cheer up We re in that delightful state of uncertainty where Polly may be blacking the cook stove like a dutiful daughter while Robert has decided that he d like a divorce said Nancy Ellen Nancy Ellen there s nothing in that so far as Robert is concerned He told me so the evening we came away said Kate Nancy Ellen banged down a trunk lid and said Well I am getting to the place where I don t much care whether there is or there is not What a whopper laughed Kate But cheer up This is my trouble I feel it in my bones Wish I knew for sure If she s eloped and it s all over with we might as well stay and finish our visit If she s married I can t unmarry her and I wouldn t if I could How are you going to apply your philosophy to yourself asked Nancy Ellen By letting time and Polly take their course said Kate This is a place where parents are of no account whatever They stand back until it s time to clean up the wreck and then they get theirs usually theirs and several of someone s else in the bargain As the train stopped at Hartley Kate sat where she could see Robert on the platform It was only a fleeting glance but she thought she had never seen him look so wholesome so vital so much a man to be desired No wonder a woman lacking in fine scruples would covet him thought Kate To Nancy Ellen she said hastily The trouble s mine Robert s on the platform Where demanded Nancy Ellen peering from the window Kate smiled as she walked from the car and confronted Robert Get it over quickly she said It s Polly He nodded Did she remember to call on the Squire she asked Oh yes said Robert It was at Peters and they had the whole neighbourhood in Kate swayed slightly then lifted her head her eyes blazing She had come feeling not altogether guiltless and quite prepared to overlook a youthful elopement The insult of having her only daughter given a wedding at the home of the groom about which the whole neighbourhood would be laughing at her was a different matter Slowly the high colour faded from Kate s face as she stepped back Excuse me Nancy Ellen she said I didn t mean to deprive you of the chance of even speaking to Robert I KNEW this was for me I was over anxious to learn what choice morsel life had in store for me now It s one that will be bitter on my tongue to the day of my death Oh Kate I as so sorry that if this had to happen it happened in just that way said Nancy Ellen but don t mind They re only foolish kids Who mister and missus Peters and the neighbours who attended the wedding Foolish kids Oh no said Kate Where s Adam I told him I d bring you out said Robert Why didn t he send for you or do something demanded Kate I m afraid the facts are that Polly lied to him said Robert She told him that Peters were having a party and missus Peters wanted her to come early and help her with the supper They had the Magistrate out from town and had the ceremony an hour before Adam got there When he arrived and found out what had happened he told Polly and the Peters family exactly his opinion of them and then he went home and turned on all the lights and sat where he could be seen on the porch all evening as a protest in evidence of his disapproval I take it Slowly the colour began to creep back into Kate s face The good boy she said in commendation He called me at once and we talked it over and I sent you the telegram but as he said it was done there was no use trying to undo it One thing will be a comfort to you All of your family and almost all of your friends left as soon as Adam spoke his piece and they found it was a wedding and not a party to which they d been invited It was a shabby trick of Peters Kate assented It was because I felt instinctively that missus Peters had it in her to do tricks like that that I never would have anything to do with her said Kate more than to be passing civil This is how she gets her revenge and her hired girl for no wages I ll be bound It s a shabby trick I m glad Adam saved me the trouble of telling her so Robert took Nancy Ellen home and then drove to Bates Corners with Kate In a few days now I hope we can see each other oftener he said on the way I got a car yesterday and it doesn t seem so complicated Any intelligent person can learn to drive in a short time I like it so much and I knew I d have such constant use for it that now this is a secret I ordered another for Nancy Ellen so she can drive about town and run out here as she chooses Will she be pleased She ll be overjoyed That was dear of you Robert Only one thing in world would please her more said Kate What s that asked Robert Kate looked him in the eye and smiled Oh he said But there is nothing in it Except TALK that worries and humiliates Nancy Ellen said Kate Kate he said suddenly if you were in my shoes what would you do The next time I got a phone call or a note from missus Southey and she was having one of those terrible headaches I should say I m dreadfully sorry missus Southey but a breath of talk that might be unpleasant for you and for my wife has come to my ear so I know you ll think it wiser to call doctor Mills who can serve you better than I In a great rush this afternoon Good bye THAT is what I should do Robert and I should do it quickly and emphatically Then I should interest Nancy Ellen in her car for a time and then I should keep my eyes open and the first time I found in my practice a sound baby with a clean bill of health and no encumbrances I should have it dressed attractively and bestow it on Nancy Ellen as casually as I did the car And in the meantime love her plenty Robert You can never know how she FEELS about this and it s in no way her fault She couldn t possibly have known while you would have married her just the same if you had known Isn t that so It s quite so Kate I think your head is level and I ll follow your advice to the letter Now you have healed my lame leg as the dog said in McGuffey s Third what can I do for THIS poor dog Nothing said Kate I ve got to hold still and take it Life will do the doing I don t want to croak but remember my word it will do plenty We ll come often he said as he turned to go back Kate slowly walked up the path dreading to meet Adam He evidently had been watching for her for he came around the corner of the house took her arm and they walked up the steps and into the living room together She looked at him he looked at her At last he said I m afraid that a good deal of this is my fault Mother How so asked Kate tersely I guess I betrayed your trust in me said Adam heavily Of course I did all my work and attended to things but in the evening after work was over the very first evening on the way home we stopped to talk to Henry at the gate and he got in and came on down We could see Milly at their gate and I wanted her I wanted her so much Mother and it was going to be lonesome so all of us went on there and she came up here and we sat on the porch and then I took her home and that left Henry and Polly together The next night Henry took us to town for a treat and we were all together and the next night Milly asked us all there and so it went It was all as open and innocent as it could be only Henry and Polly were in awful earnest and she was bound she wouldn t be sent to town to school Why didn t she tell me so She never objected a word to me said Kate Well Mother you are so big and Polly was so little and she was used to minding Yes this looks like it said Kate Well go on That s all said Adam It was only that instead of staying at home and attending to our own affairs we were somewhere every night or Milly and Henry were here That is where I was to blame I m afraid you ll never forgive me Mother but I didn t take good care of Sister I left her to Henry Peters while I tried to see how nice I could be to Milly I didn t know what Polly and Henry were planning honest I didn t Mother I would have told Uncle Robert and sent for you if I had I thought when I went there it was to be our little crowd like it was at York s I was furious when I found they were married I told mister and missus Peters what they were right before the company and then I came straight home and all the family and York s and most of the others came straight away Only a few stayed to the supper I was so angry with Polly I just pushed her away and didn t even say good night to her The little silly fool Mother if she had told you you would have let her stay at home this winter and got her clothing and let her be married here when she was old enough wouldn t you Certainly said Kate All the world knows that Bates all marry and they all marry young Don t blame yourself Adam If Polly had it in her system to do this and she did or she wouldn t have done it the thing would have happened when I was here and right under my nose It was a scheme all planned and ready before I left I know that now Let it go There s nothing we can do until things begin to go WRONG as they always do in this kind of wedding then we shall get our call In the meantime you mustn t push your sister away She may need you sooner than you d think and will you just please have enough confidence in my common sense and love for you to come to me FIRST when you feel that there s a girl who is indispensable to your future Adam Yes I will said Adam And it won t be long and the girl will be Milly York All right said Kate gravely whenever the time comes let me know about it Now see if you can find me something to eat till I lay off my hat and wash It was a long hot ride and I m tired Since there s nothing I can do I wish I had stayed where I was No I don t either I see joy coming over the hill for Nancy Ellen Why is joy coming to Nancy Ellen asked the boy pausing an instant before he started to the kitchen Oh because she s had such a very tough uncomfortable time with life said Kate that in the very nature of things joy SHOULD come her way The boy stood mystified until the expression on his face so amused Kate that she began laughing then he understood That s WHY it s coming said Kate and here s HOW it s coming She is going to get rid of a bothersome worry that s troubling her head and she s going to have a very splendid gift but it s a deep secret Then you ll have to whisper it said Adam going to her and holding a convenient ear Kate rested her hands on his shoulder a minute as she leaned on him her face buried in his crisp black hair Then she whispered the secret Crickey isn t that grand cried the boy backing away to stare at her Yes it is so grand I m going to try it ourselves said Kate We ve a pretty snug balance in the bank and I think it would be great fun evenings or when we want to go to town in a hurry and the horses are tired Adam was slowly moving toward the kitchen his face more of a study than before Mother he said as he reached the door I be hanged if I know how to take you I thought you d just raise Cain over what Polly has done but you act so sane and sensible someway it doesn t seem so bad as it did and I feel more sorry for Polly than like going back on her And are you truly in earnest about a car I m going to think very seriously about it this winter and I feel almost sure it will come true by early spring said Kate But who said anything about going back on Polly Oh missus York and all the neighbours said that you d never forgive her and that she d never darken your door again and things like that until I was almost crazy answered Adam Kate smiled grimly Adam she said I had seven years of that darken you door business myself It s a mighty cold hard proposition It s a wonder the neighbours didn t remember that Maybe they did and thought I was so much of a Bates leopard that I couldn t change my spots If they are watching me they will find that I am not spotted I m sorry and humiliated over what Polly has done but I m not going to gnash my teeth and tear my hair and wail in public or in private I m trying to keep my real mean spot so deep it can t be seen If ever I get my chance Adam you watch me pay back missus Peters THAT is the size and location of my spot but it s far deeper than my skin Now go on and find me food man food Adam sat close while Kate ate her supper then he helped her unpack her trunk and hang away her dresses and then they sat on the porch talking for a long time When at last they arose to go to bed Kate said Adam about Polly first time you see her if she asks tell her she left home of her own free will and accord and in her own way which by the way happens to be a Holt way but you needn t mention that I think by this time she has learned or soon she will learn that and whenever she wants to come back and face me to come right ahead I can stand it if she can Can you get that straight Adam said he could He got that straight and so much else that by the time he finished Polly realized that both he and her mother had left her in the house to try to SHIELD her that if she had told what she wanted in a straightforward manner she might have had a wedding outfit prepared and been married from her home at a proper time and in a proper way and without putting her mother to shame before the community Polly was very much ashamed of herself by the time Adam finished She could not find it in her heart to blame Henry she knew he was no more to blame than she was but she did store up a grievance against mister and missus Peters They were older and had had experience with the world they might have told Polly what she should do instead of having done everything in their power to make her do what she had done bribing coaxing urging all in the direction of her inclinations At heart Polly was big enough to admit that she had followed her inclinations without thinking at all what the result would be Adam never would have done what she had Adam would have thought of his mother and his name and his honour Poor little Polly had to admit that honour with her had always been a matter of Now remember Be careful and like caution on the lips of her mother The more Polly thought the worse she felt The worse she felt the more the whole Peters family tried to comfort her She was violently homesick in a few days but Adam had said she was to come when she could face her mother and Polly suddenly found that she would rather undertake to run ten miles than to face her mother so she began a process of hiding from her If she sat on the porch and saw her mother coming she ran in the house She would go to no public place where she might meet her For a few weeks she lived a life of working for missus Peters from dawn to dark under the stimulus of what a sweet girl she was how splendidly she did things how fortunate Henry was interspersed with continual kissing patting and petting all very new and unusual to Polly By that time she was so very ill she could not lift her head from the pillow half the day but it was to the credit of the badly disappointed Peters family that they kept up the petting When Polly grew better she had no desire to go anywhere she worked to make up for the trouble she had been during her illness to sew every spare moment and to do her full share of the day s work in the house of an excessively nice woman whose work never was done and most hopeless thing of all never would be missus Peters head was full of things that she meant to do three years in the future Every night found Polly so tired she staggered to bed early as possible every morning found her confronting the same round which from the nature of her condition every morning was more difficult for her Kate and Adam followed their usual routine with only the alterations required by the absence of Polly Kate now prepared breakfast while Adam did the feeding and milking washed the dishes and made the beds while he hitched up then went to the field with him On rainy days he swept and she dusted always they talked over and planned everything they did in the house or afield always they schemed contrived economized and worked to attain the shortest easiest end to any result they strove for They were growing in physical force they were efficient they attended their own affairs strictly Their work was always done on time their place in order their deposits at the bank frequent As the cold days came they missed Polly but scarcely ever mentioned her They had more books and read and studied together while every few evenings Adam picked up his hat and disappeared but soon he and Milly came in together Then they all read popped corn made taffy knitted often Kate was called away by some sewing or upstairs work she wanted to do so that the youngsters had plenty of time alone to revel in the wonder of life s greatest secret To Kate s ears came the word that Polly would be a mother in the spring that the Peters family were delighted and anxious for the child to be a girl as they found six males sufficient for one family Polly was looking well feeling fine was a famous little worker and seldom sat on a chair because some member of the Peters family usually held her I should think she would get sick of all that mushing said Adam when he repeated these things She s not like us said Kate She ll take all she can get and call for more She s a long time coming but I m glad she s well and happy Buncombe said Adam She isn t so very well She s white as putty and there are great big dark hollows under her eyes and she s always panting for breath like she had been running Nearly every time I pass there I see her out scrubbing the porches or feeding the chickens or washing windows or something You bet missus Peters has got a fine hired girl now and she s smiling all over about it She really has something to smile about said Kate To Polly s ears went the word that Adam and her mother were having a fine time together always together and that they had Milly York up three times a week to spend the evening and that Milly said that it passed her to see why Polly ran away from missus Holt She was the grandest woman alive and if she had any running to do in her neighbourhood she would run TO her and not FROM her Whereupon Polly closed her lips firmly and looked black but not before she had said Well if Mother had done just one night a week of that entertaining for Henry and me we wouldn t have run from her either Polly said nothing until April then Kate answered the telephone one day and a few seconds later was ringing for Adam as if she would pull down the bell He came running and soon was on his way to Peters with the single buggy with instructions to drive slowly and carefully and on no account to let Polly slip getting out The Peters family had all gone to bury an aunt in the neighbourhood leaving Polly alone for the day and Polly at once called up her mother and said she was dying to see her and if she couldn t come home for the day she would die soon and be glad of it Kate knew the visit should not have been made at that time and in that way but she knew that Polly was under a dangerous nervous strain she herself would not go to Peters in missus Peters absence she did not know what else to do As she waited for Polly she thought of many things she would say when she saw her she took her in her arms and almost carried her into the house and she said nothing at all save how glad she was to see her and she did nothing at all except to try with all her might to comfort and please her for to Kate Polly did not seem like a strong healthy girl approaching maternity She appeared like a very sick woman who sorely needed attention while a few questions made her so sure of it that she at once called Robert He gave both of them all the comfort he could but what he told Nancy Ellen was Polly has had no attention whatever She wants me and I ll have to go but it s a case I d like to side step I ll do all I can but the time is short Oh Lord said Nancy Ellen Is it one more for Kate Yes said Robert I am very much afraid it s one more for Kate CHAPTER XXV ONE MORE FOR KATE POLLY and Kate had a long day together while Adam was about the house much of the time Both of them said and did everything they could think of to cheer and comfort Polly whose spirits seemed most variable One minute she would be laughing and planning for the summer gaily the next she would be gloomy and depressed and declaring she never would live through the birth of her baby If she had appeared well this would not have worried Kate but she looked even sicker than she seemed to feel She was thin while her hands were hot and tremulous As the afternoon went on and time to go came nearer she grew more and more despondent until Kate proposed watching when the Peters family came home calling them up and telling them that Polly was there would remain all night and that Henry should come down Polly flatly vetoed the proposition but she seemed to feel much better after it had been made She was like herself again for a short time and then she turned to Kate and said suddenly Mother if I don t get over this will you take my baby Kate looked at Polly intently What she saw stopped the ready answer that was on her lips She stood thinking deeply At last she said gently Why Polly would you want to trust a tiny baby with a woman you ran away from yourself Mother I haven t asked you to forgive me for the light I put you in before the neighbours said Polly because I knew you couldn t honestly do it and wouldn t lie to say you did I don t know WHAT made me do that I was TIRED staying alone at the house so much I was WILD about Henry I was BOUND I wouldn t leave him and go away to school I just thought it would settle everything easily and quickly I never once thought of how it would make you look and feel Honestly I didn t Mother You believe me don t you Yes I believe you said Kate It was an awful thing for me to do said Polly I was foolish and crazy and I suppose I shouldn t say it but I certainly did have a lot of encouragement from the Peters family They all seemed to think it would be a great joke that it wouldn t make any difference and all that so I just did it I knew I shouldn t have done it but Mother you ll never know the fight I ve had all my life to keep from telling stories and sneaking I hated your everlasting Now be careful but when I hated it most I needed it worst and I knew it when I grew older If only you had been here to say Now be careful just once I never would have done it but of course I couldn t have you to keep me straight all my life All I can say is that I d give my life and never whimper if I could be back home as I was this time last year and have a chance to do things your way But that is past and I can t change it What I came for to day and what I want to know now is if I go will you take my baby Polly you KNOW the Peters family wouldn t let me have it said Kate If it s a boy they wouldn t WANT it said Polly Neither would you for that matter If it s a girl they ll fight for it but it won t do them any good All I want to know is WILL YOU TAKE IT Of course I would Polly said Kate Since I have your word I ll feel better said Polly And Mother you needn t be AFRAID of it It will be all right I have thought about it so much I have it all figured out It s going to be a girl and it s going to be exactly like you and its name is going to be Katherine Eleanor I have thought about you every hour I was awake since I have been gone so the baby will have to be exactly like you There won t be the taint of Grandmother in it that there is in me You needn t be afraid I quit sneaking forever when Adam told me what I had done to you I have gone straight as a dart Mother every single minute since Mother truly I have Kate sat down suddenly an awful sickness in her heart Why you poor child you she said Oh I ve been all right said Polly I ve been almost petted and loved to death but Mother there never should be the amount of work attached to living that there is in that house It s never ending it s intolerable missus Peters just goes until she drops and then instead of sleeping she lies awake planning some hard foolish unnecessary thing to do next Maybe she can stand it herself but I m tired out I m going to sit down and not budge to do another stroke until after the baby comes and then I am going to coax Henry to rent a piece of land and move to ourselves Kate took heart That will be fine she cried That will be the very thing I ll ask the boys to keep their eyes open for any chance for you You needn t take any bother about it said Polly because that isn t what is going to happen All I want to be sure of now is that you and Adam will take my baby I ll see to the rest How will you see to it Polly asked Kate gently Well it s already seen to for matter of that said Polly conclusively I ve known for quite a while that I was sick but I couldn t make them do anything but kiss me and laugh at me until I am so ill that I know better how I feel than anybody else I got tired being laughed at and put off about everything so one day in Hartley while Mother Peters was shopping I just went in to the lawyer Grandmother always went to and told him all about what I wanted He has the papers made out all right and proper so when I send for Uncle Robert I am going to send for him too and soon as the baby comes I ll put in its name and sign it and make Henry and then if I have to go you won t have a bit of trouble Kate gazed at Polly in dumb amazement She was speechless for a time then to break the strain she said My soul Did you really Polly I guess there is more Bates in you than I had thought Oh there s SOME Bates in me said Polly There s enough to make me live until I sign that paper and make Henry Peters sign it and send mister Thomlins to you with it and the baby I can do that because I m going to Ten days later she did exactly what she had said she would Then she turned her face to the wall and went into a convulsion out of which she never came While the Peters family refused Kate s plea to lay Polly beside her grandmother and laid her in their family lot Kate moaning dumbly sat clasping a tiny red girl in her arms Adam drove to Hartley to deposit one more paper the most precious of all in the safety deposit box Kate and Adam mourned too deeply to talk about it They went about their daily rounds silently each busy with regrets and self investigations They watched each other carefully were kinder than they ever had been to everyone they came in contact with the baby they frankly adored Kate had reared her own children with small misgivings quite casually in fact but her heart was torn to the depths about this baby Life never would be even what it had been before Polly left them for into her going there entered an element of self reproach and continual self condemnation Adam felt that if he had been less occupied with Milly York and had taken proper care of his sister he would not have lost her Kate had less time for recrimination because she had the baby Look for a good man to help you this summer Adam she said The baby is full of poison which can be eliminated only slowly If I don t get it out before teething I ll lose her and then we never shall hear the last from the Peters family Adam consigned the Peters family to a location he thought suitable for them on the instant He spoke with unusual bitterness because he had heard that the Peters family were telling that Polly had grieved herself to death while his mother had engineered a scheme whereby she had stolen the baby Occasionally a word drifted to Kate here and there until she realized much of what they were saying At first she grieved too deeply to pay any attention but as the summer went on and the baby flourished and grew fine and strong and she had time in the garden she began to feel better grief began to wear away as it always does By midsummer the baby was in short clothes sitting in a high chair which if Miss Baby only had known it was a throne before which knelt her two adoring subjects Polly had said the baby would be like Kate Its hair and colouring were like hers but it had the brown eyes of its father and enough of his facial lines to tone down the too generous Bates features When the baby was five months old it was too pretty for adequate description One baby has no business with perfect features a mop of curly yellow silk hair and big brown eyes One of the questions Kate and Adam discussed most frequently was where they would send her to college while one they did not discuss was how sick her stomach teeth would make her They merely lived in mortal dread of that Convulsion was a word that held a terror for Kate above any other in the medical books The baby had a good formal name but no one ever used it Adam on first lifting the blanket had fancied the child resembled its mother and had called her Little Poll The name clung to her Kate could not call such a tiny morsel either Kate or Katherine she liked Little Poll better The baby had three regular visitors One was her father He was not fond of Kate Little Poll suited him He expressed his feeling by bringing gifts of toys candy and unsuitable clothes Kate kept these things in evidence when she saw him coming and swept them from sight when he went for she had the good sense not to antagonize him Nancy Ellen came almost every day proudly driving her new car and with the light of a new joy on her face She never said anything to Kate but Kate knew what had happened Nancy Ellen came to see the baby She brought it lovely and delicate little shoes embroidered dresses and hoods cloaks and blankets One day as she sat holding it she said to Kate Isn t the baby a dreadful bother to you You re not getting half your usual work done No I m doing UNUSUAL work said Kate lightly Adam is hiring a man who does my work very well in the fields there isn t money that would hire me to let any one else take my job indoors right now A slow red crept into Nancy Ellen s cheeks She had meant to be diplomatic but diplomacy never worked well with Kate As Nancy Ellen often said Kate understood a sledge hammer better Nancy Ellen used the hammer Her face flushed her arms closed tightly Give me this baby she demanded Kate looked at her in helpless amazement Give it to me repeated Nancy Ellen She s a gift to me said Kate slowly One the Peters family are searching heaven and earth to find an excuse to take from me I hear they ve been to a lawyer twice already I wouldn t give her up to save my soul alive for myself for you if I would let you have her they would not leave you in possession a day Are they really trying to get her asked Nancy Ellen slowly loosening her grip They are said Kate They sent a lawyer to get a copy of the papers to see if they could pick a flaw in them Can they cried Nancy Ellen God knows said Kate slowly I HOPE not mister Thomlins is the best lawyer in Hartley he says not He says Henry put his neck in the noose when he signed the papers The only chance I can see for him would be to plead undue influence When you look at her you can t blame him for wanting her I ve two hopes One that his mother will not want the extra work the other that the next girl he selects will not want the baby If I can keep them going a few months more with a teething scare I hope they will get over wanting her If they do then may we have her asked Nancy Ellen Kate threw out her hands Take my eyes or my hands or my feet she said but leave me my heart Nancy Ellen went soon after and did not come again for several days Then she began coming as usual so that the baby soon knew her and laughed in high glee when she appeared doctor Gray often stopped in passing to see her if he was in great haste he hallooed at the gate to ask if she was all right Kate was thankful for this more than thankful for the telephone and car that would bring him in fifteen minutes day or night if he were needed But he was not needed Little Poll throve and grew fat and rosy for she ate measured food slept by the clock in a sanitary bed and was a bathed splendidly cared for baby When Kate s family and friends laughed she paid not the slightest heed Laugh away she said I ve got something to fight with this baby I don t propose for the battle to come and find the chances against me because I m unprepared With scrupulous care Kate watched over the child always putting her first the house and land afterward One day she looked up the road and saw Henry Peters coming She had been expecting Nancy Ellen She had finished bathing the baby and making her especially attractive in a dainty lace ruffled dress with blue ribbons and blue shoes that her sister had brought on her latest trip Little Poll was a wonderful picture for her eyes were always growing bigger her cheeks pinker her skin fairer her hair longer and more softly curling At first thought Kate had been inclined to snatch off the dress and change to one of the cheap ready made ginghams Henry brought but the baby was so lovely as she was she had not the heart to spoil the picture while Nancy Ellen might come any minute So she began putting things in place while Little Poll sat crowing and trying to pick up a sunbeam that fell across her tray Her father came to the door and stood looking at her Suddenly he dropped in a chair covered his face with his hands and began to cry in deep shuddering sobs Kate stood still in wonderment As last she seated herself before him and said gently Won t you tell me about it Henry Henry struggled for self control He looked at the baby longingly Finally he said It s pretty tough to give up a baby like that missus Holt She s my little girl I wish God had struck my right hand with palsy when I went to sign those papers Oh no you don t Henry said Kate suavely You wouldn t like to live the rest of your life a cripple And is it any worse for me to have your girl in spite of the real desires and dictates of your heart than it was for you to have mine And you didn t take the intelligent care of my girl that I m taking of yours either A doctor and a little right treatment at the proper time would have saved Polly to rear her own baby but there s no use to go into that I was waiting for Polly to come home of her own accord as she left it and while I waited a poison crept into her system that took her I never shall feel right about it neither shall you No I should say I won t said Henry emphatically I never thought of anything being the matter with Polly that wouldn t be all over when the baby came I know you didn t Henry said Kate I know how much you would have done and how gladly if you had known There is no use going into that we are both very much to blame we must take our punishment Now what is this I hear about your having been to see lawyers and trying to find a way to set aside the adoption papers you signed Let s have a talk and see what we can arrive at Tell me all about it So Henry told Kate how he had loved Polly how he felt guilty of her death how he longed for and wanted her baby how he had signed the paper which Polly put before him so unexpectedly to humour her because she was very ill but he had not dreamed that she could die how he did not feel that he should be bound by that signature now Kate listened with the deepest sympathy assenting to most he said until he was silent Then she sat thinking a long time At last she said Henry if you and Polly had waited until I came home and told me what you wanted and how you felt I should have gotten her ready and given you a customary wedding and helped you to start a life that I think would have saved her to you and to me That is past but the fact remains You are hurt over giving up the baby as you have I m hurt over losing my daughter as I did we are about even on the past don t you think I suppose we are he said heavily That being agreed said Kate let us look to the future You want the baby now I can guess how much by how much I want her myself I know YOUR point of view there are two others one is mine and the other is the baby s I feel that it is only right and just that I should have this little girl to replace the one you took from me in a way far from complimentary to me I feel that she is mine because Polly told me the day she came to see me how sick she had been how she had begged for a doctor and been kissed and told there was nothing the matter with her when she knew she was very ill She gave the baby to me and at that time she had been to see a lawyer and had her papers all made out except the signatures and dates mister Thomlins can tell you that and you know that up to that time I had not seen Polly or had any communication with her She simply was unnerved at the thought of trusting her baby to the care she had had Kate was hitting hard and straight from the shoulder The baby busy with her sunbeam jabbered unnoticed When Polly died as she did continued Kate I knew that her baby would be full of the same poison that killed her and that it must be eliminated before it came time to cut her worst teeth so I undertook the work and sleeping or waking I have been at it ever since Now Henry is there any one at your house who would have figured this out and taken the time pains and done work that I have Is there Mother raised six of us he said defensively But she didn t die of diathesis giving birth to the first of you said Kate You were all big strong boys with a perfectly sound birthright And your mother is now a much older wearier woman than she was then and her hands are far too full every day as it is If she knew how to handle the baby as I have and was willing to add the work to her daily round would you be willing to have her I have three times her strength while I consider that I ve the first right Then there is the baby s side of the question I have had her through the worst hardest part of babyhood she is accustomed to a fixed routine that you surely will concede agrees with her she would miss me and she would not thrive as she does with me for her food and her hours would not be regular while you and your father and the boys would tire her to death handling her That is the start The finish would be that she would grow up if she survived to take the place Polly took at your house while you would marry some other girl as you WILL before a year from now I m dreadfully sorry to say these things to you Henry but you know they are the truth If you re going to try to take the baby I m going to fight you to the last dollar I can raise and the last foot of land I own That s all Look at the baby think it over and let me know what you ll do as soon as you can I m not asking mercy at your hands but I do feel that I have suffered about my share You needn t suffer any longer said Henry drying his eyes All you say is true just as what I said was true but I might as well tell you and let one of us be happy I saw my third lawyer yesterday and he said the papers were unbreakable unless I could prove that the child was neglected and not growing right or not having proper care Look at her I might do some things I did do a thing as mean as to persuade a girl to marry me without her mother s knowledge and ruined her life thereby but God knows I couldn t go on the witness stand and swear that that baby is not properly cared for Mother s job is big enough and while it doesn t seem possible now very likely I shall marry again as other men do and in that event Little Poll WOULD be happier with you I give her up I think I came this morning to say that I was defeated and to tell you that I d give up if I saw that you would fight Keep the baby and be as happy as you can You shan t be worried any more about her Polly shall have this thing as she desired and planned it Good bye When he had gone Kate knelt on the floor laid her head on the chair tray and putting her arms around the baby she laughed and cried at the same time while Miss Baby pulled her hair patted her face and plastered it with wet uncertain kisses Then Kate tied a little bonnet on the baby s head and taking her in her arms she went to the field to tell Adam It seemed to Kate that she could see responsibility slipping from his shoulders could see him grow taller as he listened The breath of relief he drew was long and deep Fine he cried Fine I haven t told you HALF I knew I ve been worried until I couldn t sleep Kate went back to the house so glad she did not realize she was touching earth at all She fed the baby and laid her down for her morning nap and then went out in the garden but she was too restless to work She walked bareheaded in the sun and was glad as she never before in her life had known how to be glad The first thing Kate knew she was standing at the gate looking up at the noonday sky and from the depths of her heart she was crying aloud Praise ye the Lord Oh my soul Let all that is within me praise His holy name For the remainder of the day Kate was unblushingly insane She started to do a hundred things and abandoned all of them to go out and look up at the sky and to cry repeatedly Praise the Lord If she had been asked to explain why she did this Kate could have answered and would have answered Because I FEEL like it She had been taught no religion as a child she had practised no formal mode of worship as a woman She had been straight honest and virtuous She had faced life and done with small question the work that she thought fell to her hand She had accepted joy sorrow shame all in the same stoic way Always she had felt that there was a mighty force in the universe that could as well be called God as any other name it mattered not about the name it was a real force and it was there That day Kate exulted She carried the baby down to the brook in the afternoon and almost shouted she sang until she could have been heard a mile She kept straight on praising the Lord because expression was imperative and that was the form of expression that seemed to come naturally to her Without giving a thought as to how or why she followed her impulses and praised the Lord The happier she grew the more clearly she saw how uneasy and frightened she had been When Nancy Ellen came she took only one glance at Kate s glorified face and asked What in this world has happened to you Kate answered in all seriousness My Lord has shut the lions mouths and they are not going to harm me Nancy Ellen regarded her closely I hope you aren t running a temperature she said I ll take a shot at random You have found out that the Peters family can t take Little Poll Kate laughed joyously Better than that sister mine she cried I have convinced Henry that he doesn t want her himself as much as he wants me to have her and he can speedily convert his family He will do nothing more He will leave me in peace with her Thank God said Nancy Ellen There you go too cried Kate That s the very first thought that came to me only I said Praise the Lord which is exactly the same thing and Nancy Ellen since Robert has been trying to praise the Lord for twenty years and both of us do praise Him when our time comes wouldn t it be a good idea to open up our heads and say so not only to ourselves and to the Lord but to the neighbours I m afraid she won t understand much of it but I think I shall find the place and read to Little Poll about Abraham and Isaac to night and probably about Hagar and Ishmael to morrow night and it wouldn t surprise me a mite to hear myself saying Praise the Lord right out loud any time any place Let s gather a great big bouquet of our loveliest flowers and go tell Mother and Polly about it Without a word Nancy Ellen turned toward the garden They gathered the flowers and getting in Nancy Ellen s car drove the short distance to the church where Nancy Ellen played with the baby in the shade of a big tree while Kate arranged her flowers Then she sat down and they talked over their lives from childhood Nancy Ellen won t you stay to supper with us asked Kate Yes said Nancy Ellen rising I haven t had such a good time in years I m as glad for you as I d be if I had such a child assured me myself You can t bring yourself began Kate Yes I think so said Nancy Ellen Getting things for Little Poll has broken me up so I told Robert how I felt and he s watching in his practice and he s written several letters of inquiry to friends in Chicago Any day now I may have my work cut out for me Praise the Lord again cried Kate I see where you will be happier than you ever have been Real life is just beginning for you Then they went home and prepared a good supper and had such a fine time they were exalted in heart and spirit When Nancy Ellen started home Kate took the baby and climbed in the car with her explaining that they would go a short way and walk back She went only as far as the Peters gate then she bravely walked up to the porch where mister Peters and some of the boys sat and said casually I just thought I d bring Little Poll up to get acquainted with her folks Isn t she a dear An hour later as she walked back in the moonlight Henry beside her carrying the baby he said to her This is a mighty big thing and a kind thing for you to do missus Holt Mother has been saying scandalous things about you I know said Kate But never mind She won t any more The remainder of the week she passed in the same uplifted mental state She carried the baby in her arms and walked all over the farm going often to the cemetery with fresh flowers Sunday morning when the work was all done the baby dressed her prettiest Kate slipped into one of her fresh white dresses and gathering a big bunch of flowers started again to whisper above the graves of her mother and Polly the story of her gladness and to freshen the flowers so that the people coming from church would see that her family were remembered When she had finished she arose took up the baby and started to return across the cemetery going behind the church taking the path she had travelled the day she followed the minister s admonition to take the wings of morning She thought of that She stood very still thinking deeply I took them she said I ve tried flight after flight and I ve fallen and risen and fallen and got up and tried again but never until now have I felt that I could really fly to the uttermost parts of the earth There is a rising power in me that should benefit more than myself I guess I ll just join in She walked into the church as the last word of the song the congregation were singing was finished and the minister was opening his lips to say Let us pray Straight down the aisle came Kate her bare gold head crowned with a flash of light at each window she passed She paused at the altar directly facing the minister Baby and I would like the privilege of praising the Lord with you she said simply and we would like to do our share in keeping up this church and congregation to His honour and glory There s some water Can t you baptize us now The minister turned to the pitcher which always stood on his desk filled his palm and asked What is the baby s name Katherine Eleanor Peters said Kate Katherine Eleanor I baptize thee said the minister and he laid his hand on the soft curls of the baby She scattered the flowers she was holding over the altar as she reached to spat her hands in the water on her head and laughed aloud What is your name asked the minister Katherine Eleanor Holt said Kate Again the minister repeated the formula and then he raised both hands and said Let us pray

none	none	 THE WINGED VICTORY 
4289_21393_000006_000000	train-clean-360	KATE turned and placing the baby on the front seat she knelt and put her arms around the little thing but her lips only repeated the words Praise the Lord for this precious baby Her heart was filled with high resolve 
4289_21393_000006_000001	train-clean-360	She would rear the baby with such care 
4289_21393_000006_000002	train-clean-360	She would be more careful with Adam 
4289_21393_000006_000003	train-clean-360	She would make heroic effort to help him to clean unashamed manhood 
4289_21393_000006_000004	train-clean-360	She would be a better sister to all her family 
4289_21393_000006_000005	train-clean-360	She would be friendlier and have more patience with the neighbours 
4289_21393_000006_000006	train-clean-360	She would join in whatever effort the church was making to hold and increase its membership among the young people and to raise funds to keep up the organization 
none	none	All the time her mind was busy thinking out these fine resolves her lips were thanking the Lord for Little Poll 
4289_21393_000006_000008	train-clean-360	Kate arose with the benediction picked up the baby and started down the aisle among the people she had known all her life 
4289_21393_000006_000009	train-clean-360	On every side strong hands stretched out to greet and welcome her 
none	none	A daughter of Adam Bates was something new as a church member 
4289_21393_000006_000011	train-clean-360	They all knew how she could work and what she could give if she chose while that she had stood at the altar and been baptized meant that something not customary with the Bates family was taking place in her heart 
4289_21393_000006_000012	train-clean-360	So they welcomed her and praised the beauty and sweetness of the baby until Kate went out into the sunshine her face glowing 
4289_21393_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Slowly she walked home and as she reached the veranda Adam took the baby 
4289_21393_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Been to the cemetery he asked 
4289_21393_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Kate nodded and dropped into a chair 
4289_21393_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 That s too far to walk and carry this great big woman he said snuggling his face in the baby s neck while she patted his cheeks and pulled his hair 
4289_21393_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Why didn t you tell me you wanted to go and let me get out the car 
4289_21393_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Kate looked at him speculatively 
none	none	Adam she said when I started out I meant only to take some flowers to Mother and Polly As I came around the corner of the church to take the footpath they were singing Rejoice in the Lord I went inside and joined 
4289_21393_000012_000002	train-clean-360	I m going to church as often as I can after this and I m going to help with the work of running it 
none	none	Well I like that cried Adam indignantly
4289_21393_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Why didn t you let me go with you 
4289_21393_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Kate sat staring down the road 
4289_21393_000014_000001	train-clean-360	She was shocked speechless 
4289_21393_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Again she had followed an impulse without thinking of any one besides herself Usually she could talk but in that instant she had nothing to say Then a carriage drew into the line of her vision stopped at York s gate and mister York alighted and swung to the ground a slim girlish figure and then helped his wife 
none	none	Kate had a sudden inspiration
4289_21393_000014_000004	train-clean-360	 But you would want to wait a little and join with Milly wouldn t you she asked 
4289_21393_000014_000005	train-clean-360	 Uncle Robert always has been a church member 
4289_21393_000014_000006	train-clean-360	I think it s a fine stand for a man to take 
4289_21393_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe that would be better he said 
4289_21393_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I didn t think of Milly 
4289_21393_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I only thought I d like to have been with you and Little Poll 
none	none	I m sure Milly will be joining very soon and that she ll want you with her said Kate 
4289_21393_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She was a very substantial woman but for the remainder of that day she felt that she was moving with winged feet 
4289_21393_000017_000001	train-clean-360	She sang she laughed she was unspeakably happy 
none	none	She kept saying over and over And a little child shall lead them Then she would catch Little Poll almost crushing her in her strong arms 
4289_21393_000017_000003	train-clean-360	It never occurred to Kate that she had done an unprecedented thing 
4289_21393_000017_000004	train-clean-360	She had done as her heart dictated She did not know that she put the minister into a most uncomfortable position when he followed her request to baptize her and the child She had never thought of probations and examinations and catechisms She had read the Bible as was the custom every morning before her school 
4289_21393_000017_000005	train-clean-360	In that book when a man wanted to follow Jesus he followed Jesus accepted him and that was all there was to it with Kate 
4289_21393_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The middle of the week Nancy Ellen came flying up the walk on winged feet herself 
4289_21393_000018_000001	train-clean-360	She carried photographs of several small children one of them a girl so like Little Poll that she might have been the original of the picture 
4289_21393_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 They just came said Nancy Ellen rather breathlessly 
4289_21393_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I was wild for that little darling at once 
4289_21393_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I had Robert telegraph them to hold her until we could get there 
4289_21393_000019_000003	train-clean-360	We re going to start on the evening train and if her blood seems good and her ancestors respectable and she looks like that picture we re going to bring her back with us Oh Kate I can scarcely wait to get my fingers on her 
4289_21393_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I m hungry for a baby all of my own 
4289_21393_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Kate studied the picture 
4289_21393_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 She s charming she said 
none	none	Oh Nancy Ellen this world is getting entirely too good to be true 
4289_21393_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Nancy Ellen looked at Kate and smiled peculiarly 
none	none	I knew you were crazy she said but I never dreamed of you going such lengths missus Whistler told Robert when she called him in about her side Tuesday 
4289_21393_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I can t imagine a Bates joining church 
4289_21393_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 If that is joining church it s the easiest thing in the world said Kate 
4289_21393_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 We just loved doing it didn t we Little Poll 
4289_21393_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Adam and Milly are going to come in soon I m almost sure 
4289_21393_000024_000003	train-clean-360	At least he is willing 
4289_21393_000024_000004	train-clean-360	I don t know what it is that I am to do but I suppose they will give me my work soon 
4289_21393_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You bet they ll give you work soon and enough said Nancy Ellen laughing 
none	none	But you won t mind 
4289_21393_000025_000002	train-clean-360	You ll just put it through as you do things out here 
4289_21393_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Kate you are making this place look fine 
4289_21393_000025_000004	train-clean-360	I used to say I d rather die than come back here to live but lately it has been growing so attractive I ve been here about half my time and wished I were the other half 
4289_21393_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Kate slipped her arm around Nancy Ellen as they walked to the gate 
none	none	You know said Nancy Ellen the MORE I study you the LESS I know about you 
4289_21393_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Usually it s sickness and sorrow and losing their friends that bring people to the consolations of the church 
4289_21393_000027_000002	train-clean-360	You bore those things like a stoic 
none	none	When they are all over and you are comfortable and happy just the joy of being sure of Little Poll has transformed you 
4289_21393_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Kate you make me think of the Winged Victory this afternoon If I get this darling little girl will she make me big and splendid and fine like you 
4289_21393_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Kate suddenly drew Nancy Ellen to her and kissed her a long hard kiss on the lips 
none	none	Nancy Ellen she said you ARE big and splendid and fine or you never would be going to Chicago after this little motherless child You haven t said a word but I know from the joy of you and Robert during the past months that missus Southey isn t troubling you any more and I m sure enough to put it into words that when you get your little child she will lead you straight where mine as led me 
4289_21393_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Good bye and good luck to you and remember me to Robert 
4289_21393_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Nancy Ellen stood intently studying the picture she held in her hand Then she looked at Kate smiling with misty eyes I think Kate I m very close if I am not really where you are this minute she said Then she started her car but she looked back waving and smiling until the car swerved so that Kate called after her Do drive carefully Nancy Ellen 
4289_21393_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Kate went slowly up the walk 
4289_21393_000031_000001	train-clean-360	She stopped several times to examine the shrubs and bushes closely to wish for rain for the flowers 
4289_21393_000031_000002	train-clean-360	She sat on the porch a few minutes talking to Little Poll then she went inside to answer the phone 
4289_21393_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Kate cried a sharp voice 
4289_21393_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Kate recognizing a neighbour living a few miles down the road 
4289_21393_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Did Nancy Ellen just leave your house came a breathless query 
4289_21393_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Kate again 
4289_21393_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I just saw a car that looked like hers slip in the fresh sand at the river levee and it went down and two or three times over 
4289_21393_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 O God said Kate 
none	none	Then after an instant Ring the dinner bell for your men to get her out 
4289_21393_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I ll phone Robert and come as soon as I can get there 
4289_21393_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Kate called doctor Gray s office 
none	none	She said to the girl Tell the doctor that missus Howe thinks she saw Nancy Ellen s car go down the river levee and two or three times over Have him bring what he might need to Howe s and hurry 
4289_21393_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Rush him 
none	none	Then she ran to her bell and rang so frantically that Adam came running 
4289_21393_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Kate was at the little garage they had built and had the door open 
4289_21393_000039_000002	train-clean-360	She told him what she had heard ran to get the baby and met him at the gate 
none	none	On the way she said You take the baby when we get there and if I m needed take her back and get Milly and her mother to come stay with you 
4289_21393_000039_000004	train-clean-360	You know where her things are and how to feed her 
4289_21393_000039_000005	train-clean-360	Don t you dare let them change any way I do 
4289_21393_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Baby knows Milly she will be good for her and for you 
4289_21393_000039_000007	train-clean-360	You ll be careful 
4289_21393_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course Mother said Adam 
4289_21393_000041_000000	train-clean-360	He called her attention to the road 
4289_21393_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Look at those tracks he said 
4289_21393_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Was she sick 
4289_21393_000042_000002	train-clean-360	She might have been drunk from them 
none	none	No said Kate she wasn t sick 
4289_21393_000043_000001	train-clean-360	She WAS drunk drunken with joy She had a picture of the most beautiful little baby girl 
4289_21393_000043_000002	train-clean-360	They were to start to Chicago after her to night 
none	none	I suspect she was driving with the picture in one hand 
4289_21393_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Oh my God have mercy 
4289_21393_000044_000000	train-clean-360	They had come to deep grooves in loose gravel then the cut in the embankment then they could see the wrecked car standing on the engine and lying against a big tree near the water while two men and a woman were carrying a limp form across the meadow toward the house 
4289_21393_000044_000001	train-clean-360	As their car stopped Kate kissed the baby mechanically handed her to Adam and ran into the house where she dragged a couch to the middle of the first room she entered found a pillow and brought a bucket of water and a towel from the kitchen 
none	none	They carried Nancy Ellen in and laid her down Kate began unfastening clothing and trying to get the broken body in shape for the doctor to work upon but she spread the towel over what had been a face of unusual beauty Robert came in a few minutes then all of them worked under his directions until he suddenly sank to the floor burying his face in Nancy Ellen s breast then they knew 
4289_21393_000044_000004	train-clean-360	Kate gathered her sister s feet in her arms and hid her face beside them The neighbours silently began taking away things that had been used while missus Howe chose her whitest sheet and laid it on a chair near Robert 
4289_21393_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Two days later they laid Nancy Ellen beside her mother 
4289_21393_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Then they began trying to face the problem of life without her 
4289_21393_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Robert said nothing 
4289_21393_000045_000003	train-clean-360	He seemed too stunned to think 
4289_21393_000045_000004	train-clean-360	Kate wanted to tell him of her final visit with Nancy Ellen but she could not at that time Robert s aged mother came to him and said she could remain as long as he wanted her so that was a comfort to Kate who took time to pity him even in her blackest hour 
4289_21393_000045_000005	train-clean-360	She had some very black ones 
4289_21393_000045_000006	train-clean-360	She could have wailed and lamented and relinquished all she had gained but she did not 
4289_21393_000045_000007	train-clean-360	She merely went on with life as she always had lived it to the best of her ability when she was so numbed with grief she scarcely knew what she was doing 
none	none	She kept herself driven about the house and when she could find no more to do took Little Poll in her arms and went out in the fields to Adam where she found the baby a safe place and then cut and husked corn as usual 
4289_21393_000045_000009	train-clean-360	Every Sabbath and often during the week her feet carried her to the cemetery where she sat in the deep grass and looked at those three long mounds and tried to understand life deeper still to fathom death 
4289_21393_000046_000000	train-clean-360	She and her mother had agreed that there was something Now Kate tried as never before to understand what and where and why that something was 
none	none	Many days she would sit for an hour at a time thinking and at last she arrived at fixed convictions that settled matters forever with her 
4289_21393_000046_000002	train-clean-360	One day after she had arranged the fall roses she had grown and some roadside asters she had gathered in passing she sat in deep thought when a car stopped on the road 
4289_21393_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Kate looked up to see Robert coming across the churchyard with his arms full of greenhouse roses 
4289_21393_000046_000004	train-clean-360	He carried a big bunch of deep red for her mother white for Polly and a large sheaf of warm pink for Nancy Ellen 
4289_21393_000046_000005	train-clean-360	Kate knelt up and taking her flowers she moved them lower and silently helped Robert place those he had brought 
4289_21393_000046_000006	train-clean-360	Then she sat where she had been and looked at him 
4289_21393_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Finally he asked Still hunting the why Kate 
none	none	Why doesn t so much matter said Kate as where I m enough of a fatalist to believe that Mother is here because she was old and worn out 
4289_21393_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Polly had a clear case of uric poison while I d stake my life Nancy Ellen was gloating over the picture she carried when she ran into that loose sand 
4289_21393_000048_000002	train-clean-360	In each of their cases I am satisfied as to why as well as about Father 
4289_21393_000048_000003	train-clean-360	The thing that holds me and fascinates me and that I have such a time being sure of is where 
4289_21393_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Robert glanced upward and asked Isn t there room enough up there Kate 
4289_21393_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Too much said Kate 
4289_21393_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 And what IS the soul and HOW can it bridge the vortex lying between us and other worlds that man never can because of the lack of air to breathe and support him 
4289_21393_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know said Robert and in spite of the fact that I do know what a man CANNOT do I still believe in the immortality of the soul 
none	none	Oh yes said Kate
4289_21393_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 If there is any such thing in science as a self evident fact that is one 
4289_21393_000052_000002	train-clean-360	THAT is provable 
4289_21393_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Robert looked at her eager face 
4289_21393_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 How would you go about proving it Kate he asked 
none	none	Why this way said Kate leaning to straighten and arrange the delicate velvet petalled roses with her sure work abused fingers Take the history of the world from as near dawn as we have any record and trace it from the igloo of the northernmost Esquimo around the globe and down to the ice of the southern pole again and in blackest Africa farthest wildest Borneo you will never discover one single tribe of creatures upright and belonging to the race of man who did not come into the world with four primal instincts 
4289_21393_000054_000001	train-clean-360	They all reproduce themselves they all make something intended for music they all express a feeling in their hearts by the exercise we call dance they all believe in the after life of the soul 
4289_21393_000054_000002	train-clean-360	This belief is as much a PART of any man ever born in any location as his hands and his feet Whether he believes his soul enters a cat and works back to man again after long transmigration or goes to a Happy Hunting Ground as our Indians makes no difference with the fact that he enters this world with belief in after life of some kind 
4289_21393_000054_000003	train-clean-360	We see material evidence in increase that man is not defeated in his desire to reproduce himself we have advanced to something better than tom toms and pow wows for music and dance these desires are fulfilled before us now tell me why the very strongest of all the most deeply rooted the belief in after life should come to nothing 
4289_21393_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Why should the others be real and that a dream 
4289_21393_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think it is said Robert 
4289_21393_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 It s my biggest self evident fact said Kate conclusively 
4289_21393_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 I never heard any one else say these things but I think them and they are provable 
none	none	I always believed there was something but since I saw Mother go I know there is 
4289_21393_000056_000003	train-clean-360	She stood in full evening light I looked straight in her face and Robert you know I m no creature of fancies and delusions I tell you I SAW HER SOUL PASS 
4289_21393_000056_000004	train-clean-360	I saw the life go from her and go on and on 
4289_21393_000056_000005	train-clean-360	I saw her body stand erect long enough for me to reach her and pick her up after its passing 
none	none	That I know
4289_21393_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t think of questioning it Kate said Robert 
none	none	But don t you think you are rather limiting man when you narrow him to four primal instincts
4289_21393_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I don t know said Kate 
4289_21393_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 Air to breathe and food to sustain are presupposed 
4289_21393_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Man LEARNS to fight in self defense and to acquire what he covets 
4289_21393_000058_000003	train-clean-360	He learns to covet by seeing stronger men in better locations surpass his achievements so if he is strong enough he goes and robs them by force 
4289_21393_000058_000004	train-clean-360	He learns the desire for the chase in food hunting I think four are plenty to start with 
none	none	Probably you are right said the doctor rising
4289_21393_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 I must go now Shall I take you home 
4289_21393_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Kate glanced at the sun and shook her head 
4289_21393_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 I can stay half an hour longer 
4289_21393_000060_000002	train-clean-360	I don t mind the walk 
4289_21393_000060_000003	train-clean-360	I need exercise to keep me in condition 
none	none	Good bye 
4289_21393_000061_000000	train-clean-360	As he started his car he glanced back 
none	none	She was leaning over the flowers absorbed in their beauty 
4289_21393_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Kate sat looking straight before her until time to help with the evening work and prepare supper then she arose 
4289_21393_000061_000003	train-clean-360	She stood looking down a long time finally she picked up a fine specimen of each of the roses and slowly dropped them on her father s grave 
none	none	There 
4289_21393_000062_000001	train-clean-360	You may have that many she said 
none	none	You look a little too lonely lying here beside the others with not a single one but if you could speak I wonder whether you would say Thank you or Take the damn weeds off me CHAPTER XXVII BLUE RIBBON CORN NEVER in her life had Kate worked harder than she did that fall but she retained her splendid health Everything was sheltered and housed their implements under cover their stock in good condition their store room filled and their fruits and vegetables buried in hills and long rows in the garden Adam had a first wheat premium at the County Fair and a second on corn concerning which he felt abused He thought his corn scored the highest number of points but that the award was given another man because of Adam s having had first on wheat In her heart Kate agreed with him but she tried to satisfy him with the blue ribbon on wheat and keep him interested sufficiently to try for the first on corn the coming year She began making suggestions for the possible improvement of his corn Adam was not easily propitiated Mother he said you know as well as you know you re alive that if I had failed on wheat or had second I would have been given FIRST on my corn my corn was the best in every way but they thought I would swell up and burst if I had two blue ribbons That was what ailed the judges What encouragement is that to try again I might grow even finer corn in the coming year than I did this and be given no award at all because I had two this year It would amount to exactly the same thing We ll get some more books and see if we can study up any new wrinkles this winter said Kate Now cheer up and go tell Milly about it Maybe she can console you if I can t Nothing but justice will console me said Adam I m not complaining about losing the prize I m fighting mad because my corn my beautiful corn that grew and grew and held its head so high and waved its banners of triumph to me with every breeze didn t get its fair show What encouragement is there for it to try better the coming year The crows might as well have had it or the cutworms while all my work is for nothing You re making a big mistake said Kate If your corn was the finest it was and the judges knew it and you know it and very likely the man who has the first prize knows it You have a clean conscience and you know what you know They surely can t feel right about it or enjoy what they know You have had the experience you have the corn for seed with these things to back you clear a small strip of new land beside the woods this winter and try what that will do for you Adam looked at her with wide eyes By jing Mother you are a dandy he said You just bet I ll try that next year but don t you tell a soul there are more than you who will let a strip be cleared in an effort to grow blue ribbon corn How did you come to think of it Your saying all your work had been for nothing made me think of it she answered Let them give another man the prize when they know your corn is the best It s their way of keeping a larger number of people interested and avoiding the appearance of partiality this contest was too close next year you grow such corn that the CORN will force the decision in spite of the judges Do you see I see said Adam I ll try again After that life went on as usual The annual Christmas party was the loveliest of all because Kate gave it loving thought and because all of their hearts were especially touched As spring came on again Kate and Adam studied over their work planning many changes for the better but each time they talked when everything else was arranged they came back to corn More than once each of them dreamed corn that winter while asleep they frankly talked of it many times a day Location soil fertilizers seed cultivation they even studied the almanacs for a general forecast of the weather These things brought them very close together Also it was admitted between them that Little Poll grappled them with hooks of steel They never lacked subjects for conversation Poll always came first corn next and during the winter there began to be discussion of plans for Adam and Milly Should Milly come with them or should they build a small house on the end of the farm nearest her mother Adam did not care so he married Milly speedily Kate could not make up her mind Milly had the inclination of a bird for a personal and private nest of her own So spring came to them August brought the anniversary of Nancy Ellen s death which again saddened all of them Then came cooler September weather and the usual rush of preparation for winter Kate was everywhere and enjoying her work immensely On sturdy tumbly legs Little Poll trotted after her or rode in state on her shoulder when distances were too far If Kate took her to the fields as she did every day she carried along the half of an old pink and white quilt which she spread in a shaded place and filled the baby s lap with acorns wild flowers small brightly coloured stones shells and whatever she could pick up for playthings Poll amused herself with these until the heat and air made her sleepy then she laid herself down and slept for an hour or two Once she had trouble with stomach teeth that brought doctor Gray racing and left Kate white and limp with fear Everything else had gone finely and among helping Adam working in her home caring for the baby doing whatever she could see that she thought would be of benefit to the community and what was assigned her by church committees Kate had a busy life She had earned in a degree the leadership she exercised in her first days in Walden Everyone liked her but no one ever ventured to ask her for an opinion unless they truly wanted it Adam came from a run to Hartley for groceries one evening in late September with a look of concern that Kate noticed on his face He was very silent during supper and when they were on the porch as usual he still sat as if thinking deeply Kate knew that he would tell her what he was thinking about when he was ready but she was not in the least prepared for what he said Mother how do you feel about Uncle Robert marrying again he asked suddenly Kate was too surprised to answer She looked at him in amazement Instead of answering she asked him a question What makes you ask that You know how that missus Southey pursued him one summer Well she s back in Hartley staying at the hotel right across from his office she s dressed to beat the band she s pretty as a picture her car stands out in front all day and to get to ride in it and take meals with her all the women are running after her I hear she has even had Robert s old mother out for a drive What do you think of that Think she s in love with him of course and trying to marry him and that she will very probably succeed If she has located where she is right under his eye and lets him know that she wants him very much he ll no doubt marry her But what do you THINK about it asked Adam I ve had no TIME to think said Kate At first blush I d say that I shall hate it as badly as I could possibly hate anything that was none of my immediate business Nancy Ellen loved him so I never shall forget that day she first told me about him and how loving him brought out her beauty and made her shine and glow as if from an inner light I was always with her most and I loved her more than all the other girls put together I know that Southey woman tried to take him from her one summer not long ago and that he gave her to understand that she could not so she went away If she s back it means only one thing and I think probably she ll succeed but you can be sure it will make me squirm properly I THOUGHT you wouldn t like it he said emphatically Now understand me Adam said Kate I m no fool I didn t expect Robert to be more than human He has no children and he d like a child above anything else on earth I ve known that for years ever since it became apparent that none was coming to Nancy Ellen I hadn t given the matter a thought but if I had been thinking I would have thought that as soon as was proper he would select a strong healthy young woman and make her his wife I know his mother is homesick and wants to go back to her daughters and their children which is natural I haven t an objection in the world to him marrying a PROPER woman at a proper time and place but Oh dear Lord I do dread and despise to see that little Southey cat come back and catch him because she knows how Did you ever see her Mother No I never said Kate and I hope I never shall I know what Nancy Ellen felt because she told me all about it that time we were up North I m trying with all my might to have a Christian spirit I swallowed missus Peters and never blinked that anybody saw but I don t I truly don t know from where I could muster grace to treat a woman decently who tried to do to my sister what I KNOW missus Southey tried to do to Nancy Ellen She planned to break up my sister s home that I know Now that Nancy Ellen is gone I feel to night as if I just couldn t endure to see missus Southey marry Robert Bet she does it said Adam Did you see her asked Kate See her cried Adam I saw her half a dozen times in an hour She s in the heart of the town nothing to do but dress and motor Never saw such a peach of a car I couldn t help looking at it Gee I wish I could get you one like that What did you think of her looks asked Kate Might pretty said Adam promptly Small but not tiny plump but not fat pink light curls big baby blue eyes and a sort of hesitating way about her as if she were anxious to do the right thing but feared she might not and wished somebody would take care of her Kate threw out her hands with a rough exclamation I get the picture she said It s a dead centre shot THAT gets a man every time No man cares a picayune about a woman who can take care of herself and help him with his job if he has a ghost of a chance at a little pink and white clinger who will suck the life and talent out of him like the parasite she is while she makes him believe he is on the job taking care of her You can rest assured it will be settled before Christmas Kate had been right in her theories concerning the growing of blue ribbon corn At the County Fair in late September Adam exhibited such heavy ears of evenly grained white and yellow corn that the blue ribbon he carried home was not an award of the judges it was a concession to the just demands of the exhibit Then they began husking their annual crop It had been one of the country s best years for corn The long even golden ears they were stripping the husks from and stacking in heaps over the field might profitably have been used for seed by any farmer They had divided the field in halves and Adam was husking one side Kate the other She had a big shock open and kneeling beside it she was busy stripping open the husks and heaping up the yellow ears Behind her the shocks stood like rows of stationed sentinels above the crisp October sunshine warmed the air to a delightful degree around the field the fence rows were filled with purple and rose coloured asters and everywhere goldenrod yellower than the corn was hanging in heavy heads of pollen spraying bloom On her old pink quilt Little Poll sound asleep was lifted from the shade of one shock to another while Kate worked across her share of the field As she worked she kept looking at the child She frankly adored her but she kept her reason and held to rigid rules in feeding bathing and dressing Poll minded even a gesture or a nod Above the flocking larks pierced the air with silver notes on the fence rows the gathering robins called to each other high in the air the old black vulture that homed in a hollow log in Kate s woods looked down on the spots of colour made by the pink quilt the gold corn the blue of Kate s dress and her yellow head An artist would have paused long over the rich colour the grouping and perspective of that picture while the hazy fall atmosphere softened and blended the whole Kate herself never had appeared or felt better She worked rapidly often glancing across the field to see if she was even with or slightly in advance of Adam She said it would never do to let the boy get heady so she made a point of keeping even with him and caring for Little Poll for good measure She was smiling as she watched him working like a machine as he ripped open husks gave the ear a twist tossed it aside and reached for the next Kate was doing the same thing quite as automatically She was beginning to find the afternoon sun almost hot on her bare head so she turned until it fell on her back Her face was flushed to coral pink and framed in a loose border of her beautiful hair She was smiling at the thought of how Adam was working to get ahead of her smiling because Little Poll looked such a picture of healthy loveliness smiling because she was so well she felt super abundant health rising like a stimulating tide in her body smiling because the corn was the finest she ever had seen in a commonly cultivated field smiling because she and Adam were of one accord about everything smiling because the day was very beautiful because her heart was at peace her conscience clear She heard a car stop at her gate saw a man alight and start across the yard toward the field and knew that her visitor had seen her and was coming to her Kate went on husking corn and when the man swung over the fence of the field she saw that he was Robert and instantly thought of missus Southey so she ceased to smile I ve got a big notion to tell him what I think of him she said to herself even as she looked up to greet him Instantly she saw that he had come for something What is it she asked Agatha he said She s been having some severe heart attacks lately and she just gave me a real scare Instantly Kate forgot everything except Agatha whom she cordially liked and Robert who appeared older more tired and worried than she ever had seen him She thought Agatha had given him a real scare and she decided that it scarcely would have been bad enough to put lines in his face she never had noticed before dark circles under his eyes a look of weariness in his bearing She doubted as she looked at him if he were really courting missus Southey Even as she thought of these things she was asking She s better now Yes easier but she suffered terribly Adam was upset completely Adam threed and Susan and their families are away from home and won t be back for a few days unless I send for them They went to Ohio to visit some friends I stopped to ask if it would be possible for you to go down this evening and sleep there so that if there did happen to be a recurrence Adam wouldn t be alone Of course said Kate glancing at the baby I ll go right away No need for that he said if you ll arrange to stay with Adam to night as a precaution You needn t go till bed time I m going back after supper to put them in shape for the night I m almost sure she ll be all right now but you know how frightened we can get about those we love Yes I know said Kate quietly going straight on ripping open ear after ear of corn Presently she wondered why he did not go She looked up at him and met his eyes He was studying her intently Kate was vividly conscious in an instant of her bare wind teased head her husking gloves she was not at all sure that her face was clean She smiled at him and picking up the sunbonnet lying beside her she wiped her face with the skirt If this sun hits too long on the same spot it grows warm she told him Kate I do wish you wouldn t he exclaimed abruptly Kate was too forthright for sparring Why not she asked For one thing you are doing a man s work he said For another I hate to see you burn the loveliest hair I ever saw on the head of a woman and coarsen your fine skin Kate looked down at the ear of corn she held in her hands and considered an instant There hasn t any man been around asking to relieve me of this work she said I got my start in life doing a man s work and I m frank to say that I d far rather do it any day than what is usually considered a woman s As for my looks I never set a price on them or let them interfere with business Robert No I know you don t he said But it s a pity to spoil you I don t know what s the matter with you said Kate patiently She bent her head toward him Feel she said and see if my hair isn t soft and fine I always cover it in really burning sun this autumn haze is good for it My complexion is exactly as smooth and even now as it was the day I first met you on the footlog over twenty years ago There s one good thing about the Bates women They wear well None of us yet have ever faded and frazzled out Have you got many Hartley women doing what you call women s work to compare with me physically Robert You know the answer to that he said So I do said Kate I see some of them occasionally when business calls me that way Now Robert I m so well I feel like running a footrace the first thing when I wake up every morning I m making money I m starting my boy in a safe useful life have you many year and a half babies in your practice that can beat Little Poll I m as happy as it s humanly possible for me to be without Mother and Polly and Nancy Ellen Mother used always to say that when death struck a family it seldom stopped until it took three That was my experience and saving Adam and Little Poll it took my three dearest but the separation isn t going to be so very long If I were you I wouldn t worry about me Robert There are many women in the world willing to pay for your consideration save it for them Kate I m sorry I said anything he said hastily I wouldn t offend you purposely you know Kate looked at him in surprise But I m not offended she said snapping an ear and reaching for another I am merely telling you Don t give me a thought I m all right If you ll save me an hour the next time Little Poll has a tooth coming through you ll have completely earned my gratitude Tell Agatha I ll come as soon as I finish my evening work That was clearly a dismissal for Kate glancing across the field toward Adam saw that he had advanced to a new shock so she began husking faster than before CHAPTER XXVIII THE ELEVENTH HOUR ROBERT said good bye and started back toward his car Kate looked after him as he reached the fence A surge of pity for him swept up in her heart He seemed far from happy and he surely was very tired Impulsive as always she lifted her clear voice and called Robert He paused with his foot on a rail of the fence and turned toward her Have you had any dinner she asked He seemed to be considering Come to think of it I don t believe I have he said I thought you looked neglected said Kate Sonny across the field is starting a shock ahead of me I can t come but go to the kitchen the door is unlocked you ll find fried chicken and some preserves and pickles in the pantry the bread box is right there and the milk and butter are in the spring house He gave Kate one long look Thank you he said and leaped the fence He stopped on the front walk and stood a minute then he turned and went around the house She laughed aloud She was sending him to chicken perfectly cooked barely cold melon preserves pickled cucumbers and bread like that which had for years taken a County Fair prize each fall butter yellow as the goldenrod lining the fences and cream stiff enough to stand alone Also he would find neither germ nor mould in her pantry and spring house while it would be a new experience for him to let him wait on himself Kate husked away in high good humour but she quit an hour early to be on time to go to Agatha She explained this to Adam when she told him that he would have to milk alone while she bathed and dressed herself and got supper When she began to dress Kate examined her hair minutely and combed it with unusual care If Robert was at Agatha s when she got there she would let him see that her hair was not sunburned and ruined To match the hair dressing she reached back in her closet and took down her second best white dress She was hoping that Agatha would be well enough to have a short visit Kate worked so steadily that she seldom saw any of her brothers and sisters during the summer In winter she spent a day with each of them if she could possibly manage Anyway Agatha would like to see her appearing well so she put on the plain snowy linen and carefully pinning a big apron over it she went to the kitchen They always had a full dinner at noon and worked until dusk Her bath had made her later than she intended to be Dusk was deepening evening chill was beginning to creep into the air She closed the door fed Little Poll and rolled her into bed set the potatoes boiling and began mixing the biscuit She had them just ready to roll when steam lifted the lid of the potato pot with the soft dough in her hand she took a step to right it While it was in her fingers she peered into the pot She did not look up on the instant the door opened because she thought it would be Adam When she glanced toward the door she saw Robert standing looking at her He had stepped inside closed the door and with his hand on the knob was waiting for her to see him Oh Hello said Kate I thought it was Adam Have you been to Agatha s yet Yes She is very much better he said I only stopped to tell you that her mother happened to come out for the night and they ll not need you I m surely glad she is better said Kate but I m rather disappointed I ve been swimming and I m all ready to go She set the pot lid in place accurately and gave her left hand a deft turn to save the dough from dripping She glanced from it to Robert expecting to see him open the door and disappear Instead he stood looking at her intently Suddenly he said Kate will you marry me Kate mechanically saved the dough again as she looked at the pot an instant then she said casually Sure It would be splendid to have a doctor right in the house when Little Poll cuts her double teeth Thank you said Robert tersely No doubt that WOULD be a privilege but I decline to marry you in order to see Little Poll safely through teething Good night He stepped outside and closed the door very completely and somewhat pronouncedly Kate stood straight an instant then realized biscuit dough was slowly creeping down her wrist With a quick fling she shot the mass into the scrap bucket and sinking on the chair she sat on to peel vegetables she lifted her apron laid her head on her knees and gave a big gulping sob or two Then she began to cry silently A minute later the door opened again That time it had to be Adam but Kate did not care what he saw or what he thought She cried on in perfect abandon Then steps crossed the room someone knelt beside her put an arm around her and said Kate why are you crying Kate lifted her head suddenly and applied her apron skirt None of your business she said to Robert s face six inches from hers Are you so anxious as all this about Little Poll s teeth he asked Oh DRAT Little Poll s teeth cried Kate the tears rolling uninterruptedly Then WHY did you say that to me he demanded Well you said you only stopped to tell me that I needn t go to Agatha s she explained I had to say something to get even with you Oh said Robert and took possession Kate put her arms around his neck drew his head against hers and knew a minute of complete joy When Adam entered the house his mother was very busy She was mixing more biscuit dough she was laughing like a girl of sixteen she snatched out one of their finest tablecloths and put on many extra dishes for supper while Uncle Robert looking like a different man was helping her He was actually stirring the gravy and getting the water and setting up chairs And he was under high tension too He was saying things of no moment as if they were profound wisdom and laughing hilariously at things that were scarcely worth a smile Adam looked on and marvelled and all the while his irritation grew At last he saw a glance of understanding pass between them He could endure it no longer Oh you might as well SAY what you think he burst forth You forgot to pull down the blinds Both the brazen creatures laughed as if that were a fine joke They immediately threw off all reserve By the time the meal was finished Adam was struggling to keep from saying the meanest things he could think of Also he had to go to Milly with nothing very definite to tell But when he came back his mother was waiting for him She said at once Adam I m very sorry the blind was up to night I wanted to talk to you and tell you myself that the first real love for a man that I have ever known is in my heart to night Why Mother said Adam It s true said Kate quietly You see Adam the first time I ever saw Robert Gray I knew and he knew that he had made a mistake in engaging himself to Nancy Ellen but the thing was done she was happy we simply realized that we would have done better together and let it go at that But all these years I have known that I could have made him a wife who would have come closer to his ideals than my sister and SHE should have had the man who wanted to marry me They would have had a wonderful time together And where did my father come in asked Adam quietly He took advantage of my blackest hour said Kate I married him when I positively didn t care what happened to me The man I could have LOVED was married to my sister the man I could have married and lived with in comfort to both of us was out of the question it was in the Bates blood to marry about the time I did I had seen only the very best of your father and he was an attractive lover not bad looking not embarrassed with one single scruple it s the way of the world I took it I paid for it Only God knows how dearly I paid but Adam if you love me stand by me now Let me have this eleventh hour happiness with no alloy Anything I feel for your Uncle Robert has nothing in the world to do with my being your mother with you being my son Kiss me and tell me you re glad Adam Adam rose up and put his arms around his mother All his resentment was gone He was happy as he could be for his mother and happier than he ever before had been for himself The following afternoon Kate took the car and went to see Agatha instead of husking corn She dressed with care and arrived about three o clock leading Poll in whitest white with cheeks still rosy from her afternoon nap Agatha was sitting up and delighted to see them She said they were the first of the family who had come to visit her and she thought they had come because she was thinking of them Then she told Kate about her illness She said it dated from father Bates stroke and the dreadful days immediately following when Adam had completely lost self control and she had not been able to influence him I think it broke my heart she said simply Then they talked the family over and at last Agatha said Kate what is this I hear about Robert Have you been informed that missus Southey is back in Hartley and that she is working every possible chance and using multifarious blandishments on him Kate laughed heartily and suddenly She never had heard blandishments used in common conversation As she struggled to regain self possession Agatha spoke again It s no laughing matter she said The report has every ear mark of verisimilitude The Bates family has a way of feeling deeply We all loved Nancy Ellen We all suffered severely and lost something that never could be replaced when she went Of course all of us realized that Robert would enter the bonds of matrimony again none of us would have objected even if he remarried soon but all of us do object to his marrying a woman who would have broken Nancy Ellen s heart if she could and yesterday I took advantage of my illness and TOLD him so Then I asked him why a man of his standing and ability in this community didn t frustrate that unprincipled creature s vermiculations toward him by marrying you at once Slowly Kate sank down in her chair Her face whitened and then grew greenish She breathed with difficulty Oh Agatha was all she could say I do not regret it said Agatha If he is going to ruin himself he is not going to do it without knowing that the Bates family highly disapprove of his course But why drag me in said Kate almost too shocked to speak at all Maybe he LOVES missus Southey She has let him see how she feels about him possibly he feels the same about her He does if he weds her said Agatha conclusively Anything any one could say or do would have no effect if he had centred his affections upon her of that you may be very sure May I asked Kate dully Indeed you may said Agatha The male of the species when he is a man of Robert s attainments and calibre can be swerved from pursuit of the female he covets by nothing save extinction You mean said Kate with an effort that if Robert asked a woman to marry him it would mean that he loved her Indubitably cried Agatha Kate laughed until she felt a little better but she went home in a mood far different from that in which she started Then she had been very happy and she had intended to tell Agatha about her happiness the very first of all Now she was far from happy Possibly a thousand things the most possible that Robert had responded to Agatha s suggestion and stopped and asked her that abrupt question from an impulse as sudden and inexplicable as had possessed her when she married George Holt Kate fervently wished she had gone to the cornfield as usual that afternoon That s the way it goes she said angrily as she threw off her better dress and put on her every day gingham to prepare supper That s the way it goes Stay in your element and go on with your work and you re all right Leave your job and go trapesing over the country wasting your time and you get a heartache to pay you I might as well give up the idea that I m ever to be happy like anybody else Every time I think happiness is coming my way along comes something that knocks it higher than Gilderoy s kite Hang the luck She saw Robert pass while she was washing the dishes and knew he was going to Agatha s and would stop when he came back She finished her work put Little Poll to bed and made herself as attractive as she knew how in her prettiest blue dress All the time she debated whether she would say anything to him about what Agatha had said or not She decided she would wait awhile and watch how he acted She thought she could soon tell So when Robert came she was as nearly herself as possible but when he began to talk about being married soon the most she would say was that she would begin to think about it at Christmas and tell him by spring Robert was bitterly disappointed He was very lonely he needed better housekeeping than his aged mother was capable of to keep him up to a high mark in his work Neither of them was young any longer he could see no reason why they should not be married at once Of the reason in Kate s mind he had not a glimmering But Kate had her way She would not even talk of a time or express an opinion as to whether she would remain on the farm or live in Nancy Ellen s house or sell it and build whatever she wanted for herself Robert went away baffled and disappointed over some intangible thing he could not understand For six weeks Kate tortured herself and kept Robert from being happy Then one morning Agatha stopped to visit with her while Adam drove on to town After they had exhausted farming Little Poll s charms and the neighbours Agatha looked at Kate and said Katherine what is this I hear about Robert coming here every day now It appeals to me that he must have followed my advice Of course he never would have thought of coming if you hadn t told him so said Kate dryly Now THERE you are in error said the literal Agatha as she smoothed down Little Poll s skirts and twisted her ringlets into formal corkscrews Right THERE you are in error my dear The reason I told Robert to marry you was because he said to me when he suggested going after you to stay the night with me that he had seen you in the field when he passed and that you were the most glorious specimen of womanhood that he ever had seen He said you were the one to stay with me in case there should be any trouble because your head was always level and your heart was big as a barrel Yes that s the reason I can t always have it with me said Kate looking glorified instead of glorious Agatha it just happens to mean very much to me Will you just kindly begin at the beginning and tell me every single word Robert said to you and you said to him that day Why I have informed you explicitly said Agatha using her handkerchief on the toe of Poll s blue shoe He mentioned going after you and said what I told you and I told him to go He praised you so highly that when I spoke to him about the Southey woman I remembered it so I suggested to him as he seemed to think so well of you It just that minute flashed into my mind but HE made me think of it calling you glorious and level headed and big hearted Heavens Katherine Eleanor what more could you ask I guess that should be enough said Kate One certainly would presume so said Agatha Then Adam came and handed Kate her mail as she stood beside his car talking to him a minute while Agatha settled herself As Kate closed the gate behind her she saw a big square white envelope among the newspapers advertisements and letters She slipped it out and looked at it intently Then she ran her finger under the flap and read the contents She stood studying the few lines it contained frowning deeply Doesn t it beat the band she asked of the surrounding atmosphere She went up the walk entered the living room slipped the letter under the lid of the big family Bible and walking to the telephone she called doctor Gray s office He answered the call in person Robert this is Kate she said Would you have any deeply rooted objections to marrying me at six o clock this evening Well I should say not boomed Robert s voice the not coming so forcibly Kate dodged Have you got the information necessary for a license she asked Yes he answered Then bring one and your minister and come at six she said And Oh yes Robert will it be all right with you if I stay here and keep house for Adam until he and Milly can be married and move in Then I ll come to your house just as it is I don t mind coming to Nancy Ellen s home as I would another woman s Surely he cried Any arrangement you make will satisfy me All right I ll expect you with the document and the minister at six then said Kate and hung up the receiver Then she took it down again and calling Milly asked her to bring her best white dress and come up right away and help her get ready to entertain a few people that evening Then she called her sister Hannah and asked her if she thought that in the event she Kate wished that evening at six o clock to marry a very fine man and had no preparations whatever made her family would help her out to the extent of providing the supper She wanted all of them and all the children but the arrangement had come up suddenly and she could not possibly prepare a supper herself for such a big family in the length of time she had Hannah said she was perfectly sure everyone of them would drop everything and be tickled to pieces to bring the supper and to come and they would have a grand time What did Kate want Oh she wanted bread and chicken for meat maybe some potato chips and Angel s Food cake and a big freezer or two of Agatha s best ice cream and she thought possibly more butter and coffee than she had on hand She had plenty of sugar and cream and pickles and jelly She would have the tables all set as she did for Christmas Then Kate rang for Adam and put a broom in his hand as he entered the back door She met Milly with a pail of hot water and cloths to wash the glass She went to her room and got out her best afternoon dress of dull blue with gold lace and a pink velvet rose She shook it out and studied it She had worn it twice on the trip North None of them save Adam ever had seen it She put it on and looked at it critically Then she called Milly and they changed the neck and sleeves a little took a yard of width from the skirt and behold it became a creation in the very height of style Then Kate opened her trunk and got out the petticoat hose and low shoes to match it and laid them on her bed Then they set the table laid a fire ready to strike in the cook stove saw that the gas was all right set out the big coffee boiler and skimmed a crock full of cream By four o clock they could think of nothing else to do Then Kate bathed and went to her room to dress Adam and Milly were busy making themselves fine Little Poll sat in her prettiest dress watching her beloved Tate until Adam came and took her He had been instructed to send Robert and the minister to his mother s room as soon as they came Kate was trying to look her best yet making haste so that she would be ready on time She had made no arrangements except to spread a white goatskin where she and Robert would stand at the end of the big living room near her door Before she was fully dressed she began to hear young voices and knew that her people were coming When she was ready Kate looked at herself and muttered I ll give Robert and all of them a good surprise This is a real dress thanks to Nancy Ellen The poor girl It s scarcely fair to her to marry her man in a dress she gave me but I d stake my life she d rather I d have him than any other woman It was an evening of surprises At six Adam lighted a big log festooned with leaves and berries so that the flames roared and crackled up the chimney The early arrivals were the young people who had hung the mantel gas fixtures curtain poles and draped the doors with long sprays of bittersweet northern holly and great branches of red spice berries dogwood with its red leaves and berries and scarlet and yellow oak leaves The elders followed and piled the table with heaps of food then trailed red vines between dishes In a quandary as to what to wear without knowing what was expected of him further than saying I will at the proper moment Robert ended by slipping into Kate s room dressed in white flannel The ceremony was over at ten minutes after six Kate was lovely Robert was handsome everyone was happy the supper was a banquet The Bates family went home Adam disappeared with Milly while Little Poll went to sleep Left to themselves Robert took Kate in his arms and tried to tell her how much he loved her but felt he expressed himself poorly As she stood before him he said And now dear tell me what changed you and why we are married to night instead of at Christmas or in the spring Oh yes said Kate I almost forgot Why I wanted you to answer a letter for me Lucid said Robert He seated himself beside the table Bring on the ink and stationary and let me get it over Kate obeyed and with the writing material laid down the letter she had that morning received from John Jardine telling her that his wife had died suddenly and that as soon as he had laid her away he was coming to exact a definite promise from her as to the future and that he would move Heaven and earth before he would again be disappointed Robert read the letter and laid it down his face slowing flushing scarlet You called me out here and married me expressly to answer this he demanded Of course said Kate I thought if you could tell him that his letter came the day I married you it would stop his coming and not be such a disappointment to him Robert pushed the letter from him violently and arose By he checked himself and stared at her Kate you don t MEAN that he cried Tell me you don t MEAN that Why SURE I do said Kate It gave me a fine excuse I was so homesick for you and tired waiting to begin life with you Agatha told me about her telling you the day she was ill to marry me and the reason I wouldn t was because I thought maybe you asked me so offhandlike because she TOLD you to and you didn t really love me Then this morning she was here and we were talking and she got round it again and then she told me ALL you said and I saw you did love me and that you would have asked me if she hadn t said anything and I wanted you so badly Robert ever since that day we met on the footlog I ve know that you were the only man I d every really WANT to marry Robert I ve never come anywhere near loving anybody else The minute Agatha told me this morning I began to think how I could take back what I d been saying how I could change and right then Adam handed me that letter and it gave me a fine way out and so I called you Sure I married you to answer that Robert now go and do it All right he said In a minute Then he walked to her and took her in his arms again but Kate could not understand why he was laughing until he shook when he kissed her End of Project Gutenberg s A Daughter of the Land by Gene Stratton Porter END OF THIS
