INDEX four hundred ninety one PUBLISHER S PREFACE For more than twenty years I have entertained the design of publishing an English translation of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum When I formed this design the number of English speaking persons who had ever heard of the book was very limited The memory of Max Stirner had been virtually extinct for an entire generation But in the last two decades there has been a remarkable revival of interest both in the book and in its author It began in this country with a discussion in the pages of the Anarchist periodical Liberty in which Stirner s thought was clearly expounded and vigorously championed by doctor James L Walker who adopted for this discussion the pseudonym Tak Kak At that time doctor Walker was the chief editorial writer for the Galveston News Some years later he became a practising physician in Mexico where he died in nineteen oh four A series of essays which he began in an Anarchist periodical Egoism and which he lived to complete was published after his death in a small volume The Philosophy of Egoism It is a very able and convincing exposition of Stirner s teachings and almost the only one that exists in the English language But the chief instrument in the revival of Stirnerism was and is the German poet John Henry Mackay Very early in his career he met Stirner s name in Lange s History of Materialism and was moved thereby to read his book The work made such an impression on him that he resolved to devote a portion of his life to the rediscovery and rehabilitation of the lost and forgotten genius Through years of toil and correspondence and travel and triumphing over tremendous obstacles he carried his task to completion and his biography of Stirner appeared in Berlin in eighteen ninety eight It is a tribute to the thoroughness of Mackay s work that since its publication not one important fact about Stirner has been discovered by anybody During his years of investigation Mackay s advertising for information had created a new interest in Stirner which was enhanced by the sudden fame of the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche an author whose intellectual kinship with Stirner has been a subject of much controversy Der Einzige previously obtainable only in an expensive form was included in Philipp Reclam s Universal Bibliothek and this cheap edition has enjoyed a wide and ever increasing circulation During the last dozen years the book has been translated twice into French once into Italian once into Russian and possibly into other languages The Scandinavian critic Brandes has written on Stirner A large and appreciative volume entitled L Individualisme Anarchiste Max Stirner from the pen of Prof Victor Basch of the University of Rennes has appeared in Paris Another large and sympathetic volume Max Stirner written by doctor Anselm Ruest has been published very recently in Berlin doctor Paul Eltzbacher in his work Der Anarchismus gives a chapter to Stirner making him one of the seven typical Anarchists beginning with William Godwin and ending with Tolstoi of whom his book treats There is hardly a notable magazine or a review on the Continent that has not given at least one leading article to the subject of Stirner Upon the initiative of Mackay and with the aid of other admirers a suitable stone has been placed above the philosopher s previously neglected grave and a memorial tablet upon the house in Berlin where he died in eighteen fifty six and this spring another is to be placed upon the house in Bayreuth where he was born in eighteen oh six As a result of these various efforts and though but little has been written about Stirner in the English language his name is now known at least to thousands in America and England where formerly it was known only to hundreds Therefore conditions are now more favorable for the reception of this volume than they were when I formed the design of publishing it more than twenty years ago The problem of securing a reasonably good translation for in the case of a work presenting difficulties so enormous it was idle to hope for an adequate translation was finally solved by entrusting the task to Steven T Byington a scholar of remarkable attainments whose specialty is philology and who is also one of the ablest workers in the propaganda of Anarchism But for further security from error it was agreed with mister Byington that his translation should have the benefit of revision by doctor Walker the most thorough American student of Stirner and by Emma Heller Schumm and George Schumm who are not only sympathetic with Stirner but familiar with the history of his time and who enjoy a knowledge of English and German that makes it difficult to decide which is their native tongue It was also agreed that upon any point of difference between the translator and his revisers which consultation might fail to solve the publisher should decide This method has been followed and in a considerable number of instances it has fallen to me to make a decision It is only fair to say therefore that the responsibility for special errors and imperfections properly rests on my shoulders whereas on the other hand the credit for whatever general excellence the translation may possess belongs with the same propriety to mister Byington and his coadjutors One thing is certain its defects are due to no lack of loving care and pains And I think I may add with confidence while realizing fully how far short of perfection it necessarily falls that it may safely challenge comparison with the translations that have been made into other languages In particular I am responsible for the admittedly erroneous rendering of the title The Ego and His Own is not an exact English equivalent of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum But then there is no exact English equivalent Perhaps the nearest is The Unique One and His Property But the unique one is not strictly the Einzige for uniqueness connotes not only singleness but an admirable singleness while Stirner s Einzigkeit is admirable in his eyes only as such it being no part of the purpose of his book to distinguish a particular Einzigkeit as more excellent than another Moreover The Unique One and His Property has no graces to compel our forgiveness of its slight inaccuracy It is clumsy and unattractive And the same objections may be urged with still greater force against all the other renderings that have been suggested The Single One and His Property The Only One and His Property The Lone One and His Property The Unit and His Property and last and least and worst The Individual and His Prerogative The Ego and His Own on the other hand if not a precise rendering is at least an excellent title in itself excellent by its euphony its monosyllabic incisiveness and its telling Einzigkeit Another strong argument in its favor is the emphatic correspondence of the phrase his own with mister Byington s renderings of the kindred words Eigenheit and Eigner Moreover no reader will be led astray who bears in mind Stirner s distinction I am not an ego along with other egos but the sole ego I am unique And to help the reader to bear this in mind the various renderings of the word Einzige that occur through the volume are often accompanied by foot notes showing that in the German one and the same word does duty for all If the reader finds the first quarter of this book somewhat forbidding and obscure he is advised nevertheless not to falter Close attention will master almost every difficulty and if he will but give it he will find abundant reward in what follows For his guidance I may specify one defect in the author s style When controverting a view opposite to his own he seldom distinguishes with sufficient clearness his statement of his own view from his re statement of the antagonistic view As a result the reader is plunged into deeper and deeper mystification until something suddenly reveals the cause of his misunderstanding after which he must go back and read again I therefore put him on his guard The other difficulties lie as a rule in the structure of the work As to these I can hardly do better than translate the following passage from Prof Basch s book alluded to above There is nothing more disconcerting than the first approach to this strange work Stirner does not condescend to inform us as to the architecture of his edifice or furnish us the slightest guiding thread The apparent divisions of the book are few and misleading From the first page to the last a unique thought circulates but it divides itself among an infinity of vessels and arteries in each of which runs a blood so rich in ferments that one is tempted to describe them all There is no progress in the development and the repetitions are innumerable The reader who is not deterred by this oddity or rather absence of composition gives proof of genuine intellectual courage At first one seems to be confronted with a collection of essays strung together with a throng of aphorisms But if you read this book several times if after having penetrated the intimacy of each of its parts you then traverse it as a whole gradually the fragments weld themselves together and Stirner s thought is revealed in all its unity in all its force and in all its depth A word about the dedication Mackay s investigations have brought to light that Marie Daehnhardt had nothing whatever in common with Stirner and so was unworthy of the honor conferred upon her She was no Eigene I therefore reproduce the dedication merely in the interest of historical accuracy Happy as I am in the appearance of this book my joy is not unmixed with sorrow The cherished project was as dear to the heart of doctor Walker as to mine and I deeply grieve that he is no longer with us to share our delight in the fruition Nothing however can rob us of the masterly introduction that he wrote for this volume in nineteen oh three or perhaps earlier from which I will not longer keep the reader This introduction no more than the book itself shall that Einzige Death make his Eigentum February nineteen oh seven B R T INTRODUCTION Fifty years sooner or later can make little difference in the case of a book so revolutionary as this It saw the light when a so called revolutionary movement was preparing in men s minds which agitation was however only a disturbance due to desires to participate in government and to govern and to be governed in a manner different to that which prevails The revolutionists of eighteen forty eight were bewitched with an idea They were not at all the masters of ideas Most of those who since that time have prided themselves upon being revolutionists have been and are likewise but the bondmen of an idea that of the different lodgment of authority The temptation is of course present to attempt an explanation of the central thought of this work but such an effort appears to be unnecessary to one who has the volume in his hand The author s care in illustrating his meaning shows that he realized how prone the possessed man is to misunderstand whatever is not moulded according to the fashions in thinking The author s learning was considerable his command of words and ideas may never be excelled by another and he judged it needful to develop his argument in manifold ways So those who enter into the spirit of it will scarcely hope to impress others with the same conclusion in a more summary manner Or if one might deem that possible after reading Stirner still one cannot think that it could be done so surely The author has made certain work of it even though he has to wait for his public but still the reception of the book by its critics amply proves the truth of the saying that one can give another arguments but not understanding The system makers and system believers thus far cannot get it out of their heads that any discourse about the nature of an ego must turn upon the common characteristics of egos to make a systematic scheme of what they share as a generality The critics inquire what kind of man the author is talking about They repeat the question What does he believe in They fail to grasp the purport of the recorded answer I believe in myself which is attributed to a common soldier long before the time of Stirner They ask What is the principle of the self conscious egoist the Einzige To this perplexity Stirner says Change the question put who instead of what and an answer can then be given by naming him This of course is too simple for persons governed by ideas and for persons in quest of new governing ideas They wish to classify the man Now that in me which you can classify is not my distinguishing self Man is the horizon or zero of my existence as an individual Over that I rise as I can At least I am something more than man in general Pre existing worship of ideals and disrespect for self had made of the ego at the very most a Somebody oftener an empty vessel to be filled with the grace or the leavings of a tyrannous doctrine thus a Nobody Stirner dispels the morbid subjection and recognizes each one who knows and feels himself as his own property to be neither humble Nobody nor befogged Somebody but henceforth flat footed and level headed mister Thisbody who has a character and good pleasure of his own just as he has a name of his own The critics who attacked this work and were answered in the author s minor writings rescued from oblivion by John Henry Mackay nearly all display the most astonishing triviality and impotent malice We owe to doctor Eduard von Hartmann the unquestionable service which he rendered by directing attention to this book in his Philosophie des Unbewussten the first edition of which was published in eighteen sixty nine and in other writings I do not begrudge doctor von Hartmann the liberty of criticism which he used and I think the admirers of Stirner s teaching must quite appreciate one thing which Von Hartmann did at a much later date In Der Eigene of August ten eighteen ninety six there appeared a letter written by him and giving among other things certain data from which to judge that when Friedrich Nietzsche wrote his later essays Nietzsche was not ignorant of Stirner s book Von Hartmann wishes that Stirner had gone on and developed his principle Von Hartmann suggests that you and I are really the same spirit looking out through two pairs of eyes Then one may reply I need not concern myself about you for in myself I have us and at that rate Von Hartmann is merely accusing himself of inconsistency for when Stirner wrote this book Von Hartmann s spirit was writing it and it is just the pity that Von Hartmann in his present form does not indorse what he said in the form of Stirner that Stirner was different from any other man that his ego was not Fichte s transcendental generality but this transitory ego of flesh and blood It is not as a generality that you and I differ but as a couple of facts which are not to be reasoned into one I is somewise Hartmann and thus Hartmann is I but I am not Hartmann and Hartmann is not I Neither am I the I of Stirner only Stirner himself was Stirner s I Note how comparatively indifferent a matter it is with Stirner that one is an ego but how all important it is that one be a self conscious ego a self conscious self willed person Those not self conscious and self willed are constantly acting from self interested motives but clothing these in various garbs Watch those people closely in the light of Stirner s teaching and they seem to be hypocrites they have so many good moral and religious plans of which self interest is at the end and bottom but they we may believe do not know that this is more than a coincidence In Stirner we have the philosophical foundation for political liberty His interest in the practical development of egoism to the dissolution of the State and the union of free men is clear and pronounced and harmonizes perfectly with the economic philosophy of Josiah Warren Allowing for difference of temperament and language there is a substantial agreement between Stirner and Proudhon Each would be free and sees in every increase of the number of free people and their intelligence an auxiliary force against the oppressor But on the other hand will any one for a moment seriously contend that Nietzsche and Proudhon march together in general aim and tendency that they have anything in common except the daring to profane the shrine and sepulchre of superstition Nietzsche has been much spoken of as a disciple of Stirner and owing to favorable cullings from Nietzsche s writings it has occurred that one of his books has been supposed to contain more sense than it really does so long as one had read only the extracts Nietzsche cites scores or hundreds of authors Had he read everything and not read Stirner But Nietzsche is as unlike Stirner as a tight rope performance is unlike an algebraic equation Stirner loved liberty for himself and loved to see any and all men and women taking liberty and he had no lust of power Democracy to him was sham liberty egoism the genuine liberty Nietzsche on the contrary pours out his contempt upon democracy because it is not aristocratic He is predatory to the point of demanding that those who must succumb to feline rapacity shall be taught to submit with resignation When he speaks of Anarchistic dogs scouring the streets of great civilized cities it is true the context shows that he means the Communists but his worship of Napoleon his bathos of anxiety for the rise of an aristocracy that shall rule Europe for thousands of years his idea of treating women in the oriental fashion show that Nietzsche has struck out in a very old path doing the apotheosis of tyranny We individual egoistic Anarchists however may say to the Nietzsche school so as not to be misunderstood We do not ask of the Napoleons to have pity nor of the predatory barons to do justice They will find it convenient for their own welfare to make terms with men who have learned of Stirner what a man can be who worships nothing bears allegiance to nothing To Nietzsche s rhodomontade of eagles in baronial form born to prey on industrial lambs we rather tauntingly oppose the ironical question Where are your claws What if the eagles are found to be plain barnyard fowls on which more silly fowls have fastened steel spurs to hack the victims who however have the power to disarm the sham eagles between two suns Stirner shows that men make their tyrants as they make their gods and his purpose is to unmake tyrants Nietzsche dearly loves a tyrant In style Stirner s work offers the greatest possible contrast to the puerile padded phraseology of Nietzsche s Zarathustra and its false imagery Who ever imagined such an unnatural conjuncture as an eagle toting a serpent in friendship which performance is told of in bare words but nothing comes of it In Stirner we are treated to an enlivening and earnest discussion addressed to serious minds and every reader feels that the word is to him for his instruction and benefit so far as he has mental independence and courage to take it and use it The startling intrepidity of this book is infused with a whole hearted love for all mankind as evidenced by the fact that the author shows not one iota of prejudice or any idea of division of men into ranks He would lay aside government but would establish any regulation deemed convenient and for this only our convenience is consulted Thus there will be general liberty only when the disposition toward tyranny is met by intelligent opposition that will no longer submit to such a rule Beyond this the manly sympathy and philosophical bent of Stirner are such that rulership appears by contrast a vanity an infatuation of perverted pride We know not whether we more admire our author or more love him Stirner s attitude toward woman is not special She is an individual if she can be not handicapped by anything he says feels thinks or plans This was more fully exemplified in his life than even in this book but there is not a line in the book to put or keep woman in an inferior position to man neither is there anything of caste or aristocracy in the book Likewise there is nothing of obscurantism or affected mysticism about it Everything in it is made as plain as the author could make it He who does not so is not Stirner s disciple nor successor nor company worker Some one may ask How does plumb line Anarchism train with the unbridled egoism proclaimed by Stirner The plumb line is not a fetish but an intellectual conviction and egoism is a universal fact of animal life Nothing could seem clearer to my mind than that the reality of egoism must first come into the consciousness of men before we can have the unbiased Einzige in place of the prejudiced biped who lends himself to the support of tyrannies a million times stronger over me than the natural self interest of any individual When plumb line doctrine is misconceived as duty between unequal minded men as a religion of humanity it is indeed the confusion of trying to read without knowing the alphabet and of putting philanthropy in place of contract But if the plumb line be scientific it is or can be my possession my property and I choose it for its use when circumstances admit of its use I do not feel bound to use it because it is scientific in building my house but as my will to be intelligent is not to be merely wilful the adoption of the plumb line follows the discarding of incantations There is no plumb line without the unvarying lead at the end of the line not a fluttering bird or a clawing cat On the practical side of the question of egoism versus self surrender and for a trial of egoism in politics this may be said the belief that men not moved by a sense of duty will be unkind or unjust to others is but an indirect confession that those who hold that belief are greatly interested in having others live for them rather than for themselves But I do not ask or expect so much I am content if others individually live for themselves and thus cease in so many ways to act in opposition to my living for myself to our living for ourselves If Christianity has failed to turn the world from evil it is not to be dreamed that rationalism of a pious moral stamp will succeed in the same task Christianity or all philanthropic love is tested in non resistance It is a dream that example will change the hearts of rulers tyrants mobs If the extremest self surrender fails how can a mixture of Christian love and worldly caution succeed This at least must be given up The policy of Christ and Tolstoi can soon be tested but Tolstoi s belief is not satisfied with a present test and failure He has the infatuation of one who persists because this ought to be The egoist who thinks I should like this to be still has the sense to perceive that it is not accomplished by the fact of some believing and submitting inasmuch as others are alert to prey upon the unresisting The Pharaohs we have ever with us Several passages in this most remarkable book show the author as a man full of sympathy When we reflect upon his deliberately expressed opinions and sentiments his spurning of the sense of moral obligation as the last form of superstition may we not be warranted in thinking that the total disappearance of the sentimental supposition of duty liberates a quantity of nervous energy for the purest generosity and clarifies the intellect for the more discriminating choice of objects of merit J L WALKER TRANSLATOR S PREFACE If the style of this book is found unattractive it will show that I have done my work ill and not represented the author truly but if it is found odd I beg that I may not bear all the blame I have simply tried to reproduce the author s own mixture of colloquialisms and technicalities and his preference for the precise expression of his thought rather than the word conventionally expected One especial feature of the style however gives the reason why this preface should exist It is characteristic of Stirner s writing that the thread of thought is carried on largely by the repetition of the same word in a modified form or sense That connection of ideas which has guided popular instinct in the formation of words is made to suggest the line of thought which the writer wishes to follow If this echoing of words is missed the bearing of the statements on each other is in a measure lost and where the ideas are very new one cannot afford to throw away any help in following their connection Therefore where a useful echo and there are few useless ones in the book could not be reproduced in English I have generally called attention to it in a note My notes are distinguished from the author s by being enclosed in brackets One or two of such coincidences of language occurring in words which are prominent throughout the book should be borne constantly in mind as a sort of Keri perpetuum for instance the identity in the original of the words spirit and mind and of the phrases supreme being and highest essence In such cases I have repeated the note where it seemed that such repetition might be absolutely necessary but have trusted the reader to carry it in his head where a failure of his memory would not be ruinous or likely For the same reason that is in order not to miss any indication of the drift of the thought I have followed the original in the very liberal use of italics and in the occasional eccentric use of a punctuation mark as I might not have done in translating a work of a different nature I have set my face as a flint against the temptation to add notes that were not part of the translation There is no telling how much I might have enlarged the book if I had put a note at every sentence which deserved to have its truth brought out by fuller elucidation or even at every one which I thought needed correction It might have been within my province if I had been able to explain all the allusions to contemporary events but I doubt whether any one could do that properly without having access to the files of three or four well chosen German newspapers of Stirner s time The allusions are clear enough without names and dates to give a vivid picture of certain aspects of German life then The tone of some of them is explained by the fact that the book was published under censorship I have usually preferred for the sake of the connection to translate Biblical quotations somewhat as they stand in the German rather than conform them altogether to the English Bible I am sometimes quite as near the original Greek as if I had followed the current translation Where German books are referred to the pages cited are those of the German editions even when usually because of some allusions in the text the titles of the books are translated STEVEN T BYINGTON THE EGO AND HIS

2133-2145-0005	train-other-500	and looked into its heart so that you can doubtless tell us how God himself attends to God s cause which we are called to serve
2133-2145-0006	train-other-500	And you do not conceal the Lord s doings either Now what is his cause Has he as is demanded of us made an alien cause the cause of truth
2133-2145-0007	train-other-500	or love his own You are shocked by this misunderstanding and you instruct us that God s cause is indeed the cause of truth and love but that this cause cannot be called alien to him
2133-2145-0008	train-other-500	because God is himself truth and love you are shocked by the assumption that God could be like us poor worms in furthering an alien cause as his own
2133-2145-0009	train-other-500	Should God take up the cause of truth if he were not himself truth He cares only for his cause but because he is all in all therefore all is his
2133-2145-0010	train-other-500	cause But we we are not all in all and our cause is altogether little and contemptible
none	none	 therefore we must serve a 
2133-2145-0011	train-other-500	higher cause Now it is clear God cares only for what is his busies himself only with himself thinks only of himself
2133-2145-0012	train-other-500	and has only himself before his eyes woe to all that is not well pleasing to him He serves no higher person and satisfies only himself His cause is a purely
2133-2145-0013	train-other-500	egoistic cause How is it with mankind whose cause we are to make our own Is its cause that of another and does mankind serve a higher cause No
2133-2145-0014	train-other-500	mankind looks only at itself mankind will promote the interests of mankind only mankind is its own cause That it may develop

2133-2145-0016	train-other-500	Is not mankind s cause a purely egoistic cause
none	none	 I have no need to take up each thing that wants to throw its cause on us and show that it is occupied only with itself

none	none	 Joy the manure of their corpses the nation comes to its bloom 
2133-2145-0020	train-other-500	The individuals have died for the great cause of the nation and the nation sends some words of thanks after them and has the profit of it I call that a paying kind of egoism
2133-2145-0021	train-other-500	But only look at that Sultan who cares so lovingly for his people Is he not pure unselfishness itself and does he not hourly sacrifice himself for his people Oh yes
2133-2145-0022	train-other-500	for his people Just try it show yourself not as his but as your own for breaking away from his egoism you will take a trip to jail
2133-2145-0023	train-other-500	The Sultan has set his cause on nothing but himself he is to himself all in all he is to himself the only one and tolerates nobody who would dare not to be one of his people
none	none	 And will you not learn by these brilliant examples that the egoist gets on best 
2133-2145-0024	train-other-500	I for my part take a lesson from them and propose instead of further unselfishly serving those great egoists rather to be the egoist myself
2133-2145-0025	train-other-500	God and mankind have concerned themselves for nothing for nothing but themselves Let me then likewise concern myself for myself
2133-2145-0026	train-other-500	who am equally with God the nothing of all others who am my all
none	none	 who am the only one four If God 
2133-2145-0027	train-other-500	if mankind as you affirm have substance enough in themselves to be all in all to themselves then I feel that I shall still less lack that
2133-2145-0028	train-other-500	and that I shall have no complaint to make of my emptiness I am nothing in the sense of emptiness but I am the creative nothing
2133-2145-0029	train-other-500	the nothing out of which I myself as creator create everything Away then with every concern that is not altogether my concern
2133-2145-0030	train-other-500	You think at least the good cause must be my concern What s good what s bad Why I myself am my concern and I am neither good nor bad
none	none	 Neither has meaning for me

none	none	 My concern is neither the divine nor the human

2133-289460-0016	train-other-500	the fight against reason The fairest part of childhood passes without the necessity of coming to blows with reason We care nothing at all about it do not meddle with it admit no reason

2133-289460-0032	train-other-500	and the like cries conscience to us and frightens us away from it Not the might of the avenging Eumenides not Poseidon s wrath not God far as he sees the hidden
2133-289460-0033	train-other-500	not the father s rod of punishment do we fear but conscience We run after our thoughts now and follow their commands just as before we followed parental human ones
2133-289460-0034	train-other-500	Our course of action is determined by our thoughts ideas conceptions faith as it is in childhood by the commands of our parents For all that

2133-289460-0037	train-other-500	they had been only thoughts that we had about a thing we thought of the thing so or so Thus we may have thought God made the world that we see there but we did not think of search
2133-289460-0038	train-other-500	the depths of the Godhead itself we may have thought that is the truth about the matter but we did not think of Truth itself nor unite into one sentence God is truth

2133-289460-0039	train-other-500	though he does not therefore hesitate to ascertain in an individual case
none	none	 what truth there is in the thing i e whether the thing 
2133-289460-0040	train-other-500	is true Any thought bound to a thing is not yet nothing but a thought absolute thought To bring to light the pure thought or to be of its party
2133-289460-0041	train-other-500	is the delight of youth and all the shapes of light in the world of thought like truth
none	none	 freedom humanity Man et cetera illumine and inspire the youthful soul 
2133-289460-0042	train-other-500	But when the spirit is recognized as the essential thing it still makes a difference whether the spirit is poor or rich and therefore one seeks to become rich in spirit
2133-289460-0043	train-other-500	the spirit wants to spread out so as to found its empire an empire that is not of this world the world just conquered Thus then it longs to become all in all to itself
none	none	 i e 
2133-289460-0044	train-other-500	although I am spirit I am not yet perfected spirit and must first seek the complete spirit But with that I who had just now found myself as spirit
2133-289460-0045	train-other-500	lose myself again at once bowing before the complete spirit as one not my own but supernal and feeling my emptiness Spirit is the essential point for everything to be sure
2133-289460-0046	train-other-500	but then is every spirit the right spirit The right and true spirit is the ideal of spirit the Holy Spirit It is not my or your spirit but just
2133-289460-0047	train-other-500	an ideal supernal one it is God God is spirit
none	none	 And this supernal Father in heaven gives it to those that pray to him seven The man is distinguished from the youth by the fact that he takes the world as it is instead of everywhere fancying it amiss and wanting to improve it i e model it after his ideal 
2133-289460-0048	train-other-500	in him the view that one must deal with the world according to his interest not according to his ideals becomes confirmed So long as one knows himself only as spirit
2133-289460-0049	train-other-500	and feels that all the value of his existence consists in being spirit it becomes easy for the youth to give his life the bodily life for a nothing
none	none	 for the silliest point of honor 
2133-289460-0050	train-other-500	so long it is only thoughts that one has ideas that he hopes to be able to realize some day when he has found a sphere of action thus one has meanwhile only ideals
2133-289460-0051	train-other-500	unexecuted ideas or thoughts
none	none	 Not till one has fallen in love with his corporeal self 
2133-289460-0052	train-other-500	and takes a pleasure in himself as a living flesh and blood person but it is in mature years in the man that we find it so
none	none	 not till then has one a personal or egoistic interest i e an interest not only of our spirit 
2133-289460-0053	train-other-500	for instance but of total satisfaction satisfaction of the whole chap a selfish interest Just compare a man with a youth and see if he will not appear to you harder
2133-289460-0054	train-other-500	less magnanimous more selfish Is he therefore worse No you say he has only become more definite or as you also call it more practical
2133-289460-0055	train-other-500	But the main point is this that he makes himself more the centre than does the youth
none	none	 who is infatuated about other things e g God 
2133-289460-0056	train-other-500	fatherland and so on Therefore the man shows a second self discovery The youth found himself as spirit and lost himself again in the general spirit the complete
2133-289460-0057	train-other-500	holy spirit Man mankind in short all ideals the man finds himself as embodied spirit
2133-289460-0058	train-other-500	Boys had only unintellectual interests
none	none	 i e interests devoid of thoughts and ideas 
2133-289460-0059	train-other-500	youths only intellectual ones the man has bodily personal egoistic interests If the child has not an object that it can occupy itself with
2133-289460-0060	train-other-500	it feels ennui for it does not yet know how to occupy itself with itself The youth on the contrary throws the object aside because for him thoughts arose out of the object
2133-289460-0061	train-other-500	he occupies himself with his thoughts his dreams occupies himself intellectually or his mind is occupied
2133-289460-0062	train-other-500	The young man includes everything not intellectual under the contemptuous name of externalities If he nevertheless sticks to the most trivial externalities
2133-289460-0063	train-other-500	e g the customs of students clubs and other formalities it is because and when
none	none	 he discovers mind in them i e when they are symbols to him 
2133-289460-0064	train-other-500	As I find myself back of things and that as mind so I must later find myself also back of thoughts to wit as their creator and owner
2133-289460-0065	train-other-500	In the time of spirits thoughts grew till they overtopped my head whose offspring they yet were they hovered about me and convulsed me like fever phantasies an awful power
2133-289460-0066	train-other-500	The thoughts had become corporeal on their own account were ghosts such as God Emperor Pope Fatherland et cetera If I destroy their corporeity
2133-289460-0067	train-other-500	then I take them back into mine and say I alone am corporeal And now I take the world as what it is to me as mine as my property
2133-289460-0068	train-other-500	I refer all to myself If as spirit I had thrust away the world in the deepest contempt so as owner I thrust spirits or ideas away into their vanity
2133-289460-0069	train-other-500	They have no longer any power over me as no earthly might has power over the spirit The child was realistic taken up with the things of this world
none	none	 till little by little he succeeded in getting at what was back of these very things 
2133-289460-0070	train-other-500	the youth was idealistic inspired by thoughts till he worked his way up to where he became the man the egoistic man who deals with things and thoughts according to his heart s pleasure
2133-289460-0071	train-other-500	and sets his personal interest above everything
none	none	 Finally the old man When I become one there will still be time enough to speak of that II MEN OF THE OLD TIME AND THE NEW How each of us developed himself what he strove for attained or missed what objects he formerly pursued and what plans and wishes his heart is now set on what transformations his views have experienced what perturbations his principles in short how he has to day become what yesterday or years ago he was not this he brings out again from his memory with more or less ease and he feels with especial vividness what changes have taken place in himself when he has before his eyes the unrolling of another s life Let us therefore look into the activities our fore fathers busied themselves with I THE ANCIENTS Custom having once given the name of the ancients to our pre Christian ancestors we will not throw it up against them that in comparison with us experienced people they ought properly to be called children but will rather continue to honor them as our good old fathers But how have they come to be antiquated and who could displace them through his pretended newness We know of course the revolutionary innovator and disrespectful heir who even took away the sanctity of the fathers sabbath to hallow his Sunday and interrupted the course of time to begin at himself with a new chronology we know him and know that it is the Christian But does he remain forever young and is he to day still the new man or will he too be superseded as he has superseded the ancients The fathers must doubtless have themselves begotten the young one who entombed them Let us then peep at this act of generation To the ancients the world was a truth says Feuerbach but he forgets to make the important addition a truth whose untruth they tried to get back of and at last really did What is meant by those words of Feuerbach will be easily recognized if they are put alongside the Christian thesis of the vanity and transitoriness of the world For as the Christian can never convince himself of the vanity of the divine word but believes in its eternal and unshakeable truth which the more its depths are searched must all the more brilliantly come to light and triumph so the ancients on their side lived in the feeling that the world and mundane relations e g the natural ties of blood were the truth before which their powerless I must bow The very thing on which the ancients set the highest value is spurned by Christians as the valueless and what they recognized as truth these brand as idle lies the high significance of the fatherland disappears and the Christian must regard himself as a stranger on earth eight the sanctity of funeral rites from which sprang a work of art like the Antigone of Sophocles is designated as a paltry thing Let the dead bury their dead the infrangible truth of family ties is represented as an untruth which one cannot promptly enough get clear of nine and so in everything If we now see that to the two sides opposite things appear as truth to one the natural to the other the intellectual to one earthly things and relations to the other heavenly the heavenly fatherland Jerusalem that is above et cetera it still remains to be considered how the new time and that undeniable reversal could come out of antiquity But the ancients themselves worked toward making their truth a lie Let us plunge at once into the midst of the most brilliant years of the ancients into the Periclean century Then the Sophistic culture was spreading and Greece made a pastime of what had hitherto been to her a monstrously serious matter The fathers had been enslaved by the undisturbed power of existing things too long for the posterity not to have to learn by bitter experience to feel themselves Therefore the Sophists with courageous sauciness pronounce the reassuring words Don t be bluffed and diffuse the rationalistic doctrine Use your understanding your wit your mind against everything it is by having a good and well drilled understanding that one gets through the world best provides for himself the best lot the pleasantest life Thus they recognize in mind man s true weapon against the world This is why they lay such stress on dialectic skill command of language the art of disputation et cetera They announce that mind is to be used against everything but they are still far removed from the holiness of the Spirit for to them it is a means a weapon as trickery and defiance serve children for the same purpose their mind is the unbribable understanding To day we should call that a one sided culture of the understanding and add the warning Cultivate not only your understanding but also and especially your heart Socrates did the same For if the heart did not become free from its natural impulses but remained filled with the most fortuitous contents and as an uncriticised avidity altogether in the power of things i e nothing but a vessel of the most various appetites then it was unavoidable that the free understanding must serve the bad heart and was ready to justify everything that the wicked heart desired Therefore Socrates says that it is not enough for one to use his understanding in all things but it is a question of what cause one exerts it for We should now say one must serve the good cause But serving the good cause is being moral Hence Socrates is the founder of ethics Certainly the principle of the Sophistic doctrine must lead to the possibility that the blindest and most dependent slave of his desires might yet be an excellent sophist and with keen understanding trim and expound everything in favor of his coarse heart What could there be for which a good reason might not be found or which might not be defended through thick and thin Therefore Socrates says You must be pure hearted if your shrewdness is to be valued At this point begins the second period of Greek liberation of the mind the period of purity of heart For the first was brought to a close by the Sophists in their proclaiming the omnipotence of the understanding But the heart remained worldly minded remained a servant of the world always affected by worldly wishes This coarse heart was to be cultivated from now on the era of culture of the heart But how is the heart to be cultivated What the understanding this one side of the mind has reached to wit the capability of playing freely with and over every concern awaits the heart also everything worldly must come to grief before it so that at last family commonwealth fatherland and the like are given up for the sake of the heart i e of blessedness the heart s blessedness Daily experience confirms the truth that the understanding may have renounced a thing many years before the heart has ceased to beat for it So the Sophistic understanding too had so far become master over the dominant ancient powers that they now needed only to be driven out of the heart in which they dwelt unmolested to have at last no part at all left in man This war is opened by Socrates and not till the dying day of the old world does it end in peace The examination of the heart takes its start with Socrates and all the contents of the heart are sifted In their last and extremest struggles the ancients threw all contents out of the heart and let it no longer beat for anything this was the deed of the Skeptics The same purgation of the heart was now achieved in the Skeptical age as the understanding had succeeded in establishing in the Sophistic age The Sophistic culture has brought it to pass that one s understanding no longer stands still before anything and the Skeptical that his heart is no longer moved by anything So long as man is entangled in the movements of the world and embarrassed by relations to the world and he is so till the end of antiquity because his heart still has to struggle for independence from the worldly so long he is not yet spirit for spirit is without body and has no relations to the world and corporality for it the world does not exist nor natural bonds but only the spiritual and spiritual bonds Therefore man must first become so completely unconcerned and reckless so altogether without relations as the Skeptical culture presents him so altogether indifferent to the world that even its falling in ruins would not move him before he could feel himself as worldless i e as spirit And this is the result of the gigantic work of the ancients that man knows himself as a being without relations and without a world as spirit Only now after all worldly care has left him is he all in all to himself is he only for himself i e he is spirit for the spirit or in plainer language he cares only for the spiritual In the Christian wisdom of serpents and innocence of doves the two sides understanding and heart of the ancient liberation of mind are so completed that they appear young and new again and neither the one nor the other lets itself be bluffed any longer by the worldly and natural Thus the ancients mounted to spirit and strove to become spiritual But a man who wishes to be active as spirit is drawn to quite other tasks than he was able to set himself formerly to tasks which really give something to do to the spirit and not to mere sense or acuteness ten which exerts itself only to become master of things The spirit busies itself solely about the spiritual and seeks out the traces of mind in everything to the believing spirit everything comes from God and interests him only to the extent that it reveals this origin to the philosophic spirit everything appears with the stamp of reason and interests him only so far as he is able to discover in it reason i e spiritual content Not the spirit then which has to do with absolutely nothing unspiritual with no thing but only with the essence which exists behind and above things with thoughts not that did the ancients exert for they did not yet have it no they had only reached the point of struggling and longing for it and therefore sharpened it against their too powerful foe the world of sense but what would not have been sensuous for them since Jehovah or the gods of the heathen were yet far removed from the conception God is spirit since the heavenly fatherland had not yet stepped into the place of the sensuous et cetera they sharpened against the world of sense their sense their acuteness To this day the Jews those precocious children of antiquity have got no farther and with all the subtlety and strength of their prudence and understanding which easily becomes master of things and forces them to obey it they cannot discover spirit which takes no account whatever of things The Christian has spiritual interests because he allows himself to be a spiritual man the Jew does not even understand these interests in their purity because he does not allow himself to assign no value to things He does not arrive at pure spirituality a spirituality such as is religiously expressed e g in the faith of Christians which alone i e without works justifies Their unspirituality sets Jews forever apart from Christians for the spiritual man is incomprehensible to the unspiritual as the unspiritual is contemptible to the spiritual But the Jews have only the spirit of this world The ancient acuteness and profundity lies as far from the spirit and the spirituality of the Christian world as earth from heaven He who feels himself as free spirit is not oppressed and made anxious by the things of this world because he does not care for them if one is still to feel their burden he must be narrow enough to attach weight to them as is evidently the case for instance when one is still concerned for his dear life He to whom everything centres in knowing and conducting himself as a free spirit gives little heed to how scantily he is supplied meanwhile and does not reflect at all on how he must make his arrangements to have a thoroughly free or enjoyable life He is not disturbed by the inconveniences of the life that depends on things because he lives only spiritually and on spiritual food while aside from this he only gulps things down like a beast hardly knowing it and dies bodily to be sure when his fodder gives out but knows himself immortal as spirit and closes his eyes with an adoration or a thought His life is occupation with the spiritual is thinking the rest does not bother him let him busy himself with the spiritual in any way that he can and chooses in devotion in contemplation or in philosophic cognition his doing is always thinking and therefore Descartes to whom this had at last become quite clear could lay down the proposition I think that is I am This means my thinking is my being or my life only when I live spiritually do I live only as spirit am I really or I am spirit through and through and nothing but spirit Unlucky Peter Schlemihl who has lost his shadow is the portrait of this man become a spirit for the spirit s body is shadowless Over against this how different among the ancients Stoutly and manfully as they might bear themselves against the might of things they must yet acknowledge the might itself and got no farther than to protect their life against it as well as possible Only at a late hour did they recognize that their true life was not that which they led in the fight against the things of the world but the spiritual life turned away from these things and when they saw this they became Christians i e the moderns and innovators upon the ancients But the life turned away from things the spiritual life no longer draws any nourishment from nature but lives only on thoughts and therefore is no longer life but thinking Yet it must not be supposed now that the ancients were without thoughts just as the most spiritual man is not to be conceived of as if he could be without life Rather they had their thoughts about everything about the world man the gods et cetera and showed themselves keenly active in bringing all this to their consciousness But they did not know thought even though they thought of all sorts of things and worried themselves with their thoughts Compare with their position the Christian saying My thoughts are not your thoughts as the heaven is higher than the earth so are my thoughts higher than your thoughts and remember what was said above about our child thoughts What is antiquity seeking then The true enjoyment of life You will find that at bottom it is all the same as the true life The Greek poet Simonides sings Health is the noblest good for mortal man the next to this is beauty the third riches acquired without guile the fourth the enjoyment of social pleasures in the company of young friends These are all good things of life pleasures of life What else was Diogenes of Sinope seeking for than the true enjoyment of life which he discovered in having the least possible wants What else Aristippus who found it in a cheery temper under all circumstances They are seeking for cheery unclouded life courage for cheeriness they are seeking to be of good cheer The Stoics want to realize the wise man the man with practical philosophy the man who knows how to live a wise life therefore they find him in contempt for the world in a life without development without spreading out without friendly relations with the world i e in the isolated life in life as life not in life with others only the Stoic lives all else is dead for him The Epicureans on the contrary demand a moving life The ancients as they want to be of good cheer desire good living the Jews especially a long life blessed with children and goods eudaemonia well being in the most various forms Democritus e g praises as such the calm of the soul in which one lives smoothly without fear and without excitement So what he thinks is that with this he gets on best provides for himself the best lot and gets through the world best But as he cannot get rid of the world and in fact cannot for the very reason that his whole activity is taken up in the effort to get rid of it that is in repelling the world for which it is yet necessary that what can be and is repelled should remain existing otherwise there would no longer be anything to repel he reaches at most an extreme degree of liberation and is distinguishable only in degree from the less liberated If he even got as far as the deadening of the earthly sense which at last admits only the monotonous whisper of the word Brahm he nevertheless would not be essentially distinguishable from the sensual man Even the Stoic attitude and manly virtue amounts only to this that one must maintain and assert himself against the world and the ethics of the Stoics their only science since they could tell nothing about the spirit but how it should behave toward the world and of nature physics only this that the wise man must assert himself against it is not a doctrine of the spirit but only a doctrine of the repelling of the world and of self assertion against the world And this consists in imperturbability and equanimity of life and so in the most explicit Roman virtue The Romans too Horace Cicero et cetera went no further than this practical philosophy The comfort hedone of the Epicureans is the same practical philosophy the Stoics teach only trickier more deceitful They teach only another behavior toward the world exhort us only to take a shrewd attitude toward the world the world must be deceived for it is my enemy The break with the world is completely carried through by the Skeptics My entire relation to the world is worthless and truthless Timon says The feelings and thoughts which we draw from the world contain no truth What is truth cries Pilate According to Pyrrho s doctrine the world is neither good nor bad neither beautiful nor ugly et cetera but these are predicates which I give it Timon says that in itself nothing is either good or bad but man only thinks of it thus or thus to face the world only ataraxia unmovedness and aphasia speechlessness or in other words isolated inwardness are left There is no longer any truth to be recognized in the world things contradict themselves thoughts about things are without distinction good and bad are all the same so that what one calls good another finds bad here the recognition of truth is at an end and only the man without power of recognition the man who finds in the world nothing to recognize is left and this man just leaves the truth vacant world where it is and takes no account of it So antiquity gets trough with the world of things the order of the world the world as a whole but to the order of the world or the things of this world belong not only nature but all relations in which man sees himself placed by nature e g the family the community in short the so called natural bonds With the world of the spirit Christianity then begins The man who still faces the world armed is the ancient the heathen to which class the Jew too as non Christian belongs the man who has come to be led by nothing but his heart s pleasure the interest he takes his fellow feeling his spirit is the modern the Christian As the ancients worked toward the conquest of the world and strove to release man from the heavy trammels of connection with other things at last they came also to the dissolution of the State and giving preference to everything private Of course community family et cetera as natural relations are burdensome hindrances which diminish my spiritual freedom II THE MODERNS If any man be in Christ he is a new creature the old is passed away behold all is become new eleven As it was said above 
2133-2148-0000	train-other-500	To the ancients the world was a truth we must say here To the moderns the spirit was a truth but here as there we must not omit the supplement
2133-2148-0001	train-other-500	a truth whose untruth they tried to get back of and at last they really do A course similar to that which antiquity took may be demonstrated in Christianity also
2133-2148-0002	train-other-500	in that the understanding was held a prisoner under the dominion of the Christian dogmas up to the time preparatory to the Reformation but in the pre Reformation century asserted itself sophistically
2133-2148-0003	train-other-500	and played heretical pranks with all tenets of the faith And the talk then was especially in Italy and at the Roman court If only the heart remains Christian minded
2133-2148-0004	train-other-500	the understanding may go right on taking its pleasure Long before the Reformation people were so thoroughly accustomed to fine spun wranglings that the pope and most others
2133-2148-0005	train-other-500	looked on Luther s appearance too as a mere wrangling of monks at first Humanism corresponds to Sophisticism and as in the time of the Sophists Greek life stood in its fullest bloom the Periclean age
2133-2148-0006	train-other-500	so the most brilliant things happened in the time of Humanism or as one might perhaps also say of Machiavellianism printing the New World et cetera
none	none	 At this time the heart was still far from wanting to relieve itself of its Christian contents 
2133-2148-0007	train-other-500	But finally the Reformation like Socrates took hold seriously of the heart itself and since then hearts have kept growing visibly more unchristian
2133-2148-0008	train-other-500	As with Luther people began to take the matter to heart the outcome of this step of the Reformation must be that the heart also gets lightened of the heavy burden of Christian faith The heart
2133-2148-0009	train-other-500	from day to day more unchristian loses the contents with which it had busied itself till at last nothing but empty warm heartedness is left it the quite general love of men the love of Man
none	none	 the consciousness of freedom 
2133-2148-0010	train-other-500	self consciousness Only so is Christianity complete because it has become bald withered and void of contents
none	none	 There are now no contents whatever against which the heart does not mutiny 
2133-2148-0011	train-other-500	unless indeed the heart unconsciously or without self consciousness lets them slip in The heart criticises to death with hard hearted mercilessness everything that wants to make its way in
2133-2148-0012	train-other-500	and is capable except as before unconsciously or taken by surprise of no friendship no love What could there be in men to love
2133-2148-0013	train-other-500	since they are all alike egoists
none	none	 none of them man as such i e none spirit only 
2133-2148-0014	train-other-500	The Christian loves only the spirit
none	none	 but where could one be found who should be really nothing but spirit 
2133-2148-0015	train-other-500	To have a liking for the corporeal man with hide and hair why that would no longer be a spiritual warm heartedness it would be treason against pure warm heartedness the theoretical regard
none	none	 For pure warm heartedness is by no means to be conceived as like that kindliness that gives everybody a friendly hand shake 
2133-2148-0016	train-other-500	on the contrary pure warm heartedness is warm hearted toward nobody it is only a theoretical interest concern for man as man not as a person
2133-2148-0017	train-other-500	The person is repulsive to it because of being egoistic because of not being that abstraction Man But it is only for the abstraction that one can have a theoretical regard
2133-2148-0018	train-other-500	To pure warm heartedness or pure theory men exist only to be criticised scoffed at and thoroughly despised to it no less than to the fanatical parson
2133-2148-0019	train-other-500	they are only filth and other such nice things Pushed to this extremity of disinterested warm heartedness we must finally become conscious that the spirit which alone the Christian loves
2133-2148-0020	train-other-500	is nothing in other words that the spirit is a lie What has here been set down roughly summarily and doubtless as yet incomprehensibly
2133-2148-0021	train-other-500	will it is to be hoped become clear as we go on Let us take up the inheritance left by the ancients and as active workmen do with it as much as can be done with it
2133-2148-0022	train-other-500	The world lies despised at our feet far beneath us and our heaven into which its mighty arms are no longer thrust and its stupefying breath does not come Seductively as it may pose
2133-2148-0023	train-other-500	it can delude nothing but our sense it cannot lead astray the spirit and spirit alone after all we really are Having once got back of things
2133-2148-0024	train-other-500	the spirit has also got above them and become free from their bonds emancipated supernal free So speaks spiritual freedom
2133-2148-0025	train-other-500	To the spirit which after long toil has got rid of the world the worldless spirit nothing is left after the loss of the world and the worldly but the spirit
2133-2148-0026	train-other-500	and the spiritual Yet as it has only moved away from the world and made of itself a being free from the world
none	none	 without being able really to annihilate the world 
2133-2148-0027	train-other-500	this remains to it a stumbling block that cannot be cleared away a discredited existence and as on the other hand it knows and recognizes nothing but the spirit and the spiritual
none	none	 it must perpetually carry about with it the longing to spiritualize the world i e to redeem it from the black list 
2133-2148-0028	train-other-500	Therefore like a youth it goes about with plans for the redemption or improvement of the world
none	none	 The ancients we saw served the natural the worldly the natural order of the world but they incessantly asked themselves whether they could not then relieve themselves of this service and when they had tired themselves to death in ever renewed attempts at revolt then 
2133-2148-0029	train-other-500	among their last sighs was born to them the God the conqueror of the world All their doing had been nothing but wisdom of the world
2133-2148-0030	train-other-500	an effort to get back of the world and above it And what is the wisdom of the many following centuries What did the moderns try to get back of No longer to get back of the world
2133-2148-0031	train-other-500	for the ancients had accomplished that but back of the God whom the ancients bequeathed to them back of the God who is spirit back of everything that is the spirit s the spiritual
2133-2148-0032	train-other-500	But the activity of the spirit which searches even the depths of the Godhead is theology If the ancients have nothing to show but wisdom of the world
2133-2148-0033	train-other-500	the moderns never did nor do make their way further
none	none	 than to theology We shall see later that even the newest revolts against God are nothing but the extremest efforts of theology i e theological insurrections Sec one THE SPIRIT The realm of spirits is monstrously great there is an infinite deal of the spiritual yet let us look and see what the spirit this bequest of the ancients properly is Out of their birth pangs it came forth but they themselves could not utter themselves as spirit they could give birth to it it itself must speak The born God the Son of Man is the first to utter the word that the spirit i e he God has to do with nothing earthly and no earthly relationship but solely with the spirit and spiritual relationships Is my courage indestructible under all the world s blows my inflexibility and my obduracy perchance already spirit in the full sense because the world cannot touch it Why then it would not yet be at enmity with the world and all its action would consist merely in not succumbing to the world No so long as it does not busy itself with itself alone so long as it does not have to do with its world the spiritual alone it is not free spirit but only the spirit of this world the spirit fettered to it The spirit is free spirit i e really spirit only in a world of its own in this the world it is a stranger Only through a spiritual world is the spirit really spirit for this world does not understand it and does not know how to keep the maiden from a foreign land twelve from departing But where is it to get this spiritual world Where but out of itself It must reveal itself and the words that it speaks the revelations in which it unveils itself these are its world As a visionary lives and has his world only in the visionary pictures that he himself creates as a crazy man generates for himself his own dream world without which he could not be crazy so the spirit must create for itself its spirit world and is not spirit till it creates it Thus its creations make it spirit and by its creatures we know it the creator in them it lives they are its world Now what is the spirit It is the creator of a spiritual world Even in you and me people do not recognize spirit till they see that we have appropriated to ourselves something spiritual i e though thoughts may have been set before us we have at least brought them to life in ourselves for as long as we were children the most edifying thoughts might have been laid before us without our wishing or being able to reproduce them in ourselves So the spirit also exists only when it creates something spiritual it is real only together with the spiritual its creature As then we know it by its works the question is what these works are But the works or children of the spirit are nothing else but spirits If I had before me Jews Jews of the true metal I should have to stop here and leave them standing before this mystery as for almost two thousand years they have remained standing before it unbelieving and without knowledge But as you my dear reader are at least not a full blooded Jew for such a one will not go astray as far as this we will still go along a bit of road together till perhaps you too turn your back on me because I laugh in your face If somebody told you you were altogether spirit you would take hold of your body and not believe him but answer I have a spirit no doubt but do not exist only as spirit but am a man with a body You would still distinguish yourself from your spirit But replies he it is your destiny even though now you are yet going about in the fetters of the body to be one day a blessed spirit and however you may conceive of the future aspect of your spirit so much is yet certain that in death you will put off this body and yet keep yourself i e your spirit for all eternity accordingly your spirit is the eternal and true in you the body only a dwelling here below which you may leave and perhaps exchange for another Now you believe him For the present indeed you are not spirit only but when you emigrate from the mortal body as one day you must then you will have to help yourself without the body and therefore it is needful that you be prudent and care in time for your proper self What should it profit a man if he gained the whole world and yet suffered damage in his soul But even granted that doubts raised in the course of time against the tenets of the Christian faith have long since robbed you of faith in the immortality of your spirit you have nevertheless left one tenet undisturbed and still ingenuously adhere to the one truth that the spirit is your better part and that the spiritual has greater claims on you than anything else Despite all your atheism in zeal against egoism you concur with the believers in immortality But whom do you think of under the name of egoist A man who instead of living to an idea i e a spiritual thing and sacrificing to it his personal advantage serves the latter A good patriot e g brings his sacrifice to the altar of the fatherland but it cannot be disputed that the fatherland is an idea since for beasts incapable of mind thirteen or children as yet without mind there is no fatherland and no patriotism Now if any one does not approve himself as a good patriot he betrays his egoism with reference to the fatherland And so the matter stands in innumerable other cases he who in human society takes the benefit of a prerogative sins egoistically against the idea of equality he who exercises dominion is blamed as an egoist against the idea of liberty et cetera You despise the egoist because he puts the spiritual in the background as compared with the personal and has his eyes on himself where you would like to see him act to favor an idea The distinction between you is that he makes himself the central point but you the spirit or that you cut your identity in two and exalt your proper self the spirit to be ruler of the paltrier remainder while he will hear nothing of this cutting in two and pursues spiritual and material interests just as he pleases You think to be sure that you are falling foul of those only who enter into no spiritual interest at all but in fact you curse at everybody who does not look on the spiritual interest as his true and highest interest You carry your knightly service for this beauty so far that you affirm her to be the only beauty of the world You live not to yourself but to your spirit and to what is the spirit s i e ideas As the spirit exists only in its creating of the spiritual let us take a look about us for its first creation If only it has accomplished this there follows thenceforth a natural propagation of creations as according to the myth only the first human beings needed to be created the rest of the race propagating of itself The first creation on the other hand must come forth out of nothing i e the spirit has toward its realization nothing but itself or rather it has not yet even itself but must create itself hence its first creation is itself the spirit Mystical as this sounds we yet go through it as an every day experience Are you a thinking being before you think In creating the first thought you create yourself the thinking one for you do not think before you think a thought i e have a thought Is it not your singing that first makes you a singer your talking that makes you a talker Now so too it is the production of the spiritual that first makes you a spirit Meantime as you distinguish yourself from the thinker singer and talker so you no less distinguish yourself from the spirit and feel very clearly that you are something beside spirit But as in the thinking ego hearing and sight easily vanish in the enthusiasm of thought so you also have been seized by the spirit enthusiasm and you now long with all your might to become wholly spirit and to be dissolved in spirit The spirit is your ideal the unattained the otherworldly spirit is the name of your god God is spirit Against all that is not spirit you are a zealot and therefore you play the zealot against yourself who cannot get rid of a remainder of the non spiritual Instead of saying I am more than spirit you say with contrition I am less than spirit and spirit pure spirit or the spirit that is nothing but spirit I can only think of but am not and since I am not it it is another exists as another whom I call God It lies in the nature of the case that the spirit that is to exist as pure spirit must be an otherworldly one for since I am not it it follows that it can only be outside me since in any case a human being is not fully comprehended in the concept spirit it follows that the pure spirit the spirit as such can only be outside of men beyond the human world not earthly but heavenly Only from this disunion in which I and the spirit lie only because I and spirit are not names for one and the same thing but different names for completely different things only because I am not spirit and spirit not I only from this do we get a quite tautological explanation of the necessity that the spirit dwells in the other world i e is God But from this it also appears how thoroughly theological is the liberation that Feuerbach fourteen is laboring to give us What he says is that we had only mistaken our own essence and therefore looked for it in the other world but that now when we see that God was only our human essence we must recognize it again as ours and move it back out of the other world into this To God who is spirit Feuerbach gives the name Our Essence Can we put up with this that Our Essence is brought into opposition to us that we are split into an essential and an unessential self Do we not therewith go back into the dreary misery of seeing ourselves banished out of ourselves What have we gained then when for a variation we have transferred into ourselves the divine outside us Are we that which is in us As little as we are that which is outside us I am as little my heart as I am my sweetheart this other self of mine Just because we are not the spirit that dwells in us just for that reason we had to take it and set it outside us it was not we did not coincide with us and therefore we could not think of it as existing otherwise than outside us on the other side from us in the other world With the strength of despair Feuerbach clutches at the total substance of Christianity not to throw it away no to drag it to himself to draw it the long yearned for ever distant out of its heaven with a last effort and keep it by him forever Is not that a clutch of the uttermost despair a clutch for life or death and is it not at the same time the Christian yearning and hungering for the other world The hero wants not to go into the other world but to draw the other world to him and compel it to become this world And since then has not all the world with more or less consciousness been crying that this world is the vital point and heaven must come down on earth and be experienced even here Let us in brief set Feuerbach s theological view and our contradiction over against each other The essence of man is man s supreme being fifteen now by religion to be sure the supreme being is called God and regarded as an objective essence but in truth it is only man s own essence and therefore the turning point of the world s history is that henceforth no longer God but man is to appear to man as God sixteen To this we reply The supreme being is indeed the essence of man but just because it is his essence and not he himself it remains quite immaterial whether we see it outside him and view it as God or find it in him and call it Essence of Man or Man I am neither God nor Man seventeen neither the supreme essence nor my essence and therefore it is all one in the main whether I think of the essence as in me or outside me Nay we really do always think of the supreme being as in both kinds of otherworldliness the inward and outward at once for the Spirit of God is according to the Christian view also our spirit and dwells in us eighteen It dwells in heaven and dwells in us we poor things are just its dwelling and if Feuerbach goes on to destroy its heavenly dwelling and force it to move to us bag and baggage then we its earthly apartments will be badly overcrowded But after this digression which if we were at all proposing to work by line and level we should have had to save for later pages in order to avoid repetition we return to the spirit s first creation the spirit itself The spirit is something other than myself But this other what is it Sec two THE POSSESSED Have you ever seen a spirit No not I but my grandmother Now you see it s just so with me too I myself haven t seen any but my grandmother had them running between her feet all sorts of ways and out of confidence in our grandmothers honesty we believe in the existence of spirits But had we no grandfathers then and did they not shrug their shoulders every time our grandmothers told about their ghosts Yes those were unbelieving men who have harmed our good religion much those rationalists We shall feel that What else lies at the bottom of this warm faith in ghosts if not the faith in the existence of spiritual beings in general and is not this latter itself disastrously unsettled if saucy men of the understanding may disturb the former The Romanticists were quite conscious what a blow the very belief in God suffered by the laying aside of the belief in spirits or ghosts and they tried to help us out of the baleful consequences not only by their reawakened fairy world but at last and especially by the intrusion of a higher world by their somnambulists prophetesses of Prevorst et cetera The good believers and fathers of the church did not suspect that with the belief in ghosts the foundation of religion was withdrawn and that since then it had been floating in the air He who no longer believes in any ghost needs only to travel on consistently in his unbelief to see that there is no separate being at all concealed behind things no ghost or what is naively reckoned as synonymous even in our use of words no spirit Spirits exist Look about in the world and say for yourself whether a spirit does not gaze upon you out of everything Out of the lovely little flower there speaks to you the spirit of the Creator who has shaped it so wonderfully the stars proclaim the spirit that established their order from the mountain tops a spirit of sublimity breathes down out of the waters a spirit of yearning murmurs up and out of men millions of spirits speak The mountains may sink the flowers fade the world of stars fall in ruins the men die what matters the wreck of these visible bodies The spirit the invisible spirit abides eternally Yes the whole world is haunted Only is haunted Nay it itself walks it is uncanny through and through it is the wandering seeming body of a spirit it is a spook What else should a ghost be then than an apparent body but real spirit Well the world is empty is naught is only glamorous semblance its truth is the spirit alone it is the seeming body of a spirit Look out near or far a ghostly world surrounds you everywhere you are always having apparitions or visions Everything that appears to you is only the phantasm of an indwelling spirit is a ghostly apparition the world is to you only a world of appearances behind which the spirit walks You see spirits Are you perchance thinking of comparing yourself with the ancients who saw gods everywhere Gods my dear modern are not spirits gods do not degrade the world to a semblance and do not spiritualize it But to you the whole world is spiritualized and has become an enigmatical ghost therefore do not wonder if you likewise find in yourself nothing but a spook Is not your body haunted by your spirit and is not the latter alone the true and real the former only the transitory naught or a semblance Are we not all ghosts uncanny beings that wait for deliverance to wit spirits Since the spirit appeared in the world since the Word became flesh since then the world has been spiritualized enchanted a spook You have spirit for you have thoughts What are your thoughts Spiritual entities Not things then No but the spirit of things the main point in all things the inmost in them their idea Consequently what you think is not only your thought On the contrary it is that in the world which is most real that which is properly to be called true it is the truth itself if I only think truly I think the truth I may to be sure err with regard to the truth and fail to recognize it but if I recognize truly the object of my cognition is the truth So I suppose you strive at all times to recognize the truth To me the truth is sacred It may well happen that I find a truth incomplete and replace it with a better but the truth I cannot abrogate I believe in the truth therefore I search in it nothing transcends it it is eternal Sacred eternal is the truth it is the Sacred the Eternal But you who let yourself be filled and led by this sacred thing are yourself hallowed Further the sacred is not for your senses and you never as a sensual man discover its trace but for your faith or more definitely still for your spirit for it itself you know is a spiritual thing a spirit is spirit for the spirit The sacred is by no means so easily to be set aside as many at present affirm who no longer take this unsuitable word into their mouths If even in a single respect I am still upbraided as an egoist there is left the thought of something else which I should serve more than myself and which must be to me more important than everything in short somewhat in which I should have to seek my true welfare nineteen something sacred twenty However human this sacred thing may look though it be the Human itself that does not take away its sacredness but at most changes it from an unearthly to an earthly sacred thing from a divine one to a human Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself the involuntary egoist for him who is always looking after his own and yet does not count himself as the highest being who serves only himself and at the same time always thinks he is serving a higher being who knows nothing higher than himself and yet is infatuated about something higher in short for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist and abases himself i e combats his egoism but at the same time abases himself only for the sake of being exalted and therefore of gratifying his egoism Because he would like to cease to be an egoist he looks about in heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to but however much he shakes and disciplines himself in the end he does all for his own sake and the disreputable egoism will not come off him On this account I call him the involuntary egoist His toil and care to get away from himself is nothing but the misunderstood impulse to self dissolution If you are bound to your past hour if you must babble to day because you babbled yesterday twenty one if you can not transform yourself each instant you feel yourself fettered in slavery and benumbed Therefore over each minute of your existence a fresh minute of the future beckons to you and developing yourself you get away from yourself i e from the self that was at that moment As you are at each instant you are your own creature and in this very creature you do not wish to lose yourself the creator You are yourself a higher being than you are and surpass yourself But that you are the one who is higher than you i e that you are not only creature but likewise your creator just this as an involuntary egoist you fail to recognize and therefore the higher essence is to you an alien twenty two essence Every higher essence such as truth mankind et cetera is an essence over us Alienness is a criterion of the sacred In everything sacred there lies something uncanny i e strange twenty three such as we are not quite familiar and at home in What is sacred to me is not my own and if e g the property of others was not sacred to me I should look on it as mine which I should take to myself when occasion offered Or on the other side if I regard the face of the Chinese emperor as sacred it remains strange to my eye which I close at its appearance Why is an incontrovertible mathematical truth which might even be called eternal according to the common understanding of words not sacred Because it is not revealed or not the revelation of a higher being If by revealed we understand only the so called religious truths we go far astray and entirely fail to recognize the breadth of the concept higher being Atheists keep up their scoffing at the higher being which was also honored under the name of the highest or etre supreme and trample in the dust one proof of his existence after another without noticing that they themselves out of need for a higher being only annihilate the old to make room for a new Is Man perchance not a higher essence than an individual man and must not the truths rights and ideas which result from the concept of him be honored and counted sacred as revelations of this very concept For even though we should abrogate again many a truth that seemed to be made manifest by this concept yet this would only evince a misunderstanding on our part without in the least degree harming the sacred concept itself or taking their sacredness from those truths that must rightly be looked upon as its revelations Man reaches beyond every individual man and yet though he be his essence is not in fact his essence which rather would be as single twenty four as he the individual himself but a general and higher yes for atheists the highest essence twenty five And as the divine revelations were not written down by God with his own hand but made public through the Lord s instruments so also the new highest essence does not write out its revelations itself but lets them come to our knowledge through true men Only the new essence betrays in fact a more spiritual style of conception than the old God because the latter was still represented in a sort of embodiedness or form while the undimmed spirituality of the new is retained and no special material body is fancied for it And withal it does not lack corporeity which even takes on a yet more seductive appearance because it looks more natural and mundane and consists in nothing less than in every bodily man yes or outright in humanity or all men Thereby the spectralness of the spirit in a seeming body has once again become really solid and popular Sacred then is the highest essence and everything in which this highest essence reveals or will reveal itself but hallowed are they who recognize this highest essence together with its own i e together with its revelations The sacred hallows in turn its reverer who by his worship becomes himself a saint as likewise what he does is saintly a saintly walk saintly thoughts and actions imaginations and aspirations et cetera It is easily understood that the conflict over what is revered as the highest essence can be significant only so long as even the most embittered opponents concede to each other the main point that there is a highest essence to which worship or service is due If one should smile compassionately at the whole struggle over a highest essence as a Christian might at the war of words between a Shiite and a Sunnite or between a Brahman and a Buddhist then the hypothesis of a highest essence would be null in his eyes and the conflict on this basis an idle play Whether then the one God or the three in one whether the Lutheran God or the etre supreme or not God at all but Man may represent the highest essence that makes no difference at all for him who denies the highest essence itself for in his eyes those servants of a highest essence are one and all pious people the most raging atheist not less than the most faith filled Christian In the foremost place of the sacred twenty six then stands the highest essence and the faith in this essence our holy twenty seven faith THE SPOOK With ghosts we arrive in the spirit realm in the realm of essences What haunts the universe and has its occult incomprehensible being there is precisely the mysterious spook that we call highest essence And to get to the bottom of this spook to comprehend it to discover reality in it to prove the existence of God this task men set to themselves for thousands of years with the horrible impossibility the endless Danaid labor of transforming the spook into a non spook the unreal into something real the spirit into an entire and corporeal person with this they tormented themselves to death Behind the existing world they sought the thing in itself the essence behind the thing they sought the un thing When one looks to the bottom of anything i e searches out its essence one often discovers something quite other than what it seems to be honeyed speech and a lying heart pompous words and beggarly thoughts et cetera By bringing the essence into prominence one degrades the hitherto misapprehended appearance to a bare semblance a deception The essence of the world so attractive and splendid is for him who looks to the bottom of it emptiness emptiness is world s essence world s doings Now he who is religious does not occupy himself with the deceitful semblance with the empty appearances but looks upon the essence and in the essence has the truth The essences which are deduced from some appearances are the evil essences and conversely from others the good The essence of human feeling e g is love the essence of human will is the good that of one s thinking the true et cetera What at first passed for existence such as the world and its like appears now as bare semblance and the truly existent is much rather the essence whose realm is filled with gods spirits demons i e with good or bad essences Only this inverted world the world of essences truly exists now The human heart may be loveless but its essence exists God who is love human thought may wander in error but its essence truth exists God is truth et cetera To know and acknowledge essences alone and nothing but essences that is religion its realm is a realm of essences spooks and ghosts The longing to make the spook comprehensible or to realize non sense has brought about a corporeal ghost a ghost or spirit with a real body an embodied ghost How the strongest and most talented Christians have tortured themselves to get a conception of this ghostly apparition But there always remained the contradiction of two natures the divine and human i e the ghostly and sensual there remained the most wondrous spook a thing that was not a thing Never yet was a ghost more soul torturing and no shaman who pricks himself to raving fury and nerve lacerating cramps to conjure a ghost can endure such soul torment as Christians suffered from that most incomprehensible ghost But through Christ the truth of the matter had at the same time come to light that the veritable spirit or ghost is man The corporeal or embodied spirit is just man he himself is the ghastly being and at the same time the being s appearance and existence Henceforth man no longer in typical cases shudders at ghosts outside him but at himself he is terrified at himself In the depth of his breast dwells the spirit of sin even the faintest thought and this is itself a spirit you know may be a devil et cetera The ghost has put on a body God has become man but now man is himself the gruesome spook which he seeks to get back of to exorcise to fathom to bring to reality and to speech man is spirit What matter if the body wither if only the spirit is saved everything rests on the spirit and the spirit s or soul s welfare becomes the exclusive goal Man has become to himself a ghost an uncanny spook to which there is even assigned a distinct seat in the body dispute over the seat of the soul whether in the head et cetera You are not to me and I am not to you a higher essence Nevertheless a higher essence may be hidden in each of us and call forth a mutual reverence To take at once the most general Man lives in you and me If I did not see Man in you what occasion should I have to respect you To be sure you are not Man and his true and adequate form but only a mortal veil of his from which he can withdraw without himself ceasing but yet for the present this general and higher essence is housed in you and you present before me because an imperishable spirit has in you assumed a perishable body so that really your form is only an assumed one a spirit that appears appears in you without being bound to your body and to this particular mode of appearance therefore a spook Hence I do not regard you as a higher essence but only respect that higher essence which walks in you I respect Man in you The ancients did not observe anything of this sort in their slaves and the higher essence Man found as yet little response To make up for this they saw in each other ghosts of another sort The People is a higher essence than an individual and like Man or the Spirit of Man a spirit haunting the individual the Spirit of the People For this reason they revered this spirit and only so far as he served this or else a spirit related to it e g the Spirit of the Family et cetera could the individual appear significant only for the sake of the higher essence the People was consideration allowed to the member of the people As you are hallowed to us by Man who haunts you so at every time men have been hallowed by some higher essence or other like People Family and such Only for the sake of a higher essence has any one been honored from of old only as a ghost has he been regarded in the light of a hallowed i e protected and recognized person If I cherish you because I hold you dear because in you my heart finds nourishment my need satisfaction then it is not done for the sake of a higher essence whose hallowed body you are not on account of my beholding in you a ghost i e an appearing spirit but from egoistic pleasure you yourself with your essence are valuable to me for your essence is not a higher one is not higher and more general than you is unique twenty eight like you yourself because it is you But it is not only man that haunts so does everything The higher essence the spirit that walks in everything is at the same time bound to nothing and only appears in it Ghosts in every corner Here would be the place to pass the haunting spirits in review if they were not to come before us again further on in order to vanish before egoism Hence let only a few of them be particularized by way of example in order to bring us at once to our attitude toward them Sacred above all e g is the holy Spirit sacred the truth sacred are right law a good cause majesty marriage the common good order the fatherland et cetera WHEELS IN THE HEAD Man your head is haunted you have wheels in your head You imagine great things and depict to yourself a whole world of gods that has an existence for you a spirit realm to which you suppose yourself to be called an ideal that beckons to you You have a fixed idea Do not think that I am jesting or speaking figuratively when I regard those persons who cling to the Higher and because the vast majority belongs under this head almost the whole world of men as veritable fools fools in a madhouse What is it then that is called a fixed idea An idea that has subjected the man to itself When you recognize with regard to such a fixed idea that it is a folly you shut its slave up in an asylum And is the truth of the faith say which we are not to doubt the majesty of e g the people which we are not to strike at he who does is guilty of lese majesty virtue against which the censor is not to let a word pass that morality may be kept pure et cetera are these not fixed ideas Is not all the stupid chatter of e g most of our newspapers the babble of fools who suffer from the fixed idea of morality legality Christianity et cetera and only seem to go about free because the madhouse in which they walk takes in so broad a space Touch the fixed idea of such a fool and you will at once have to guard your back against the lunatic s stealthy malice For these great lunatics are like the little so called lunatics in this point too that they assail by stealth him who touches their fixed idea They first steal his weapon steal free speech from him and then they fall upon him with their nails Every day now lays bare the cowardice and vindictiveness of these maniacs and the stupid populace hurrahs for their crazy measures One must read the journals of this period and must hear the Philistines talk to get the horrible conviction that one is shut up in a house with fools Thou shalt not call thy brother a fool if thou dost et cetera But I do not fear the curse and I say my brothers are arch fools Whether a poor fool of the insane asylum is possessed by the fancy that he is God the Father Emperor of Japan the Holy Spirit et cetera or whether a citizen in comfortable circumstances conceives that it is his mission to be a good Christian a faithful Protestant a loyal citizen a virtuous man et cetera both these are one and the same fixed idea He who has never tried and dared not to be a good Christian a faithful Protestant a virtuous man et cetera is possessed and prepossessed twenty nine by faith virtuousness et cetera Just as the schoolmen philosophized only inside the belief of the church as Pope Benedict XIV wrote fat books inside the papist superstition without ever throwing a doubt upon this belief as authors fill whole folios on the State without calling in question the fixed idea of the State itself as our newspapers are crammed with politics because they are conjured into the fancy that man was created to be a zoon politicon so also subjects vegetate in subjection virtuous people in virtue liberals in humanity et cetera without ever putting to these fixed ideas of theirs the searching knife of criticism Undislodgeable like a madman s delusion those thoughts stand on a firm footing and he who doubts them lays hands on the sacred Yes the fixed idea that is the truly sacred Is it perchance only people possessed by the devil that meet us or do we as often come upon people possessed in the contrary way possessed by the good by virtue morality the law or some principle or other Possessions of the devil are not the only ones God works on us and the devil does the former workings of grace the latter workings of the devil Possessed thirty people are set thirty one in their opinions If the word possession displeases you then call it prepossession yes since the spirit possesses you and all inspirations come from it call it inspiration and enthusiasm I add that complete enthusiasm for we cannot stop with the sluggish half way kind is called fanaticism It is precisely among cultured people that fanaticism is at home for man is cultured so far as he takes an interest in spiritual things and interest in spiritual things when it is alive is and must be fanaticism it is a fanatical interest in the sacred fanum Observe our liberals look into the Saechsischen Vaterlandsblaetter hear what Schlosser says thirty two Holbach s company constituted a regular plot against the traditional doctrine and the existing system and its members were as fanatical on behalf of their unbelief as monks and priests Jesuits and Pietists Methodists missionary and Bible societies commonly are for mechanical worship and orthodoxy Take notice how a moral man behaves who to day often thinks he is through with God and throws off Christianity as a bygone thing If you ask him whether he has ever doubted that the copulation of brother and sister is incest that monogamy is the truth of marriage that filial piety is a sacred duty et cetera then a moral shudder will come over him at the conception of one s being allowed to touch his sister as wife also et cetera And whence this shudder Because he believes in those moral commandments This moral faith is deeply rooted in his breast Much as he rages against the pious Christians he himself has nevertheless as thoroughly remained a Christian to wit a moral Christian In the form of morality Christianity holds him a prisoner and a prisoner under faith Monogamy is to be something sacred and he who may live in bigamy is punished as a criminal he who commits incest suffers as a criminal Those who are always crying that religion is not to be regarded in the State and the Jew is to be a citizen equally with the Christian show themselves in accord with this Is not this of incest and monogamy a dogma of faith Touch it and you will learn by experience how this moral man is a hero of faith too not less than Krummacher not less than Philip II These fight for the faith of the Church he for the faith of the State or the moral laws of the State for articles of faith both condemn him who acts otherwise than their faith will allow The brand of crime is stamped upon him and he may languish in reformatories in jails Moral faith is as fanatical as religious faith They call that liberty of faith then when brother and sister on account of a relation that they should have settled with their conscience are thrown into prison But they set a pernicious example Yes indeed others might have taken the notion that the State had no business to meddle with their relation and thereupon purity of morals would go to ruin So then the religious heroes of faith are zealous for the sacred God the moral ones for the sacred good Those who are zealous for something sacred often look very little like each other How the strictly orthodox or old style believers differ from the fighters for truth light and justice from the Philalethes the Friends of Light the Rationalists et cetera And yet how utterly unessential is this difference If one buffets single traditional truths e g miracles unlimited power of princes et cetera then the rationalists buffet them too and only the old style believers wail But if one buffets truth itself he immediately has both as believers for opponents So with moralities the strict believers are relentless the clearer heads are more tolerant But he who attacks morality itself gets both to deal with Truth morality justice light et cetera are to be and remain sacred What any one finds to censure in Christianity is simply supposed to be unchristian according to the view of these rationalists but Christianity must remain a fixture to buffet it is outrageous an outrage To be sure the heretic against pure faith no longer exposes himself to the earlier fury of persecution but so much the more does it now fall upon the heretic against pure morals Piety has for a century received so many blows and had to hear its superhuman essence reviled as an inhuman one so often that one cannot feel tempted to draw the sword against it again And yet it has almost always been only moral opponents that have appeared in the arena to assail the supreme essence in favor of another supreme essence So Proudhon unabashed says thirty three Man is destined to live without religion but the moral law is eternal and absolute Who would dare to day to attack morality Moral people skimmed off the best fat from religion ate it themselves and are now having a tough job to get rid of the resulting scrofula If therefore we point out that religion has not by any means been hurt in its inmost part so long as people reproach it only with its superhuman essence and that it takes its final appeal to the spirit alone for God is spirit then we have sufficiently indicated its final accord with morality and can leave its stubborn conflict with the latter lying behind us It is a question of a supreme essence with both and whether this is a superhuman or a human one can make since it is in any case an essence over me a super mine one so to speak but little difference to me In the end the relation to the human essence or to Man as soon as ever it has shed the snake skin of the old religion will yet wear a religious snake skin again So Feuerbach instructs us that if one only inverts speculative philosophy i e always makes the predicate the subject and so makes the subject the object and principle one has the undraped truth pure and clean thirty four Herewith to be sure we lose the narrow religious standpoint lose the God who from this standpoint is subject but we take in exchange for it the other side of the religious standpoint the moral standpoint E g we no longer say God is love but Love is divine If we further put in place of the predicate divine the equivalent sacred then as far as concerns the sense all the old comes back again According to this love is to be the good in man his divineness that which does him honor his true humanity it makes him Man for the first time makes for the first time a man out of him So then it would be more accurately worded thus Love is what is human in man and what is inhuman is the loveless egoist But precisely all that which Christianity and with it speculative philosophy i e theology offers as the good the absolute is to self ownership simply not the good or what means the same it is only the good Consequently by the transformation of the predicate into the subject the Christian essence and it is the predicate that contains the essence you know would only be fixed yet more oppressively God and the divine would entwine themselves all the more inextricably with me To expel God from his heaven and to rob him of his transcendence cannot yet support a claim of complete victory if therein he is only chased into the human breast and gifted with indelible immanence Now they say The divine is the truly human The same people who oppose Christianity as the basis of the State i e oppose the so called Christian State do not tire of repeating that morality is the fundamental pillar of social life and of the State As if the dominion of morality were not a complete dominion of the sacred a hierarchy So we may here mention by the way that rationalist movement which after theologians had long insisted that only faith was capable of grasping religious truths that only to believers did God reveal himself et cetera and that therefore only the heart the feelings the believing fancy was religious broke out with the assertion that the natural understanding human reason was also capable of discerning God What does that mean but that the reason laid claim to be the same visionary as the fancy thirty five In this sense Reimarus wrote his Most Notable Truths of Natural Religion It had to come to this that the whole man with all his faculties was found to be religious heart and affections understanding and reason feeling knowledge and will in short everything in man appeared religious Hegel has shown that even philosophy is religious And what is not called religion to day The religion of love the religion of freedom political religion in short every enthusiasm So it is too in fact To this day we use the Romance word religion which expresses the concept of a condition of being bound To be sure we remain bound so far as religion takes possession of our inward parts but is the mind also bound On the contrary that is free is sole lord is not our mind but absolute Therefore the correct affirmative translation of the word religion would be freedom of mind In whomsoever the mind is free he is religious in just the same way as he in whom the senses have free course is called a sensual man The mind binds the former the desires the latter Religion therefore is boundness or religio with reference to me I am bound it is freedom with reference to the mind the mind is free or has freedom of mind Many know from experience how hard it is on us when the desires run away with us free and unbridled but that the free mind splendid intellectuality enthusiasm for intellectual interests or however this jewel may in the most various phrase be named brings us into yet more grievous straits than even the wildest impropriety people will not perceive nor can they perceive it without being consciously egoists Reimarus and all who have shown that our reason our heart et cetera also lead to God have therewithal shown that we are possessed through and through To be sure they vexed the theologians from whom they took away the prerogative of religious exaltation but for religion for freedom of mind they thereby only conquered yet more ground For when the mind is no longer limited to feeling or faith but also as understanding reason and thought in general belongs to itself the mind when therefore it may take part in the spiritual thirty six and heavenly truths in the form of understanding et cetera as well as in its other forms then the whole mind is occupied only with spiritual things i e with itself and is therefore free Now we are so through and through religious that jurors i e sworn men condemn us to death and every policeman as a good Christian takes us to the lock up by virtue of an oath of office Morality could not come into opposition with piety till after the time when in general the boisterous hate of everything that looked like an order decrees commandments et cetera spoke out in revolt and the personal absolute lord was scoffed at and persecuted consequently it could arrive at independence only through liberalism whose first form acquired significance in the world s history as citizenship and weakened the specifically religious powers see Liberalism below For when morality not merely goes alongside of piety but stands on feet of its own then its principle lies no longer in the divine commandments but in the law of reason from which the commandments so far as they are still to remain valid must first await justification for their validity In the law of reason man determines himself out of himself for Man is rational and out of the essence of Man those laws follow of necessity Piety and morality part company in this that the former makes God the lawgiver the latter Man From a certain standpoint of morality people reason about as follows Either man is led by his sensuality and is following it immoral or he is led by the good which taken up into the will is called moral sentiment sentiment and prepossession in favor of the good then he shows himself moral From this point of view how e g can Sand s act against Kotzebue be called immoral What is commonly understood by unselfish it certainly was in the same measure as among other things saint Crispin s thieveries in favor of the poor He should not have murdered for it stands written Thou shalt not murder Then to serve the good the welfare of the people as Sand at least intended or the welfare of the poor like Crispin is moral but murder and theft are immoral the purpose moral the means immoral Why Because murder assassination is something absolutely bad When the Guerrillas enticed the enemies of the country into ravines and shot them down unseen from the bushes do you suppose that was not assassination According to the principle of morality which commands us to serve the good you could really ask only whether murder could never in any case be a realization of the good and would have to endorse that murder which realized the good You cannot condemn Sand s deed at all it was moral because in the service of the good because unselfish it was an act of punishment which the individual inflicted an execution inflicted at the risk of the executioner s life What else had his scheme been after all but that he wanted to suppress writings by brute force Are you not acquainted with the same procedure as a legal and sanctioned one And what can be objected against it from your principle of morality But it was an illegal execution So the immoral thing in it was the illegality the disobedience to law Then you admit that the good is nothing else than law morality nothing else than loyalty And to this externality of loyalty your morality must sink to this righteousness of works in the fulfilment of the law only that the latter is at once more tyrannical and more revolting than the old time righteousness of works For in the latter only the act is needed but you require the disposition too one must carry in himself the law the statute and he who is most legally disposed is the most moral Even the last vestige of cheerfulness in Catholic life must perish in this Protestant legality Here at last the domination of the law is for the first time complete Not I live but the law lives in me Thus I have really come so far as to be only the vessel of its glory Every Prussian carries his gendarme in his breast says a high Prussian officer Why do certain opposition parties fail to flourish Solely for the reason that they refuse to forsake the path of morality or legality Hence the measureless hypocrisy of devotion love et cetera from whose repulsiveness one may daily get the most thorough nausea at this rotten and hypocritical relation of a lawful opposition In the moral relation of love and fidelity divided or opposed will cannot have place the beautiful relation is disturbed if the one wills this and the other the reverse But now according to the practice hitherto and the old prejudice of the opposition the moral relation is to be preserved above all What is then left to the opposition Perhaps the will to have a liberty if the beloved one sees fit to deny it Not a bit It may not will to have the freedom it can only wish for it petition for it lisp a Please please What would come of it if the opposition really willed willed with the full energy of the will No it must renounce will in order to live to love renounce liberty for love of morality It may never claim as a right what it is permitted only to beg as a favor Love devotion et cetera demand with undeviating definiteness that there be only one will to which the others devote themselves which they serve follow love Whether this will is regarded as reasonable or as unreasonable in both cases one acts morally when one follows it and immorally when one breaks away from it The will that commands the censorship seems to many unreasonable but he who in a land of censorship evades the censoring of his book acts immorally and he who submits it to the censorship acts morally If some one let his moral judgment go and set up e g a secret press one would have to call him immoral and imprudent into the bargain if he let himself be caught but will such a man lay claim to a value in the eyes of the moral Perhaps That is if he fancied he was serving a higher morality The web of the hypocrisy of to day hangs on the frontiers of two domains between which our time swings back and forth attaching its fine threads of deception and self deception No longer vigorous enough to serve morality without doubt or weakening not yet reckless enough to live wholly to egoism it trembles now toward the one and now toward the other in the spider web of hypocrisy and crippled by the curse of halfness catches only miserable stupid flies If one has once dared to make a free motion immediately one waters it again with assurances of love and shams resignation if on the other side they have had the face to reject the free motion with moral appeals to confidence et cetera immediately the moral courage also sinks and they assure one how they hear the free words with special pleasure et cetera they sham approval In short people would like to have the one but not go without the other they would like to have a free will but not for their lives lack the moral will Just come in contact with a servile loyalist you Liberals You will sweeten every word of freedom with a look of the most loyal confidence and he will clothe his servilism in the most flattering phrases of freedom Then you go apart and he like you thinks I know you fox He scents the devil in you as much as you do the dark old Lord God in him A Nero is a bad man only in the eyes of the good in mine he is nothing but a possessed man as are the good too The good see in him an arch villain and relegate him to hell Why did nothing hinder him in his arbitrary course Why did people put up with so much Do you suppose the tame Romans who let all their will be bound by such a tyrant were a hair the better In old Rome they would have put him to death instantly would never have been his slaves But the contemporary good among the Romans opposed to him only moral demands not their will they sighed that their emperor did not do homage to morality like them they themselves remained moral subjects till at last one found courage to give up moral obedient subjection And then the same good Romans who as obedient subjects had borne all the ignominy of having no will hurrahed over the nefarious immoral act of the rebel Where then in the good was the courage for the revolution that courage which they now praised after another had mustered it up The good could not have this courage for a revolution and an insurrection into the bargain is always something immoral which one can resolve upon only when one ceases to be good and becomes either bad or neither of the two Nero was no viler than his time in which one could only be one of the two good or bad The judgment of his time on him had to be that he was bad and this in the highest degree not a milksop but an arch scoundrel All moral people can pronounce only this judgment on him Rascals such as he was are still living here and there to day see e g the Memoirs of Ritter von Lang in the midst of the moral It is not convenient to live among them certainly as one is not sure of his life for a moment but can you say that it is more convenient to live among the moral One is just as little sure of his life there only that one is hanged in the way of justice but least of all is one sure of his honor and the national cockade is gone before you can say Jack Robinson The hard fist of morality treats the noble nature of egoism altogether without compassion But surely one cannot put a rascal and an honest man on the same level Now no human being does that oftener than you judges of morals yes still more than that you imprison as a criminal an honest man who speaks openly against the existing constitution against the hallowed institutions et cetera and you entrust portfolios and still more important things to a crafty rascal So in praxi you have nothing to reproach me with But in theory Now there I do put both on the same level as two opposite poles to wit both on the level of the moral law Both have meaning only in the moral world just as in the pre Christian time a Jew who kept the law and one who broke it had meaning and significance only in respect to the Jewish law before Jesus Christ on the contrary the Pharisee was no more than the sinner and publican So before self ownership the moral Pharisee amounts to as much as the immoral sinner Nero became very inconvenient by his possessedness But a self owning man would not sillily oppose to him the sacred and whine if the tyrant does not regard the sacred he would oppose to him his will How often the sacredness of the inalienable rights of man has been held up to their foes and some liberty or other shown and demonstrated to be a sacred right of man Those who do that deserve to be laughed out of court as they actually are were it not that in truth they do even though unconsciously take the road that leads to the goal They have a presentiment that if only the majority is once won for that liberty it will also will the liberty and will then take what it will have The sacredness of the liberty and all possible proofs of this sacredness will never procure it lamenting and petitioning only shows beggars The moral man is necessarily narrow in that he knows no other enemy than the immoral man He who is not moral is immoral and accordingly reprobate despicable et cetera Therefore the moral man can never comprehend the egoist Is not unwedded cohabitation an immorality The moral man may turn as he pleases he will have to stand by this verdict Emilia Galotti gave up her life for this moral truth And it is true it is an immorality A virtuous girl may become an old maid a virtuous man may pass the time in fighting his natural impulses till he has perhaps dulled them he may castrate himself for the sake of virtue as saint Origen did for the sake of heaven he thereby honors sacred wedlock sacred chastity as inviolable he is moral Unchastity can never become a moral act However indulgently the moral man may judge and excuse him who committed it it remains a transgression a sin against a moral commandment there clings to it an indelible stain As chastity once belonged to the monastic vow so it does to moral conduct Chastity is a good For the egoist on the contrary even chastity is not a good without which he could not get along he cares nothing at all about it What now follows from this for the judgment of the moral man This that he throws the egoist into the only class of men that he knows besides moral men into that of the immoral He cannot do otherwise he must find the egoist immoral in everything in which the egoist disregards morality If he did not find him so then he would already have become an apostate from morality without confessing it to himself he would already no longer be a truly moral man One should not let himself be led astray by such phenomena which at the present day are certainly no longer to be classed as rare but should reflect that he who yields any point of morality can as little be counted among the truly moral as Lessing was a pious Christian when in the well known parable he compared the Christian religion as well as the Mohammedan and Jewish to a counterfeit ring Often people are already further than they venture to confess to themselves For Socrates because in culture he stood on the level of morality it would have been an immorality if he had been willing to follow Crito s seductive incitement and escape from the dungeon to remain was the only moral thing But it was solely because Socrates was a moral man The unprincipled sacrilegious men of the Revolution on the contrary had sworn fidelity to Louis XVI and decreed his deposition yes his death but the act was an immoral one at which moral persons will be horrified to all eternity Yet all this applies more or less only to civic morality on which the freer look down with contempt For it like civism its native ground in general is still too little removed and free from the religious heaven not to transplant the latter s laws without criticism or further consideration to its domain instead of producing independent doctrines of its own Morality cuts a quite different figure when it arrives at the consciousness of its dignity and raises its principle the essence of man or Man to be the only regulative power Those who have worked their way through to such a decided consciousness break entirely with religion whose God no longer finds any place alongside their Man and as they see below themselves scuttle the ship of State so too they crumble away that morality which flourishes only in the State and logically have no right to use even its name any further For what this critical party calls morality is very positively distinguished from the so called civic or political morality and must appear to the citizen like an insensate and unbridled liberty But at bottom it has only the advantage of the purity of the principle which freed from its defilement with the religious has now reached universal power in its clarified definiteness as humanity Therefore one should not wonder that the name morality is retained along with others like freedom benevolence self consciousness et cetera and is only garnished now and then with the addition a free morality just as though the civic State is abused yet the State is to arise again as a free State or if not even so yet as a free society Because this morality completed into humanity has fully settled its accounts with the religion out of which it historically came forth nothing hinders it from becoming a religion on its own account For a distinction prevails between religion and morality only so long as our dealings with the world of men are regulated and hallowed by our relation to a superhuman being or so long as our doing is a doing for God s sake If on the other hand it comes to the point that man is to man the supreme being then that distinction vanishes and morality being removed from its subordinate position is completed into religion For then the higher being who had hitherto been subordinated to the highest Man has ascended to absolute height and we are related to him as one is related to the highest being i e religiously Morality and piety are now as synonymous as in the beginning of Christianity and it is only because the supreme being has come to be a different one that a holy walk is no longer called a holy one but a human one If morality has conquered then a complete change of masters has taken place After the annihilation of faith Feuerbach thinks to put in to the supposedly safe harbor of love The first and highest law must be the love of man to man Homo homini Deus est this is the supreme practical maxim this the turning point of the world s history thirty seven But properly speaking only the god is changed the deus love has remained there love to the superhuman God here love to the human God to homo as Deus Therefore man is to me sacred And everything truly human is to me sacred Marriage is sacred of itself And so it is with all moral relations Friendship is and must be sacred for you and property and marriage and the good of every man but sacred in and of itself thirty eight Haven t we the priest again there Who is his God Man with a great M What is the divine The human Then the predicate has indeed only been changed into the subject and instead of the sentence God is love they say love is divine instead of God has become man Man has become God et cetera It is nothing more or less than a new religion All moral relations are ethical are cultivated with a moral mind only where of themselves without religious consecration by the priest s blessing they are counted religious Feuerbach s proposition Theology is anthropology means only religion must be ethics ethics alone is religion Altogether Feuerbach accomplishes only a transposition of subject and predicate a giving of preference to the latter But since he himself says Love is not and has never been considered by men sacred through being a predicate of God but it is a predicate of God because it is divine in and of itself he might judge that the fight against the predicates themselves against love and all sanctities must be commenced How could he hope to turn men away from God when he left them the divine And if as Feuerbach says God himself has never been the main thing to them but only his predicates then he might have gone on leaving them the tinsel longer yet since the doll the real kernel was left at any rate He recognizes too that with him it is only a matter of annihilating an illusion thirty nine he thinks however that the effect of the illusion on men is downright ruinous since even love in itself the truest most inward sentiment becomes an obscure illusory one through religiousness since religious love loves man forty only for God s sake therefore loves man only apparently but in truth God only Is this different with moral love Does it love the man this man for this man s sake or for morality s sake for Man s sake and so for homo homini Deus for God s sake The wheels in the head have a number of other formal aspects some of which it may be useful to indicate here Thus self renunciation is common to the holy with the unholy to the pure and the impure The impure man renounces all better feelings all shame even natural timidity and follows only the appetite that rules him The pure man renounces his natural relation to the world renounces the world and follows only the desire which rules him Driven by the thirst for money the avaricious man renounces all admonitions of conscience all feeling of honor all gentleness and all compassion he puts all considerations out of sight the appetite drags him along The holy man behaves similarly He makes himself the laughing stock of the world is hard hearted and strictly just for the desire drags him along As the unholy man renounces himself before Mammon so the holy man renounces himself before God and the divine laws We are now living in a time when the shamelessness of the holy is every day more and more felt and uncovered whereby it is at the same time compelled to unveil itself and lay itself bare more and more every day Have not the shamelessness and stupidity of the reasons with which men antagonize the progress of the age long surpassed all measure and all expectation But it must be so The self renouncers must as holy men take the same course that they do as unholy men as the latter little by little sink to the fullest measure of self renouncing vulgarity and lowness so the former must ascend to the most dishonorable exaltation The mammon of the earth and the God of heaven both demand exactly the same degree of self renunciation The low man like the exalted one reaches out for a good the former for the material good the latter for the ideal the so called supreme good and at last both complete each other again too as the materially minded man sacrifices everything to an ideal phantasm his vanity and the spiritually minded man to a material gratification the life of enjoyment Those who exhort men to unselfishness forty one think they are saying an uncommon deal What do they understand by it Probably something like what they understand by self renunciation But who is this self that is to be renounced and to have no benefit It seems that you yourself are supposed to be it And for whose benefit is unselfish self renunciation recommended to you Again for your benefit and behoof only that through unselfishness you are procuring your true benefit You are to benefit yourself and yet you are not seek your benefit People regard as unselfish the benefactor of men a Franke who founded the orphan asylum an O Connell who works tirelessly for his Irish people but also the fanatic who like saint Boniface hazards his life for the conversion of the heathen or like Robespierre sacrifices everything to virtue like Koerner dies for God king and fatherland Hence among others O Connell s opponents try to trump up against him some selfishness or mercenariness for which the O Connell fund seemed to give them a foundation for if they were successful in casting suspicion on his unselfishness they would easily separate him from his adherents Yet what could they show further than that O Connell was working for another end than the ostensible one But whether he may aim at making money or at liberating the people it still remains certain in one case as in the other that he is striving for an end and that his end selfishness here as there only that his national self interest would be beneficial to others too and so would be for the common interest Now do you suppose unselfishness is unreal and nowhere extant On the contrary nothing is more ordinary One may even call it an article of fashion in the civilized world which is considered so indispensable that if it costs too much in solid material people at least adorn themselves with its tinsel counterfeit and feign it Where does unselfishness begin Right where an end ceases to be our end and our property which we as owners can dispose of at pleasure where it becomes a fixed end or a fixed idea where it begins to inspire enthuse fanaticize us in short where it passes into our stubbornness and becomes our master One is not unselfish so long as he retains the end in his power one becomes so only at that Here I stand I cannot do otherwise the fundamental maxim of all the possessed one becomes so in the case of a sacred end through the corresponding sacred zeal I am not unselfish so long as the end remains my own and I instead of giving myself up to be the blind means of its fulfilment leave it always an open question My zeal need not on that account be slacker than the most fanatical but at the same time I remain toward it frostily cold unbelieving and its most irreconcilable enemy I remain its judge because I am its owner Unselfishness grows rank as far as possessedness reaches as much on possessions of the devil as on those of a good spirit there vice folly et cetera here humility devotion et cetera Where could one look without meeting victims of self renunciation There sits a girl opposite me who perhaps has been making bloody sacrifices to her soul for ten years already Over the buxom form droops a deathly tired head and pale cheeks betray the slow bleeding away of her youth Poor child how often the passions may have beaten at your heart and the rich powers of youth have demanded their right When your head rolled in the soft pillow how awakening nature quivered through your limbs the blood swelled your veins and fiery fancies poured the gleam of voluptuousness into your eyes Then appeared the ghost of the soul and its eternal bliss You were terrified your hands folded themselves your tormented eye turned its look upward you prayed The storms of nature were hushed a calm glided over the ocean of your appetites Slowly the weary eyelids sank over the life extinguished under them the tension crept out unperceived from the rounded limbs the boisterous waves dried up in the heart the folded hands themselves rested a powerless weight on the unresisting bosom one last faint Oh dear moaned itself away and the soul was at rest You fell asleep to awake in the morning to a new combat and a new prayer Now the habit of renunciation cools the heat of your desire and the roses of your youth are growing pale in the chlorosis of your heavenliness The soul is saved the body may perish O Lais O Ninon how well you did to scorn this pale virtue One free grisette against a thousand virgins grown gray in virtue The fixed idea may also be perceived as maxim principle standpoint and the like Archimedes to move the earth asked for a standpoint outside it Men sought continually for this standpoint and every one seized upon it as well as he was able This foreign standpoint is the world of mind of ideas thoughts concepts essences et cetera it is heaven Heaven is the standpoint from which the earth is moved earthly doings surveyed and despised To assure to themselves heaven to occupy the heavenly standpoint firmly and for ever how painfully and tirelessly humanity struggled for this Christianity has aimed to deliver us from a life determined by nature from the appetites as actuating us and so has meant that man should not let himself be determined by his appetites This does not involve the idea that he was not to have appetites but that the appetites were not to have him that they were not to become fixed uncontrollable indissoluble Now could not what Christianity religion contrived against the appetites be applied by us to its own precept that mind thought conceptions ideas faith et cetera must determine us could we not ask that neither should mind or the conception the idea be allowed to determine us to become fixed and inviolable or sacred Then it would end in the dissolution of mind the dissolution of all thoughts of all conceptions As we there had to say We are indeed to have appetites but the appetites are not to have us so we should now say We are indeed to have mind but mind is not to have us If the latter seems lacking in sense think e g of the fact that with so many a man a thought becomes a maxim whereby he himself is made prisoner to it so that it is not he that has the maxim but rather it that has him And with the maxim he has a permanent standpoint again The doctrines of the catechism become our principles before we find it out and no longer brook rejection Their thought or mind has the sole power and no protest of the flesh is further listened to Nevertheless it is only through the flesh that I can break the tyranny of mind for it is only when a man hears his flesh along with the rest of him that he hears himself wholly and it is only when he wholly hears himself that he is a hearing or rational forty two being The Christian does not hear the agony of his enthralled nature but lives in humility therefore he does not grumble at the wrong which befalls his person he thinks himself satisfied with the freedom of the spirit But if the flesh once takes the floor and its tone is passionate indecorous not well disposed spiteful et cetera as it cannot be otherwise then he thinks he hears voices of devils voices against the spirit for decorum passionlessness kindly disposition and the like is spirit and is justly zealous against them He could not be a Christian if he were willing to endure them He listens only to morality and slaps immorality in the mouth he listens only to legality and gags the lawless word The spirit of morality and legality holds him a prisoner a rigid unbending master They call that the mastery of the spirit it is at the same time the standpoint of the spirit And now whom do the ordinary liberal gentlemen mean to make free Whose freedom is it that they cry out and thirst for The spirit s That of the spirit of morality legality piety the fear of God et cetera That is what the anti liberal gentlemen also want and the whole contention between the two turns on a matter of advantage whether the latter are to be the only speakers or the former are to receive a share in the enjoyment of the same advantage The spirit remains the absolute lord for both and their only quarrel is over who shall occupy the hierarchical throne that pertains to the Vicegerent of the Lord The best of it is that one can calmly look upon the stir with the certainty that the wild beasts of history will tear each other to pieces just like those of nature their putrefying corpses fertilize the ground for our crops We shall come back later to many another wheel in the head for instance those of vocation truthfulness love et cetera When one s own is contrasted with what is imparted to him there is no use in objecting that we cannot have anything isolated but receive everything as a part of the universal order and therefore through the impression of what is around us and that consequently we have it as something imparted for there is a great difference between the feelings and thoughts which are aroused in me by other things and those which are given to me God immortality freedom humanity et cetera are drilled into us from childhood as thoughts and feelings which move our inner being more or less strongly either ruling us without our knowing it or sometimes in richer natures manifesting themselves in systems and works of art but are always not aroused but imparted feelings because we must believe in them and cling to them That an Absolute existed and that it must be taken in felt and thought by us was settled as a faith in the minds of those who spent all the strength of their mind on recognizing it and setting it forth The feeling for the Absolute exists there as an imparted one and thenceforth results only in the most manifold revelations of its own self So in Klopstock the religious feeling was an imparted one which in the Messiad simply found artistic expression If on the other hand the religion with which he was confronted had been for him only an incitation to feeling and thought and if he had known how to take an attitude completely his own toward it then there would have resulted instead of religious inspiration a dissolution and consumption of the religion itself Instead of that he only continued in mature years his childish feelings received in childhood and squandered the powers of his manhood in decking out his childish trifles The difference is then whether feelings are imparted to me or only aroused Those which are aroused are my own egoistic because they are not as feelings drilled into me dictated to me and pressed upon me but those which are imparted to me I receive with open arms I cherish them in me as a heritage cultivate them and am possessed by them Who is there that has never more or less consciously noticed that our whole education is calculated to produce feelings in us i e impart them to us instead of leaving their production to ourselves however they may turn out If we hear thee name of God we are to feel veneration if we hear that of the prince s majesty it is to be received with reverence deference submission if we hear that of morality we are to think that we hear something inviolable if we hear of the Evil One or evil ones we are to shudder et cetera The intention is directed to these feelings and he who e g should hear with pleasure the deeds of the bad would have to be taught what s what with the rod of discipline Thus stuffed with imparted feelings we appear before the bar of majority and are pronounced of age Our equipment consists of elevating feelings lofty thoughts inspiring maxims eternal principles et cetera The young are of age when they twitter like the old they are driven through school to learn the old song and when they have this by heart they are declared of age We must not feel at every thing and every name that comes before us what we could and would like to feel thereat e g at the name of God we must think of nothing laughable feel nothing disrespectful it being prescribed and imparted to us what and how we are to feel and think at mention of that name That is the meaning of the care of souls that my soul or my mind be tuned as others think right not as I myself would like it How much trouble does it not cost one finally to secure to oneself a feeling of one s own at the mention of at least this or that name and to laugh in the face of many who expect from us a holy face and a composed expression at their speeches What is imparted is alien to us is not our own and therefore is sacred and it is hard work to lay aside the sacred dread of it To day one again hears seriousness praised seriousness in the presence of highly important subjects and discussions German seriousness et cetera This sort of seriousness proclaims clearly how old and grave lunacy and possession have already become For there is nothing more serious than a lunatic when he comes to the central point of his lunacy then his great earnestness incapacitates him for taking a joke See madhouses Sec three THE HIERARCHY The historical reflections on our Mongolism which I propose to insert episodically at this place are not given with the claim of thoroughness or even of approved soundness but solely because it seems to me that they may contribute toward making the rest clear The history of the world whose shaping properly belongs altogether to the Caucasian race seems till now to have run through two Caucasian ages in the first of which we had to work out and work off our innate negroidity this was followed in the second by Mongoloidity Chineseness which must likewise be terribly made an end of Negroidity represents antiquity the time of dependence on things on cocks eating birds flight on sneezing on thunder and lightning on the rustling of sacred trees et cetera Mongoloidity the time of dependence on thoughts the Christian time Reserved for the future are the words I am owner of the world of things and I am owner of the world of mind In the negroid age fall the campaigns of Sesostris and the importance of Egypt and of northern Africa in general To the Mongoloid age belong the invasions of the Huns and Mongols up to the Russians The value of me cannot possibly be rated high so long as the hard diamond of the not me bears so enormous a price as was the case both with God and with the world The not me is still too stony and indomitable to be consumed and absorbed by me rather men only creep about with extraordinary bustle on this immovable entity i e on this substance like parasitic animals on a body from whose juices they draw nourishment yet without consuming it It is the bustle of vermin the assiduity of Mongolians Among the Chinese we know everything remains as it used to be and nothing essential or substantial suffers a change all the more actively do they work away at that which remains which bears the name of the old ancestors et cetera Accordingly in our Mongolian age all change has been only reformatory or ameliorative not destructive or consuming and annihilating The substance the object remains All our assiduity was only the activity of ants and the hopping of fleas jugglers tricks on the immovable tight rope of the objective corvee service under the lordship of the unchangeable or eternal The Chinese are doubtless the most positive nation because totally buried in precepts but neither has the Christian age come out from the positive i e from limited freedom freedom within certain limits In the most advanced stage of civilization this activity earns the name of scientific activity of working on a motionless presupposition a hypothesis that is not to be upset In its first and most unintelligible form morality shows itself as habit To act according to the habit and usage morem of one s country is to be moral there Therefore pure moral action clear unadulterated morality is most straightforwardly practised in China they keep to the old habit and usage and hate each innovation as a crime worthy of death For innovation is the deadly enemy of habit of the old of permanence In fact too it admits of no doubt that through habit man secures himself against the obtrusiveness of things of the world and founds a world of his own in which alone he is and feels at home i e builds himself a heaven Why heaven has no other meaning than that it is man s proper home in which nothing alien regulates and rules him any longer no influence of the earthly any longer makes him himself alien in short in which the dross of the earthly is thrown off and the combat against the world has found an end in which therefore nothing is any longer denied him Heaven is the end of abnegation it is free enjoyment There man no longer denies himself anything because nothing is any longer alien and hostile to him But now habit is a second nature which detaches and frees man from his first and original natural condition in securing him against every casualty of it The fully elaborated habit of the Chinese has provided for all emergencies and everything is looked out for whatever may come the Chinaman always knows how he has to behave and does not need to decide first according to the circumstances no unforeseen case throws him down from the heaven of his rest The morally habituated and inured Chinaman is not surprised and taken off his guard he behaves with equanimity i e with equal spirit or temper toward everything because his temper protected by the precaution of his traditional usage does not lose its balance Hence on the ladder of culture or civilization humanity mounts the first round through habit and as it conceives that in climbing to culture it is at the same time climbing to heaven the realm of culture or second nature it really mounts the first round of the ladder to heaven If Mongoldom has settled the existence of spiritual beings if it has created a world of spirits a heaven the Caucasians have wrestled for thousands of years with these spiritual beings to get to the bottom of them What were they doing then but building on Mongolian ground They have not built on sand but in the air they have wrestled with Mongolism stormed the Mongolian heaven Tien When will they at last annihilate this heaven When will they at last become really Caucasians and find themselves When will the immortality of the soul which in these latter days thought it was giving itself still more security if it presented itself as immortality of mind at last change to the mortality of mind It was when in the industrious struggle of the Mongolian race men had built a heaven that those of the Caucasian race since in their Mongolian complexion they have to do with heaven took upon themselves the opposite task the task of storming that heaven of custom heaven storming forty three activity To dig under all human ordinance in order to set up a new and better one on the cleared site to wreck all customs in order to put new and better customs in their place et cetera their act is limited to this But is it thus already purely and really what it aspires to be and does it reach its final aim No in this creation of a better it is tainted with Mongolism It storms heaven only to make a heaven again it overthrows an old power only to legitimate a new power it only improves Nevertheless the point aimed at often as it may vanish from the eyes at every new attempt is the real complete downfall of heaven customs et cetera in short of man secured only against the world of the isolation or inwardness of man Through the heaven of culture man seeks to isolate himself from the world to break its hostile power But this isolation of heaven must likewise be broken and the true end of heaven storming is the downfall of heaven the annihilation of heaven Improving and reforming is the Mongolism of the Caucasian because thereby he is always setting up again what already existed to wit a precept a generality a heaven He harbors the most irreconcilable enmity to heaven and yet builds new heavens daily piling heaven on heaven he only crushes one by another the Jews heaven destroys the Greeks the Christians the Jews the Protestants the Catholics et cetera If the heaven storming men of Caucasian blood throw on their Mongolian skin they will bury the emotional man under the ruins of the monstrous world of emotion the isolated man under his isolated world the paradisiacal man under his heaven And heaven is the realm of spirits the realm of freedom of the spirit The realm of heaven the realm of spirits and ghosts has found its right standing in the speculative philosophy Here it was stated as the realm of thoughts concepts and ideas heaven is peopled with thoughts and ideas and this realm of spirits is then the true reality To want to win freedom for the spirit is Mongolism freedom of the spirit is Mongolian freedom freedom of feeling moral freedom et cetera We may find the word morality taken as synonymous with spontaneity self determination But that is not involved in it rather has the Caucasian shown himself spontaneous only in spite of his Mongolian morality The Mongolian heaven or morals forty four remained the strong castle and only by storming incessantly at this castle did the Caucasian show himself moral if he had not had to do with morals at all any longer if he had not had therein his indomitable continual enemy the relation to morals would cease and consequently morality would cease That his spontaneity is still a moral spontaneity therefore is just the Mongoloidity of it is a sign that in it he has not arrived at himself Moral spontaneity corresponds entirely with religious and orthodox philosophy constitutional monarchy the Christian State freedom within certain limits the limited freedom of the press or in a figure to the hero fettered to a sick bed Man has not really vanquished Shamanism and its spooks till he possesses the strength to lay aside not only the belief in ghosts or in spirits but also the belief in the spirit He who believes in a spook no more assumes the introduction of a higher world than he who believes in the spirit and both seek behind the sensual world a supersensual one in short they produce and believe another world and this other world the product of their mind is a spiritual world for their senses grasp and know nothing of another a non sensual world only their spirit lives in it Going on from this Mongolian belief in the existence of spiritual beings to the point that the proper being of man too is his spirit and that all care must be directed to this alone to the welfare of his soul is not hard Influence on the spirit so called moral influence is hereby assured Hence it is manifest that Mongolism represents utter absence of any rights of the sensuous represents non sensuousness and unnature and that sin and the consciousness of sin was our Mongolian torment that lasted thousands of years But who then will dissolve the spirit into its nothing He who by means of the spirit set forth nature as the null finite transitory he alone can bring down the spirit too to like nullity I can each one among you can who does his will as an absolute I in a word the egoist can Before the sacred people lose all sense of power and all confidence they occupy a powerless and humble attitude toward it And yet no thing is sacred of itself but by my declaring it sacred by my declaration my judgment my bending the knee in short by my conscience Sacred is everything which for the egoist is to be unapproachable not to be touched outside his power i e above him sacred in a word is every matter of conscience for this is a matter of conscience to me means simply I hold this sacred For little children just as for animals nothing sacred exists because in order to make room for this conception one must already have progressed so far in understanding that he can make distinctions like good and bad warranted and unwarranted et cetera only at such a level of reflection or intelligence the proper standpoint of religion can unnatural i e brought into existence by thinking reverence sacred dread step into the place of natural fear To this sacred dread belongs holding something outside oneself for mightier greater better warranted better et cetera i e the attitude in which one acknowledges the might of something alien not merely feels it then but expressly acknowledges it i e admits it yields surrenders lets himself be tied devotion humility servility submission et cetera Here walks the whole ghostly troop of the Christian virtues Everything toward which you cherish any respect or reverence deserves the name of sacred you yourselves too say that you would feel a sacred dread of laying hands on it And you give this tinge even to the unholy gallows crime et cetera You have a horror of touching it There lies in it something uncanny i e unfamiliar or not your own If something or other did not rank as sacred in a man s mind why then all bars would be let down to self will to unlimited subjectivity Fear makes the beginning and one can make himself fearful to the coarsest man already therefore a barrier against his insolence But in fear there always remains the attempt to liberate oneself from what is feared by guile deception tricks et cetera In reverence forty five on the contrary it is quite otherwise Here something is not only feared forty six but also honored forty seven what is feared has become an inward power which I can no longer get clear of I honor it am captivated by it and devoted to it belong to it by the honor which I pay it I am completely in its power and do not even attempt liberation any longer Now I am attached to it with all the strength of faith I believe I and what I fear are one not I live but the respected lives in me Because the spirit the infinite does not allow of coming to any end therefore it is stationary it fears dying it cannot let go its dear Jesus the greatness of finiteness is no longer recognized by its blinded eye the object of fear now raised to veneration may no longer be handled reverence is made eternal the respected is deified The man is now no longer employed in creating but in learning knowing investigating et cetera i e occupied with a fixed object losing himself in its depths without return to himself The relation to this object is that of knowing fathoming basing et cetera not that of dissolution abrogation et cetera Man is to be religious that is settled therefore people busy themselves only with the question how this is to be attained what is the right meaning of religiousness et cetera Quite otherwise when one makes the axiom itself doubtful and calls it in question even though it should go to smash Morality too is such sacred conception one must be moral and must look only for the right how the right way to be so One dares not go at morality itself with the question whether it is not itself an illusion it remains exalted above all doubt unchangeable And so we go on with the sacred grade after grade from the holy to the holy of holies Men are sometimes divided into two classes cultured and uncultured The former so far as they were worthy of their name occupied themselves with thoughts with mind and because in the time since Christ of which the very principle is thought they were the ruling ones demanded a servile respect for the thoughts recognized by them State emperor church God morality order et cetera are such thoughts or spirits that exist only for the mind A merely living being an animal cares as little for them as a child But the uncultured are really nothing but children and he who attends only to the necessities of his life is indifferent to those spirits but because he is also weak before them he succumbs to their power and is ruled by thoughts This is the meaning of hierarchy Hierarchy is dominion of thoughts dominion of mind We are hierarchic to this day kept down by those who are supported by thoughts Thoughts are the sacred But the two are always clashing now one and now the other giving the offence and this clash occurs not only in the collision of two men but in one and the same man For no cultured man is so cultured as not to find enjoyment in things too and so be uncultured and no uncultured man is totally without thoughts In Hegel it comes to light at last what a longing for things even the most cultured man has and what a horror of every hollow theory he harbors With him reality the world of things is altogether to correspond to the thought and no concept to be without reality This caused Hegel s system to be known as the most objective as if in it thought and thing celebrated their union But this was simply the extremest case of violence on the part of thought its highest pitch of despotism and sole dominion the triumph of mind and with it the triumph of philosophy Philosophy cannot hereafter achieve anything higher for its highest is the omnipotence of mind the almightiness of mind forty eight Spiritual men have taken into their head something that is to be realized They have concepts of love goodness and the like which they would like to see realized therefore they want to set up a kingdom of love on earth in which no one any longer acts from selfishness but each one from love Love is to rule What they have taken into their head what shall we call it but fixed idea Why their head is haunted The most oppressive spook is Man Think of the proverb The road to ruin is paved with good intentions The intention to realize humanity altogether in oneself to become altogether man is of such ruinous kind here belong the intentions to become good noble loving et cetera In the sixth part of the Denkwuerdigkeiten p seven Bruno Bauer says That middle class which was to receive such a terrible importance for modern history is capable of no self sacrificing action no enthusiasm for an idea no exaltation it devotes itself to nothing but the interests of its mediocrity i e it remains always limited to itself and conquers at last only through its bulk with which it has succeeded in tiring out the efforts of passion enthusiasm consistency through its surface into which it absorbs a part of the new ideas And p six It has turned the revolutionary ideas for which not it but unselfish or impassioned men sacrificed themselves solely to its own profit has turned spirit into money That is to be sure after it had taken away from those ideas their point their consistency their destructive seriousness fanatical against all egoism These people then are not self sacrificing not enthusiastic not idealistic not consistent not zealots they are egoists in the usual sense selfish people looking out for their advantage sober calculating et cetera Who then is self sacrificing forty nine In the full sense surely he who ventures everything else for one thing one object one will one passion et cetera Is not the lover self sacrificing who forsakes father and mother endures all dangers and privations to reach his goal Or the ambitious man who offers up all his desires wishes and satisfactions to the single passion or the avaricious man who denies himself everything to gather treasures or the pleasure seeker et cetera He is ruled by a passion to which he brings the rest as sacrifices And are these self sacrificing people perchance not selfish not egoists As they have only one ruling passion so they provide for only one satisfaction but for this the more strenuously they are wholly absorbed in it Their entire activity is egoistic but it is a one sided unopened narrow egoism it is possessedness Why those are petty passions by which on the contrary man must not let himself be enthralled Man must make sacrifices for a great idea a great cause A great idea a good cause is it may be the honor of God for which innumerable people have met death Christianity which has found its willing martyrs the Holy Catholic Church which has greedily demanded sacrifices of heretics liberty and equality which were waited on by bloody guillotines He who lives for a great idea a good cause a doctrine a system a lofty calling may not let any worldly lusts any self seeking interest spring up in him Here we have the concept of clericalism or as it may also be called in its pedagogic activity school masterliness for the idealists play the schoolmaster over us The clergyman is especially called to live to the idea and to work for the idea the truly good cause Therefore the people feel how little it befits him to show worldly haughtiness to desire good living to join in such pleasures as dancing and gaming in short to have any other than a sacred interest Hence too doubtless is derived the scanty salary of teachers who are to feel themselves repaid by the sacredness of their calling alone and to renounce other enjoyments Even a directory of the sacred ideas one or more of which man is to look upon as his calling is not lacking Family fatherland science et cetera may find in man a servant faithful to his calling Here we come upon the old old craze of the world which has not yet learned to do without clericalism that to live and work for an idea is man s calling and according to the faithfulness of its fulfilment his human worth is measured This is the dominion of the idea in other words it is clericalism E g Robespierre saint Just et cetera were priests through and through inspired by the idea enthusiasts consistent instruments of this idea idealistic men So saint Just exclaims in a speech There is something terrible in the sacred love of country it is so exclusive that it sacrifices everything to the public interest without mercy without fear without human consideration It hurls Manlius down the precipice it sacrifices its private inclinations it leads Regulus to Carthage throws a Roman into the chasm and sets Marat as a victim of his devotion in the Pantheon Now over against these representatives of ideal or sacred interests stands a world of innumerable personal profane interests No idea no system no sacred cause is so great as never to be outrivaled and modified by these personal interests Even if they are silent momentarily and in times of rage and fanaticism yet they soon come uppermost again through the sound sense of the people Those ideas do not completely conquer till they are no longer hostile to personal interests i e till they satisfy egoism The man who is just now crying herrings in front of my window has a personal interest in good sales and if his wife or anybody else wishes him the like this remains a personal interest all the same If on the other hand a thief deprived him of his basket then there would at once arise an interest of many of the whole city of the whole country or in a word of all who abhor theft an interest in which the herring seller s person would become indifferent and in its place the category of the robbed man would come into the foreground But even here all might yet resolve itself into a personal interest each of the partakers reflecting that he must concur in the punishment of the thief because unpunished stealing might otherwise become general and cause him too to lose his own Such a calculation however can hardly be assumed on the part of many and we shall rather hear the cry that the thief is a criminal Here we have before us a judgment the thief s action receiving its expression in the concept crime Now the matter stands thus even if a crime did not cause the slightest damage either to me or to any of those in whom I take an interest I should nevertheless denounce it Why Because I am enthusiastic for morality filled with the idea of morality what is hostile to it I everywhere assail Because in his mind theft ranks as abominable without any question Proudhon e g thinks that with the sentence Property is theft he has at once put a brand on property In the sense of the priestly theft is always a crime or at least a misdeed Here the personal interest is at an end This particular person who has stolen the basket is perfectly indifferent to my person it is only the thief this concept of which that person presents a specimen that I take an interest in The thief and man are in my mind irreconcilable opposites for one is not truly man when one is a thief one degrades Man or humanity in himself when one steals Dropping out of personal concern one gets into philanthropism friendliness to man which is usually misunderstood as if it was a love to men to each individual while it is nothing but a love of Man the unreal concept the spook It is not Greek tous anthropous men but Greek ton anthropon Man that the philanthropist carries in his heart To be sure he cares for each individual but only because he wants to see his beloved ideal realized everywhere So there is nothing said here of care for me you us that would be personal interest and belongs under the head of worldly love Philanthropism is a heavenly spiritual a priestly love Man must be restored in us even if thereby we poor devils should come to grief It is the same priestly principle as that famous fiat justitia pereat mundus man and justice are ideas ghosts for love of which everything is sacrificed therefore the priestly spirits are the self sacrificing ones He who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends and floats in an ideal sacred interest Man you see is not a person but an ideal a spook Now things as different as possible can belong to Man and be so regarded If one finds Man s chief requirement in piety there arises religious clericalism if one sees it in morality then moral clericalism raises its head On this account the priestly spirits of our day want to make a religion of everything a religion of liberty religion of equality et cetera and for them every idea becomes a sacred cause e g even citizenship politics publicity freedom of the press trial by jury et cetera Now what does unselfishness mean in this sense Having only an ideal interest before which no respect of persons avails The stiff head of the worldly man opposes this but for centuries has always been worsted at least so far as to have to bend the unruly neck and honor the higher power clericalism pressed it down When the worldly egoist had shaken off a higher power e g the Old Testament law the Roman pope et cetera then at once a seven times higher one was over him again e g faith in the place of the law the transformation of all laymen into divines in place of the limited body of clergy et cetera His experience was like that of the possessed man into whom seven devils passed when he thought he had freed himself from one In the passage quoted above all ideality et cetera is denied to the middle class It certainly schemed against the ideal consistency with which Robespierre wanted to carry out the principle The instinct of its interest told it that this consistency harmonized too little with what its mind was set on and that it would be acting against itself if it were willing to further the enthusiasm for principle Was it to behave so unselfishly as to abandon all its aims in order to bring a harsh theory to its triumph It suits the priests admirably to be sure when people listen to their summons Cast away everything and follow me or Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me Some decided idealists obey this call but most act like Ananias and Sapphira maintaining a behavior half clerical or religious and half worldly serving God and Mammon I do not blame the middle class for not wanting to let its aims be frustrated by Robespierre i e for inquiring of its egoism how far it might give the revolutionary idea a chance But one might blame if blame were in place here anyhow those who let their own interests be frustrated by the interests of the middle class However will not they likewise sooner or later learn to understand what is to their advantage August Becker says fifty To win the producers proletarians a negation of the traditional conception of right is by no means enough Folks unfortunately care little for the theoretical victory of the idea One must demonstrate to them ad oculos how this victory can be practically utilized in life And p thirty two You must get hold of folks by their real interests if you want to work upon them Immediately after this he shows how a fine looseness of morals is already spreading among our peasants because they prefer to follow their real interests rather than the commands of morality Because the revolutionary priests or schoolmasters served Man they cut off the heads of men The revolutionary laymen those outside the sacred circle did not feel any greater horror of cutting off heads but were less anxious about the rights of Man than about their own How comes it though that the egoism of those who affirm personal interest and always inquire of it is nevertheless forever succumbing to a priestly or schoolmasterly i e an ideal interest Their person seems to them too small too insignificant and is so in fact to lay claim to everything and be able to put itself completely in force There is a sure sign of this in their dividing themselves into two persons an eternal and a temporal and always caring either only for the one or only for the other on Sunday for the eternal on the work day for the temporal in prayer for the former in work for the latter They have the priest in themselves therefore they do not get rid of him but hear themselves lectured inwardly every Sunday How men have struggled and calculated to get at a solution regarding these dualistic essences Idea followed upon idea principle upon principle system upon system and none knew how to keep down permanently the contradiction of the worldly man the so called egoist Does not this prove that all those ideas were too feeble to take up my whole will into themselves and satisfy it They were and remained hostile to me even if the hostility lay concealed for a considerable time Will it be the same with self ownership Is it too only an attempt at mediation Whatever principle I turned to it might be to that of reason I always had to turn away from it again Or can I always be rational arrange my life according to reason in everything I can no doubt strive after rationality I can love it just as I can also love God and every other idea I can be a philosopher a lover of wisdom as I love God But what I love what I strive for is only in my idea my conception my thoughts it is in my heart my head it is in me like the heart but it is not I I am not it To the activity of priestly minds belongs especially what one often hears called moral influence Moral influence takes its start where humiliation begins yes it is nothing else than this humiliation itself the breaking and bending of the temper fifty one down to humility fifty two If I call to some one to run away when a rock is to be blasted I exert no moral influence by this demand if I say to a child You will go hungry if you will not eat what is put on the table this is not moral influence But if I say to it You will pray honor your parents respect the crucifix speak the truth et cetera for this belongs to man and is man s calling or even this is God s will then moral influence is complete then a man is to bend before the calling of man be tractable become humble give up his will for an alien one which is set up as rule and law he is to abase himself before something higher self abasement He that abaseth himself shall be exalted Yes yes children must early be made to practise piety godliness and propriety a person of good breeding is one into whom good maxims have been instilled and impressed poured in through a funnel thrashed in and preached in If one shrugs his shoulders at this at once the good wring their hands despairingly and cry But for heaven s sake if one is to give children no good instruction why then they will run straight into the jaws of sin and become good for nothing hoodlums Gently you prophets of evil Good for nothing in your sense they certainly will become but your sense happens to be a very good for nothing sense The impudent lads will no longer let anything be whined and chattered into them by you and will have no sympathy for all the follies for which you have been raving and driveling since the memory of man began they will abolish the law of inheritance i e they will not be willing to inherit your stupidities as you inherited them from your fathers they destroy inherited sin fifty three If you command them Bend before the Most High they will answer If he wants to bend us let him come himself and do it we at least will not bend of our own accord And if you threaten them with his wrath and his punishment they will take it like being threatened with the bogie man If you are no longer successful in making them afraid of ghosts then the dominion of ghosts is at an end and nurses tales find no faith And is it not precisely the liberals again that press for good education and improvement of the educational system For how could their liberalism their liberty within the bounds of law come about without discipline Even if they do not exactly educate to the fear of God yet they demand the fear of Man all the more strictly and awaken enthusiasm for the truly human calling by discipline A long time passed away in which people were satisfied with the fancy that they had the truth without thinking seriously whether perhaps they themselves must be true to possess the truth This time was the Middle Ages With the common consciousness i e the consciousness which deals with things that consciousness which has receptivity only for things or for what is sensuous and sense moving they thought to grasp what did not deal with things and was not perceptible by the senses As one does indeed also exert his eye to see the remote or laboriously exercise his hand till its fingers have become dexterous enough to press the keys correctly so they chastened themselves in the most manifold ways in order to become capable of receiving the supersensual wholly into themselves But what they chastened was after all only the sensual man the common consciousness so called finite or objective thought Yet as this thought this understanding which Luther decries under the name of reason is incapable of comprehending the divine its chastening contributed just as much to the understanding of the truth as if one exercised the feet year in and year out in dancing and hoped that in this way they would finally learn to play the flute Luther with whom the so called Middle Ages end was the first who understood that the man himself must become other than he was if he wanted to comprehend truth must become as true as truth itself Only he who already has truth in his belief only he who believes in it can become a partaker of it i e only the believer finds it accessible and sounds its depths Only that organ of man which is able to blow can attain the further capacity of flute playing and only that man can become a partaker of truth who has the right organ for it He who is capable of thinking only what is sensuous objective pertaining to things figures to himself in truth only what pertains to things But truth is spirit stuff altogether inappreciable by the senses and therefore only for the higher consciousness not for that which is earthly minded With Luther accordingly dawns the perception that truth because it is a thought is only for the thinking man And this is to say that man must henceforth take an utterly different standpoint viz the heavenly believing scientific standpoint or that of thought in relation to its object the thought that of mind in relation to mind Consequently only the like apprehend the like You are like the spirit that you understand fifty four Because Protestantism broke the mediaeval hierarchy the opinion could take root that hierarchy in general had been shattered by it and it could be wholly overlooked that it was precisely a reformation and so a reinvigoration of the antiquated hierarchy That mediaeval hierarchy had been only a weakly one as it had to let all possible barbarism of unsanctified things run on uncoerced beside it and it was the Reformation that first steeled the power of hierarchy If Bruno Bauer thinks fifty five As the Reformation was mainly the abstract rending of the religious principle from art State and science and so its liberation from those powers with which it had joined itself in the antiquity of the church and in the hierarchy of the Middle Ages so too the theological and ecclesiastical movements which proceeded from the Reformation are only the consistent carrying out of this abstraction of the religious principle from the other powers of humanity I regard precisely the opposite as correct and think that the dominion of spirits or freedom of mind which comes to the same thing was never before so all embracing and all powerful because the present one instead of rending the religious principle from art State and science lifted the latter altogether out of secularity into the realm of spirit and made them religious Luther and Descartes have been appropriately put side by side in their He who believes is a God and I think therefore I am cogito ergo sum Man s heaven is thought mind Everything can be wrested from him except thought except faith Particular faith like faith in Zeus Astarte Jehovah Allah et cetera may be destroyed but faith itself is indestructible In thought is freedom What I need and what I hunger for is no longer granted to me by any grace by the Virgin Mary by intercession of the saints or by the binding and loosing church but I procure it for myself In short my being the sum is a living in the heaven of thought of mind a cogitare But I myself am nothing else than mind thinking mind according to Descartes believing mind according to Luther My body I am not my flesh may suffer from appetites or pains I am not my flesh but I am mind only mind This thought runs through the history of the Reformation till to day Only by the more modern philosophy since Descartes has a serious effort been made to bring Christianity to complete efficacy by exalting the scientific consciousness to be the only true and valid one Hence it begins with absolute doubt dubitare with grinding common consciousness to atoms with turning away from everything that mind thought does not legitimate To it Nature counts for nothing the opinion of men their human precepts for nothing and it does not rest till it has brought reason into everything and can say The real is the rational and only the rational is the real Thus it has at last brought mind reason to victory and everything is mind because everything is rational because all nature as well as even the perversest opinions of men contains reason for all must serve for the best i e lead to the victory of reason Descartes s dubitare contains the decided statement that only cogitare thought mind is A complete break with common consciousness which ascribes reality to irrational things Only the rational is only mind is This is the principle of modern philosophy the genuine Christian principle Descartes in his own time discriminated the body sharply from the mind and the spirit tis that builds itself the body says Goethe But this philosophy itself Christian philosophy still does not get rid of the rational and therefore inveighs against the merely subjective against fancies fortuities arbitrariness et cetera What it wants is that the divine should become visible in everything and all consciousness become a knowing of the divine and man behold God everywhere but God never is without the devil For this very reason the name of philosopher is not to be given to him who has indeed open eyes for the things of the world a clear and undazzled gaze a correct judgment about the world but who sees in the world just the world in objects only objects and in short everything prosaically as it is but he alone is a philosopher who sees and points out or demonstrates heaven in the world the supernal in the earthly the divine in the mundane The former may be ever so wise there is no getting away from this What wise men see not by their wisdom s art Is practised simply by a childlike heart fifty six It takes this childlike heart this eye for the divine to make a philosopher The first named man has only a common consciousness but he who knows the divine and knows how to tell it has a scientific one On this ground Bacon was turned out of the realm of philosophers And certainly what is called English philosophy seems to have got no further than to the discoveries of so called clear heads such as Bacon and Hume The English did not know how to exalt the simplicity of the childlike heart to philosophic significance did not know how to make philosophers out of childlike hearts This is as much as to say their philosophy was not able to become theological or theology and yet it is only as theology that it can really live itself out complete itself The field of its battle to the death is in theology Bacon did not trouble himself about theological questions and cardinal points Cognition has its object in life German thought seeks more than that of others to reach the beginnings and fountain heads of life and sees no life till it sees it in cognition itself Descartes s cogito ergo sum has the meaning One lives only when one thinks Thinking life is called intellectual life Only mind lives its life is the true life Then just so in nature only the eternal laws the mind or the reason of nature are its true life In man as in nature only the thought lives everything else is dead To this abstraction to the life of generalities or of that which is lifeless the history of mind had to come God who is spirit alone lives Nothing lives but the ghost How can one try to assert of modern philosophy or modern times that they have reached freedom since they have not freed us from the power of objectivity Or am I perhaps free from a despot when I am not afraid of the personal potentate to be sure but of every infraction of the loving reverence which I fancy I owe him The case is the same with modern times They only changed the existing objects the real ruler et cetera into conceived objects i e into ideas before which the old respect not only was not lost but increased in intensity Even if people snapped their fingers at God and the devil in their former crass reality people devoted only the greater attention to their ideas They are rid of the Evil One evil is left fifty seven The decision having once been made not to let oneself be imposed on any longer by the extant and palpable little scruple was felt about revolting against the existing State or overturning the existing laws but to sin against the idea of the State not to submit to the idea of law who would have dared that So one remained a citizen and a law respecting loyal man yes one seemed to himself to be only so much more law respecting the more rationalistically one abrogated the former defective law in order to do homage to the spirit of the law In all this the objects had only suffered a change of form they had remained in their prepollence and pre eminence in short one was still involved in obedience and possessedness lived in refection and had an object on which one reflected which one respected and before which one felt reverence and fear One had done nothing but transform the things into conceptions of the things into thoughts and ideas whereby one s dependence became all the more intimate and indissoluble So e g it is not hard to emancipate oneself from the commands of parents or to set aside the admonitions of uncle and aunt the entreaties of brother and sister but the renounced obedience easily gets into one s conscience and the less one does give way to the individual demands because he rationalistically by his own reason recognizes them to be unreasonable so much the more conscientiously does he hold fast to filial piety and family love and so much the harder is it for him to forgive himself a trespass against the conception which he has formed of family love and of filial duty Released from dependence as regards the existing family one falls into the more binding dependence on the idea of the family one is ruled by the spirit of the family The family consisting of John Maggie et cetera whose dominion has become powerless is only internalized being left as family in general to which one just applies the old saying We must obey God rather than man whose significance here is this I cannot to be sure accommodate myself to your senseless requirements but as my family you still remain the object of my love and care for the family is a sacred idea which the individual must never offend against And this family internalized and desensualized into a thought a conception now ranks as the sacred whose despotism is tenfold more grievous because it makes a racket in my conscience This despotism is broken only when the conception family also becomes a nothing to me The Christian dicta Woman what have I to do with thee fifty eight I am come to stir up a man against his father and a daughter against her mother fifty nine and others are accompanied by something that refers us to the heavenly or true family and mean no more than the State s demand in case of a collision between it and the family that we obey its commands The case of morality is like that of the family Many a man renounces morals but with great difficulty the conception morality Morality is the idea of morals their intellectual power their power over the conscience on the other hand morals are too material to rule the mind and do not fetter an intellectual man a so called independent a freethinker The Protestant may put it as he will the holy sixty Scripture the Word of God still remains sacred sixty one for him He for whom this is no longer holy has ceased to be a Protestant But herewith what is ordained in it the public authorities appointed by God et cetera also remain sacred for him For him these things remain indissoluble unapproachable raised above all doubt and as doubt which in practice becomes a buffeting is what is most man s own these things remain raised above himself He who cannot get away from them will believe for to believe in them is to be bound to them Through the fact that in Protestantism the faith became a more inward faith the servitude has also become a more inward servitude one has taken those sanctities up into himself entwined them with all his thoughts and endeavors made them a matter of conscience constructed out of them a sacred duty for himself Therefore what the Protestant s conscience cannot get away from is sacred to him and conscientiousness most clearly designates his character Protestantism has actually put a man in the position of a country governed by secret police The spy and eavesdropper conscience watches over every motion of the mind and all thought and action is for it a matter of conscience i e police business This tearing apart of man into natural impulse and conscience inner populace and inner police is what constitutes the Protestant The reason of the Bible in place of the Catholic reason of the church ranks as sacred and this feeling and consciousness that the word of the Bible is sacred is called conscience With this then sacredness is laid upon one s conscience If one does not free himself from conscience the consciousness of the sacred he may act unconscientiously indeed but never consciencelessly The Catholic finds himself satisfied when he fulfils the command the Protestant acts according to his best judgment and conscience For the Catholic is only a layman the Protestant is himself a clergyman sixty two Just this is the progress of the Reformation period beyond the Middle Ages and at the same time its curse that the spiritual became complete What else was the Jesuit moral philosophy than a continuation of the sale of indulgences only that the man who was relieved of his burden of sin now gained also an insight into the remission of sins and convinced himself how really his sin was taken from him since in this or that particular case Casuists it was so clearly no sin at all that he committed The sale of indulgences had made all sins and transgressions permissible and silenced every movement of conscience All sensuality might hold sway if it was only purchased from the church This favoring of sensuality was continued by the Jesuits while the strictly moral dark fanatical repentant contrite praying Protestants as the true completers of Christianity to be sure acknowledged only the intellectual and spiritual man Catholicism especially the Jesuits gave aid to egoism in this way found involuntary and unconscious adherents within Protestantism itself and saved us from the subversion and extinction of sensuality Nevertheless the Protestant spirit spreads its dominion farther and farther and as beside it the divine the Jesuit spirit represents only the diabolic which is inseparable from everything divine the latter can never assert itself alone but must look on and see how in France e g the Philistinism of Protestantism wins at last and mind is on top Protestantism is usually complimented on having brought the mundane into repute again e g marriage the State et cetera But the mundane itself as mundane the secular is even more indifferent to it than to Catholicism which lets the profane world stand yes and relishes its pleasures while the rational consistent Protestant sets about annihilating the mundane altogether and that simply by hallowing it So marriage has been deprived of its naturalness by becoming sacred not in the sense of the Catholic sacrament where it only receives its consecration from the church and so is unholy at bottom but in the sense of being something sacred in itself to begin with a sacred relation Just so the State et cetera Formerly the pope gave consecration and his blessing to it and its princes now the State is intrinsically sacred majesty is sacred without needing the priest s blessing The order of nature or natural law was altogether hallowed as God s ordinance Hence it is said e g in the Augsburg Confession Art eleven So now we reasonably abide by the saying as the jurisconsults have wisely and rightly said that man and woman should be with each other is a natural law Now if it is a natural law then it is God s ordinance therefore implanted in nature and therefore a divine law also And is it anything more than Protestantism brought up to date when Feuerbach pronounces moral relations sacred not as God s ordinance indeed but instead for the sake of the spirit that dwells in them But marriage as a free alliance of love of course is sacred of itself by the nature of the union that is formed here That marriage alone is a religious one that is a true one that corresponds to the essence of marriage love And so it is with all moral relations They are ethical are cultivated with a moral mind only where they rank as religious of themselves True friendship is only where the limits of friendship are preserved with religious conscientiousness with the same conscientiousness with which the believer guards the dignity of his God Friendship is and must be sacred for you and property and marriage and the good of every man but sacred in and of itself sixty three That is a very essential consideration In Catholicism the mundane can indeed be consecrated or hallowed but it is not sacred without this priestly blessing in Protestantism on the contrary mundane relations are sacred of themselves sacred by their mere existence The Jesuit maxim the end hallows the means corresponds precisely to the consecration by which sanctity is bestowed No means are holy or unholy in themselves but their relation to the church their use for the church hallows the means Regicide was named as such if it was committed for the church s behoof it could be certain of being hallowed by the church even if the hallowing was not openly pronounced To the Protestant majesty ranks as sacred to the Catholic only that majesty which is consecrated by the pontiff can rank as such and it does rank as such to him only because the pope even though it be without a special act confers this sacredness on it once for all If he retracted his consecration the king would be left only a man of the world or layman an unconsecrated man to the Catholic If the Protestant seeks to discover a sacredness in the sensual itself that he may then be linked only to what is holy the Catholic strives rather to banish the sensual from himself into a separate domain where it like the rest of nature keeps its value for itself The Catholic church eliminated mundane marriage from its consecrated order and withdrew those who were its own from the mundane family the Protestant church declared marriage and family ties to be holy and therefore not unsuitable for its clergymen A Jesuit may as a good Catholic hallow everything He needs only e g to say to himself I as a priest am necessary to the church but serve it more zealously when I appease my desires properly consequently I will seduce this girl have my enemy there poisoned et cetera my end is holy because it is a priest s consequently it hallows the means For in the end it is still done for the benefit of the church Why should the Catholic priest shrink from handing Emperor Henry VII the poisoned wafer for the church s welfare The genuinely churchly Protestants inveighed against every innocent pleasure because only the sacred the spiritual could be innocent What they could not point out the holy spirit in the Protestants had to reject dancing the theatre ostentation e g in the church and the like Compared with this puritanical Calvinism Lutheranism is again more on the religious i e spiritual track is more radical For the former excludes at once a great number of things as sensual and worldly and purifies the church Lutheranism on the contrary tries to bring spirit into all things as far as possible to recognize the holy spirit as an essence in everything and so to hallow everything worldly No one can forbid a kiss in honor The spirit of honor hallows it Hence it was that the Lutheran Hegel he declares himself such in some passage or other he wants to remain a Lutheran was completely successful in carrying the idea through everything In everything there is reason i e holy spirit or the real is rational For the real is in fact everything as in each thing e g each lie the truth can be detected there is no absolute lie no absolute evil and the like Great works of mind were created almost solely by Protestants as they alone were the true disciples and consummators of mind How little man is able to control He must let the sun run its course the sea roll its waves the mountains rise to heaven Thus he stands powerless before the uncontrollable Can he keep off the impression that he is helpless against this gigantic world It is a fixed law to which he must submit it determines his fate Now what did pre Christian humanity work toward Toward getting rid of the irruptions of the destinies not letting oneself be vexed by them The Stoics attained this in apathy declaring the attacks of nature indifferent and not letting themselves be affected by them Horace utters the famous Nil admirari by which he likewise announces the indifference of the other the world it is not to influence us not to arouse our astonishment And that impavidum ferient ruinae expresses the very same imperturbability as Ps forty six point three We do not fear though the earth should perish In all this there is room made for the Christian proposition that the world is empty for the Christian contempt of the world The imperturbable spirit of the wise man with which the old world worked to prepare its end now underwent an inner perturbation against which no ataraxy no Stoic courage was able to protect it The spirit secured against all influence of the world insensible to its shocks and exalted above its attacks admiring nothing not to be disconcerted by any downfall of the world foamed over irrepressibly again because gases spirits were evolved in its own interior and after the mechanical shock that comes from without had become ineffective chemical tensions that agitate within began their wonderful play In fact ancient history ends with this that I have struggled till I won my ownership of the world All things have been delivered to me by my Father Matt eleven point twenty seven It has ceased to be overpowering unapproachable sacred divine et cetera for me it is undeified and now I treat it so entirely as I please that if I cared I could exert on it all miracle working power i e power of mind remove mountains command mulberry trees to tear themselves up and transplant themselves into the sea Luke seventeen point six and do everything possible i e thinkable All things are possible to him who believes sixty four I am the lord of the world mine is the glory sixty five The world has become prosaic for the divine has vanished from it it is my property which I dispose of as I to wit the mind choose When I had exalted myself to be the owner of the world egoism had won its first complete victory had vanquished the world had become worldless and put the acquisitions of a long age under lock and key The first property the first glory has been acquired But the lord of the world is not yet lord of his thoughts his feelings his will he is not lord and owner of the spirit for the spirit is still sacred the Holy Spirit and the worldless Christian is not able to become godless If the ancient struggle was a struggle against the world the mediaeval Christian struggle is a struggle against self the mind the former against the outer world the latter against the inner world The mediaeval man is the man whose gaze is turned inward the thinking meditative man All wisdom of the ancients is the science of the world all wisdom of the moderns is the science of God The heathen Jews included got through with the world but now the thing was to get through with self the spirit too i e to become spiritless or godless For almost two thousand years we have been working at subjecting the Holy Spirit to ourselves and little by little we have torn off and trodden under foot many bits of sacredness but the gigantic opponent is constantly rising anew under a changed form and name The spirit has not yet lost its divinity its holiness its sacredness To be sure it has long ceased to flutter over our heads as a dove to be sure it no longer gladdens its saints alone but lets itself be caught by the laity too et cetera but as spirit of humanity as spirit of Man it remains still an alien spirit to me or you still far from becoming our unrestricted property which we dispose of at our pleasure However one thing certainly happened and visibly guided the progress of post Christian history this one thing was the endeavor to make the Holy Spirit more human and bring it nearer to men or men to it Through this it came about that at last it could be conceived as the spirit of humanity and under different expressions like idea of humanity mankind humaneness general philanthropy et cetera appeared more attractive more familiar and more accessible Would not one think that now everybody could possess the Holy Spirit take up into himself the idea of humanity bring mankind to form and existence in himself No the spirit is not stripped of its holiness and robbed of its unapproachableness is not accessible to us not our property for the spirit of humanity is not my spirit My ideal it may be and as a thought I call it mine the thought of humanity is my property and I prove this sufficiently by propounding it quite according to my views and shaping it to day so to morrow otherwise we represent it to ourselves in the most manifold ways But it is at the same time an entail which I cannot alienate nor get rid of Among many transformations the Holy Spirit became in time the absolute idea which again in manifold refractions split into the different ideas of philanthropy reasonableness civic virtue et cetera But can I call the idea my property if it is the idea of humanity and can I consider the Spirit as vanquished if I am to serve it sacrifice myself to it Antiquity at its close had gained its ownership of the world only when it had broken the world s overpoweringness and divinity recognized the world s powerlessness and vanity The case with regard to the spirit corresponds When I have degraded it to a spook and its control over me to a cranky notion then it is to be looked upon as having lost its sacredness its holiness its divinity and then I use it as one uses nature at pleasure without scruple The nature of the case the concept of the relationship is to guide me in dealing with the case or in contracting the relation As if a concept of the case existed on its own account and was not rather the concept that one forms of the case As if a relation which we enter into was not by the uniqueness of those who enter into it itself unique As if it depended on how others stamp it But as people separated the essence of Man from the real man and judged the latter by the former so they also separate his action from him and appraise it by human value Concepts are to decide everywhere concepts to regulate life concepts to rule This is the religious world to which Hegel gave a systematic expression bringing method into the nonsense and completing the conceptual precepts into a rounded firmly based dogmatic Everything is sung according to concepts and the real man i e I am compelled to live according to these conceptual laws Can there be a more grievous dominion of law and did not Christianity confess at the very beginning that it meant only to draw Judaism s dominion of law tighter Not a letter of the law shall be lost Liberalism simply brought other concepts on the carpet viz human instead of divine political instead of ecclesiastical scientific instead of doctrinal or more generally real concepts and eternal laws instead of crude dogmas and precepts Now nothing but mind rules in the world An innumerable multitude of concepts buzz about in people s heads and what are those doing who endeavor to get further They are negating these concepts to put new ones in their place They are saying You form a false concept of right of the State of man of liberty of truth of marriage et cetera the concept of right et cetera is rather that one which we now set up Thus the confusion of concepts moves forward The history of the world has dealt cruelly with us and the spirit has obtained an almighty power You must have regard for my miserable shoes which could protect your naked foot my salt by which your potatoes would become palatable and my state carriage whose possession would relieve you of all need at once you must not reach out after them Man is to recognize the independence of all these and innumerable other things they are to rank in his mind as something that cannot be seized or approached are to be kept away from him He must have regard for it respect it woe to him if he stretches out his fingers desirously we call that being light fingered How beggarly little is left us yes how really nothing Everything has been removed we must not venture on anything unless it is given us we continue to live only by the grace of the giver You must not pick up a pin unless indeed you have got leave to do so And got it from whom From respect Only when this lets you have it as property only when you can respect it as property only then may you take it And again you are not to conceive a thought speak a syllable commit an action that should have their warrant in you alone instead of receiving it from morality or reason or humanity Happy unconstraint of the desirous man how mercilessly people have tried to slay you on the altar of constraint But around the altar rise the arches of a church and its walls keep moving further and further out What they enclose is sacred You can no longer get to it no longer touch it Shrieking with the hunger that devours you you wander round about these walls in search of the little that is profane and the circles of your course keep growing more and more extended Soon that church will embrace the whole world and you be driven out to the extreme edge another step and the world of the sacred has conquered you sink into the abyss Therefore take courage while it is yet time wander about no longer in the profane where now it is dry feeding dare the leap and rush in through the gates into the sanctuary itself If you devour the sacred you have made it your own Digest the sacramental wafer and you are rid of it III THE FREE The ancients and the moderns having been presented above in two divisions it may seem as if the free were here to be described in a third division as independent and distinct This is not so The free are only the more modern and most modern among the moderns and are put in a separate division merely because they belong to the present and what is present above all claims our attention here I give the free only as a translation of the liberals but must with regard to the concept of freedom as in general with regard to so many other things whose anticipatory introduction cannot be avoided refer to what comes later Sec one POLITICAL LIBERALISM After the chalice of so called absolute monarchy had been drained down to the dregs in the eighteenth century people became aware that their drink did not taste human too clearly aware not to begin to crave a different cup Since our fathers were human beings after all they at last desired also to be regarded as such Whoever sees in us something else than human beings in him we likewise will not see a human being but an inhuman being and will meet him as an unhuman being on the other hand whoever recognizes us as human beings and protects us against the danger of being treated inhumanly him we will honor as our true protector and guardian Let us then hold together and protect the man in each other then we find the necessary protection in our holding together and in ourselves those who hold together a fellowship of those who know their human dignity and hold together as human beings Our holding together is the State we who hold together are the nation In our being together as nation or State we are only human beings How we deport ourselves in other respects as individuals and what self seeking impulses we may there succumb to belongs solely to our private life our public or State life is a purely human one Everything un human or egoistic that clings to us is degraded to a private matter and we distinguish the State definitely from civil society which is the sphere of egoism s activity The true man is the nation but the individual is always an egoist Therefore strip off your individuality or isolation wherein dwells discord and egoistic inequality and consecrate yourselves wholly to the true man the nation or the State Then you will rank as men and have all that is man s the State the true man will entitle you to what belongs to it and give you the rights of man Man gives you his rights So runs the speech of the commonalty The commonalty sixty six is nothing else than the thought that the State is all in all the true man and that the individual s human value consists in being a citizen of the State In being a good citizen he seeks his highest honor beyond that he knows nothing higher than at most the antiquated being a good Christian The commonalty developed itself in the struggle against the privileged classes by whom it was cavalierly treated as third estate and confounded with the canaille In other words up to this time the State had recognized caste sixty seven The son of a nobleman was selected for posts to which the most distinguished commoners aspired in vain et cetera The civic feeling revolted against this No more distinction no giving preference to persons no difference of classes Let all be alike No separate interest is to be pursued longer but the general interest of all The State is to be a fellowship of free and equal men and every one is to devote himself to the welfare of the whole to be dissolved in the State to make the State his end and ideal State State so ran the general cry and thenceforth people sought for the right form of State the best constitution and so the State in its best conception The thought of the State passed into all hearts and awakened enthusiasm to serve it this mundane god became the new divine service and worship The properly political epoch had dawned To serve the State or the nation became the highest ideal the State s interest the highest interest State service for which one does not by any means need to be an official the highest honor So then the separate interests and personalities had been scared away and sacrifice for the State had become the shibboleth One must give up himself and live only for the State One must act disinterestedly not want to benefit himself but the State Hereby the latter has become the true person before whom the individual personality vanishes not I live but it lives in me Therefore in comparison with the former self seeking this was unselfishness and impersonality itself Before this god State all egoism vanished and before it all were equal they were without any other distinction men nothing but men The Revolution took fire from the inflammable material of property The government needed money Now it must prove the proposition that it is absolute and so master of all property sole proprietor it must take to itself its money which was only in the possession of the subjects not their property Instead of this it calls States general to have this money granted to it The shrinking from strictly logical action destroyed the illusion of an absolute government he who must have something granted to him cannot be regarded as absolute The subjects recognized that they were real proprietors and that it was their money that was demanded Those who had hitherto been subjects attained the consciousness that they were proprietors Bailly depicts this in a few words If you cannot dispose of my property without my assent how much less can you of my person of all that concerns my mental and social position All this is my property like the piece of land that I till and I have a right an interest to make the laws myself Bailly s words sound certainly as if every one was a proprietor now However instead of the government instead of the prince the nation now became proprietor and master From this time on the ideal is spoken of as popular liberty a free people et cetera As early as July eight seventeen eighty nine the declaration of the bishop of Autun and Barrere took away all semblance of the importance of each and every individual in legislation it showed the complete powerlessness of the constituents the majority of the representatives has become master When on July nine the plan for division of the work on the constitution is proposed Mirabeau remarks that the government has only power no rights only in the people is the source of all right to be found On July sixteen this same Mirabeau exclaims Is not the people the source of all power The source therefore of all right and the source of all power sixty eight By the way here the substance of right becomes visible it is power He who has power has right The commonalty is the heir of the privileged classes In fact the rights of the barons which were taken from them as usurpations only passed over to the commonalty For the commonalty was now called the nation Into the hands of the nation all prerogatives were given back Thereby they ceased to be prerogatives sixty nine they became rights seventy From this time on the nation demands tithes compulsory services it has inherited the lord s court the rights of vert and venison the serfs The night of August four was the death night of privileges or prerogatives cities communes boards of magistrates were also privileged furnished with prerogatives and seigniorial rights and ended with the new morning of right the rights of the State the rights of the nation The monarch in the person of the royal master had been a paltry monarch compared with this new monarch the sovereign nation This monarchy was a thousand times severer stricter and more consistent Against the new monarch there was no longer any right any privilege at all how limited the absolute king of the ancien regime looks in comparison The Revolution effected the transformation of limited monarchy into absolute monarchy From this time on every right that is not conferred by this monarch is an assumption but every prerogative that he bestows a right The times demanded absolute royalty absolute monarchy therefore down fell that so called absolute royalty which had so little understood how to become absolute that it remained limited by a thousand little lords What was longed for and striven for through thousands of years to wit to find that absolute lord beside whom no other lords and lordlings any longer exist to clip his power the bourgeoisie has brought to pass It has revealed the Lord who alone confers rightful titles and without whose warrant nothing is justified So now we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other god save the one seventy one Against right one can no longer as against a right come forward with the assertion that it is a wrong One can say now only that it is a piece of nonsense an illusion If one called it wrong one would have to set up another right in opposition to it and measure it by this If on the contrary one rejects right as such right in and of itself altogether then one also rejects the concept of wrong and dissolves the whole concept of right to which the concept of wrong belongs What is the meaning of the doctrine that we all enjoy equality of political rights Only this that the State has no regard for my person that to it I like every other am only a man without having another significance that commands its deference I do not command its deference as an aristocrat a nobleman s son or even as heir of an official whose office belongs to me by inheritance as in the Middle Ages countships et cetera and later under absolute royalty where hereditary offices occur Now the State has an innumerable multitude of rights to give away e g the right to lead a battalion a company et cetera the right to lecture at a university and so forth it has them to give away because they are its own i e State rights or political rights Withal it makes no difference to it to whom it gives them if the receiver only fulfils the duties that spring from the delegated rights To it we are all of us all right and equal one worth no more and no less than another It is indifferent to me who receives the command of the army says the sovereign State provided the grantee understands the matter properly Equality of political rights has consequently the meaning that every one may acquire every right that the State has to give away if only he fulfils the conditions annexed thereto conditions which are to be sought only in the nature of the particular right not in a predilection for the person persona grata the nature of the right to become an officer brings with it e g the necessity that one possess sound limbs and a suitable measure of knowledge but it does not have noble birth as a condition if on the other hand even the most deserving commoner could not reach that station then an inequality of political rights would exist Among the States of to day one has carried out that maxim of equality more another less The monarchy of estates so I will call absolute royalty the time of the kings before the revolution kept the individual in dependence on a lot of little monarchies These were fellowships societies like the guilds the nobility the priesthood the burgher class cities communes et cetera Everywhere the individual must regard himself first as a member of this little society and yield unconditional obedience to its spirit the esprit de corps as his monarch More e g than the individual nobleman himself must his family the honor of his race be to him Only by means of his corporation his estate did the individual have relation to the greater corporation the State as in Catholicism the individual deals with God only through the priest To this the third estate now showing courage to negate itself as an estate made an end It decided no longer to be and be called an estate beside other estates but to glorify and generalize itself into the nation Hereby it created a much more complete and absolute monarchy and the entire previously ruling principle of estates the principle of little monarchies inside the great went down Therefore it cannot be said that the Revolution was a revolution against the first two privileged estates it was against the little monarchies of estates in general But if the estates and their despotism were broken the king too we know was only a king of estates not a citizen king the individuals freed from the inequality of estate were left Were they now really to be without estate and out of gear no longer bound by any estate without a general bond of union No for the third estate had declared itself the nation only in order not to remain an estate beside other estates but to become the sole estate This sole estate is the nation the State What had the individual now become A political Protestant for he had come into immediate connection with his God the State He was no longer as an aristocrat in the monarchy of the nobility as a mechanic in the monarchy of the guild but he like all recognized and acknowledged only one lord the State as whose servants they all received the equal title of honor citizen The bourgeoisie is the aristocracy of DESERT its motto Let desert wear its crowns It fought against the lazy aristocracy for according to it the industrious aristocracy acquired by industry and desert it is not the born who is free nor yet I who am free either but the deserving man the honest servant of his king of the State of the people in constitutional States Through service one acquires freedom i e acquires deserts even if one served mammon One must deserve well of the State i e of the principle of the State of its moral spirit He who serves this spirit of the State is a good citizen let him live to whatever honest branch of industry he will In its eyes innovators practise a breadless art Only the shopkeeper is practical and the spirit that chases after public offices is as much the shopkeeping spirit as is that which tries in trade to feather its nest or otherwise to become useful to itself and anybody else But if the deserving count as the free for what does the comfortable commoner the faithful office holder lack of that freedom that his heart desires then the servants are the free The obedient servant is the free man What glaring nonsense Yet this is the sense of the bourgeoisie and its poet Goethe as well as its philosopher Hegel succeeded in glorifying the dependence of the subject on the object obedience to the objective world et cetera He who only serves the cause devotes himself entirely to it has the true freedom And among thinkers the cause was reason that which like State and Church gives general laws and puts the individual man in irons by the thought of humanity It determines what is true according to which one must then act No more rational people than the honest servants who primarily are called good citizens as servants of the State Be rich as Croesus or poor as Job the State of the commonalty leaves that to your option but only have a good disposition This it demands of you and counts it its most urgent task to establish this in all Therefore it will keep you from evil promptings holding the ill disposed in check and silencing their inflammatory discourses under censors cancelling marks or press penalties and behind dungeon walls and will on the other hand appoint people of good disposition as censors and in every way have a moral influence exerted on you by well disposed and well meaning people If it has made you deaf to evil promptings then it opens your ears again all the more diligently to good promptings With the time of the bourgeoisie begins that of liberalism People want to see what is rational suited to the times et cetera established everywhere The following definition of liberalism which is supposed to be pronounced in its honor characterizes it completely Liberalism is nothing else than the knowledge of reason applied to our existing relations seventy two Its aim is a rational order a moral behavior a limited freedom not anarchy lawlessness selfhood But if reason rules then the person succumbs Art has for a long time not only acknowledged the ugly but considered the ugly as necessary to its existence and taken it up into itself it needs the villain et cetera In the religious domain too the extremest liberals go so far that they want to see the most religious man regarded as a citizen i e the religious villain they want to see no more of trials for heresy But against the rational law no one is to rebel otherwise he is threatened with the severest penalty What is wanted is not free movement and realization of the person or of me but of reason i e a dominion of reason a dominion The liberals are zealots not exactly for the faith for God et cetera but certainly for reason their master They brook no lack of breeding and therefore no self development and self determination they play the guardian as effectively as the most absolute rulers Political liberty what are we to understand by that Perhaps the individual s independence of the State and its laws No on the contrary the individual s subjection in the State and to the State s laws But why liberty Because one is no longer separated from the State by intermediaries but stands in direct and immediate relation to it because one is a citizen not the subject of another not even of the king as a person but only in his quality as supreme head of the State Political liberty this fundamental doctrine of liberalism is nothing but a second phase of Protestantism and runs quite parallel with religious liberty seventy three Or would it perhaps be right to understand by the latter an independence of religion Anything but that Independence of intermediaries is all that it is intended to express independence of mediating priests the abolition of the laity and so direct and immediate relation to religion or to God Only on the supposition that one has religion can he enjoy freedom of religion freedom of religion does not mean being without religion but inwardness of faith unmediated intercourse with God To him who is religiously free religion is an affair of the heart it is to him his own affair it is to him a sacredly serious matter So too to the politically free man the State is a sacredly serious matter it is his heart s affair his chief affair his own affair Political liberty means that the polis the State is free freedom of religion that religion is free as freedom of conscience signifies that conscience is free not therefore that I am free from the State from religion from conscience or that I am rid of them It does not mean my liberty but the liberty of a power that rules and subjugates me it means that one of my despots like State religion conscience is free State religion conscience these despots make me a slave and their liberty is my slavery That in this they necessarily follow the principle the end hallows the means is self evident If the welfare of the State is the end war is a hallowed means if justice is the State s end homicide is a hallowed means and is called by its sacred name execution et cetera the sacred State hallows everything that is serviceable to it Individual liberty over which civic liberalism keeps jealous watch does not by any means signify a completely free self determination by which actions become altogether mine but only independence of persons Individually free is he who is responsible to no man Taken in this sense and we are not allowed to understand it otherwise not only the ruler is individually free i e irresponsible toward men before God we know he acknowledges himself responsible but all who are responsible only to the law This kind of liberty was won through the revolutionary movement of the century to wit independence of arbitrary will of tel est notre plaisir Hence the constitutional prince must himself be stripped of all personality deprived of all individual decision that he may not as a person as an individual man violate the individual liberty of others The personal will of the ruler has disappeared in the constitutional prince it is with a right feeling therefore that absolute princes resist this Nevertheless these very ones profess to be in the best sense Christian princes For this however they must become a purely spiritual power as the Christian is subject only to spirit God is spirit The purely spiritual power is consistently represented only by the constitutional prince he who without any personal significance stands there spiritualized to the degree that he can rank as a sheer uncanny spirit as an idea The constitutional king is the truly Christian king the genuine consistent carrying out of the Christian principle In the constitutional monarchy individual dominion i e a real ruler that wills has found its end here therefore individual liberty prevails independence of every individual dictator of every one who could dictate to me with a tel est notre plaisir It is the completed Christian State life a spiritualized life The behavior of the commonalty is liberal through and through Every personal invasion of another s sphere revolts the civic sense if the citizen sees that one is dependent on the humor the pleasure the will of a man as individual i e as not authorized by a higher power at once he brings his liberalism to the front and shrieks about arbitrariness In fine the citizen asserts his freedom from what is called orders ordonnance No one has any business to give me orders Orders carries the idea that what I am to do is another man s will while law does not express a personal authority of another The liberty of the commonalty is liberty or independence from the will of another person so called personal or individual liberty for being personally free means being only so free that no other person can dispose of mine or that what I may or may not do does not depend on the personal decree of another The liberty of the press for instance is such a liberty of liberalism liberalism fighting only against the coercion of the censorship as that of personal wilfulness but otherwise showing itself extremely inclined and willing to tyrannize over the press by press laws i e the civic liberals want liberty of writing for themselves for as they are law abiding their writings will not bring them under the law Only liberal matter i e only lawful matter is to be allowed to be printed otherwise the press laws threaten press penalties If one sees personal liberty assured one does not notice at all how if a new issue happens to arise the most glaring unfreedom becomes dominant For one is rid of orders indeed and no one has any business to give us orders but one has become so much the more submissive to the law One is enthralled now in due legal form In the citizen State there are only free people who are compelled to thousands of things e g to deference to a confession of faith and the like But what does that amount to Why it is only the State the law not any man that compels them What does the commonalty mean by inveighing against every personal order i e every order not founded on the cause on reason et cetera It is simply fighting in the interest of the cause seventy four against the dominion of persons But the mind s cause is the rational good lawful et cetera that is the good cause The commonalty wants an impersonal ruler Furthermore if the principle is this that only the cause is to rule man to wit the cause of morality the cause of legality et cetera then no personal balking of one by the other may be authorized either as formerly e g the commoner was balked of the aristocratic offices the aristocrat of common mechanical trades et cetera i e free competition must exist Only through the thing seventy five can one balk another e g the rich man balking the impecunious man by money a thing not as a person Henceforth only one lordship the lordship of the State is admitted personally no one is any longer lord of another Even at birth the children belong to the State and to the parents only in the name of the State which e g does not allow infanticide demands their baptism et cetera But all the State s children furthermore are of quite equal account in its eyes civic or political equality and they may see to it themselves how they get along with each other they may compete Free competition means nothing else than that every one can present himself assert himself fight against another Of course the feudal party set itself against this as its existence depended on an absence of competition The contests in the time of the Restoration in France had no other substance than this that the bourgeoisie was struggling for free competition and the feudalists were seeking to bring back the guild system Now free competition has won and against the guild system it had to win See below for the further discussion If the Revolution ended in a reaction this only showed what the Revolution really was For every effort arrives at reaction when it comes to discreet reflection and storms forward in the original action only so long as it is an intoxication an indiscretion Discretion will always be the cue of the reaction because discretion sets limits and liberates what was really wanted i e the principle from the initial unbridledness and unrestrainedness Wild young fellows bumptious students who set aside all considerations are really Philistines since with them as with the latter considerations form the substance of their conduct only that as swaggerers they are mutinous against considerations and in negative relations to them but as Philistines later they give themselves up to considerations and have positive relations to them In both cases all their doing and thinking turns upon considerations but the Philistine is reactionary in relation to the student he is the wild fellow come to discreet reflection as the latter is the unreflecting Philistine Daily experience confirms the truth of this transformation and shows how the swaggerers turn to Philistines in turning gray So too the so called reaction in Germany gives proof that it was only the discreet continuation of the warlike jubilation of liberty The Revolution was not directed against the established but against the establishment in question against a particular establishment It did away with this ruler not with the ruler on the contrary the French were ruled most inexorably it killed the old vicious rulers but wanted to confer on the virtuous ones a securely established position i e it simply set virtue in the place of vice Vice and virtue again are on their part distinguished from each other only as a wild young fellow from a Philistine et cetera To this day the revolutionary principle has gone no farther than to assail only one or another particular establishment i e be reformatory Much as may be improved strongly as discreet progress may be adhered to always there is only a new master set in the old one s place and the overturning is a building up We are still at the distinction of the young Philistine from the old one The Revolution began in bourgeois fashion with the uprising of the third estate the middle class in bourgeois fashion it dries away It was not the individual man and he alone is Man that became free but the citizen the citoyen the political man who for that very reason is not Man but a specimen of the human species and more particularly a specimen of the species Citizen a free citizen In the Revolution it was not the individual who acted so as to affect the world s history but a people the nation the sovereign nation wanted to effect everything A fancied I an idea such as the nation is appears acting i e the individuals contribute themselves as tools of this idea and act as citizens The commonalty has its power and at the same time its limits in the fundamental law of the State in a charter in a legitimate seventy six or just seventy seven prince who himself is guided and rules according to rational laws in short in legality The period of the bourgeoisie is ruled by the British spirit of legality An assembly of provincial estates e g is ever recalling that its authorization goes only so and so far and that it is called at all only through favor and can be thrown out again through disfavor It is always reminding itself of its vocation It is certainly not to be denied that my father begot me but now that I am once begotten surely his purposes in begetting do not concern me a bit and whatever he may have called me to I do what I myself will Therefore even a called assembly of estates the French assembly in the beginning of the Revolution recognized quite rightly that it was independent of the caller It existed and would have been stupid if it did not avail itself of the right of existence but fancied itself dependent as on a father The called one no longer has to ask what did the caller want when he created me but what do I want after I have once followed the call Not the caller not the constituents not the charter according to which their meeting was called out nothing will be to him a sacred inviolable power He is authorized for everything that is in his power he will know no restrictive authorization will not want to be loyal This if any such thing could be expected from chambers at all would give a completely egoistic chamber severed from all navel string and without consideration But chambers are always devout and therefore one cannot be surprised if so much half way or undecided i e hypocritical egoism parades in them The members of the estates are to remain within the limits that are traced for them by the charter by the king s will and the like If they will not or can not do that then they are to step out What dutiful man could act otherwise could put himself his conviction and his will as the first thing who could be so immoral as to want to assert himself even if the body corporate and everything should go to ruin over it People keep carefully within the limits of their authorization of course one must remain within the limits of his power anyhow because no one can do more than he can My power or if it be so powerlessness be my sole limit but authorizations only restraining precepts Should I profess this all subversive view No I am a law abiding citizen The commonalty professes a morality which is most closely connected with its essence The first demand of this morality is to the effect that one should carry on a solid business an honorable trade lead a moral life Immoral to it is the sharper the demirep the thief robber and murderer the gamester the penniless man without a situation the frivolous man The doughty commoner designates the feeling against these immoral people as his deepest indignation All these lack settlement the solid quality of business a solid seemly life a fixed income et cetera in short they belong because their existence does not rest on a secure basis to the dangerous individuals or isolated persons to the dangerous proletariat they are individual bawlers who offer no guarantee and have nothing to lose and so nothing to risk The forming of family ties e g binds a man he who is bound furnishes security can be taken hold of not so the street walker The gamester stakes everything on the game ruins himself and others no guarantee All who appear to the commoner suspicious hostile and dangerous might be comprised under the name vagabonds every vagabondish way of living displeases him For there are intellectual vagabonds too to whom the hereditary dwelling place of their fathers seems too cramped and oppressive for them to be willing to satisfy themselves with the limited space any more instead of keeping within the limits of a temperate style of thinking and taking as inviolable truth what furnishes comfort and tranquillity to thousands they overleap all bounds of the traditional and run wild with their impudent criticism and untamed mania for doubt these extravagating vagabonds They form the class of the unstable restless changeable i e of the proletariat and if they give voice to their unsettled nature are called unruly fellows Such a broad sense has the so called proletariat or pauperism How much one would err if one believed the commonalty to be desirous of doing away with poverty pauperism to the best of its ability On the contrary the good citizen helps himself with the incomparably comforting conviction that the fact is that the good things of fortune are unequally divided and will always remain so according to God s wise decree The poverty which surrounds him in every alley does not disturb the true commoner further than that at most he clears his account with it by throwing an alms or finds work and food for an honest and serviceable fellow But so much the more does he feel his quiet enjoyment clouded by innovating and discontented poverty by those poor who no longer behave quietly and endure but begin to run wild and become restless Lock up the vagabond thrust the breeder of unrest into the darkest dungeon He wants to arouse dissatisfaction and incite people against existing institutions in the State stone him stone him But from these identical discontented ones comes a reasoning somewhat as follows It need not make any difference to the good citizens who protects them and their principles whether an absolute king or a constitutional one a republic et cetera if only they are protected And what is their principle whose protector they always love Not that of labor not that of birth either But that of mediocrity of the golden mean a little birth and a little labor i e an interest bearing possession Possession is here the fixed the given inherited birth interest drawing is the exertion about it labor laboring capital therefore Only no immoderation no ultra no radicalism Right of birth certainly but only hereditary possessions labor certainly yet little or none at all of one s own but labor of capital and of the subject laborers If an age is imbued with an error some always derive advantage from the error while the rest have to suffer from it In the Middle Ages the error was general among Christians that the church must have all power or the supreme lordship on earth the hierarchs believed in this truth not less than the laymen and both were spellbound in the like error But by it the hierarchs had the advantage of power the laymen had to suffer subjection However as the saying goes one learns wisdom by suffering and so the laymen at last learned wisdom and no longer believed in the mediaeval truth A like relation exists between the commonalty and the laboring class Commoner and laborer believe in the truth of money they who do not possess it believe in it no less than those who possess it the laymen therefore as well as the priests Money governs the world is the keynote of the civic epoch A destitute aristocrat and a destitute laborer as starvelings amount to nothing so far as political consideration is concerned birth and labor do not do it but money brings consideration seventy eight The possessors rule but the State trains up from the destitute its servants to whom in proportion as they are to rule govern in its name it gives money a salary I receive everything from the State Have I anything without the State s assent What I have without this it takes from me as soon as it discovers the lack of a legal title Do I not therefore have everything through its grace its assent On this alone on the legal title the commonalty rests The commoner is what he is through the protection of the State through the State s grace He would necessarily be afraid of losing everything if the State s power were broken But how is it with him who has nothing to lose how with the proletarian As he has nothing to lose he does not need the protection of the State for his nothing He may gain on the contrary if that protection of the State is withdrawn from the protege Therefore the non possessor will regard the State as a power protecting the possessor which privileges the latter but does nothing for him the non possessor but to suck his blood The State is a commoners State is the estate of the commonalty It protects man not according to his labor but according to his tractableness loyalty to wit according to whether the rights entrusted to him by the State are enjoyed and managed in accordance with the will i e laws of the State Under the regime of the commonalty the laborers always fall into the hands of the possessors i e of those who have at their disposal some bit of the State domains and everything possessible is State domain belongs to the State and is only a fief of the individual especially money and land of the capitalists therefore The laborer cannot realize on his labor to the extent of the value that it has for the consumer Labor is badly paid The capitalist has the greatest profit from it Well paid and more than well paid are only the labors of those who heighten the splendor and dominion of the State the labors of high State servants The State pays well that its good citizens the possessors may be able to pay badly without danger it secures to itself by good payment its servants out of whom it forms a protecting power a police to the police belong soldiers officials of all kinds e g those of justice education et cetera in short the whole machinery of the State for the good citizens and the good citizens gladly pay high tax rates to it in order to pay so much lower rates to their laborers But the class of laborers because unprotected in what they essentially are for they do not enjoy the protection of the State as laborers but as its subjects they have a share in the enjoyment of the police a so called protection of the law remains a power hostile to this State this State of possessors this citizen kingship Its principle labor is not recognized as to its value it is exploited seventy nine a spoil eighty of the possessors the enemy The laborers have the most enormous power in their hands and if they once became thoroughly conscious of it and used it nothing would withstand them they would only have to stop labor regard the product of labor as theirs and enjoy it This is the sense of the labor disturbances which show themselves here and there The State rests on the slavery of labor If labor becomes free the State is lost Sec two SOCIAL LIBERALISM We are freeborn men and wherever we look we see ourselves made servants of egoists Are we therefore to become egoists too Heaven forbid we want rather to make egoists impossible We want to make them all ragamuffins all of us must have nothing that all may have So say the Socialists Who is this person that you call All It is society But is it corporeal then We are its body You Why you are not a body yourselves you sir are corporeal to be sure you too and you but you all together are only bodies not a body Accordingly the united society may indeed have bodies at its service but no one body of its own Like the nation of the politicians it will turn out to be nothing but a spirit its body only semblance The freedom of man is in political liberalism freedom from persons from personal dominion from the master the securing of each individual person against other persons personal freedom No one has any orders to give the law alone gives orders But even if the persons have become equal yet their possessions have not And yet the poor man needs the rich the rich the poor the former the rich man s money the latter the poor man s labor So no one needs another as a person but needs him as a giver and thus as one who has something to give as holder or possessor So what he has makes the man And in having or in possessions people are unequal Consequently social liberalism concludes no one must have as according to political liberalism no one was to give orders i e as in that case the State alone obtained the command so now society alone obtains the possessions For the State protecting each one s person and property against the other separates them from one another each one is his special part and has his special part He who is satisfied with what he is and has finds this state of things profitable but he who would like to be and have more looks around for this more and finds it in the power of other persons Here he comes upon a contradiction as a person no one is inferior to another and yet one person has what another has not but would like to have So he concludes the one person is more than the other after all for the former has what he needs the latter has not the former is a rich man the latter a poor man He now asks himself further are we to let what we rightly buried come to life again are we to let this circuitously restored inequality of persons pass No on the contrary we must bring quite to an end what was only half accomplished Our freedom from another s person still lacks the freedom from what the other s person can command from what he has in his personal power in short from personal property Let us then do away with personal property Let no one have anything any longer let every one be a ragamuffin Let property be impersonal let it belong to society Before the supreme ruler the sole commander we had all become equal equal persons i e nullities Before the supreme proprietor we all become equal ragamuffins For the present one is still in another s estimation a ragamuffin a have nothing but then this estimation ceases We are all ragamuffins together and as the aggregate of Communistic society we might call ourselves a ragamuffin crew When the proletarian shall really have founded his purposed society in which the interval between rich and poor is to be removed then he will be a ragamuffin for then he will feel that it amounts to something to be a ragamuffin and might lift Ragamuffin to be an honorable form of address just as the Revolution did with the word Citizen Ragamuffin is his ideal we are all to become ragamuffins This is the second robbery of the personal in the interest of humanity Neither command nor property is left to the individual the State took the former society the latter Because in society the most oppressive evils make themselves felt therefore the oppressed especially and consequently the members in the lower regions of society think they find the fault in society and make it their task to discover the right society This is only the old phenomenon that one looks for the fault first in everything but himself and consequently in the State in the self seeking of the rich et cetera which yet have precisely our fault to thank for their existence The reflections and conclusions of Communism look very simple As matters lie at this time in the present situation with regard to the State therefore some and they the majority are at a disadvantage compared to others the minority In this state of things the former are in a state of prosperity the latter in a state of need Hence the present state of things i e the State must be done away with And what in its place Instead of the isolated state of prosperity a general state of prosperity a prosperity of all Through the Revolution the bourgeoisie became omnipotent and all inequality was abolished by every one s being raised or degraded to the dignity of a citizen the common man raised the aristocrat degraded the third estate became sole estate viz the estate of citizens of the State Now Communism responds Our dignity and our essence consist not in our being all the equal children of our mother the State all born with equal claim to her love and her protection but in our all existing for each other This is our equality or herein we are equal in that we I as well as you and you and all of you are active or labor each one for the rest in that each of us is a laborer then The point for us is not what we are for the State viz citizens not our citizenship therefore but what we are for each other viz that each of us exists only through the other who caring for my wants at the same time sees his own satisfied by me He labors e g for my clothing tailor I for his need of amusement comedy writer rope dancer et cetera he for my food farmer et cetera I for his instruction scientist et cetera It is labor that constitutes our dignity and our equality What advantage does citizenship bring us Burdens And how high is our labor appraised As low as possible But labor is our sole value all the same that we are laborers is the best thing about us this is our significance in the world and therefore it must be our consideration too and must come to receive consideration What can you meet us with Surely nothing but labor too Only for labor or services do we owe you a recompense not for your bare existence not for what you are for yourselves either but only for what you are for us By what have you claims on us Perhaps by your high birth et cetera No only by what you do for us that is desirable or useful Be it thus then we are willing to be worth to you only so much as we do for you but you are to be held likewise by us Services determine value i e those services that are worth something to us and consequently labors for each other labors for the common good Let each one be in the other s eyes a laborer He who accomplishes something useful is inferior to none or all laborers laborers of course in the sense of laborers for the common good i e communistic laborers are equal But as the laborer is worth his wages eighty one let the wages too be equal As long as faith sufficed for man s honor and dignity no labor however harassing could be objected to if it only did not hinder a man in his faith Now on the contrary when every one is to cultivate himself into man condemning a man to machine like labor amounts to the same thing as slavery If a factory worker must tire himself to death twelve hours and more he is cut off from becoming man Every labor is to have the intent that the man be satisfied Therefore he must become a master in it too i e be able to perform it as a totality He who in a pin factory only puts on the heads only draws the wire et cetera works as it were mechanically like a machine he remains half trained does not become a master his labor cannot satisfy him it can only fatigue him His labor is nothing taken by itself has no object in itself is nothing complete in itself he labors only into another s hands and is used exploited by this other For this laborer in another s service there is no enjoyment of a cultivated mind at most crude amusements culture you see is barred against him To be a good Christian one needs only to believe and that can be done under the most oppressive circumstances Hence the Christian minded take care only of the oppressed laborers piety their patience submission et cetera Only so long as the downtrodden classes were Christians could they bear all their misery for Christianity does not let their murmurings and exasperation rise Now the hushing of desires is no longer enough but their sating is demanded The bourgeoisie has proclaimed the gospel of the enjoyment of the world of material enjoyment and now wonders that this doctrine finds adherents among us poor it has shown that not faith and poverty but culture and possessions make a man blessed we proletarians understand that too The commonalty freed us from the orders and arbitrariness of individuals But that arbitrariness was left which springs from the conjuncture of situations and may be called the fortuity of circumstances favoring fortune and those favored by fortune still remain When e g a branch of industry is ruined and thousands of laborers become breadless people think reasonably enough to acknowledge that it is not the individual who must bear the blame but that the evil lies in the situation Let us change the situation then but let us change it thoroughly and so that its fortuity becomes powerless and a law Let us no longer be slaves of chance Let us create a new order that makes an end of fluctuations Let this order then be sacred Formerly one had to suit the lords to come to anything after the Revolution the word was Grasp fortune Luck hunting or hazard playing civil life was absorbed in this Then alongside this the demand that he who has obtained something shall not frivolously stake it again Strange and yet supremely natural contradiction Competition in which alone civil or political life unrolls itself is a game of luck through and through from the speculations of the exchange down to the solicitation of offices the hunt for customers looking for work aspiring to promotion and decorations the second hand dealer s petty haggling et cetera If one succeeds in supplanting and outbidding his rivals then the lucky throw is made for it must be taken as a piece of luck to begin with that the victor sees himself equipped with an ability even though it has been developed by the most careful industry against which the others do not know how to rise consequently that no abler ones are found And now those who ply their daily lives in the midst of these changes of fortune without seeing any harm in it are seized with the most virtuous indignation when their own principle appears in naked form and breeds misfortune as hazard playing Hazard playing you see is too clear too barefaced a competition and like every decided nakedness offends honorable modesty The Socialists want to put a stop to this activity of chance and to form a society in which men are no longer dependent on fortune but free In the most natural way in the world this endeavor first utters itself as hatred of the unfortunate against the fortunate i e of those for whom fortune has done little or nothing against those for whom it has done everything But properly the ill feeling is not directed against the fortunate but against fortune this rotten spot of the commonalty As the Communists first declare free activity to be man s essence they like all work day dispositions need a Sunday like all material endeavors they need a God an uplifting and edification alongside their witless labor That the Communist sees in you the man the brother is only the Sunday side of Communism According to the work day side he does not by any means take you as man simply but as human laborer or laboring man The first view has in it the liberal principle in the second illiberality is concealed If you were a lazybones he would not indeed fail to recognize the man in you but would endeavor to cleanse him as a lazy man from laziness and to convert you to the faith that labor is man s destiny and calling Therefore he shows a double face with the one he takes heed that the spiritual man be satisfied with the other he looks about him for means for the material or corporeal man He gives man a twofold post an office of material acquisition and one of spiritual The commonalty had thrown open spiritual and material goods and left it with each one to reach out for them if he liked Communism really procures them for each one presses them upon him and compels him to acquire them It takes seriously the idea that because only spiritual and material goods make us men we must unquestionably acquire these goods in order to be man The commonalty made acquisition free Communism compels to acquisition and recognizes only the acquirer him who practises a trade It is not enough that the trade is free but you must take it up So all that is left for criticism to do is to prove that the acquisition of these goods does not yet by any means make us men With the liberal commandment that every one is to make a man of himself or every one to make himself man there was posited the necessity that every one must gain time for this labor of humanization i e that it should become possible for every one to labor on himself The commonalty thought it had brought this about if it handed over everything human to competition but gave the individual a right to every human thing Each may strive after everything Social liberalism finds that the matter is not settled with the may because may means only it is forbidden to none but not it is made possible to every one Hence it affirms that the commonalty is liberal only with the mouth and in words supremely illiberal in act It on its part wants to give all of us the means to be able to labor on ourselves By the principle of labor that of fortune or competition is certainly outdone But at the same time the laborer in his consciousness that the essential thing in him is the laborer holds himself aloof from egoism and subjects himself to the supremacy of a society of laborers as the commoner clung with self abandonment to the competition State The beautiful dream of a social duty still continues to be dreamed People think again that society gives what we need and we are under obligations to it on that account owe it everything eighty two They are still at the point of wanting to serve a supreme giver of all good That society is no ego at all which could give bestow or grant but an instrument or means from which we may derive benefit that we have no social duties but solely interests for the pursuance of which society must serve us that we owe society no sacrifice but if we sacrifice anything sacrifice it to ourselves of this the Socialists do not think because they as liberals are imprisoned in the religious principle and zealously aspire after a sacred society such as the State was hitherto Society from which we have everything is a new master a new spook a new supreme being which takes us into its service and allegiance The more precise appreciation of political as well as social liberalism must wait to find its place further on For the present we pass this over in order first to summon them before the tribunal of humane or critical liberalism Sec three HUMANE LIBERALISM As liberalism is completed in self criticising critical eighty three liberalism 
6084-2159-0000	train-other-500	in which the critic remains a liberal and does not go beyond the principle of liberalism Man this may distinctively be named after Man and called the humane
6084-2159-0001	train-other-500	The laborer is counted as the most material and egoistical man He does nothing at all for humanity does everything for himself for his welfare The commonalty
6084-2159-0002	train-other-500	because it proclaimed the freedom of Man only as to his birth had to leave him in the claws of the un human man the egoist for the rest of life Hence under the regime of political liberalism
6084-2159-0003	train-other-500	egoism has an immense field for free utilization The laborer will utilize society for his egoistic ends as the commoner does the State
6084-2159-0004	train-other-500	You have only an egoistic end after all your welfare is the humane liberal s reproach to the Socialist take up a purely human interest then I will be your companion
6084-2159-0005	train-other-500	But to this there belongs a consciousness stronger more comprehensive than a laborer consciousness The laborer makes nothing therefore he has nothing but he makes nothing
6084-2159-0006	train-other-500	because his labor is always a labor that remains individual calculated strictly for his own want a labor
none	none	 day by day eighty four In opposition to this one might for instance consider the fact that 
6084-2159-0007	train-other-500	Gutenberg s labor did not remain individual but begot innumerable children and still lives to day it was calculated for the want of humanity and was an eternal
6084-2159-0008	train-other-500	imperishable labor The humane consciousness despises the commoner consciousness as well as the laborer consciousness for the commoner is indignant only at vagabonds
6084-2159-0009	train-other-500	at all who have no definite occupation and their immorality the laborer is disgusted by the idler lazybones and his immoral because parasitic
6084-2159-0010	train-other-500	and unsocial principles To this the humane liberal retorts The unsettledness of many is only your product Philistine But that you proletarian demand the grind of all
6084-2159-0011	train-other-500	and want to make drudgery general is a part still clinging to you of your pack mule life up to this time Certainly you want to lighten drudgery itself by all having to drudge equally hard
6084-2159-0012	train-other-500	yet only for this reason that all may gain leisure to an equal extent But what are they to do with their leisure What does your society do that this leisure may be passed humanly
6084-2159-0013	train-other-500	It must leave the gained leisure to egoistic preference again and the very gain that your society furthers falls to the egoist as the gain of the commonalty
6084-2159-0014	train-other-500	the masterlessness of man could not be filled with a human element by the State and therefore was left to arbitrary choice It is assuredly necessary that man be masterless
6084-2159-0015	train-other-500	but therefore the egoist is not to become master over man again either but man over the egoist Man must assuredly find leisure but if the egoist makes use of it
6084-2159-0016	train-other-500	it will be lost for man therefore you ought to have given leisure a human significance But you laborers undertake even your labor from an egoistic impulse because you want to eat drink
6084-2159-0017	train-other-500	live how should you be less egoists in leisure You labor only because having your time to yourselves idling goes well after work done and what you are to while away your leisure time with
6084-2159-0018	train-other-500	is left to chance But if every door is to be bolted against egoism it would be necessary to strive after completely disinterested action total
6084-2159-0019	train-other-500	disinterestedness This alone is human because only Man is disinterested the egoist always interested
6084-2159-0020	train-other-500	If we let disinterestedness pass unchallenged for a while then we ask do you mean not to take an interest in anything not to be enthusiastic for anything
none	none	 not for liberty humanity et cetera 
6084-2159-0021	train-other-500	Oh yes but that is not an egoistic interest not interestedness but a human
none	none	 i e a 
6084-2159-0022	train-other-500	theoretical interest to wit an interest not for an individual or individuals all but for the idea for Man
6084-2159-0023	train-other-500	And you do not notice that you too are enthusiastic only for your idea your idea of liberty And further do you not notice that your disinterestedness is again like
6084-2159-0024	train-other-500	religious disinterestedness a heavenly interestedness Certainly benefit to the individual leaves you cold and abstractly you could cry
none	none	 fiat libertas pereat mundus You do not take thought for the coming day either 
6084-2159-0025	train-other-500	and take no serious care for the individual s wants anyhow not for your own comfort nor for that of the rest but you make nothing of all this because you are a dreamer
6084-2159-0026	train-other-500	Do you suppose the humane liberal will be so liberal as to aver that everything possible to man is human On the contrary He does not indeed share the Philistine s moral prejudice
none	none	 about the strumpet but that this woman turns her body into a money getting machine eighty five makes her despicable to him as human being 
6084-2159-0027	train-other-500	His judgment is The strumpet is not a human being or So far as a woman is a strumpet
none	none	 so far is she unhuman dehumanized Further The 
6084-2159-0028	train-other-500	Jew the Christian the
none	none	 privileged person the theologian et cetera 
6084-2159-0029	train-other-500	is not a human being so far as you are a Jew et cetera you are not a human being Again the imperious postulate Cast from you everything peculiar criticise it away Be not a Jew
none	none	 not a Christian et cetera but be a human being 
6084-2159-0030	train-other-500	nothing but a human being Assert your humanity against every restrictive specification
6084-2159-0031	train-other-500	make yourself by means of it a human being and free from those limits make yourself a free man
none	none	 i e 
6084-2159-0032	train-other-500	recognize humanity as your all determining essence I say You are indeed more than a Jew
none	none	 more than a Christian et cetera 
6084-2159-0033	train-other-500	but you are also more than a human being Those are all ideas but you are corporeal Do you suppose then that you can ever become a human being as such
6084-2159-0034	train-other-500	Do you suppose our posterity will find no prejudices and limits to clear away for which our powers were not sufficient Or do you perhaps think that in your fortieth or fiftieth year you have come so far
6084-2159-0035	train-other-500	that the following days have nothing more to dissipate in you
none	none	 and that you are a human being 
6084-2159-0036	train-other-500	The men of the future will yet fight their way to many a liberty that we do not even miss What do you need that later liberty for If you meant to esteem yourself as nothing before you had become a human being
6084-2159-0037	train-other-500	you would have to wait till the last judgment till the day when man or humanity shall have attained perfection But as you will surely die before that
6084-2159-0038	train-other-500	what becomes of your prize of victory Rather therefore invert the case and say to yourself I
none	none	 am a human being 
6084-2159-0039	train-other-500	I do not need to begin by producing the human being in myself for he belongs to me already like all my qualities But asks the critic how can one be a Jew and a man at once
6084-2159-0040	train-other-500	In the first place I answer one cannot be either a Jew or a man at all if
none	none	 one and Jew or man are to mean the same 
6084-2159-0041	train-other-500	one always reaches beyond those specifications and let Isaacs be ever so Jewish a Jew nothing but a Jew he cannot be just because he is this Jew
6084-2159-0042	train-other-500	In the second place as a Jew one assuredly cannot be a man if being a man means being nothing special But in the third place and this is the point I can as a Jew
none	none	 be entirely what I can be 
6084-2159-0043	train-other-500	From Samuel or Moses and others you hardly expect that they should have raised themselves above Judaism although you must say that they were not yet men They simply were what they could be Is it otherwise with the Jews of to day
6084-2159-0044	train-other-500	Because you have discovered the idea of humanity does it follow from this that every Jew can become a convert to it If he can he does not fail to and if he fails to he cannot
6084-2159-0045	train-other-500	What does your demand concern him what the call to be a man which you address to him As a universal principle in the human society which the humane liberal promises
none	none	 nothing special which one or another has is to find recognition 
6084-2159-0046	train-other-500	nothing which bears the character of private is to have value In this way the circle of liberalism which has its good principle in man and human liberty its bad in the
6084-2159-0047	train-other-500	egoist and everything private its God in the former its devil in the latter rounds itself off completely and if the special or private person lost his value in the State
6084-2159-0048	train-other-500	no personal prerogative if in the laborers or ragamuffins society special private property is no longer recognized so in human society
6084-2159-0049	train-other-500	everything special or private will be left out of account and when pure criticism shall have accomplished its arduous task then it will be known just what we must look upon as private and what
6084-2159-0050	train-other-500	penetrated with a sense of our nothingness we must let stand Because State and society do not suffice for humane liberalism it negates both and at the same time
6084-2159-0051	train-other-500	retains them So at one time the cry is that the task of the day is not a political but a social one and then again the free State is promised for the future In truth
6084-2159-0052	train-other-500	human society is both the most general State and the most general society Only against the limited State is it asserted that it makes too much stir about spiritual private interests
6084-2159-0053	train-other-500	e g people s religious belief and against limited society that it makes too much of material private interests Both are to leave private interests to private people and
6084-2159-0054	train-other-500	as human society concern themselves solely about general human interests The politicians thinking to abolish personal will self will or arbitrariness
none	none	 did not observe that through property eighty six our self will eighty seven gained a secure place of refuge 
6084-2159-0055	train-other-500	The Socialists taking away property too do not notice that this secures itself a continued existence in self ownership Is it only money and goods then that are a property or is every opinion something of mine
6084-2159-0056	train-other-500	something of my own So every opinion must be abolished or made impersonal The person is entitled to no opinion but as self will was transferred to the State property to society
6084-2159-0057	train-other-500	so opinion too must be transferred to something general Man and thereby become a general human opinion If opinion persists then I have my God why
6084-2159-0058	train-other-500	God exists only as my God he is an opinion or my faith and consequently my faith my religion my thoughts
none	none	 my ideals Therefore a general human faith must come into existence 
6084-2159-0059	train-other-500	the fanaticism of liberty For this would be a faith that agreed with the essence of man and because only man is reasonable you and I might be very unreasonable a reasonable faith
6084-2159-0060	train-other-500	As self will and property become powerless so must self ownership or egoism in general In this supreme development of free man egoism
6084-2159-0061	train-other-500	self ownership is combated on principle and such subordinate ends as the social welfare of the Socialists et cetera vanish before the lofty idea of humanity
6084-2159-0062	train-other-500	Everything that is not a general human entity is something separate satisfies only some or one or if it satisfies all it does this to them only as individuals
6084-2159-0063	train-other-500	not as men and is therefore called egoistic To the Socialists welfare is still the supreme aim as free rivalry was the approved thing to the political liberals
6084-2159-0064	train-other-500	now welfare is free too and we are free to achieve welfare just as he who wanted to enter into rivalry competition
none	none	 was free to do so 
6084-2159-0065	train-other-500	But to take part in the rivalry you need only to be commoners to take part in the welfare only to be laborers Neither reaches the point of being synonymous with man
6084-2159-0066	train-other-500	It is truly well with man only when he is also intellectually free For man is mind therefore
6084-2159-0067	train-other-500	all powers that are alien to him the mind all superhuman heavenly unhuman powers must be overthrown and the name man must be above every name
6084-2159-0068	train-other-500	So in this end of the modern age age of the moderns there returns again as the main point what had been the main point at its beginning intellectual liberty
6084-2159-0069	train-other-500	To the Communist in particular the humane liberal says If society prescribes to you your activity then this is indeed free
none	none	 from the influence of the individual i e the egoist but it still does not on that account 
6084-2159-0070	train-other-500	need to be a purely human activity
none	none	 nor you to be a complete organ of humanity 
6084-2159-0071	train-other-500	What kind of activity society demands of you remains accidental you know it might give you a place in building a temple or something of that sort or even if not that
6084-2159-0072	train-other-500	you might yet on your own impulse be active for something foolish therefore unhuman yes more yet you really labor only to nourish yourself in general to live
6084-2159-0073	train-other-500	for dear life s sake not for the glorification of humanity Consequently free activity is not attained till you make yourself free from all stupidities from everything non human
none	none	 i e 
6084-2159-0074	train-other-500	egoistic pertaining only to the individual not to the Man in the individual dissipate all untrue thoughts that obscure man or the idea of humanity in short
6084-2159-0075	train-other-500	when you are not merely unhampered in your activity but the substance too of your activity is only what is human and you live and work only for humanity
6084-2159-0076	train-other-500	But this is not the case so long as the aim of your effort is only your welfare and that of all what you do for the society of ragamuffins is not yet anything done for human society
6084-2159-0077	train-other-500	Laboring does not alone make you a man because it is something formal and its object accidental the question is who you that labor are
6084-2159-0078	train-other-500	As far as laboring goes you might do it from an egoistic
none	none	 material impulse merely to procure 
6084-2159-0079	train-other-500	nourishment and the like it must be a labor furthering humanity calculated for the good of humanity
none	none	 serving historical i e human evolution 
6084-2159-0080	train-other-500	in short a humane labor This implies two things one that it be useful to humanity next that it be the work of a man
6084-2159-0081	train-other-500	The first alone may be the case with every labor as even the labors of nature e g of animals are utilized by humanity for the furthering of science et cetera the second requires that he who labors
6084-2159-0082	train-other-500	should know the human object of his labor and as he can have this consciousness only when he knows himself as man the crucial condition is self consciousness
none	none	 Unquestionably much is already attained when you cease to be a fragment laborer eighty eight yet 
6084-2159-0083	train-other-500	therewith you only get a view of the whole of your labor
none	none	 and acquire a consciousness about it which is still far removed from a self consciousness a consciousness about your true self 
6084-2159-0084	train-other-500	or essence Man The laborer has still remaining the desire for a higher consciousness which
none	none	 because the activity of labor is unable to quiet it he satisfies in a leisure hour 
6084-2159-0085	train-other-500	Hence leisure stands by the side of his labor and he sees himself compelled to proclaim labor and idling human in one breath yes to attribute the true elevation to the idler
6084-2159-0086	train-other-500	the leisure enjoyer He labors only to get rid of labor he wants to make labor free only that he may be free from labor In fine his work has no satisfying substance
6084-2159-0087	train-other-500	because it is only imposed by society only a stint a task a calling and conversely his society does not satisfy
none	none	 because it gives only 
6084-2159-0088	train-other-500	work His labor ought to satisfy him as a man instead of that it satisfies society society ought to treat him as a man and it treats him as a rag tag laborer or
6084-2159-0089	train-other-500	a laboring ragamuffin Labor and society are of use to him not as he needs them as a man but only as he needs them
none	none	 as an egoist 
6084-2159-0090	train-other-500	Such is the attitude of criticism toward labor It points to mind wages the war
none	none	 of mind with the masses eighty nine and pronounces communistic labor 
6084-2159-0091	train-other-500	unintellectual mass labor Averse to labor as they are the masses love to make labor easy for themselves In literature which is to day furnished in mass
6084-2159-0092	train-other-500	this aversion to labor begets the universally known superficiality which puts from it
none	none	 the toil of research ninety Therefore 
6084-2159-0093	train-other-500	humane liberalism says You want labor all right we want it likewise but we want it in the fullest measure We want it not that we may gain spare time
6084-2159-0094	train-other-500	but that we may find all satisfaction in it itself We want labor because it is our self development But then the labor too must be adapted to that end Man is honored only by human self conscious labor
6084-2159-0095	train-other-500	only by the labor that has for its end no egoistic purpose but Man
none	none	 and is Man s self revelation 
6084-2159-0096	train-other-500	so that the saying should be
none	none	 laboro ergo sum 
6084-2159-0097	train-other-500	I labor therefore I am a man The humane liberal wants that labor of the mind which works up all material he wants the mind that leaves no thing quiet or in its existing condition that
6084-2159-0098	train-other-500	acquiesces in nothing analyzes everything criticises anew every result that has been gained This restless mind is the true laborer it obliterates prejudices shatters limits and narrownesses
6084-2159-0099	train-other-500	and raises man above everything that would like to dominate over him while the Communist labors only for himself and not even freely but from necessity in short
6084-2159-0100	train-other-500	represents a man condemned to hard labor The laborer of such a type is not egoistic because he does not labor for individuals
6084-2159-0101	train-other-500	neither for himself nor for other individuals not for private men therefore but for humanity and its progress he does not ease individual pains does not care for individual wants
none	none	 but removes limits within which 
6084-2159-0102	train-other-500	humanity is pressed dispels prejudices which dominate an entire time vanquishes hindrances that obstruct the path of all clears away errors in which men entangle themselves discovers truths
none	none	 which are found through him for all and for all time in short he lives and labors for humanity Now in the first place the discoverer of a great truth doubtless knows that it can be useful to the rest of men and as a jealous withholding furnishes him no enjoyment he communicates it but even though he has the consciousness that his communication is highly valuable to the rest yet he has in no wise sought and found his truth for the sake of the rest but for his own sake because he himself desired it because darkness and fancies left him no rest till he had procured for himself light and enlightenment to the best of his powers He labors therefore for his own sake and for the satisfaction of his want That along with this he was also useful to others yes to posterity does not take from his labor the egoistic character In the next place if he did labor only on his own account like the rest why should his act be human those of the rest unhuman i e egoistic Perhaps because this book painting symphony et cetera is the labor of his whole being because he has done his best in it has spread himself out wholly and is wholly to be known from it while the work of a handicraftsman mirrors only the handicraftsman i e the skill in handicraft not the man In his poems we have the whole Schiller in so many hundred stoves on the other hand we have before us only the stove maker not the man But does this mean more than in the one work you see me as completely as possible in the other only my skill Is it not me again that the act expresses And is it not more egoistic to offer oneself to the world in a work to work out and shape oneself than to remain concealed behind one s labor You say to be sure that you are revealing Man But the Man that you reveal is you you reveal only yourself yet with this distinction from the handicraftsman that he does not understand how to compress himself into one labor but in order to be known as himself must be searched out in his other relations of life and that your want through whose satisfaction that work came into being was a theoretical want But you will reply that you reveal quite another man a worthier higher greater a man that is more man than that other I will assume that you accomplish all that is possible to man that you bring to pass what no other succeeds in Wherein then does your greatness consist Precisely in this that you are more than other men the masses more than men ordinarily are more than ordinary men precisely in your elevation above men You are distinguished beyond other men not by being man but because you are a unique ninety one man Doubtless you show what a man can do but because you a man do it this by no means shows that others also men are able to do as much you have executed it only as a unique man and are unique therein It is not man that makes up your greatness but you create it because you are more than man and mightier than other men It is believed that one cannot be more than man Rather one cannot be less It is believed further that whatever one attains is good for Man In so far as I remain at all times a man or like Schiller a Swabian like Kant a Prussian like Gustavus Adolphus a near sighted person I certainly become by my superior qualities a notable man Swabian Prussian or near sighted person But the case is not much better with that than with Frederick the Great s cane which became famous for Frederick s sake To Give God the glory corresponds the modern Give Man the glory But I mean to keep it for myself Criticism issuing the summons to man to be human enunciates the necessary condition of sociability for only as a man among men is one companionable Herewith it makes known its social object the establishment of human society Among social theories criticism is indisputably the most complete because it removes and deprives of value everything that separates man from man all prerogatives down to the prerogative of faith In it the love principle of Christianity the true social principle comes to the purest fulfilment and the last possible experiment is tried to take away exclusiveness and repulsion from men a fight against egoism in its simplest and therefore hardest form in the form of singleness ninety two exclusiveness itself How can you live a truly social life so long as even one exclusiveness still exists between you I ask conversely How can you be truly single so long as even one connection still exists between you If you are connected you cannot leave each other if a tie clasps you you are something only with another and twelve of you make a dozen thousands of you a people millions of you humanity Only when you are human can you keep company with each other as men just as you can understand each other as patriots only when you are patriotic All right then I answer Only when you are single can you have intercourse with each other as what you are It is precisely the keenest critic who is hit hardest by the curse of his principle Putting from him one exclusive thing after another shaking off churchliness patriotism et cetera he undoes one tie after another and separates himself from the churchly man from the patriot et cetera till at last when all ties are undone he stands alone He of all men must exclude all that have anything exclusive or private and when you get to the bottom what can be more exclusive than the exclusive single person himself Or does he perhaps think that the situation would be better if all became men and gave up exclusiveness Why for the very reason that all means every individual the most glaring contradiction is still maintained for the individual is exclusiveness itself If the humane liberal no longer concedes to the individual anything private or exclusive any private thought any private folly if he criticises everything away from him before his face since his hatred of the private is an absolute and fanatical hatred if he knows no tolerance toward what is private because everything private is unhuman yet he cannot criticise away the private person himself since the hardness of the individual person resists his criticism and he must be satisfied with declaring this person a private person and really leaving everything private to him again What will the society that no longer cares about anything private do Make the private impossible No but subordinate it to the interests of society and e g leave it to private will to institute holidays as many as it chooses if only it does not come in collision with the general interest ninety three Everything private is left free i e it has no interest for society By their raising of barriers against science the church and religiousness have declared that they are what they always were only that this was hidden under another semblance when they were proclaimed to be the basis and necessary foundation of the State a matter of purely private concern Even when they were connected with the State and made it Christian they were only the proof that the State had not yet developed its general political idea that it was only instituting private rights they were only the highest expression for the fact that the State was a private affair and had to do only with private affairs When the State shall at last have the courage and strength to fulfil its general destiny and to be free when therefore it is also able to give separate interests and private concerns their true position then religion and the church will be free as they have never been hitherto As a matter of the most purely private concern and a satisfaction of purely personal want they will be left to themselves and every individual every congregation and ecclesiastical communion will be able to care for the blessedness of their souls as they choose and as they think necessary Every one will care for his soul s blessedness so far as it is to him a personal want and will accept and pay as spiritual caretaker the one who seems to him to offer the best guarantee for the satisfaction of his want Science is at last left entirely out of the game ninety four What is to happen though Is social life to have an end and all companionableness all fraternization everything that is created by the love or society principle to disappear As if one will not always seek the other because he needs him as if one must not accommodate himself to the other when he needs him But the difference is this that then the individual really unites with the individual while formerly they were bound together by a tie son and father are bound together before majority after it they can come together independently before it they belonged together as members of the family after it they unite as egoists sonship and fatherhood remain but son and father no longer pin themselves down to these The last privilege in truth is Man with it all are privileged or invested For as Bruno Bauer himself says privilege remains even when it is extended to all ninety five Thus liberalism runs its course in the following transformations First the individual is not man therefore his individual personality is of no account no personal will no arbitrariness no orders or mandates Second the individual has nothing human therefore no mine and thine or property is valid Third as the individual neither is man nor has anything human he shall not exist at all he shall as an egoist with his egoistic belongings be annihilated by criticism to make room for Man Man just discovered But although the individual is not Man Man is yet present in the individual and like every spook and everything divine has its existence in him Hence political liberalism awards to the individual everything that pertains to him as a man by birth as a born man among which there are counted liberty of conscience the possession of goods et cetera in short the rights of man Socialism grants to the individual what pertains to him as an active man as a laboring man finally humane liberalism gives the individual what he has as a man i e everything that belongs to humanity Accordingly the single one ninety six has nothing at all humanity everything and the necessity of the regeneration preached in Christianity is demanded unambiguously and in the completest measure Become a new creature become man One might even think himself reminded of the close of the Lord s Prayer To Man belongs the lordship the power or dynamis therefore no individual may be lord but Man is the lord of individuals Man s is the kingdom i e the world consequently the individual is not to be proprietor but Man all commands the world as property to Man is due renown glorification or glory doxa from all for Man or humanity is the individual s end for which he labors thinks lives and for whose glorification he must become man Hitherto men have always striven to find out a fellowship in which their inequalities in other respects should become non essential they strove for equalization consequently for equality and wanted to come all under one hat which means nothing less than that they were seeking for one lord one tie one faith Tis in one God we all believe There cannot be for men anything more fellowly or more equal than Man himself and in this fellowship the love craving has found its contentment it did not rest till it had brought on this last equalization leveled all inequality laid man on the breast of man But under this very fellowship decay and ruin become most glaring In a more limited fellowship the Frenchman still stood against the German the Christian against the Mohammedan et cetera Now on the contrary man stands against men or as men are not man man stands against the un man The sentence God has become man is now followed by the other Man has become I This is the human I But we invert it and say I was not able to find myself so long as I sought myself as Man But now that it appears that Man is aspiring to become I and to gain a corporeity in me I note that after all everything depends on me and Man is lost without me But I do not care to give myself up to be the shrine of this most holy thing and shall not ask henceforward whether I am man or un man in what I set about let this spirit keep off my neck Humane liberalism goes to work radically If you want to be or have anything especial even in one point if you want to retain for yourself even one prerogative above others to claim even one right that is not a general right of man you are an egoist Very good I do not want to have or be anything especial above others I do not want to claim any prerogative against them but I do not measure myself by others either and do not want to have any right whatever I want to be all and have all that I can be and have Whether others are and have anything similar what do I care The equal the same they can neither be nor have I cause no detriment to them as I cause no detriment to the rock by being ahead of it in having motion If they could have it they would have it To cause other men no detriment is the point of the demand to possess no prerogative to renounce all being ahead the strictest theory of renunciation One is not to count himself as anything especial such as e g a Jew or a Christian Well I do not count myself as anything especial but as unique ninety seven Doubtless I have similarity with others yet that holds good only for comparison or reflection in fact I am incomparable unique My flesh is not their flesh my mind is not their mind If you bring them under the generalities flesh mind those are your thoughts which have nothing to do with my flesh my mind and can least of all issue a call to mine I do not want to recognize or respect in you anything neither the proprietor nor the ragamuffin nor even the man but to use you In salt I find that it makes food palatable to me therefore I dissolve it in the fish I recognize an aliment therefore I eat it in you I discover the gift of making my life agreeable therefore I choose you as a companion Or in salt I study crystallization in the fish animality in you men et cetera But to me you are only what you are for me to wit my object and because my object therefore my property In humane liberalism ragamuffinhood is completed We must first come down to the most ragamuffin like most poverty stricken condition if we want to arrive at ownness for we must strip off everything alien But nothing seems more ragamuffin like than naked Man It is more than ragamuffinhood however when I throw away Man too because I feel that he too is alien to me and that I can make no pretensions on that basis This is no longer mere ragamuffinhood because even the last rag has fallen off here stands real nakedness denudation of everything alien The ragamuffin has stripped off ragamuffinhood itself and therewith has ceased to be what he was a ragamuffin I am no longer a ragamuffin but have been one Up to this time the discord could not come to an outbreak because properly there is current only a contention of modern liberals with antiquated liberals a contention of those who understand freedom in a small measure and those who want the full measure of freedom of the moderate and measureless therefore Everything turns on the question how free must man be That man must be free in this all believe therefore all are liberal too But the un man ninety eight who is somewhere in every individual how is he blocked flow can it be arranged not to leave the un man free at the same time with man Liberalism as a whole has a deadly enemy an invincible opposite as God has the devil by the side of man stands always the un man the individual the egoist State society humanity do not master this devil Humane liberalism has undertaken the task of showing the other liberals that they still do not want freedom If the other liberals had before their eyes only isolated egoism and were for the most part blind radical liberalism has against it egoism in mass throws among the masses all who do not make the cause of freedom their own as it does so that now man and un man rigorously separated stand over against each other as enemies to wit the masses and criticism ninety nine namely free human criticism as it is called Judenfrage p one hundred fourteen in opposition to crude e g religious criticism Criticism expresses the hope that it will be victorious over all the masses and give them a general certificate of insolvency one hundred So it means finally to make itself out in the right and to represent all contention of the faint hearted and timorous as an egoistic stubbornness one hundred one as pettiness paltriness All wrangling loses significance and petty dissensions are given up because in criticism a common enemy enters the field You are egoists altogether one no better than another Now the egoists stand together against criticism Really the egoists No they fight against criticism precisely because it accuses them of egoism they do not plead guilty to egoism Accordingly criticism and the masses stand on the same basis both fight against egoism both repudiate it for themselves and charge it to each other Criticism and the masses pursue the same goal freedom from egoism and wrangle only over which of them approaches nearest to the goal or even attains it The Jews the Christians the absolutists the men of darkness and men of light politicians Communists all in short hold the reproach of egoism far from them and as criticism brings against them this reproach in plain terms and in the most extended sense all justify themselves against the accusation of egoism and combat egoism the same enemy with whom criticism wages war Both criticism and masses are enemies of egoists and both seek to liberate themselves from egoism as well by clearing or whitewashing themselves as by ascribing it to the opposite party The critic is the true spokesman of the masses who gives them the simple concept and the phrase of egoism while the spokesmen to whom the triumph is denied in Lit Ztg V twenty four were only bunglers He is their prince and general in the war against egoism for freedom what he fights against they fight against But at the same time he is their enemy too only not the enemy before them but the friendly enemy who wields the knout behind the timorous to force courage into them Hereby the opposition of criticism and the masses is reduced to the following contradiction You are egoists No we are not I will prove it to you You shall have our justification Let us then take both for what they give themselves out for non egoists and what they take each other for egoists They are egoists and are not Properly criticism says You must liberate your ego from all limitedness so entirely that it becomes a human ego I say Liberate yourself as far as you can and you have done your part for it is not given to every one to break through all limits or more expressively not to every one is that a limit which is a limit for the rest Consequently do not tire yourself with toiling at the limits of others enough if you tear down yours Who has ever succeeded in tearing down even one limit for all men Are not countless persons to day as at all times running about with all the limitations of humanity He who overturns one of his limits may have shown others the way and the means the overturning of their limits remains their affair Nobody does anything else either To demand of people that they become wholly men is to call on them to cast down all human limits That is impossible because Man has no limits I have some indeed but then it is only mine that concern me any and only they can be overcome by me A human ego I cannot become just because I am I and not merely man Yet let us still see whether criticism has not taught us something that we can lay to heart I am not free if I am not without interests not man if I am not disinterested Well even if it makes little difference to me to be free or man yet I do not want to leave unused any occasion to realize myself or make myself count Criticism offers me this occasion by the teaching that if anything plants itself firmly in me and becomes indissoluble I become its prisoner and servant i e a possessed man An interest be it for what it may has kidnapped a slave in me if I cannot get away from it and is no longer my property but I I am its Let us therefore accept criticism s lesson to let no part of our property become stable and to feel comfortable only in dissolving it So if criticism says You are man only when you are restlessly criticising and dissolving then we say Man I am without that and I am I likewise therefore I want only to be careful to secure my property to myself and in order to secure it I continually take it back into myself annihilate in it every movement toward independence and swallow it before it can fix itself and become a fixed idea or a mania But I do that not for the sake of my human calling but because I call myself to it I do not strut about dissolving everything that it is possible for a man to dissolve and e g while not yet ten years old I do not criticise the nonsense of the Commandments but I am man all the same and act humanly in just this that I still leave them uncriticised In short I have no calling and follow none not even that to be a man Do I now reject what liberalism has won in its various exertions Far be the day that anything won should be lost Only after Man has become free through liberalism I turn my gaze back upon myself and confess to myself openly What Man seems to have gained I alone have gained Man is free when Man is to man the supreme being So it belongs to the completion of liberalism that every other supreme being be annulled theology overturned by anthropology God and his grace laughed down atheism universal The egoism of property has given up the last that it had to give when even the My God has become senseless for God exists only when he has at heart the individual s welfare as the latter seeks his welfare in him Political liberalism abolished the inequality of masters and servants it made people masterless anarchic The master was now removed from the individual the egoist to become a ghost the law or the State Social liberalism abolishes the inequality of possession of the poor and rich and makes people possessionless or propertyless Property is withdrawn from the individual and surrendered to ghostly society Humane liberalism makes people godless atheistic Therefore the individual s God my God must be put an end to Now masterlessness is indeed at the same time freedom from service possessionlessness at the same time freedom from care and godlessness at the same time freedom from prejudice for with the master the servant falls away with possession the care about it with the firmly rooted God prejudice But since the master rises again as State the servant appears again as subject since possession becomes the property of society care is begotten anew as labor and since God as Man becomes a prejudice there arises a new faith faith in humanity or liberty For the individual s God the God of all viz Man is now exalted for it is the highest thing in us all to be man But as nobody can become entirely what the idea man imports Man remains to the individual a lofty other world an unattained supreme being a God But at the same time this is the true God because he is fully adequate to us to wit our own self we ourselves but separated from us and lifted above us POSTSCRIPT The foregoing review of free human criticism was written by bits immediately after the appearance of the books in question as was also that which elsewhere refers to writings of this tendency and I did little more than bring together the fragments But criticism is restlessly pressing forward and thereby makes it necessary for me to come back to it once more now that my book is finished and insert this concluding note I have before me the latest eighth number of the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung of Bruno Bauer There again the general interests of society stand at the top But criticism has reflected and given this society a specification by which it is discriminated from a form which previously had still been confused with it the State in former passages still celebrated as free State is quite given up because it can in no wise fulfil the task of human society Criticism only saw itself compelled to identify for a moment human and political affairs in eighteen forty two but now it has found that the State even as free State is not human society or as it could likewise say that the people is not man We saw how it got through with theology and showed clearly that God sinks into dust before Man we see it now come to a clearance with politics in the same way and show that before Man peoples and nationalities fall so we see how it has its explanation with Church and State declaring them both unhuman and we shall see for it betrays this to us already how it can also give proof that before Man the masses which it even calls a spiritual being appear worthless And how should the lesser spiritual beings be able to maintain themselves before the supreme spirit Man casts down the false idols So what the critic has in view for the present is the scrutiny of the masses which he will place before Man in order to combat them from the standpoint of Man What is now the object of criticism The masses a spiritual being These the critic will learn to know and will find that they are in contradiction with Man he will demonstrate that they are unhuman and will succeed just as well in this demonstration as in the former ones that the divine and the national or the concerns of Church and of State were the unhuman The masses are defined as the most significant product of the Revolution as the deceived multitude which the illusions of political Illumination and in general the entire Illumination movement of the eighteenth century have given over to boundless disgruntlement The Revolution satisfied some by its result and left others unsatisfied the satisfied part is the commonalty bourgeoisie et cetera the unsatisfied is the masses Does not the critic so placed himself belong to the masses But the unsatisfied are still in great mistiness and their discontent utters itself only in a boundless disgruntlement This the likewise unsatisfied critic now wants to master he cannot want and attain more than to bring that spiritual being the masses out of its disgruntlement and to uplift those who were only disgruntled i e to give them the right attitude toward those results of the Revolution which are to be overcome he can become the head of the masses their decided spokesman Therefore he wants also to abolish the deep chasm which parts him from the multitude From those who want to uplift the lower classes of the people he is distinguished by wanting to deliver from disgruntlement not merely these but himself too But assuredly his consciousness does not deceive him either when he takes the masses to be the natural opponents of theory and foresees that the more this theory shall develop itself so much the more will it make the masses compact For the critic cannot enlighten or satisfy the masses with his presupposition Man If over against the commonalty they are only the lower classes of the people politically insignificant masses over against Man they must still more be mere masses humanly insignificant yes unhuman masses or a multitude of un men The critic clears away everything human and starting from the presupposition that the human is the true he works against himself denying it wherever it had been hitherto found He proves only that the human is to be found nowhere except in his head but the unhuman everywhere The unhuman is the real the extant on all hands and by the proof that it is not human the critic only enunciates plainly the tautological sentence that it is the unhuman But what if the unhuman turning its back on itself with resolute heart should at the same time turn away from the disturbing critic and leave him standing untouched and unstung by his remonstrance You call me the unhuman it might say to him and so I really am for you but I am so only because you bring me into opposition to the human and I could despise myself only so long as I let myself be hypnotized into this opposition I was contemptible because I sought my better self outside me I was the unhuman because I dreamed of the human I resembled the pious who hunger for their true self and always remain poor sinners I thought of myself only in comparison to another enough I was not all in all was not unique one hundred two But now I cease to appear to myself as the unhuman cease to measure myself and let myself be measured by man cease to recognize anything above me consequently adieu humane critic I only have been the unhuman am it now no longer but am the unique yes to your loathing the egoistic yet not the egoistic as it lets itself be measured by the human humane and unselfish but the egoistic as the unique We have to pay attention to still another sentence of the same number Criticism sets up no dogmas and wants to learn to know nothing but things The critic is afraid of becoming dogmatic or setting up dogmas Of course why thereby he would become the opposite of the critic the dogmatist he would now become bad as he is good as critic or would become from an unselfish man an egoist et cetera Of all things no dogma this is his dogma For the critic remains on one and the same ground with the dogmatist that of thoughts Like the latter he always starts from a thought but varies in this that he never ceases to keep the principle thought in the process of thinking and so does not let it become stable He only asserts the thought process against stationariness in it From criticism no thought is safe since criticism is thought or the thinking mind itself Therefore I repeat that the religious world and this is the world of thoughts reaches its completion in criticism where thinking extends its encroachments over every thought no one of which may egoistically establish itself Where would the purity of criticism the purity of thinking be left if even one thought escaped the process of thinking This explains the fact that the critic has even begun already to gibe gently here and there at the thought of Man of humanity and humaneness because he suspects that here a thought is approaching dogmatic fixity But yet he cannot decompose this thought till he has found a higher in which it dissolves for he moves only in thoughts This higher thought might be enunciated as that of the movement or process of thinking itself i e as the thought of thinking or of criticism Freedom of thinking has in fact become complete hereby freedom of mind celebrates its triumph for the individual egoistic thoughts have lost their dogmatic truculence There is nothing left but the dogma of free thinking or of criticism Against everything that belongs to the world of thought criticism is in the right i e in might it is the victor Criticism and criticism alone is up to date From the standpoint of thought there is no power capable of being an overmatch for criticism s and it is a pleasure to see how easily and sportively this dragon swallows all other serpents of thought Each serpent twists to be sure but criticism crushes it in all its turns I am no opponent of criticism i e I am no dogmatist and do not feel myself touched by the critic s tooth with which he tears the dogmatist to pieces If I were a dogmatist I should place at the head a dogma i e a thought an idea a principle and should complete this as a systematist spinning it out to a system i e a structure of thought Conversely if I were a critic viz an opponent of the dogmatist I should carry on the fight of free thinking against the enthralling thought I should defend thinking against what was thought But I am neither the champion of a thought nor the champion of thinking for I from whom I start am not a thought nor do I consist in thinking Against me the unnameable the realm of thoughts thinking and mind is shattered Criticism is the possessed man s fight against possession as such against all possession a fight which is founded in the consciousness that everywhere possession or as the critic calls it a religious and theological attitude is extant He knows that people stand in a religious or believing attitude not only toward God but toward other ideas as well like right the State law et cetera i e he recognizes possession in all places So he wants to break up thoughts by thinking but I say only thoughtlessness really saves me from thoughts It it not thinking but my thoughtlessness or I the unthinkable incomprehensible that frees me from possession A jerk does me the service of the most anxious thinking a stretching of the limbs shakes off the torment of thoughts a leap upward hurls from my breast the nightmare of the religious world a jubilant Hoopla throws off year long burdens But the monstrous significance of unthinking jubilation could not be recognized in the long night of thinking and believing What clumsiness and frivolity to want to solve the most difficult problems acquit yourself of the most comprehensive tasks by a breaking off But have you tasks if you do not set them to yourself So long as you set them you will not give them up and I certainly do not care if you think and thinking create a thousand thoughts But you who have set the tasks are you not to be able to upset them again Must you be bound to these tasks and must they become absolute tasks To cite only one thing the government has been disparaged on account of its resorting to forcible means against thoughts interfering against the press by means of the police power of the censorship and making a personal fight out of a literary one As if it were solely a matter of thoughts and as if one s attitude toward thoughts must be unselfish self denying and self sacrificing Do not those thoughts attack the governing parties themselves and so call out egoism And do the thinkers not set before the attacked ones the religious demand to reverence the power of thought of ideas They are to succumb voluntarily and resignedly because the divine power of thought Minerva fights on their enemies side Why that would be an act of possession a religious sacrifice To be sure the governing parties are themselves held fast in a religious bias and follow the leading power of an idea or a faith but they are at the same time unconfessed egoists and right here against the enemy their pent up egoism breaks loose possessed in their faith they are at the same time unpossessed by their opponents faith i e they are egoists toward this If one wants to make them a reproach it could only be the converse to wit that they are possessed by their ideas Against thoughts no egoistic power is to appear no police power and the like So the believers in thinking believe But thinking and its thoughts are not sacred to me and I defend my skin against them as against other things That may be an unreasonable defence but if I am in duty bound to reason then I like Abraham must sacrifice my dearest to it In the kingdom of thought which like that of faith is the kingdom of heaven every one is assuredly wrong who uses unthinking force just as every one is wrong who in the kingdom of love behaves unlovingly or although he is a Christian and therefore lives in the kingdom of love yet acts unchristianly in these kingdoms to which he supposes himself to belong though he nevertheless throws off their laws he is a sinner or egoist But it is only when he becomes a criminal against these kingdoms that he can throw off their dominion Here too the result is this that the fight of the thinkers against the government is indeed in the right viz in might so far as it is carried on against the government s thoughts the government is dumb and does not succeed in making any literary rejoinder to speak of but is on the other hand in the wrong viz in impotence so far as it does not succeed in bringing into the field anything but thoughts against a personal power the egoistic power stops the mouths of the thinkers The theoretical fight cannot complete the victory and the sacred power of thought succumbs to the might of egoism Only the egoistic fight the fight of egoists on both sides clears up everything This last now to make thinking an affair of egoistic option an affair of the single person one hundred three a mere pastime or hobby as it were and to take from it the importance of being the last decisive power this degradation and desecration of thinking this equalization of the unthinking and thoughtful ego this clumsy but real equality criticism is not able to produce because it itself is only the priest of thinking and sees nothing beyond thinking but the deluge Criticism does indeed affirm e g that free criticism may overcome the State but at the same time it defends itself against the reproach which is laid upon it by the State government that it is self will and impudence it thinks then that self will and impudence may not overcome it alone may The truth is rather the reverse the State can be really overcome only by impudent self will It may now to conclude with this be clear that in the critic s new change of front he has not transformed himself but only made good an oversight disentangled a subject and is saying too much when he speaks of criticism criticising itself it or rather he has only criticised its oversight and cleared it of its inconsistencies If he wanted to criticise criticism he would have to look and see if there was anything in its presupposition I on my part start from a presupposition in presupposing myself but my presupposition does not struggle for its perfection like Man struggling for his perfection but only serves me to enjoy it and consume it I consume my presupposition and nothing else and exist only in consuming it But that presupposition is therefore not a presupposition at all for as I am the Unique I know nothing of the duality of a presupposing and a presupposed ego an incomplete and a complete ego or man but this that I consume myself means only that I am I do not presuppose myself because I am every moment just positing or creating myself and am I only by being not presupposed but posited and again posited only in the moment when I posit myself i e I am creator and creature in one If the presuppositions that have hitherto been current are to melt away in a full dissolution they must not be dissolved into a higher presupposition again i e a thought or thinking itself criticism For that dissolution is to be for my good otherwise it would belong only in the series of the innumerable dissolutions which in favor of others e g this very Man God the State pure morality et cetera declared old truths to be untruths and did away with long fostered presuppositions Part Second I At the entrance of the modern time stands the God man At its exit will only the God in the God man evaporate and can the God man really die if only the God in him dies They did not think of this question and thought they were through when in our days they brought to a victorious end the work of the Illumination the vanquishing of God they did not notice that Man has killed God in order to become now sole God on high The other world outside us is indeed brushed away and the great undertaking of the Illuminators completed but the other world in us has become a new heaven and calls us forth to renewed heaven storming God has had to give place yet not to us but to Man How can you believe that the God man is dead before the Man in him besides the God is dead I OWNNESS one hundred four Does not the spirit thirst for freedom Alas not my spirit alone my body too thirsts for it hourly When before the odorous castle kitchen my nose tells my palate of the savory dishes that are being prepared therein it feels a fearful pining at its dry bread when my eyes tell the hardened back about soft down on which one may lie more delightfully than on its compressed straw a suppressed rage seizes it when but let us not follow the pains further And you call that a longing for freedom What do you want to become free from then From your hardtack and your straw bed Then throw them away But that seems not to serve you you want rather to have the freedom to enjoy delicious foods and downy beds Are men to give you this freedom are they to permit it to you You do not hope that from their philanthropy because you know they all think like you each is the nearest to himself How therefore do you mean to come to the enjoyment of those foods and beds Evidently not otherwise than in making them your property If you think it over rightly you do not want the freedom to have all these fine things for with this freedom you still do not have them you want really to have them to call them yours and possess them as your property Of what use is a freedom to you indeed if it brings in nothing And if you became free from everything you would no longer have anything for freedom is empty of substance Whoso knows not how to make use of it for him it has no value this useless permission but how I make use of it depends on my personality one hundred five I have no objection to freedom but I wish more than freedom for you you should not merely be rid of what you do not want you should also have what you want you should not only be a freeman you should be an owner too Free from what Oh what is there that cannot be shaken off The yoke of serfdom of sovereignty of aristocracy and princes the dominion of the desires and passions yes even the dominion of one s own will of self will for the completest self denial is nothing but freedom freedom to wit from self determination from one s own self And the craving for freedom as for something absolute worthy of every praise deprived us of ownness it created self denial However the freer I become the more compulsion piles up before my eyes and the more impotent I feel myself The unfree son of the wilderness does not yet feel anything of all the limits that crowd a civilized man he seems to himself freer than this latter In the measure that I conquer freedom for myself I create for myself new bounds and new tasks if I have invented railroads I feel myself weak again because I cannot yet sail through the skies like the bird and if I have solved a problem whose obscurity disturbed my mind at once there await me innumerable others whose perplexities impede my progress dim my free gaze make the limits of my freedom painfully sensible to me Now that you have become free from sin you have become servants of righteousness one hundred six Republicans in their broad freedom do they not become servants of the law How true Christian hearts at all times longed to become free how they pined to see themselves delivered from the bonds of this earth life they looked out toward the land of freedom The Jerusalem that is above is the freewoman she is the mother of us all Gal four twenty six Being free from anything means only being clear or rid He is free from headache is equal to he is rid of it He is free from this prejudice is equal to he has never conceived it or he has got rid of it In less we complete the freedom recommended by Christianity in sinless godless moralityless et cetera Freedom is the doctrine of Christianity Ye dear brethren are called to freedom one hundred seven So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom one hundred eight Must we then because freedom betrays itself as a Christian ideal give it up No nothing is to be lost freedom no more than the rest but it is to become our own and in the form of freedom it cannot What a difference between freedom and ownness One can get rid of a great many things one yet does not get rid of all one becomes free from much not from everything Inwardly one may be free in spite of the condition of slavery although too it is again only from all sorts of things not from everything but from the whip the domineering temper et cetera of the master one does not as slave become free Freedom lives only in the realm of dreams Ownness on the contrary is my whole being and existence it is I myself I am free from what I am rid of owner of what I have in my power or what I control My own I am at all times and under all circumstances if I know how to have myself and do not throw myself away on others To be free is something that I cannot truly will because I cannot make it cannot create it I can only wish it and aspire toward it for it remains an ideal a spook The fetters of reality cut the sharpest welts in my flesh every moment But my own I remain Given up as serf to a master I think only of myself and my advantage his blows strike me indeed I am not free from them but I endure them only for my benefit perhaps in order to deceive him and make him secure by the semblance of patience or again not to draw worse upon myself by contumacy But as I keep my eye on myself and my selfishness I take by the forelock the first good opportunity to trample the slaveholder into the dust That I then become free from him and his whip is only the consequence of my antecedent egoism Here one perhaps says I was free even in the condition of slavery to wit intrinsically or inwardly But intrinsically free is not really free and inwardly is not outwardly I was own on the other hand my own altogether inwardly and outwardly Under the dominion of a cruel master my body is not free from torments and lashes but it is my bones that moan under the torture my fibres that quiver under the blows and I moan because my body moans That I sigh and shiver proves that I have not yet lost myself that I am still my own My leg is not free from the master s stick but it is my leg and is inseparable Let him tear it off me and look and see if he still has my leg He retains in his hand nothing but the corpse of my leg which is as little my leg as a dead dog is still a dog a dog has a pulsating heart a so called dead dog has none and is therefore no longer a dog If one opines that a slave may yet be inwardly free he says in fact only the most indisputable and trivial thing For who is going to assert that any man is wholly without freedom If I am an eye servant can I therefore not be free from innumerable things e g from faith in Zeus from the desire for fame and the like Why then should not a whipped slave also be able to be inwardly free from unchristian sentiments from hatred of his enemy et cetera He then has Christian freedom is rid of the unchristian but has he absolute freedom freedom from everything e g from the Christian delusion or from bodily pain et cetera In the meantime all this seems to be said more against names than against the thing But is the name indifferent and has not a word a shibboleth always inspired and fooled men Yet between freedom and ownness there lies still a deeper chasm than the mere difference of the words All the world desires freedom all long for its reign to come O enchantingly beautiful dream of a blooming reign of freedom a free human race who has not dreamed it So men shall become free entirely free free from all constraint From all constraint really from all Are they never to put constraint on themselves any more Oh yes that of course don t you see that is no constraint at all Well then at any rate they are to become free from religious faith from the strict duties of morality from the inexorability of the law from What a fearful misunderstanding Well what are they to be free from then and what not The lovely dream is dissipated awakened one rubs his half opened eyes and stares at the prosaic questioner What men are to be free from From blind credulity cries one What s that exclaims another all faith is blind credulity they must become free from all faith No no for God s sake inveighs the first again do not cast all faith from you else the power of brutality breaks in We must have the republic a third makes himself heard and become free from all commanding lords There is no help in that says a fourth we only get a new lord then a dominant majority let us rather free ourselves from this dreadful inequality O hapless equality already I hear your plebeian roar again How I had dreamed so beautifully just now of a paradise of freedom and what impudence and licentiousness now raises its wild clamor Thus the first laments and gets on his feet to grasp the sword against unmeasured freedom Soon we no longer hear anything but the clashing of the swords of the disagreeing dreamers of freedom What the craving for freedom has always come to has been the desire for a particular freedom e g freedom of faith i e the believing man wanted to be free and independent of what of faith perhaps no but of the inquisitors of faith So now political or civil freedom The citizen wants to become free not from citizenhood but from bureaucracy the arbitrariness of princes and the like Prince Metternich once said he had found a way that was adapted to guide men in the path of genuine freedom for all the future The Count of Provence ran away from France precisely at the time when she was preparing the reign of freedom and said My imprisonment had become intolerable to me I had only one passion the desire for freedom I thought only of it The craving for a particular freedom always includes the purpose of a new dominion as it was with the Revolution which indeed could give its defenders the uplifting feeling that they were fighting for freedom but in truth only because they were after a particular freedom therefore a new dominion the dominion of the law Freedom you all want you want freedom Why then do you higgle over a more or less Freedom can only be the whole of freedom a piece of freedom is not freedom You despair of the possibility of obtaining the whole of freedom freedom from everything yes you consider it insanity even to wish this Well then leave off chasing after the phantom and spend your pains on something better than the unattainable Ah but there is nothing better than freedom What have you then when you have freedom viz for I will not speak here of your piecemeal bits of freedom complete freedom Then you are rid of everything that embarrasses you everything and there is probably nothing that does not once in your life embarrass you and cause you inconvenience And for whose sake then did you want to be rid of it Doubtless for your sake because it is in your way But if something were not inconvenient to you if on the contrary it were quite to your mind e g the gently but irresistibly commanding look of your loved one then you would not want to be rid of it and free from it Why not For your sake again So you take yourselves as measure and judge over all You gladly let freedom go when unfreedom the sweet service of love suits you and you take up your freedom again on occasion when it begins to suit you better that is supposing which is not the point here that you are not afraid of such a Repeal of the Union for other perhaps religious reasons Why will you not take courage now to really make yourselves the central point and the main thing altogether Why grasp in the air at freedom your dream Are you your dream Do not begin by inquiring of your dreams your notions your thoughts for that is all hollow theory Ask yourselves and ask after yourselves that is practical and you know you want very much to be practical But there the one hearkens what his God of course what he thinks of at the name God is his God may be going to say to it and another what his moral feelings his conscience his feeling of duty may determine about it and a third calculates what folks will think of it and when each has thus asked his Lord God folks are a Lord God just as good as nay even more compact than the other worldly and imaginary one vox populi vox dei then he accommodates himself to his Lord s will and listens no more at all for what he himself would like to say and decide Therefore turn to yourselves rather than to your gods or idols Bring out from yourselves what is in you bring it to the light bring yourselves to revelation How one acts only from himself and asks after nothing further the Christians have realized in the notion God He acts as it pleases him And foolish man who could do just so is to act as it pleases God instead If it is said that even God proceeds according to eternal laws that too fits me since I too cannot get out of my skin but have my law in my whole nature i e in myself But one needs only admonish you of yourselves to bring you to despair at once What am I each of you asks himself An abyss of lawless and unregulated impulses desires wishes passions a chaos without light or guiding star How am I to obtain a correct answer if without regard to God s commandments or to the duties which morality prescribes without regard to the voice of reason which in the course of history after bitter experiences has exalted the best and most reasonable thing into law I simply appeal to myself My passion would advise me to do the most senseless thing possible Thus each deems himself the devil for if so far as he is unconcerned about religion et cetera he only deemed himself a beast he would easily find that the beast which does follow only its impulse as it were its advice does not advise and impel itself to do the most senseless things but takes very correct steps But the habit of the religious way of thinking has biased our mind so grievously that we are terrified at ourselves in our nakedness and naturalness it has degraded us so that we deem ourselves depraved by nature born devils Of course it comes into your head at once that your calling requires you to do the good the moral the right Now if you ask yourselves what is to be done how can the right voice sound forth from you the voice which points the way of the good the right the true et cetera What concord have God and Belial But what would you think if one answered you by saying That one is to listen to God conscience duties laws et cetera is flim flam with which people have stuffed your head and heart and made you crazy And if he asked you how it is that you know so surely that the voice of nature is a seducer And if he even demanded of you to turn the thing about and actually to deem the voice of God and conscience to be the devil s work There are such graceless men how will you settle them You cannot appeal to your parsons parents and good men for precisely these are designated by them as your seducers as the true seducers and corrupters of youth who busily sow broadcast the tares of self contempt and reverence to God who fill young hearts with mud and young heads with stupidity But now those people go on and ask For whose sake do you care about God s and the other commandments You surely do not suppose that this is done merely out of complaisance toward God No you are doing it for your sake again Here too therefore you are the main thing and each must say to himself I am everything to myself and I do everything on my account If it ever became clear to you that God the commandments et cetera only harm you that they reduce and ruin you to a certainty you would throw them from you just as the Christians once condemned Apollo or Minerva or heathen morality They did indeed put in the place of these Christ and afterward Mary as well as a Christian morality but they did this for the sake of their souls welfare too therefore out of egoism or ownness And it was by this egoism this ownness that they got rid of the old world of gods and became free from it Ownness created a new freedom for ownness is the creator of everything as genius a definite ownness which is always originality has for a long time already been looked upon as the creator of new productions that have a place in the history of the world If your efforts are ever to make freedom the issue then exhaust freedom s demands Who is it that is to become free You I we Free from what From everything that is not you not I not we I therefore am the kernel that is to be delivered from all wrappings and freed from all cramping shells What is left when I have been freed from everything that is not I Only I nothing but I But freedom has nothing to offer to this I himself As to what is now to happen further after I have become free freedom is silent as our governments when the prisoner s time is up merely let him go thrusting him out into abandonment Now why if freedom is striven after for love of the I after all why not choose the I himself as beginning middle and end Am I not worth more than freedom Is it not I that make myself free am not I the first Even unfree 
5248-2163-0000	train-other-500	even laid in a thousand fetters I yet am and I am not like freedom extant only in the future and in hopes
5248-2163-0001	train-other-500	but even as the most abject of slaves I am present Think that over well and decide whether you will place on your banner the dream of freedom or the resolution of egoism of ownness
none	none	 Freedom awakens your rage against everything that is not you egoism calls you to joy over yourselves to self enjoyment freedom is and remains a longing a romantic plaint a Christian hope for unearthliness and futurity ownness is a reality which of itself removes just so much unfreedom as by barring your own way hinders you What does not disturb you you will not want to renounce and if it begins to disturb you why you know that you must obey yourselves rather than men Freedom teaches only Get yourselves rid relieve yourselves of everything burdensome it does not teach you who you yourselves are Rid rid so rings its rallying cry and you eagerly following its call get rid even of yourselves deny yourselves But ownness calls you back to yourselves it says Come to yourself Under the aegis of freedom you get rid of many kinds of things but something new pinches you again you are rid of the Evil One evil is left one hundred nine As own you are really rid of everything and what clings to you you have accepted it is your choice and your pleasure The own man is the freeborn the man free to begin with the free man on the contrary is only the eleutheromaniac the dreamer and enthusiast The former is originally free because he recognizes nothing but himself he does not need to free himself first because at the start he rejects everything outside himself because he prizes nothing more than himself rates nothing higher because in short he starts from himself and comes to himself Constrained by childish respect 
5248-2163-0002	train-other-500	he is nevertheless already working at freeing himself from this constraint Ownness works in the little egoist and procures him the desired freedom Thousands of years of civilization have obscured to you what you are
5248-2163-0003	train-other-500	have made you believe you are not egoists but are called to be idealists good men Shake that off Do not seek for freedom which does precisely deprive you of yourselves in self denial but seek for yourselves become egoists
none	none	 become each of you an almighty ego Or more clearly Just recognize yourselves again just recognize what you really are and let go your hypocritical endeavors your foolish mania to be something else than you are Hypocritical I call them because 
5248-2163-0004	train-other-500	you have yet remained egoists all these thousands of years but sleeping self deceiving crazy egoists you

5248-2163-0006	train-other-500	But how about that doing the good for the good s sake without prospect of reward As if here too the pay was not contained in the satisfaction that it is to afford Even religion therefore
none	none	 is founded on our egoism and exploits it 
5248-2163-0007	train-other-500	calculated for our desires it stifles many others for the sake of one This then gives the phenomenon of cheated egoism where I satisfy not myself but one of my desires e g the impulse toward blessedness
5248-2163-0008	train-other-500	Religion promises me the supreme good to gain this I no longer regard any other of my desires and do not slake them All your doings are unconfessed secret covert and concealed egoism But because they are egoism

5248-2163-0009	train-other-500	you are egoists and you are not since you renounce egoism Where you seem most to be such you have drawn upon the word egoist loathing and contempt I secure my freedom with regard to the world in the degree that I make the world my own

5248-2163-0018	train-other-500	my inability to touch you I yet remember it against you Vigorous men have always done so When the loyal had exalted an unsubdued power to be their master and had adored it when they had
5248-2163-0019	train-other-500	demanded adoration from all then there came some such son of nature who would not loyally submit and drove the adored power from its inaccessible Olympus He cried his Stand still to the rolling sun
none	none	 and made the earth go round the loyal had to make the best of it he laid his axe to the sacred oaks and the loyal were astonished that no heavenly fire consumed him he threw the pope off Peter s chair and the loyal had no way to hinder it he is tearing down the divine right business and the loyal croak in vain and at last are silent My freedom becomes complete only when it is my might but by this I cease to be a merely free man and become an own man Why is the freedom of the peoples a hollow word Because the peoples have no might With a breath of the living ego I blow peoples over be it the breath of a Nero a Chinese emperor or a poor writer Why is it that the G one hundred ten legislatures pine 
5248-2163-0020	train-other-500	in vain for freedom and are lectured for it by the cabinet ministers

5248-2163-0021	train-other-500	Might is a fine thing and useful for many purposes for one goes further with a handful of might than with a bagful of right You long for freedom You fools If you took might freedom would come of itself
none	none	 See he who has might stands above the law How does this prospect taste to you you law abiding people But you have no taste The cry for freedom rings loudly all around But is it felt and known what a donated or chartered freedom must mean It is not recognized in the full amplitude of the word that all freedom is essentially self liberation i e 
5248-2163-0022	train-other-500	that I can have only so much freedom as I procure for myself by my ownness Of what use is it to sheep that no one abridges their freedom of speech They stick to bleating Give one who is inwardly a Mohammedan
5248-2163-0023	train-other-500	a Jew or a Christian permission to speak what he likes he will yet utter only narrow minded stuff If on the contrary certain others rob you of the freedom of speaking and hearing they know quite rightly wherein lies their temporary advantage
5248-2163-0024	train-other-500	as you would perhaps be able to say and hear something whereby those certain persons would lose their credit If they nevertheless give you freedom they are simply knaves who give more than they have For then they give you nothing of their own
5248-2163-0025	train-other-500	but stolen wares they give you your own freedom the freedom that you must take for yourselves and they give it to you only that you may not take it and call the thieves and cheats to an account to boot In their slyness they know well that given
5248-2163-0026	train-other-500	chartered freedom is no freedom since only the freedom one takes for himself therefore the egoist s freedom rides with full sails Donated freedom strikes its sails as soon as there comes a storm or calm it requires always a
none	none	 gentle and moderate breeze Here lies the difference between self liberation and emancipation manumission setting free Those who to day stand in the opposition are thirsting and screaming to be set free The princes are to declare their peoples of age i e emancipate them 
5248-2163-0027	train-other-500	Behave as if you were of age and you are so without any declaration of majority if you do not behave accordingly you are not worthy of it
none	none	 and would never be of age even by a declaration of majority 
5248-2163-0028	train-other-500	When the Greeks were of age they drove out their tyrants and when the son is of age he makes himself independent of his father
none	none	 If the Greeks had waited till their tyrants 
5248-2163-0029	train-other-500	graciously allowed them their majority they might have waited long A sensible father throws out a son who will not come of age and keeps the house to himself it serves the noodle right The man who is set free is nothing but a freedman
5248-2163-0030	train-other-500	a libertinus a dog dragging a piece of chain with him he is an unfree man in the garment of freedom like the ass in the lion s skin Emancipated Jews are nothing bettered in themselves
5248-2163-0031	train-other-500	but only relieved as Jews although he who relieves their condition is certainly more than a churchly Christian as the latter cannot do this without inconsistency But emancipated or not emancipated Jew remains Jew
5248-2163-0032	train-other-500	he who is not self freed is merely an emancipated man The Protestant State can certainly set free emancipate the Catholics but because they do not make themselves free they remain simply Catholics Selfishness and unselfishness have already been spoken of
none	none	 The friends of freedom are exasperated against selfishness because in their religious striving after freedom they cannot free themselves from that sublime thing self renunciation The liberal s anger 
5248-2163-0033	train-other-500	is directed against egoism for the egoist you know never takes trouble about a thing for the sake of the thing but for his sake the thing must serve him It is egoistic to ascribe to no thing a value of its own an absolute value
5248-2163-0034	train-other-500	but to seek its value in me One often hears that pot boiling study which is so common counted among the most repulsive traits of egoistic behavior because it manifests the most shameful desecration of science
none	none	 but what is science for but to be consumed If one does not know how to use it for anything better than to keep the pot boiling then his egoism is a petty one indeed because this egoist s power 
5248-2163-0035	train-other-500	is a limited power but the egoistic element in it and the desecration of science only a possessed man can blame Because Christianity incapable of letting the individual count as an ego
none	none	 one hundred eleven 
5248-2163-0036	train-other-500	thought of him only as a dependent and was properly nothing but a social theory a doctrine of living together and that of man with God as well as of man with man
none	none	 therefore in it everything own must fall into most woeful disrepute selfishness self will ownness self love et cetera The Christian way of looking at things has on all sides gradually re stamped honorable words into dishonorable why should they not be brought into honor again So Schimpf contumely is in its old sense equivalent to jest but for Christian seriousness pastime became a dishonor one hundred twelve for that seriousness cannot take a joke frech impudent 
5248-2163-0037	train-other-500	formerly meant only bold brave Frevel wanton outrage was only daring It is well known how askance the word reason was looked at for a long time
none	none	 Our language has settled itself pretty well to the Christian standpoint and the general consciousness is still too Christian not to shrink in terror from everything unchristian as from something incomplete or evil 
5248-2163-0038	train-other-500	Therefore selfishness is in a bad way too Selfishness
none	none	 one hundred thirteen in the Christian sense means something like this 
5248-2163-0039	train-other-500	I look only to see whether anything is of use to me as a sensual man But is sensuality then the whole of my ownness
none	none	 Am I in my own senses when I am given up to sensuality 
5248-2163-0040	train-other-500	Do I follow myself my own determination when I follow that
none	none	 I am my own only when I am master of myself 
5248-2163-0041	train-other-500	instead of being mastered either by sensuality or by anything else God man authority law State Church et cetera what is of use to me this self owned or self appertaining one my selfishness pursues
none	none	 Besides one sees himself every moment compelled to believe in that constantly blasphemed selfishness as an all controlling power In the session of February ten eighteen forty four Welcker argues a motion on the dependence of the judges 
5248-2163-0042	train-other-500	and sets forth in a detailed speech that removable dismissable transferable and pensionable judges in short such members of a court of justice as can by mere administrative process be damaged and endangered are wholly without reliability
5248-2163-0043	train-other-500	yes lose all respect and all confidence among the people The whole bench Welcker cries is demoralized by this dependence In blunt words this means nothing else than that the judges
none	none	 find it more to their advantage to give judgment as the ministers 
5248-2163-0044	train-other-500	would have them than to give it as the law would have them How is that to be helped Perhaps by bringing home to the judges hearts the ignominiousness of their venality and then cherishing
5248-2163-0045	train-other-500	the confidence that they will repent and henceforth prize justice more highly than their selfishness No the people does not soar to this romantic confidence for it feels that selfishness is mightier than any other motive Therefore the same persons
5248-2163-0046	train-other-500	who have been judges hitherto may remain so however thoroughly one has convinced himself that they behaved as egoists only they must not any longer
5248-2163-0047	train-other-500	find their selfishness favored by the venality of justice but must stand so independent of the government that by a judgment in conformity with the facts they do not throw into the shade their own cause
none	none	 their well understood interest but rather secure a comfortable combination of a good salary with respect among the citizens So Welcker and the commoners of Baden consider themselves secured 
5248-2163-0048	train-other-500	only when they can count on selfishness What is one to think then of the countless phrases of unselfishness with which their mouths overflow at other times To a cause which I am pushing selfishly
5248-2163-0049	train-other-500	I have another relation than to one which I am serving unselfishly The following criterion might be cited for it against the one I can sin or commit a sin the other I can only trifle away push from me deprive myself of

5248-2163-0050	train-other-500	Free trade is looked at in both ways being regarded partly as a freedom which may under certain circumstances be granted or withdrawn partly as one which is to be held sacred under all circumstances
none	none	 If I am not concerned about a thing in and for itself 
5248-2163-0051	train-other-500	and do not desire it for its own sake then I desire it solely as a means to an end for its usefulness for the sake of another end e g oysters for a pleasant flavor Now will not every thing whose final end

none	none	 and is he to protect a thing that serves him for nothing e g the proletarian to protect the State Ownness includes in itself everything own and brings to honor again what Christian language dishonored But ownness has not any alien standard either as it is not in any sense an idea like freedom morality humanity and the like it is only a description of the owner II THE OWNER I do I come to myself and mine through liberalism Whom does the liberal look upon as his equal Man Be only man and that you are anyway and the liberal calls you his brother He asks very little about your private opinions and private follies if only he can espy Man in you But as he takes little heed of what you are privatim nay in a strict following out of his principle sets no value at all on it he sees in you only what you are generatim In other words he sees in you not you but the species not Tom or Jim but Man not the real or unique one one hundred fourteen but your essence or your concept not the bodily man but the spirit As Tom you would not be his equal because he is Jim therefore not Tom as man you are the same that he is And since as Tom you virtually do not exist at all for him so far to wit as he is a liberal and not unconsciously an egoist he has really made brother love very easy for himself he loves in you not Tom of whom he knows nothing and wants to know nothing but Man To see in you and me nothing further than men that is running the Christian way of looking at things according to which one is for the other nothing but a concept e g a man called to salvation et cetera into the ground Christianity properly so called gathers us under a less utterly general concept there we are sons of God and led by the Spirit of God one hundred fifteen Yet not all can boast of being God s sons but the same Spirit which witnesses to our spirit that we are sons of God reveals also who are the sons of the devil one hundred sixteen Consequently to be a son of God one must not be a son of the devil the sonship of God excluded certain men To be sons of men i e men on the contrary we need nothing but to belong to the human species need only to be specimens of the same species What I am as this I is no concern of yours as a good liberal but is my private affair alone enough that we are both sons of one and the same mother to wit the human species as a son of man I am your equal What am I now to you Perhaps this bodily I as I walk and stand Anything but that This bodily I with its thoughts decisions and passions is in your eyes a private affair which is no concern of yours it is an affair by itself As an affair for you there exists only my concept my generic concept only the Man who as he is called Tom could just as well be Joe or Dick You see in me not me the bodily man but an unreal thing the spook i e a Man In the course of the Christian centuries we declared the most various persons to be our equals but each time in the measure of that spirit which we expected from them e g each one in whom the spirit of the need of redemption may be assumed then later each one who has the spirit of integrity finally each one who shows a human spirit and a human face Thus the fundamental principle of equality varied Equality being now conceived as equality of the human spirit there has certainly been discovered an equality that includes all men for who could deny that we men have a human spirit i e no other than a human But are we on that account further on now than in the beginning of Christianity Then we were to have a divine spirit now a human but if the divine did not exhaust us how should the human wholly express what we are Feuerbach e g thinks that if he humanizes the divine he has found the truth No if God has given us pain Man is capable of pinching us still more torturingly The long and the short of it is this that we are men is the slightest thing about us and has significance only in so far as it is one of our qualities one hundred seventeen i e our property one hundred eighteen I am indeed among other things a man as I am e g a living being therefore an animal or a European a Berliner and the like but he who chose to have regard for me only as a man or as a Berliner would pay me a regard that would be very unimportant to me And wherefore Because he would have regard only for one of my qualities not for me It is just so with the spirit too A Christian spirit an upright spirit and the like may well be my acquired quality i e my property but I am not this spirit it is mine not I its Hence we have in liberalism only the continuation of the old Christian depreciation of the I the bodily Tom Instead of taking me as I am one looks solely at my property my qualities and enters into marriage bonds with me only for the sake of my possessions one marries as it were what I have not what I am The Christian takes hold of my spirit the liberal of my humanity But if the spirit which is not regarded as the property of the bodily ego but as the proper ego itself is a ghost then the Man too who is not recognized as my quality but as the proper I is nothing but a spook a thought a concept Therefore the liberal too revolves in the same circle as the Christian Because the spirit of mankind i e Man dwells in you you are a man as when the spirit of Christ dwells in you you are a Christian but because it dwells in you only as a second ego even though it be as your proper or better ego it remains otherworldly to you and you have to strive to become wholly man A striving just as fruitless as the Christian s to become wholly a blessed spirit One can now after liberalism has proclaimed Man declare openly that herewith was only completed the consistent carrying out of Christianity and that in truth Christianity set itself no other task from the start than to realize man the true man Hence then the illusion that Christianity ascribes an infinite value to the ego as e g in the doctrine of immortality in the cure of souls et cetera comes to light No it assigns this value to Man alone Only Man is immortal and only because I am man am I too immortal In fact Christianity had to teach that no one is lost just as liberalism too puts all on an equality as men but that eternity like this equality applied only to the Man in me not to me Only as the bearer and harborer of Man do I not die as notoriously the king never dies Louis dies but the king remains I die but my spirit Man remains To identify me now entirely with Man the demand has been invented and stated that I must become a real generic being one hundred nineteen The HUMAN religion is only the last metamorphosis of the Christian religion For liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me because it exalts Man to the same extent as any other religion does its God or idol because it makes what is mine into something otherworldly because in general it makes out of what is mine out of my qualities and my property something alien to wit an essence in short because it sets me beneath Man and thereby creates for me a vocation But liberalism declares itself a religion in form too when it demands for this supreme being Man a zeal of faith a faith that some day will at last prove its fiery zeal too a zeal that will be invincible one hundred twenty But as liberalism is a human religion its professor takes a tolerant attitude toward the professor of any other Catholic Jewish et cetera as Frederick the Great did toward every one who performed his duties as a subject whatever fashion of becoming blest he might be inclined toward This religion is now to be raised to the rank of the generally customary one and separated from the others as mere private follies toward which besides one takes a highly liberal attitude on account of their unessentialness One may call it the State religion the religion of the free State not in the sense hitherto current that it is the one favored or privileged by the State but as that religion which the free State not only has the right but is compelled to demand from each of those who belong to it let him be privatim a Jew a Christian or anything else For it does the same service to the State as filial piety to the family If the family is to be recognized and maintained in its existing condition by each one of those who belong to it then to him the tie of blood must be sacred and his feeling for it must be that of piety of respect for the ties of blood by which every blood relation becomes to him a consecrated person So also to every member of the State community this community must be sacred and the concept which is the highest to the State must likewise be the highest to him But what concept is the highest to the State Doubtless that of being a really human society a society in which every one who is really a man i e not an un man can obtain admission as a member Let a State s tolerance go ever so far toward an un man and toward what is inhuman it ceases And yet this un man is a man yet the inhuman itself is something human yes possible only to a man not to any beast it is in fact something possible to man But although every un man is a man yet the State excludes him i e it locks him up or transforms him from a fellow of the State into a fellow of the prison fellow of the lunatic asylum or hospital according to Communism To say in blunt words what an un man is is not particularly hard it is a man who does not correspond to the concept man as the inhuman is something human which is not conformed to the concept of the human Logic calls this a self contradictory judgment Would it be permissible for one to pronounce this judgment that one can be a man without being a man if he did not admit the hypothesis that the concept of man can be separated from the existence the essence from the appearance They say he appears indeed as a man but is not a man Men have passed this self contradictory judgment through a long line of centuries Nay what is still more in this long time there were only un men What individual can have corresponded to his concept Christianity knows only one Man and this one Christ is at once an un man again in the reverse sense to wit a superhuman man a God Only the un man is a real man Men that are not men what should they be but ghosts Every real man because he does not correspond to the concept man or because he is not a generic man is a spook But do I still remain an un man even if I bring Man who towered above me and remained otherworldly to me only as my ideal my task my essence or concept down to be my quality my own and inherent in me so that Man is nothing else than my humanity my human existence and everything that I do is human precisely because I do it but not because it corresponds to the concept man I am really Man and the un man in one for I am a man and at the same time more than a man i e I am the ego of this my mere quality It had to come to this at last that it was no longer merely demanded of us to be Christians but to become men for though we could never really become even Christians but always remained poor sinners for the Christian was an unattainable ideal too yet in this the contradictoriness did not come before our consciousness so and the illusion was easier than now when of us who are men and act humanly yes cannot do otherwise than be such and act so the demand is made that we are to be men real men Our States of to day because they still have all sorts of things sticking to them left from their churchly mother do indeed load those who belong to them with various obligations e g churchly religiousness which properly do not a bit concern them the States yet on the whole they do not deny their significance since they want to be looked upon as human societies in which man as man can be a member even if he is less privileged than other members most of them admit adherents of every religious sect and receive people without distinction of race or nation Jews Turks Moors et cetera can become French citizens In the act of reception therefore the State looks only to see whether one is a man The Church as a society of believers could not receive every man into her bosom the State as a society of men can But when the State has carried its principle clear through of presupposing in its constituents nothing but that they are men even the North Americans still presuppose in theirs that they have religion at least the religion of integrity of respectability then it has dug its grave While it will fancy that those whom it possesses are without exception men these have meanwhile become without exception egoists each of whom utilizes it according to his egoistic powers and ends Against the egoists human society is wrecked for they no longer have to do with each other as men but appear egoistically as an I against a You altogether different from me and in opposition to me If the State must count on our humanity it is the same if one says it must count on our morality Seeing Man in each other and acting as men toward each other is called moral behavior This is every whit the spiritual love of Christianity For if I see Man in you as in myself I see Man and nothing but Man then I care for you as I would care for myself for we represent you see nothing but the mathematical proposition A C and B C consequently A B i e I nothing but man and you nothing but man consequently I and you the same Morality is incompatible with egoism because the former does not allow validity to me but only to the Man in me But if the State is a society of men not a union of egos each of whom has only himself before his eyes then it cannot last without morality and must insist on morality Therefore we two the State and I are enemies I the egoist have not at heart the welfare of this human society I sacrifice nothing to it I only utilize it but to be able to utilize it completely I transform it rather into my property and my creature i e I annihilate it and form in its place the Union of Egoists So the State betrays its enmity to me by demanding that I be a man which presupposes that I may also not be a man but rank for it as an un man it imposes being a man upon me as a duty Further it desires me to do nothing along with which it cannot last so its permanence is to be sacred for me Then I am not to be an egoist but a respectable upright i e moral man Enough before it and its permanence I am to be impotent and respectful et cetera This State not a present one indeed but still in need of being first created is the ideal of advancing liberalism There is to come into existence a true society of men in which every man finds room Liberalism means to realize Man i e create a world for him and this should be the human world or the general Communistic society of men It was said The Church could regard only the spirit the State is to regard the whole man one hundred twenty one But is not Man spirit The kernel of the State is simply Man this unreality and it itself is only a society of men The world which the believer believing spirit creates is called Church the world which the man human or humane spirit creates is called State But that is not my world I never execute anything human in the abstract but always my own things i e my human act is diverse from every other human act and only by this diversity is it a real act belonging to me The human in it is an abstraction and as such spirit i e abstracted essence Br Bauer states e g Judenfrage p eighty four that the truth of criticism is the final truth and in fact the truth sought for by Christianity itself to wit Man He says The history of the Christian world is the history of the supreme fight for truth for in it and in it only the thing at issue is the discovery of the final or the primal truth man and freedom All right let us accept this gain and let us take man as the ultimately found result of Christian history and of the religious or ideal efforts of man in general Now who is Man I am Man the end and outcome of Christianity is as I the beginning and raw material of the new history a history of enjoyment after the history of sacrifices a history not of man or humanity but of me Man ranks as the general Now then I and the egoistic are the really general since every one is an egoist and of paramount importance to himself The Jewish is not the purely egoistic because the Jew still devotes himself to Jehovah the Christian is not because the Christian lives on the grace of God and subjects himself to him As Jew and as Christian alike a man satisfies only certain of his wants only a certain need not himself a half egoism because the egoism of a half man who is half he half Jew or half his own proprietor half a slave Therefore too Jew and Christian always half way exclude each other i e as men they recognize each other as slaves they exclude each other because they are servants of two different masters If they could be complete egoists they would exclude each other wholly and hold together so much the more firmly Their ignominy is not that they exclude each other but that this is done only half way Br Bauer on the contrary thinks Jews and Christians cannot regard and treat each other as men till they give up the separate essence which parts them and obligates them to eternal separation recognize the general essence of Man and regard this as their true essence According to his representation the defect of the Jews and the Christians alike lies in their wanting to be and have something particular instead of only being men and endeavoring after what is human to wit the general rights of man He thinks their fundamental error consists in the belief that they are privileged possess prerogatives in general in the belief in prerogative one hundred twenty two In opposition to this he holds up to them the general rights of man The rights of man Man is man in general and in so far every one who is a man Now every one is to have the eternal rights of man and according to the opinion of Communism enjoy them in the complete democracy or as it ought more correctly to be called anthropocracy But it is I alone who have everything that I procure for myself as man I have nothing People would like to give every man an affluence of all good merely because he has the title man But I put the accent on me not on my being man Man is something only as my quality one hundred twenty three property one hundred twenty four like masculinity or femininity The ancients found the ideal in one s being male in the full sense their virtue is virtus and arete i e manliness What is one to think of a woman who should want only to be perfectly woman That is not given to all and many a one would therein be fixing for herself an unattainable goal Feminine on the other hand she is anyhow by nature femininity is her quality and she does not need true femininity I am a man just as the earth is a star As ridiculous as it would be to set the earth the task of being a thorough star so ridiculous it is to burden me with the call to be a thorough man When Fichte says The ego is all this seems to harmonize perfectly with my theses But it is not that the ego is all but the ego destroys all and only the self dissolving ego the never being ego the finite ego is really I Fichte speaks of the absolute ego but I speak of me the transitory ego How natural is the supposition that man and ego mean the same and yet one sees e g by Feuerbach that the expression man is to designate the absolute ego the species not the transitory individual ego Egoism and humanity humaneness ought to mean the same but according to Feuerbach the individual can only lift himself above the limits of his individuality but not above the laws the positive ordinances of his species one hundred twenty five But the species is nothing and if the individual lifts himself above the limits of his individuality this is rather his very self as an individual he exists only in raising himself he exists only in not remaining what he is otherwise he would be done dead Man with the great M is only an ideal the species only something thought of To be a man is not to realize the ideal of Man but to present oneself the individual It is not how I realize the generally human that needs to be my task but how I satisfy myself I am my species am without norm without law without model and the like It is possible that I can make very little out of myself but this little is everything and is better than what I allow to be made out of me by the might of others by the training of custom religion the laws the State et cetera Better if the talk is to be of better at all better an unmannerly child than an old head on young shoulders better a mulish man than a man compliant in everything The unmannerly and mulish fellow is still on the way to form himself according to his own will the prematurely knowing and compliant one is determined by the species the general demands et cetera the species is law to him He is determined one hundred twenty six by it for what else is the species to him but his destiny one hundred twenty seven his calling Whether I look to humanity the species in order to strive toward this ideal or to God and Christ with like endeavor where is the essential dissimilarity At most the former is more washed out than the latter As the individual is the whole of nature so he is the whole of the species too Everything that I do think et cetera in short my expression or manifestation is indeed conditioned by what I am The Jew e g can will only thus or thus can present himself only thus the Christian can present and manifest himself only christianly et cetera If it were possible that you could be a Jew or Christian you would indeed bring out only what was Jewish or Christian but it is not possible in the most rigorous conduct you yet remain an egoist a sinner against that concept i e you are not the precise equivalent of Jew Now because the egoistic always keeps peeping through people have inquired for a more perfect concept which should really wholly express what you are and which because it is your true nature should contain all the laws of your activity The most perfect thing of the kind has been attained in Man As a Jew you are too little and the Jewish is not your task to be a Greek a German does not suffice But be a man then you have everything look upon the human as your calling Now I know what is expected of me and the new catechism can be written The subject is again subjected to the predicate the individual to something general the dominion is again secured to an idea and the foundation laid for a new religion This is a step forward in the domain of religion and in particular of Christianity not a step out beyond it The step out beyond it leads into the unspeakable For me paltry language has no word and the Word the Logos is to me a mere word My essence is sought for If not the Jew the German et cetera then at any rate it is the man Man is my essence I am repulsive or repugnant to myself I have a horror and loathing of myself I am a horror to myself or I am never enough for myself and never do enough to satisfy myself From such feelings springs self dissolution or self criticism Religiousness begins with self renunciation ends with completed criticism I am possessed and want to get rid of the evil spirit How do I set about it I fearlessly commit the sin that seems to the Christian the direst the sin and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit He who blasphemes the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever but is liable to the eternal judgment one hundred twenty eight I want no forgiveness and am not afraid of the judgment Man is the last evil spirit or spook the most deceptive or most intimate the craftiest liar with honest mien the father of lies The egoist turning against the demands and concepts of the present executes pitilessly the most measureless desecration Nothing is holy to him It would be foolish to assert that there is no power above mine Only the attitude that I take toward it will be quite another than that of the religious age I shall be the enemy of every higher power while religion teaches us to make it our friend and be humble toward it The desecrator puts forth his strength against every fear of God for fear of God would determine him in everything that he left standing as sacred Whether it is the God or the Man that exercises the hallowing power in the God man whether therefore anything is held sacred for God s sake or for Man s Humanity s this does not change the fear of God since Man is revered as supreme essence as much as on the specifically religious standpoint God as supreme essence calls for our fear and reverence both overawe us The fear of God in the proper sense was shaken long ago and a more or less conscious atheism externally recognizable by a wide spread unchurchliness has involuntarily become the mode But what was taken from God has been superadded to Man and the power of humanity grew greater in just the degree that that of piety lost weight Man is the God of to day and fear of Man has taken the place of the old fear of God But because Man represents only another Supreme Being nothing has in fact taken place but a metamorphosis in the Supreme Being and the fear of Man is merely an altered form of the fear of God Our atheists are pious people If in the so called feudal times we held everything as a fief from God in the liberal period the same feudal relation exists with Man God was the Lord now Man is the Lord God was the Mediator now Man is God was the Spirit now Man is In this threefold regard the feudal relation has experienced a transformation For now firstly we hold as a fief from all powerful Man our power which because it comes from a higher is not called power or might but right the rights of man we further hold as a fief from him our position in the world for he the mediator mediates our intercourse with others which therefore may not be otherwise than human finally we hold as a fief from him ourselves to wit our own value or all that we are worth inasmuch as we are worth nothing when he does not dwell in us and when or where we are not human The power is Man s the world is Man s I am Man s But am I not still unrestrained from declaring myself the entitler the mediator and the own self Then it runs thus My power is my property My power gives me property My power am I myself and through it am I my property I MY POWER Right one hundred twenty nine is the spirit of society If society has a will this will is simply right society exists only through right But as it endures only by exercising a sovereignty over individuals right is its SOVEREIGN WILL Aristotle says justice is the advantage of society All existing right is foreign law some one makes me out to be in the right does right by me But should I therefore be in the right if all the world made me out so And yet what else is the right that I obtain in the State in society but a right of those foreign to me When a blockhead makes me out in the right I grow distrustful of my rightness I don t like to receive it from him But even when a wise man makes me out in the right I nevertheless am not in the right on that account Whether I am in the right is completely independent of the fool s making out and of the wise man s All the same we have coveted this right till now We seek for right and turn to the court for that purpose To what To a royal a papal a popular court et cetera Can a sultanic court declare another right than that which the sultan has ordained to be right Can it make me out in the right if I seek for a right that does not agree with the sultan s law Can it e g concede to me high treason as a right since it is assuredly not a right according to the sultan s mind Can it as a court of censorship allow me the free utterance of opinion as a right since the sultan will hear nothing of this my right What am I seeking for in this court then I am seeking for sultanic right not my right I am seeking for foreign right As long as this foreign right harmonizes with mine to be sure I shall find in it the latter too The State does not permit pitching into each other man to man it opposes the duel Even every ordinary appeal to blows notwithstanding that neither of the fighters calls the police to it is punished except when it is not an I whacking away at a you but say the head of a family at the child The family is entitled to this and in its name the father I as Ego am not The Vossische Zeitung presents to us the commonwealth of right There everything is to be decided by the judge and a court It ranks the supreme court of censorship as a court where right is declared What sort of a right The right of the censorship To recognize the sentences of that court as right one must regard the censorship as right But it is thought nevertheless that this court offers a protection Yes protection against an individual censor s error it protects only the censorship legislator against false interpretation of his will at the same time making his statute by the sacred power of right all the firmer against writers Whether I am in the right or not there is no judge but myself Others can judge only whether they endorse my right and whether it exists as right for them too In the meantime let us take the matter yet another way I am to reverence sultanic law in the sultanate popular law in republics canon law in Catholic communities et cetera To these laws I am to subordinate myself I am to regard them as sacred A sense of right and law abiding mind of such a sort is so firmly planted in people s heads that the most revolutionary persons of our days want to subject us to a new sacred law the law of society the law of mankind the right of all and the like The right of all is to go before my right As a right of all it would indeed be my right among the rest since I with the rest am included in all but that it is at the same time a right of others or even of all others does not move me to its upholding Not as a right of all will I defend it but as my right and then every other may see to it how he shall likewise maintain it for himself The right of all e g to eat is a right of every individual Let each keep this right unabridged for himself then all exercise it spontaneously let him not take care for all though let him not grow zealous for it as for a right of all But the social reformers preach to us a law of society There the individual becomes society s slave and is in the right only when society makes him out in the right i e when he lives according to society s statutes and so is loyal Whether I am loyal under a despotism or in a society a la Weitling it is the same absence of right in so far as in both cases I have not my right but foreign right In considerations of right the question is always asked What or who gives me the right to it Answer God love reason nature humanity et cetera No only your might your power gives you the right your reason e g may give it to you Communism which assumes that men have equal rights by nature contradicts its own proposition till it comes to this that men have no right at all by nature For it is not willing to recognize e g that parents have by nature rights as against their children or the children as against the parents it abolishes the family Nature gives parents brothers et cetera no right at all Altogether this entire revolutionary or Babouvist principle one hundred thirty rests on a religious i e false view of things Who can ask after right if he does not occupy the religious standpoint himself Is not right a religious concept i e something sacred Why equality of rights as the Revolution propounded it is only another name for Christian equality the equality of the brethren of God s children of Christians et cetera in short fraternite Each and every inquiry after right deserves to be lashed with Schillers words Many a year I ve used my nose To smell the onion and the rose Is there any proof which shows That I ve a right to that same nose When the Revolution stamped equality as a right it took flight into the religious domain into the region of the sacred of the ideal Hence since then the fight for the sacred inalienable rights of man Against the eternal rights of man the well earned rights of the established order are quite naturally and with equal right brought to bear right against right where of course one is decried by the other as wrong This has been the contest of rights one hundred thirty one since the Revolution You want to be in the right as against the rest That you cannot as against them you remain forever in the wrong for they surely would not be your opponents if they were not in their right too they will always make you out in the wrong But as against the right of the rest yours is a higher greater more powerful right is it not No such thing Your right is not more powerful if you are not more powerful Have Chinese subjects a right to freedom Just bestow it on them and then look how far you have gone wrong in your attempt because they do not know how to use freedom they have no right to it or in clearer terms because they have not freedom they have not the right to it Children have no right to the condition of majority because they are not of age i e because they are children Peoples that let themselves be kept in nonage have no right to the condition of majority if they ceased to be in nonage then only would they have the right to be of age This means nothing else than What you have the power to be you have the right to I derive all right and all warrant from me I am entitled to everything that I have in my power I am entitled to overthrow Zeus Jehovah God et cetera if I can if I cannot then these gods will always remain in the right and in power as against me and what I do will be to fear their right and their power in impotent god fearingness to keep their commandments and believe that I do right in everything that I do according to their right about as the Russian boundary sentinels think themselves rightfully entitled to shoot dead the suspicious persons who are escaping since they murder by superior authority i e with right But I am entitled by myself to murder if I myself do not forbid it to myself if I myself do not fear murder as a wrong This view of things lies at the foundation of Chamisso s poem The Valley of Murder where the gray haired Indian murderer compels reverence from the white man whose brethren he has murdered The only thing I am not entitled to is what I do not do with a free cheer i e what I do not entitle myself to I decide whether it is the right thing in me there is no right outside me If it is right for me one hundred thirty two it is right Possibly this may not suffice to make it right for the rest that is their care not mine let them defend themselves And if for the whole world something were not right but it were right for me i e I wanted it then I would ask nothing about the whole world So every one does who knows how to value himself every one in the degree that he is an egoist for might goes before right and that with perfect right Because I am by nature a man I have an equal right to the enjoyment of all goods says Babeuf Must he not also say because I am by nature a first born prince I have a right to the throne The rights of man and the well earned rights come to the same thing in the end to wit to nature which gives me a right i e to birth and further inheritance et cetera I am born as a man is equal to I am born as a king s son The natural man has only a natural right because he has only a natural power and natural claims he has right of birth and claims of birth But nature cannot entitle me i e give me capacity or might to that to which only my act entitles me That the king s child sets himself above other children even this is his act which secures to him the precedence and that the other children approve and recognize this act is their act which makes them worthy to be subjects Whether nature gives me a right or whether God the people s choice et cetera does so all of that is the same foreign right a right that I do not give or take to myself Thus the Communists say equal labor entitles man to equal enjoyment Formerly the question was raised whether the virtuous man must not be happy on earth The Jews actually drew this inference That it may go well with thee on earth No equal labor does not entitle you to it but equal enjoyment alone entitles you to equal enjoyment Enjoy then you are entitled to enjoyment But if you have labored and let the enjoyment be taken from you then it serves you right If you take the enjoyment it is your right if on the contrary you only pine for it without laying hands on it it remains as before a well earned right of those who are privileged for enjoyment It is their right as by laying hands on it it would become your right The conflict over the right of property wavers in vehement commotion The Communists affirm one hundred thirty three that the earth belongs rightfully to him who tills it and its products to those who bring them out I think it belongs to him who knows how to take it or who does not let it be taken from him does not let himself be deprived of it If he appropriates it then not only the earth but the right to it too belongs to him This is egoistic right i e it is right for me therefore it is right Aside from this right does have a wax nose The tiger that assails me is in the right and I who strike him down am also in the right I defend against him not my right but myself As human right is always something given it always in reality reduces to the right which men give i e concede to each other If the right to existence is conceded to new born children then they have the right if it is not conceded to them as was the case among the Spartans and ancient Romans then they do not have it For only society can give or concede it to them they themselves cannot take it or give it to themselves It will be objected the children had nevertheless by nature the right to exist only the Spartans refused recognition to this right But then they simply had no right to this recognition no more than they had to recognition of their life by the wild beasts to which they were thrown People talk so much about birthright and complain There is alas no mention of the rights That were born with us one hundred thirty four What sort of right then is there that was born with me The right to receive an entailed estate to inherit a throne to enjoy a princely or noble education or again because poor parents begot me to get free schooling be clothed out of contributions of alms and at last earn my bread and my herring in the coal mines or at the loom Are these not birthrights rights that have come down to me from my parents through birth You think no you think these are only rights improperly so called it is just these rights that you aim to abolish through the real birthright To give a basis for this you go back to the simplest thing and affirm that every one is by birth equal to another to wit a man I will grant you that every one is born as man hence the new born are therein equal to each other Why are they Only because they do not yet show and exert themselves as anything but bare children of men naked little human beings But thereby they are at once different from those who have already made something out of themselves who thus are no longer bare children of men but children of their own creation The latter possess more than bare birthrights they have earned rights What an antithesis what a field of combat The old combat of the birthrights of man and well earned rights Go right on appealing to your birthrights people will not fail to oppose to you the well earned Both stand on the ground of right for each of the two has a right against the other the one the birthright or natural right the other the earned or well earned right If you remain on the ground of right you remain in Rechthaberei one hundred thirty five The other cannot give you your right he cannot mete out right to you He who has might has right if you have not the former neither have you the latter Is this wisdom so hard to attain Just look at the mighty and their doings We are talking here only of China and Japan of course Just try it once you Chinese and Japanese to make them out in the wrong and learn by experience how they throw you into jail Only do not confuse with this the well meaning counsels which in China and Japan are permitted because they do not hinder the mighty one but possibly help him on For him who should want to make them out in the wrong there would stand open only one way thereto that of might If he deprives them of their might then he has really made them out in the wrong deprived them of their right in any other case he can do nothing but clench his little fist in his pocket or fall a victim as an obtrusive fool In short if you Chinese and Japanese did not ask after right and in particular if you did not ask after the rights that were born with you then you would not need to ask at all after the well earned rights either You start back in fright before others because you think you see beside them the ghost of right which as in the Homeric combats seems to fight as a goddess at their side helping them What do you do Do you throw the spear No you creep around to gain the spook over to yourselves that it may fight on your side you woo for the ghost s favor Another would simply ask thus Do I will what my opponent wills No Now then there may fight for him a thousand devils or gods I go at him all the same The commonwealth of right as the Vossische Zeitung among others stands for it asks that office holders be removable only by the judge not by the administration Vain illusion If it were settled by law that an office holder who is once seen drunken shall lose his office then the judges would have to condemn him on the word of the witnesses et cetera In short the lawgiver would only have to state precisely all the possible grounds which entail the loss of office however laughable they might be e g he who laughs in his superiors faces who does not go to church every Sunday who does not take the communion every four weeks who runs in debt who has disreputable associates who shows no determination et cetera shall be removed These things the lawgiver might take it into his head to prescribe e g for a court of honor then the judge would solely have to investigate whether the accused had become guilty of those offences and on presentation of the proof pronounce sentence of removal against him in the name of the law The judge is lost when he ceases to be mechanical when he is forsaken by the rules of evidence Then he no longer has anything but an opinion like everybody else and if he decides according to this opinion his action is no longer an official action As judge he must decide only according to the law Commend me rather to the old French parliaments which wanted to examine for themselves what was to be matter of right and to register it only after their own approval They at least judged according to a right of their own and were not willing to give themselves up to be machines of the lawgiver although as judges they must to be sure become their own machines It is said that punishment is the criminal s right But impunity is just as much his right If his undertaking succeeds it serves him right and if it does not succeed it likewise serves him right You make your bed and lie in it If some one goes foolhardily into dangers and perishes in them we are apt to say It serves him right he would have it so But if he conquered the dangers i e if his might was victorious then he would be in the right too If a child plays with the knife and gets cut it is served right but if it doesn t get cut it is served right too Hence right befalls the criminal doubtless when he suffers what he risked why what did he risk it for since he knew the possible consequences But the punishment that we decree against him is only our right not his Our right reacts against his and he is in the wrong at last because we get the upper hand But what is right what is matter of right in a society is voiced too in the law one hundred thirty six Whatever the law may be it must be respected by the loyal citizen Thus the law abiding mind of Old England is eulogized To this that Euripidean sentiment Orestes four hundred eighteen entirely corresponds We serve the gods whatever the gods are Law as such God as such thus far we are to day People are at pains to distinguish law from arbitrary orders from an ordinance the former comes from a duly entitled authority But a law over human action ethical law State law et cetera is always a declaration of will and so an order Yes even if I myself gave myself the law it would yet be only my order to which in the next moment I can refuse obedience One may well enough declare what he will put up with and so deprecate the opposite by a law making known that in the contrary case he will treat the transgressor as his enemy but no one has any business to command my actions to say what course I shall pursue and set up a code to govern it I must put up with it that he treats me as his enemy but never that he makes free with me as his creature and that he makes his reason or even unreason my plumb line States last only so long as there is a ruling will and this ruling will is looked upon as tantamount to the own will The lord s will is law What do your laws amount to if no one obeys them what your orders if nobody lets himself be ordered The State cannot forbear the claim to determine the individual s will to speculate and count on this For the State it is indispensable that nobody have an own will if one had the State would have to exclude lock up banish et cetera this one if all had they would do away with the State The State is not thinkable without lordship and servitude subjection for the State must will to be the lord of all that it embraces and this will is called the will of the State He who to hold his own must count on the absence of will in others is a thing made by these others as the master is a thing made by the servant If submissiveness ceased it would be all over with lordship The own will of Me is the State s destroyer it is therefore branded by the State as self will Own will and the State are powers in deadly hostility between which no eternal peace is possible As long as the State asserts itself it represents own will its ever hostile opponent as unreasonable evil et cetera and the latter lets itself be talked into believing this nay it really is such for no more reason than this that it still lets itself be talked into such belief it has not yet come to itself and to the consciousness of its dignity hence it is still incomplete still amenable to fine words et cetera Every State is a despotism be the despot one or many or as one is likely to imagine about a republic if all be lords i e despotize one over another For this is the case when the law given at any time the expressed volition of it may be a popular assembly is thenceforth to be law for the individual to which obedience is due from him or toward which he has the duty of obedience If one were even to conceive the case that every individual in the people had expressed the same will and hereby a complete collective will had come into being the matter would still remain the same Would I not be bound to day and henceforth to my will of yesterday My will would in this case be frozen Wretched stability My creature to wit a particular expression of will would have become my commander But I in my will I the creator should be hindered in my flow and my dissolution Because I was a fool yesterday I must remain such my life long So in the State life I am at best I might just as well say at worst a bondman of myself Because I was a willer yesterday I am to day without will yesterday voluntary to day involuntary How change it Only by recognizing no duty i e not binding myself nor letting myself be bound If I have no duty then I know no law either But they will bind me My will nobody can bind and my disinclination remains free Why everything must go topsy turvy if every one could do what he would Well who says that every one can do everything What are you there for pray you who do not need to put up with everything Defend yourself and no one will do anything to you He who would break your will has to do with you and is your enemy Deal with him as such If there stand behind you for your protection some millions more then you are an imposing power and will have an easy victory But even if as a power you overawe your opponent still you are not on that account a hallowed authority to him unless he be a simpleton He does not owe you respect and regard even though he will have to consider your might We are accustomed to classify States according to the different ways in which the supreme might is distributed If an individual has it monarchy if all have it democracy et cetera Supreme might then Might against whom Against the individual and his self will The State practises violence the individual must not do so The State s behavior is violence and it calls its violence law that of the individual crime Crime one hundred thirty seven then so the individual s violence is called and only by crime does he overcome one hundred thirty eight the State s violence when he thinks that the State is not above him but he above the State Now if I wanted to act ridiculously I might as a well meaning person admonish you not to make laws which impair my self development self activity self creation I do not give this advice For if you should follow it you would be unwise and I should have been cheated of my entire profit I request nothing at all from you for whatever I might demand you would still be dictatorial lawgivers and must be so because a raven cannot sing nor a robber live without robbery Rather do I ask those who would be egoists what they think the more egoistic to let laws be given them by you and to respect those that are given or to practise refractoriness yes complete disobedience Good hearted people think the laws ought to prescribe only what is accepted in the people s feeling as right and proper But what concern is it of mine what is accepted in the nation and by the nation The nation will perhaps be against the blasphemer therefore a law against blasphemy Am I not to blaspheme on that account Is this law to be more than an order to me I put the question Solely from the principle that all right and all authority belong to the collectivity of the people do all forms of government arise For none of them lacks this appeal to the collectivity and the despot as well as the president or any aristocracy et cetera acts and commands in the name of the State They are in possession of the authority of the State and it is perfectly indifferent whether were this possible the people as a collectivity all individuals exercise this State authority or whether it is only the representatives of this collectivity be there many of them as in aristocracies or one as in monarchies Always the collectivity is above the individual and has a power which is called legitimate i e which is law Over against the sacredness of the State the individual is only a vessel of dishonor in which exuberance malevolence mania for ridicule and slander frivolity et cetera are left as soon as he does not deem that object of veneration the State to be worthy of recognition The spiritual haughtiness of the servants and subjects of the State has fine penalties against unspiritual exuberance When the government designates as punishable an play of mind against the State the moderate liberals come and opine that fun satire wit humor et cetera must have free play anyhow and genius must enjoy freedom So not the individual man indeed but still genius is to be free Here the State or in its name the government says with perfect right He who is not for me is against me Fun wit et cetera in short the turning of State affairs into a comedy have undermined States from of old they are not innocent And further what boundaries are to be drawn between guilty and innocent wit et cetera At this question the moderates fall into great perplexity and everything reduces itself to the prayer that the State government would please not be so sensitive so ticklish that it would not immediately scent malevolence in harmless things and would in general be a little more tolerant Exaggerated sensitiveness is certainly a weakness its avoidance may be a praiseworthy virtue but in time of war one cannot be sparing and what may be allowed under peaceable circumstances ceases to be permitted as soon as a state of siege is declared Because the well meaning liberals feel this plainly they hasten to declare that considering the devotion of the people there is assuredly no danger to be feared But the government will be wiser and not let itself be talked into believing anything of that sort It knows too well how people stuff one with fine words and will not let itself be satisfied with this Barmecide dish But they are bound to have their play ground for they are children you know and cannot be so staid as old folks boys will be boys Only for this play ground only for a few hours of jolly running about they bargain They ask only that the State should not like a splenetic papa be too cross It should permit some Processions of the Ass and plays of fools as the church allowed them in the Middle Ages But the times when it could grant this without danger are past Children that now once come into the open and live through an hour without the rod of discipline are no longer willing to go into the cell For the open is now no longer a supplement to the cell no longer a refreshing recreation but its opposite an aut aut In short the State must either no longer put up with anything or put up with everything and perish it must be either sensitive through and through or like a dead man insensitive Tolerance is done with If the State but gives a finger they take the whole hand at once There can be no more jesting and all jest such as fun wit humor et cetera becomes bitter earnest The clamor of the Liberals for freedom of the press runs counter to their own principle their proper will They will what they do not will i e they wish they would like Hence it is too that they fall away so easily when once so called freedom of the press appears then they would like censorship Quite naturally The State is sacred even to them likewise morals et cetera They behave toward it only as ill bred brats as tricky children who seek to utilize the weaknesses of their parents Papa State is to permit them to say many things that do not please him but papa has the right by a stern look to blue pencil their impertinent gabble If they recognize in him their papa they must in his presence put up with the censorship of speech like every child If you let yourself be made out in the right by another you must no less let yourself be made out in the wrong by him if justification and reward come to you from him expect also his arraignment and punishment Alongside right goes wrong alongside legality crime What are you You are a criminal The criminal is in the utmost degree the State s own crime says Bettina one hundred thirty nine One may let this sentiment pass even if Bettina herself does not understand it exactly so For in the State the unbridled I I as I belong to myself alone cannot come to my fulfilment and realization Every ego is from birth a criminal to begin with against the people the State Hence it is that it does really keep watch over all it sees in each one an egoist and it is afraid of the egoist It presumes the worst about each one and takes care police care that no harm happens to the State ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat The unbridled ego and this we originally are and in our secret inward parts we remain so always is the never ceasing criminal in the State The man whom his boldness his will his inconsiderateness and fearlessness lead is surrounded with spies by the State by the people I say by the people The people think it something wonderful you good hearted folks what you have in the people the people is full of police sentiments through and through Only he who renounces his ego who practises self renunciation is acceptable to the people In the book cited Bettina is throughout good natured enough to regard the State as only sick and to hope for its recovery a recovery which she would bring about through the demagogues one hundred forty but it is not sick rather is it in its full strength when it puts from it the demagogues who want to acquire something for the individuals for all In its believers it is provided with the best demagogues leaders of the people According to Bettina the State is to one hundred forty one develop mankind s germ of freedom otherwise it is a raven mother one hundred forty two and caring for raven fodder It cannot do otherwise for in its very caring for mankind which besides would have to be the humane or free State to begin with the individual is raven fodder for it How rightly speaks the burgomaster on the other hand one hundred forty three What the State has no other duty than to be merely the attendant of incurable invalids That isn t to the point From of old the healthy State has relieved itself of the diseased matter and not mixed itself with it It does not need to be so economical with its juices Cut off the robber branches without hesitation that the others may bloom Do not shiver at the State s harshness its morality its policy and religion point it to that Accuse it of no want of feeling its sympathy revolts against this but its experience finds safety only in this severity There are diseases in which only drastic remedies will help The physician who recognizes the disease as such but timidly turns to palliatives will never remove the disease but may well cause the patient to succumb after a shorter or longer sickness Frau Rat s question If you apply death as a drastic remedy how is the cure to be wrought then isn t to the point Why the State does not apply death against itself but against an offensive member it tears out an eye that offends it et cetera For the invalid State the only way of salvation is to make man flourish in it one hundred forty four If one here like Bettina understands by man the concept Man she is right the invalid State will recover by the flourishing of Man for the more infatuated the individuals are with Man the better it serves the State s turn But if one referred it to the individuals to all and the authoress half does this too because about Man she is still involved in vagueness then it would sound somewhat like the following For an invalid band of robbers the only way of salvation is to make the loyal citizen flourish in it Why thereby the band of robbers would simply go to ruin as a band of robbers and because it perceives this it prefers to shoot every one who has a leaning toward becoming a steady man In this book Bettina is a patriot or what is little more a philanthropist a worker for human happiness She is discontented with the existing order in quite the same way as is the title ghost of her book along with all who would like to bring back the good old faith and what goes with it Only she thinks contrariwise that the politicians place holders and diplomats ruined the State while those lay it at the door of the malevolent the seducers of the people What is the ordinary criminal but one who has committed the fatal mistake of endeavoring after what is the people s instead of seeking for what is his He has sought despicable alien goods has done what believers do who seek after what is God s What does the priest who admonishes the criminal do He sets before him the great wrong of having desecrated by his act what was hallowed by the State its property in which of course must be included even the life of those who belong to the State instead of this he might rather hold up to him the fact that he has befouled himself in not despising the alien thing but thinking it worth stealing he could if he were not a parson Talk with the so called criminal as with an egoist and he will be ashamed not that he transgressed against your laws and goods but that he considered your laws worth evading your goods worth desiring he will be ashamed that he did not despise you and yours together that he was too little an egoist But you cannot talk egoistically with him for you are not so great as a criminal you commit no crime You do not know that an ego who is his own cannot desist from being a criminal that crime is his life And yet you should know it since you believe that we are all miserable sinners but you think surreptitiously to get beyond sin you do not comprehend for you are devil fearing that guilt is the value of a man Oh if you were guilty But now you are righteous one hundred forty five Well just put every thing nicely to rights one hundred forty six for your master When the Christian consciousness or the Christian man draws up a criminal code what can the concept of crime be there but simply heartlessness Each severing and wounding of a heart relation each heartless behavior toward a sacred being is crime The more heartfelt the relation is supposed to be the more scandalous is the deriding of it and the more worthy of punishment the crime Every one who is subject to the lord should love him to deny this love is a high treason worthy of death Adultery is a heartlessness worthy of punishment one has no heart no enthusiasm no pathetic feeling for the sacredness of marriage So long as the heart or soul dictates laws only the heartful or soulful man enjoys the protection of the laws That the man of soul makes laws means properly only that the moral man makes them what contradicts these men s moral feeling this they penalize How e g should disloyalty secession breach of oaths in short all radical breaking off all tearing asunder of venerable ties not be flagitious and criminal in their eyes He who breaks with these demands of the soul has for enemies all the moral all the men of soul Only Krummacher and his mates are the right people to set up consistently a penal code of the heart as a certain bill sufficiently proves The consistent legislation of the Christian State must be placed wholly in the hands of the parsons and will not become pure and coherent so long as it is worked out only by the parson ridden who are always only half parsons Only then will every lack of soulfulness every heartlessness be certified as an unpardonable crime only then will every agitation of the soul become condemnable every objection of criticism and doubt be anathematized only then is the own man before the Christian consciousness a convicted criminal to begin with The men of the Revolution often talked of the people s just revenge as its right Revenge and right coincide here Is this an attitude of an ego to an ego The people cries that the opposite party has committed crimes against it Can I assume that one commits a crime against me without assuming that he has to act as I see fit And this action I call the right the good et cetera the divergent action a crime So I think that the others must aim at the same goal with me i e I do not treat them as unique beings one hundred forty seven who bear their law in themselves and live according to it but as beings who are to obey some rational law I set up what Man is and what acting in a truly human way is and I demand of every one that this law become norm and ideal to him otherwise he will expose himself as a sinner and criminal But upon the guilty falls the penalty of the law One sees here how it is Man again who sets on foot even the concept of crime of sin and therewith that of right A man in whom I do not recognize Man is a sinner a guilty one Only against a sacred thing are there criminals you against me can never be a criminal but only an opponent But not to hate him who injures a sacred thing is in itself a crime as saint Just cries out against Danton Are you not a criminal and responsible for not having hated the enemies of the fatherland If as in the Revolution what Man is is apprehended as good citizen then from this concept of Man we have the well known political offences and crimes In all this the individual the individual man is regarded as refuse and on the other hand the general man Man is honored Now according to how this ghost is named as Christian Jew Mussulman good citizen loyal subject freeman patriot et cetera just so do those who would like to carry through a divergent concept of man as well as those who want to put themselves through fall before victorious Man And with what unction the butchery goes on here in the name of the law of the sovereign people of God et cetera Now if the persecuted trickily conceal and protect themselves from the stern parsonical judges people stigmatize them as hypocrites as saint Just e g does those whom he accuses in the speech against Danton one hundred forty eight One is to be a fool and deliver himself up to their Moloch Crimes spring from fixed ideas The sacredness of marriage is a fixed idea From the sacredness it follows that infidelity is a crime and therefore a certain marriage law imposes upon it a shorter or longer penalty But by those who proclaim freedom as sacred this penalty must be regarded as a crime against freedom and only in this sense has public opinion in fact branded the marriage law Society would have every one come to his right indeed but yet only to that which is sanctioned by society to the society right not really to his right But I give or take to myself the right out of my own plenitude of power and against every superior power I am the most impenitent criminal Owner and creator of my right I recognize no other source of right than me neither God nor the State nor nature nor even man himself with his eternal rights of man neither divine nor human right Right in and for itself Without relation to me therefore Absolute right Separated from me therefore A thing that exists in and for itself An absolute An eternal right like an eternal truth According to the liberal way of thinking right is to be obligatory for me because it is thus established by human reason against which my reason is unreason Formerly people inveighed in the name of divine reason against weak human reason now in the name of strong human reason against egoistic reason which is rejected as unreason And yet none is real but this very unreason Neither divine nor human reason but only your and my reason existing at any given time is real as and because you and I are real The thought of right is originally my thought or it has its origin in me But when it has sprung from me when the Word is out then it has become flesh it is a fixed idea Now I no longer get rid of the thought however I turn it stands before me Thus men have not become masters again of the thought right which they themselves created their creature is running away with them This is absolute right that which is absolved or unfastened from me We revering it as absolute cannot devour it again and it takes from us the creative power the creature is more than the creator it is in and for itself Once you no longer let right run around free once you draw it back into its origin into you it is your right and that is right which suits you Right has had to suffer an attack within itself i e from the standpoint of right war being declared on the part of liberalism against privilege one hundred forty nine Privileged and endowed with equal rights on these two concepts turns a stubborn fight Excluded or admitted would mean the same But where should there be a power be it an imaginary one like God law or a real one like I you of which it should not be true that before it all are endowed with equal rights i e no respect of persons holds Every one is equally dear to God if he adores him equally agreeable to the law if only he is a law abiding person whether the lover of God and the law is humpbacked and lame whether poor or rich and the like that amounts to nothing for God and the law just so when you are at the point of drowning you like a negro as rescuer as well as the most excellent Caucasian yes in this situation you esteem a dog not less than a man But to whom will not every one be also contrariwise a preferred or disregarded person God punishes the wicked with his wrath the law chastises the lawless you let one visit you every moment and show the other the door The equality of right is a phantom just because right is nothing more and nothing less than admission i e a matter of grace which be it said one may also acquire by his desert for desert and grace are not contradictory since even grace wishes to be deserved and our gracious smile falls only to him who knows how to force it from us So people dream of all citizens of the State having to stand side by side with equal rights As citizens of the State they are certainly all equal for the State But it will divide them and advance them or put them in the rear according to its special ends if on no other account and still more must it distinguish them from one another as good and bad citizens Bruno Bauer disposes of the Jew question from the standpoint that privilege is not justified Because Jew and Christian have each some point of advantage over the other and in having this point of advantage are exclusive therefore before the critic s gaze they crumble into nothingness With them the State lies under the like blame since it justifies their having advantages and stamps it as a privilege or prerogative but thereby derogates from its calling to become a free State But now every one has something of advantage over another viz himself or his individuality in this everybody remains exclusive And again before a third party every one makes his peculiarity count for as much as possible and if he wants to win him at all tries to make it appear attractive before him Now is the third party to be insensible to the difference of the one from the other Do they ask that of the free State or of humanity Then these would have to be absolutely without self interest and incapable of taking an interest in any one whatever Neither God who divides his own from the wicked nor the State which knows how to separate good citizens from bad was thought of as so indifferent But they are looking for this very third party that bestows no more privilege Then it is called perhaps the free State or humanity or whatever else it may be As Christian and Jew are ranked low by Br Bauer on account of their asserting privileges it must be that they could and should free themselves from their narrow standpoint by self renunciation or unselfishness If they threw off their egoism the mutual wrong would cease and with it Christian and Jewish religiousness in general it would be necessary only that neither of them should any longer want to be anything peculiar But if they gave up this exclusiveness with that the ground on which their hostilities were waged would in truth not yet be forsaken In case of need they would indeed find a third thing on which they could unite a general religion a religion of humanity and the like in short an equalization which need not be better than that which would result if all Jews became Christians by which likewise the privilege of one over the other would have an end The tension one hundred fifty would indeed be done away but in this consisted not the essence of the two but only their neighborhood As being distinguished from each other they must necessarily be mutually resistant one hundred fifty one and the disparity will always remain Truly it is not a failing in you that you stiffen one hundred fifty two yourself against me and assert your distinctness or peculiarity you need not give way or renounce yourself People conceive the significance of the opposition too formally and weakly when they want only to dissolve it in order to make room for a third thing that shall unite The opposition deserves rather to be sharpened As Jew and Christian you are in too slight an opposition and are contending only about religion as it were about the emperor s beard about a fiddlestick s end Enemies in religion indeed in the rest you still remain good friends and equal to each other e g as men Nevertheless the rest too is unlike in each and the time when you no longer merely dissemble your opposition will be only when you entirely recognize it and everybody asserts himself from top to toe as unique one hundred fifty three Then the former opposition will assuredly be dissolved but only because a stronger has taken it up into itself Our weakness consists not in this that we are in opposition to others but in this that we are not completely so i e that we are not entirely severed from them or that we seek a communion a bond that in communion we have an ideal One faith one God one idea one hat for all If all were brought under one hat certainly no one would any longer need to take off his hat before another The last and most decided opposition that of unique against unique is at bottom beyond what is called opposition but without having sunk back into unity and unison As unique you have nothing in common with the other any longer and therefore nothing divisive or hostile either you are not seeking to be in the right against him before a third party and are standing with him neither on the ground of right nor on any other common ground The opposition vanishes in complete severance or singleness one hundred fifty four This might indeed be regarded as the new point in common or a new parity but here the parity consists precisely in the disparity and is itself nothing but disparity a par of disparity and that only for him who institutes a comparison The polemic against privilege forms a characteristic feature of liberalism which fumes against privilege because it itself appeals to right Further than to fuming it cannot carry this for privileges do not fall before right falls as they are only forms of right But right falls apart into its nothingness when it is swallowed up by might i e when one understands what is meant by Might goes before right All right explains itself then as privilege and privilege itself as power as superior power But must not the mighty combat against superior power show quite another face than the modest combat against privilege which is to be fought out before a first judge Right according to the judge s mind Now in conclusion I have still to take back the half way form of expression of which I was willing to make use only so long as I was still rooting among the entrails of right and letting the word at least stand But in fact with the concept the word too loses its meaning What I called my right is no longer right at all because right can be bestowed only by a spirit be it the spirit of nature or that of the species of mankind the Spirit of God or that of His Holiness or His Highness et cetera What I have without an entitling spirit I have without right I have it solely and alone through my power I do not demand any right therefore I need not recognize any either What I can get by force I get by force and what I do not get by force I have no right to nor do I give myself airs or consolation with my imprescriptible right With absolute right right itself passes away the dominion of the concept of right is canceled at the same time For it is not to be forgotten that hitherto concepts ideas or principles ruled us and that among these rulers the concept of right or of justice played one of the most important parts Entitled or unentitled that does not concern me if I am only powerful I am of myself empowered and need no other empowering or entitling Right is a wheel in the head put there by a spook power that am I myself I am the powerful one and owner of power Right is above me is absolute and exists in one higher as whose grace it flows to me right is a gift of grace from the judge power and might exist only in me the powerful and mighty II MY INTERCOURSE In society the human demand at most can be satisfied while the egoistic must always come short Because it can hardly escape anybody that the present shows no such living interest in any question as in the social one has to direct his gaze especially to society Nay if the interest felt in it were less passionate and dazzled people would not so much in looking at society lose sight of the individuals in it and would recognize that a society cannot become new so long as those who form and constitute it remain the old ones If e g there was to arise in the Jewish people a society which should spread a new faith over the earth these apostles could in no case remain Pharisees As you are so you present yourself so you behave toward men a hypocrite as a hypocrite a Christian as a Christian Therefore the character of a society is determined by the character of its members they are its creators So much at least one must perceive even if one were not willing to put to the test the concept society itself Ever far from letting themselves come to their full development and consequence men have hitherto not been able to found their societies on themselves or rather they have been able only to found societies and to live in societies The societies were always persons powerful persons so called moral persons i e ghosts before which the individual had the appropriate wheel in his head the fear of ghosts As such ghosts they may most suitably be designated by the respective names people and peoplet the people of the patriarchs the people of the Hellenes et cetera at last the people of men Mankind Anacharsis Clootz was enthusiastic for the nation of mankind then every subdivision of this people which could and must have its special societies the Spanish French people et cetera within it again classes cities in short all kinds of corporations lastly tapering to the finest point the little people of the family Hence instead of saying that the person that walked as ghost in all societies hitherto has been the people there might also have been named the two extremes to wit either mankind or the family both the most natural born units We choose the word people one hundred fifty five because its derivation has been brought into connection with the Greek polloi the many or the masses but still more because national efforts are at present the order of the day and because even the newest mutineers have not yet shaken off this deceptive person although on the other hand the latter consideration must give the preference to the expression mankind since on all sides they are going in for enthusiasm over mankind The people then mankind or the family have hitherto as it seems played history no egoistic interest was to come up in these societies but solely general ones national or popular interests class interests family interests and general human interests But who has brought to their fall the peoples whose decline history relates Who but the egoist who was seeking his satisfaction If once an egoistic interest crept in the society was corrupted and moved toward its dissolution as Rome e g proves with its highly developed system of private rights or Christianity with the incessantly breaking in rational self determination self consciousness the autonomy of the spirit et cetera The Christian people has produced two societies whose duration will keep equal measure with the permanence of that people these are the societies State and Church Can they be called a union of egoists Do we in them pursue an egoistic personal own interest or do we pursue a popular i e an interest of the Christian people to wit a State and Church interest Can I and may I be myself in them May I think and act as I will may I reveal myself live myself out busy myself Must I not leave untouched the majesty of the State the sanctity of the Church Well I may not do as I will But shall I find in any society such an unmeasured freedom of maying Certainly no Accordingly we might be content Not a bit It is a different thing whether I rebound from an ego or from a people a generalization There I am my opponent s opponent born his equal here I am a despised opponent bound and under a guardian there I stand man to man here I am a schoolboy who can accomplish nothing against his comrade because the latter has called father and mother to aid and has crept under the apron while I am well scolded as an ill bred brat and I must not argue there I fight against a bodily enemy here against mankind against a generalization against a majesty against a spook But to me no majesty nothing sacred is a limit nothing that I know how to overpower Only that which I cannot overpower still limits my might and I of limited might am temporarily a limited I not limited by the might outside me but limited by my own still deficient might by my own impotence However the Guard dies but does not surrender Above all only a bodily opponent I dare meet every foeman Whom I can see and measure with my eye Whose mettle fires my mettle for the fight et cetera Many privileges have indeed been cancelled with time but solely for the sake of the common weal of the State and the State s weal by no means for the strengthening of me Vassalage e g was abrogated only that a single liege lord the lord of the people the monarchical power might be strengthened vassalage under the one became yet more rigorous thereby Only in favor of the monarch be he called prince or law have privileges fallen In France the citizens are not indeed vassals of the king but are instead vassals of the law the Charter Subordination was retained only the Christian State recognized that man cannot serve two masters the lord of the manor and the prince et cetera therefore one obtained all the prerogatives now he can again place one above another he can make men in high place But of what concern to me is the common weal The common weal as such is not my weal but only the furthest extremity of self renunciation The common weal may cheer aloud while I must down one hundred fifty six the State may shine while I starve In what lies the folly of the political liberals but in their opposing the people to the government and talking of people s rights So there is the people going to be of age et cetera As if one who has no mouth could be muendig one hundred fifty seven Only the individual is able to be muendig Thus the whole question of the liberty of the press is turned upside down when it is laid claim to as a right of the people It is only a right or better the might of the individual If a people has liberty of the press then I although in the midst of this people have it not a liberty of the people is not my liberty and the liberty of the press as a liberty of the people must have at its side a press law directed against me This must be insisted on all around against the present day efforts for liberty Liberty of the people is not my liberty Let us admit these categories liberty of the people and right of the people e g the right of the people that everybody may bear arms Does one not forfeit such a right One cannot forfeit his own right but may well forfeit a right that belongs not to me but to the people I may be locked up for the sake of the liberty of the people I may under sentence incur the loss of the right to bear arms Liberalism appears as the last attempt at a creation of the liberty of the people a liberty of the commune of society of the general of mankind the dream of a humanity a people a commune a society that shall be of age A people cannot be free otherwise than at the individual s expense for it is not the individual that is the main point in this liberty but the people The freer the people the more bound the individual the Athenian people precisely at its freest time created ostracism banished the atheists poisoned the most honest thinker How they do praise Socrates for his conscientiousness which makes nun resist the advice to get away from the dungeon He is a fool that he concedes to the Athenians a right to condemn him Therefore it certainly serves him right why then does he remain standing on an equal footing with the Athenians Why does he not break with them Had he known and been able to know what he was he would have conceded to such judges no claim no right That he did not escape was just his weakness his delusion of still having something in common with the Athenians or the opinion that he was a member a mere member of this people But he was rather this people itself in person and could only be his own judge There was no judge over him as he himself had really pronounced a public sentence on himself and rated himself worthy of the Prytaneum He should have stuck to that and as he had uttered no sentence of death against himself should have despised that of the Athenians too and escaped But he subordinated himself and recognized in the people his judge he seemed little to himself before the majesty of the people That he subjected himself to might to which alone he could succumb as to a right was treason against himself it was virtue To Christ who it is alleged refrained from using the power over his heavenly legions the same scrupulousness is thereby ascribed by the narrators Luther did very well and wisely to have the safety of his journey to Worms warranted to him in black and white and Socrates should have known that the Athenians were his enemies he alone his judge The self deception of a reign of law et cetera should have given way to the perception that the relation was a relation of might It was with pettifoggery and intrigues that Greek liberty ended Why Because the ordinary Greeks could still less attain that logical conclusion which not even their hero of thought Socrates was able to draw What then is pettifoggery but a way of utilizing something established without doing away with it I might add for one s own advantage but you see that lies in utilizing Such pettifoggers are the theologians who wrest and force God s word what would they have to wrest if it were not for the established Word of God So those liberals who only shake and wrest the established order They are all perverters like those perverters of the law Socrates recognized law right the Greeks constantly retained the authority of right and law If with this recognition they wanted nevertheless to assert their advantage every one his own then they had to seek it in perversion of the law or intrigue Alcibiades an intriguer of genius introduces the period of Athenian decay the Spartan Lysander and others show that intrigue had become universally Greek Greek law on which the Greek States rested had to be perverted and undermined by the egoists within these States and the States went down that the individuals might become free the Greek people fell because the individuals cared less for this people than for themselves In general all States constitutions churches et cetera have sunk by the secession of individuals for the individual is the irreconcilable enemy of every generality every tie i e every fetter Yet people fancy to this day that man needs sacred ties he the deadly enemy of every tie The history of the world shows that no tie has yet remained unrent shows that man tirelessly defends himself against ties of every sort and yet blinded people think up new ties again and again and think e g that they have arrived at the right one if one puts upon them the tie of a so called free constitution a beautiful constitutional tie decoration ribbons the ties of confidence between do seem gradually to have become somewhat infirm but people have made no further progress than from apron strings to garters and collars Everything sacred is a tie a fetter Everything sacred is and must be perverted by perverters of the law therefore our present time has multitudes of such perverters in all spheres They are preparing the way for the break up of law for lawlessness Poor Athenians who are accused of pettifoggery and sophistry poor Alcibiades of intrigue Why that was just your best point your first step in freedom Your AEschylus Herodotus et cetera only wanted to have a free Greek people you were the first to surmise something of your freedom A people represses those who tower above its majesty by ostracism against too powerful citizens by the Inquisition against the heretics of the Church by the Inquisition against traitors in the State et cetera For the people is concerned only with its self assertion it demands patriotic self sacrifice from everybody To it accordingly every one in himself is indifferent a nothing and it cannot do not even suffer what the individual and he alone must do to wit turn him to account Every people every State is unjust toward the egoist As long as there still exists even one institution which the individual may not dissolve the ownness and self appurtenance of Me is still very remote How can I e g be free when I must bind myself by oath to a constitution a charter a law vow body and soul to my people How can I be my own when my faculties may develop only so far as they do not disturb the harmony of society Weitling The fall of peoples and mankind will invite me to my rise Listen even as I am writing this the bells begin to sound that they may jingle in for to morrow the festival of the thousand years existence of our dear Germany Sound sound its knell You do sound solemn enough as if your tongue was moved by the presentiment that it is giving convoy to a corpse The German people and German peoples have behind them a history of a thousand years what a long life O go to rest never to rise again that all may become free whom you so long have held in fetters The people is dead Up with me O thou my much tormented German people what was thy torment It was the torment of a thought that cannot create itself a body the torment of a walking spirit that dissolves into nothing at every cock crow and yet pines for deliverance and fulfilment In me too thou hast lived long thou dear thought thou dear spook Already I almost fancied I had found the word of thy deliverance discovered flesh and bones for the wandering spirit then I hear them sound the bells that usher thee into eternal rest then the last hope fades out then the notes of the last love die away then I depart from the desolate house of those who now are dead and enter at the door of the living one For only he who is alive is in the right Farewell thou dream of so many millions farewell thou who hast tyrannized over thy children for a thousand years To morrow they carry thee to the grave soon thy sisters the peoples will follow thee But when they have all followed then mankind is buried and I am my own I am the laughing heir The word Gesellschaft society has its origin in the word Sal hall If one hall encloses many persons then the hall causes these persons to be in society They are in society and at most constitute a parlor society by talking in the traditional forms of parlor speech When it comes to real intercourse this is to be regarded as independent of society it may occur or be lacking without altering the nature of what is named society Those who are in the hall are a society even as mute persons or when they put each other off solely with empty phrases of courtesy Intercourse is mutuality it is the action the commercium of individuals society is only community of the hall and even the statues of a museum hall are in society they are grouped People are accustomed to say they haben inne one hundred fifty eight this hall in common but the case is rather that the hall has us inne or in it So far the natural signification of the word society In this it comes out that society is not generated by me and you but by a third factor which makes associates out of us two and that it is just this third factor that is the creative one that which creates society Just so a prison society or prison companionship those who enjoy one hundred fifty nine the same prison Here we already hit upon a third factor fuller of significance than was that merely local one the hall Prison no longer means a space only but a space with express reference to its inhabitants for it is a prison only through being destined for prisoners without whom it would be a mere building What gives a common stamp to those who are gathered in it Evidently the prison since it is only by means of the prison that they are prisoners What then determines the manner of life of the prison society The prison What determines their intercourse The prison too perhaps Certainly they can enter upon intercourse only as prisoners i e only so far as the prison laws allow it but that they themselves hold intercourse I with you this the prison cannot bring to pass on the contrary it must have an eye to guarding against such egoistic purely personal intercourse and only as such is it really intercourse between me and you That we jointly execute a job run a machine effectuate anything in general for this a prison will indeed provide but that I forget that I am a prisoner and engage in intercourse with you who likewise disregard it brings danger to the prison and not only cannot be caused by it but must not even be permitted For this reason the saintly and moral minded French chamber decides to introduce solitary confinement and other saints will do the like in order to cut off demoralizing intercourse Imprisonment is the established and sacred condition to injure which no attempt must be made The slightest push of that kind is punishable as is every uprising against a sacred thing by which man is to be charmed and chained Like the hall the prison does form a society a companionship a communion e g communion of labor but no intercourse no reciprocity no union On the contrary every union in the prison bears within it the dangerous seed of a plot which under favorable circumstances might spring up and bear fruit Yet one does not usually enter the prison voluntarily and seldom remains in it voluntarily either but cherishes the egoistic desire for liberty Here therefore it sooner becomes manifest that personal intercourse is in hostile relations to the prison society and tends to the dissolution of this very society this joint incarceration Let us therefore look about for such communions as it seems we remain in gladly and voluntarily without wanting to endanger them by our egoistic impulses As a communion of the required sort the family offers itself in the first place Parents husband and wife children brothers and sisters represent a whole or form a family for the further widening of which the collateral relatives also may be made to serve if taken into account The family is a true communion only when the law of the family piety one hundred sixty or family love is observed by its members A son to whom parents brothers and sisters have become indifferent has been a son for as the sonship no longer shows itself efficacious it has no greater significance than the long past connection of mother and child by the navel string That one has once lived in this bodily juncture cannot as a fact be undone and so far one remains irrevocably this mother s son and the brother of the rest of her children but it would come to a lasting connection only by lasting piety this spirit of the family Individuals are members of a family in the full sense only when they make the persistence of the family their task only as conservative do they keep aloof from doubting their basis the family To every member of the family one thing must be fixed and sacred viz the family itself or more expressively piety That the family is to persist remains to its member so long as he keeps himself free from that egoism which is hostile to the family an unassailable truth In a word If the family is sacred then nobody who belongs to it may secede from it else he becomes a criminal against the family he may never pursue an interest hostile to the family e g form a misalliance He who does this has dishonored the family put it to shame et cetera Now if in an individual the egoistic impulse has not force enough he complies and makes a marriage which suits the claims of the family takes a rank which harmonizes with its position and the like in short he does honor to the family If on the contrary the egoistic blood flows fierily enough in his veins he prefers to become a criminal against the family and to throw off its laws Which of the two lies nearer my heart the good of the family or my good In innumerable cases both go peacefully together the advantage of the family is at the same time mine and vice versa Then it is hard to decide whether I am thinking selfishly or for the common benefit and perhaps I complacently flatter myself with my unselfishness But there comes the day when a necessity of choice makes me tremble when I have it in mind to dishonor my family tree to affront parents brothers and kindred What then Now it will appear how I am disposed at the bottom of my heart now it will be revealed whether piety ever stood above egoism for me now the selfish one can no longer skulk behind the semblance of unselfishness A wish rises in my soul and growing from hour to hour becomes a passion To whom does it occur at first blush that the slightest thought which may result adversely to the spirit of the family piety bears within it a transgression against this nay who at once in the first moment becomes completely conscious of the matter It happens so with Juliet in Romeo and Juliet The unruly passion can at last no longer be tamed and undermines the building of piety You will say indeed it is from self will that the family casts out of its bosom those wilful ones that grant more of a hearing to their passion than to piety the good Protestants used the same excuse with much success against the Catholics and believed in it themselves But it is just a subterfuge to roll the fault off oneself nothing more The Catholics had regard for the common bond of the church and thrust those heretics from them only because these did not have so much regard for the bond of the church as to sacrifice their convictions to it the former therefore held the bond fast because the bond the Catholic i e common and united church was sacred to them the latter on the contrary disregarded the bond Just so those who lack piety They are not thrust out but thrust themselves out prizing their passion their wilfulness higher than the bond of the family But now sometimes a wish glimmers in a less passionate and wilful heart than Juliet s The pliable girl brings herself as a sacrifice to the peace of the family One might say that here too selfishness prevailed for the decision came from the feeling that the pliable girl felt herself more satisfied by the unity of the family than by the fulfilment of her wish That might be but what if there remained a sure sign that egoism had been sacrificed to piety What if even after the wish that had been directed against the peace of the family was sacrificed it remained at least as a recollection of a sacrifice brought to a sacred tie What if the pliable girl were conscious of having left her self will unsatisfied and humbly subjected herself to a higher power Subjected and sacrificed because the superstition of piety exercised its dominion over her There egoism won here piety wins and the egoistic heart bleeds there egoism was strong here it was weak But the weak as we have long known are the unselfish For them for these its weak members the family cares because they belong to the family do not belong to themselves and care for themselves This weakness Hegel e g praises when he wants to have match making left to the choice of the parents As a sacred communion to which among the rest the individual owes obedience the family has the judicial function too vested in it such a family court is described e g in the Cabanis of Wilibald Alexis There the father in the name of the family council puts the intractable son among the soldiers and thrusts him out of the family in order to cleanse the smirched family again by means of this act of punishment The most consistent development of family responsibility is contained in Chinese law according to which the whole family has to expiate the individual s fault To day however the arm of family power seldom reaches far enough to take seriously in hand the punishment of apostates in most cases the State protects even against disinheritance The criminal against the family family criminal flees into the domain of the State and is free as the State criminal who gets away to America is no longer reached by the punishments of his State He who has shamed his family the graceless son is protected against the family s punishment because the State this protecting lord takes away from family punishment its sacredness and profanes it decreeing that it is only revenge it restrains punishment this sacred family right because before its the State s sacredness the subordinate sacredness of the family always pales and loses its sanctity as soon as it comes in conflict with this higher sacredness Without the conflict the State lets pass the lesser sacredness of the family but in the opposite case it even commands crime against the family charging e g the son to refuse obedience to his parents as soon as they want to beguile him to a crime against the State Well the egoist has broken the ties of the family and found in the State a lord to shelter him against the grievously affronted spirit of the family But where has he run now Straight into a new society in which his egoism is awaited by the same snares and nets that it has just escaped For the State is likewise a society not a union it is the broadened family Father of the Country Mother of the Country children of the country What is called a State is a tissue and plexus of dependence and adherence it is a belonging together a holding together in which those who are placed together fit themselves to each other or in short mutually depend on each other it is the order of this dependence Suppose the king whose authority lends authority to all down to the beadle should vanish still all in whom the will for order was awake would keep order erect against the disorders of bestiality If disorder were victorious the State would be at an end But is this thought of love to fit ourselves to each other to adhere to each other and depend on each other really capable of winning us According to this the State would be love realized the being for each other and living for each other of all Is not self will being lost while we attend to the will for order Will people not be satisfied when order is cared for by authority i e when authority sees to it that no one gets in the way of another when then the herd is judiciously distributed or ordered Why then everything is in the best order and it is this best order that is called State Our societies and States are without our making them are united without our uniting are predestined and established or have an independent standing one hundred sixty one of their own are the indissolubly established against us egoists The fight of the world to day is as it is said directed against the established Yet people are wont to misunderstand this as if it were only that what is now established was to be exchanged for another a better established system But war might rather be declared against establishment itself i e the State not a particular State not any such thing as the mere condition of the State at the time it is not another State such as a people s State that men aim at but their union uniting this ever fluid uniting of everything standing A State exists even without my company operation I am born in it brought up in it under obligations to it and must do it homage one hundred sixty two It takes me up into its favor one hundred sixty three and I live by its grace Thus the independent establishment of the State founds my lack of independence its condition as a natural growth its organism demands that my nature do not grow freely but be cut to fit it That it may be able to unfold in natural growth it applies to me the shears of civilization it gives me an education and culture adapted to it not to me and teaches me e g to respect the laws to refrain from injury to State property i e private property to reverence divine and earthly highness et cetera in short it teaches me to be unpunishable sacrificing my ownness to sacredness everything possible is sacred e g property others life et cetera In this consists the sort of civilization and culture that the State is able to give me it brings me up to be a serviceable instrument a serviceable member of society This every State must do the people s State as well as the absolute or constitutional one It must do so as long as we rest in the error that it is an I as which it then applies to itself the name of a moral mystical or political person I who really am I must pull off this lion skin of the I from the stalking thistle eater What manifold robbery have I not put up with in the history of the world There I let sun moon and stars cats and crocodiles receive the honor of ranking as I there Jehovah Allah and Our Father came and were invested with the I there families tribes peoples and at last actually mankind came and were honored as I s there the Church the State came with the pretension to be I and I gazed calmly on all What wonder if then there was always a real I too that joined the company and affirmed in my face that it was not my you but my real I Why the Son of Man par excellence had done the like why should not a son of man do it too So I saw my I always above me and outside me and could never really come to myself I never believed in myself I never believed in my present I saw myself only in the future The boy believes he will be a proper I a proper fellow only when he has become a man the man thinks only in the other world will he be something proper And to enter more closely upon reality at once even the best are to day still persuading each other that one must have received into himself the State his people mankind and what not in order to be a real I a free burgher a citizen a free or true man they too see the truth and reality of me in the reception of an alien I and devotion to it And what sort of an I An I that is neither an I nor a you a fancied I a spook While in the Middle Ages the church could well brook many States living united in it the States learned after the Reformation especially after the Thirty Years War to tolerate many churches confessions gathering under one crown But all States are religious and as the case may be Christian States and make it their task to force the intractable the egoists under the bond of the unnatural i e Christianize them All arrangements of the Christian State have the object of Christianizing the people Thus the court has the object of forcing people to justice the school that of forcing them to mental culture in short the object of protecting those who act Christianly against those who act unchristianly of bringing Christian action to dominion of making it powerful Among these means of force the State counted the Church too it demanded a particular religion from everybody Dupin said lately against the clergy Instruction and education belong to the State Certainly everything that regards the principle of morality is a State affair Hence it is that the Chinese State meddles so much in family concerns and one is nothing there if one is not first of all a good child to his parents Family concerns are altogether State concerns with us too only that our State puts confidence in the families without painful oversight it holds the family bound by the marriage tie and this tie cannot be broken without it But that the State makes me responsible for my principles and demands certain ones from me might make me ask what concern has it with the wheel in my head principle Very much for the State is the ruling principle It is supposed that in divorce matters in marriage law in general the question is of the proportion of rights between Church and State Rather the question is of whether anything sacred is to rule over man be it called faith or ethical law morality The State behaves as the same ruler that the Church was The latter rests on godliness the former on morality People talk of the tolerance the leaving opposite tendencies free and the like by which civilized States are distinguished Certainly some are strong enough to look with complacency on even the most unrestrained meetings while others charge their catchpolls to go hunting for tobacco pipes Yet for one State as for another the play of individuals among themselves their buzzing to and fro their daily life is an incident which it must be content to leave to themselves because it can do nothing with this Many indeed still strain out gnats and swallow camels while others are shrewder Individuals are freer in the latter because less pestered But I am free in no State The lauded tolerance of States is simply a tolerating of the harmless the not dangerous it is only elevation above pettymindedness only a more estimable grander prouder despotism A certain State seemed for a while to mean to be pretty well elevated above literary combats which might be carried on with all heat England is elevated above popular turmoil and tobacco smoking But woe to the literature that deals blows at the State itself woe to the mobs that endanger the State In that certain State they dream of a free science in England of a free popular life The State does let individuals play as freely as possible only they must not be in earnest must not forget it Man must not carry on intercourse with man unconcernedly not without superior oversight and mediation I must not execute all that I am able to but only so much as the State allows I must not turn to account my thoughts nor my work nor in general anything of mine The State always has the sole purpose to limit tame subordinate the individual to make him subject to some generality or other it lasts only so long as the individual is not all in all and it is only the clearly marked restriction of me my limitation my slavery Never does a State aim to bring in the free activity of individuals but always that which is bound to the purpose of the State Through the State nothing in common comes to pass either as little as one can call a piece of cloth the common work of all the individual parts of a machine it is rather the work of the whole machine as a unit machine work In the same style everything is done by the State machine too for it moves the clockwork of the individual minds none of which follow their own impulse The State seeks to hinder every free activity by its censorship its supervision its police and holds this hindering to be its duty because it is in truth a duty of self preservation The State wants to make something out of man therefore there live in it only made men every one who wants to be his own self is its opponent and is nothing He is nothing means as much as The State does not make use of him grants him no position no office no trade and the like E Bauer one hundred sixty four in the Liberale Bestrebungen II fifty is still dreaming of a government which proceeding out of the people can never stand in opposition to it He does indeed p sixty nine himself take back the word government In the republic no government at all obtains but only an executive authority An authority which proceeds purely and alone out of the people which has not an independent power independent principles independent officers over against the people but which has its foundation the fountain of its power and of its principles in the sole supreme authority of the State in the people The concept government therefore is not at all suitable in the people s State But the thing remains the same That which has proceeded been founded sprung from the fountain becomes something independent and like a child delivered from the womb enters upon opposition at once The government if it were nothing independent and opposing would be nothing at all In the free State there is no government et cetera p ninety four This surely means that the people when it is the sovereign does not let itself be conducted by a superior authority Is it perchance different in absolute monarchy Is there there for the sovereign perchance a government standing over him Over the sovereign be he called prince or people there never stands a government that is understood of itself But over me there will stand a government in every State in the absolute as well as in the republican or free I am as badly off in one as in the other The republic is nothing whatever but absolute monarchy for it makes no difference whether the monarch is called prince or people both being a majesty Constitutionalism itself proves that nobody is able and willing to be only an instrument The ministers domineer over their master the prince the deputies over their master the people Here then the parties at least are already free videlicet the office holders party so called people s party The prince must conform to the will of the ministers the people dance to the pipe of the chambers Constitutionalism is further than the republic because it is the State in incipient dissolution E Bauer denies p fifty six that the people is a personality in the constitutional State per contra then in the republic Well in the constitutional State the people is a party and a party is surely a personality if one is once resolved to talk of a political p seventy six moral person anyhow The fact is that a moral person be it called people s party or people or even the Lord is in no wise a person but a spook Further E Bauer goes on p sixty nine guardianship is the characteristic of a government Truly still more that of a people and people s State it is the characteristic of all dominion A people s State which unites in itself all completeness of power the absolute master cannot let me become powerful And what a chimera to be no longer willing to call the people s officials servants instruments because they execute the free rational law will of the people p seventy three He thinks p seventy four Only by all official circles subordinating themselves to the government s views can unity be brought into the State but his people s State is to have unity too how will a lack of subordination be allowable there subordination to the people s will In the constitutional State it is the regent and his disposition that the whole structure of government rests on in the end Ibid p one hundred thirty How would that be otherwise in the people s State Shall I not there be governed by the people s disposition too and does it make a difference for me whether I see myself kept in dependence by the prince s disposition or by the people s disposition so called public opinion If dependence means as much as religious relation as E Bauer rightly alleges then in the people s State the people remains for me the superior power the majesty for God and prince have their proper essence in majesty to which I stand in religious relations Like the sovereign regent the sovereign people too would be reached by no law E Bauer s whole attempt comes to a change of masters Instead of wanting to make the people free he should have had his mind on the sole realizable freedom his own In the constitutional State absolutism itself has at last come in conflict with itself as it has been shattered into a duality the government wants to be absolute and the people wants to be absolute These two absolutes will wear out against each other E Bauer inveighs against the determination of the regent by birth by chance But when the people have become the sole power in the State p one hundred thirty two have we not then in it a master from chance Why what is the people The people has always been only the body of the government it is many under one hat a prince s hat or many under one constitution And the constitution is the prince Princes and peoples will persist so long as both do not col lapse i e fall together If under one constitution there are many peoples e g in the ancient Persian monarchy and to day then these peoples rank only as provinces For me the people is in any case an accidental power a force of nature an enemy that I must overcome What is one to think of under the name of an organized people ibid p one hundred thirty two A people that no longer has a government that governs itself In which therefore no ego stands out prominently a people organized by ostracism The banishment of egos ostracism makes the people autocrat If you speak of the people you must speak of the prince for the people if it is to be a subject one hundred sixty five and make history must like everything that acts have a head its supreme head Weitling sets this forth in the Trio and Proudhon declares une societe pour ainsi dire acephale ne peut vivre one hundred sixty six The vox populi is now always held up to us and public opinion is to rule our princes Certainly the vox populi is at the same time vox dei but is either of any use and is not the vox principis also vox dei At this point the Nationals may be brought to mind To demand of the thirty eight States of Germany that they shall act as one nation can only be put alongside the senseless desire that thirty eight swarms of bees led by thirty eight queen bees shall unite themselves into one swarm Bees they all remain but it is not the bees as bees that belong together and can join themselves together it is only that the subject bees are connected with the ruling queens Bees and peoples are destitute of will and the instinct of their queens leads them If one were to point the bees to their beehood in which at any rate they are all equal to each other one would be doing the same thing that they are now doing so stormily in pointing the Germans to their Germanhood Why Germanhood is just like beehood in this very thing that it bears in itself the necessity of cleavages and separations yet without pushing on to the last separation where with the complete carrying through of the process of separating its end appears I mean to the separation of man from man Germanhood does indeed divide itself into different peoples and tribes i e beehives but the individual who has the quality of being a German is still as powerless as the isolated bee And yet only individuals can enter into union with each other and all alliances and leagues of peoples are and remain mechanical compoundings because those who come together at least so far as the peoples are regarded as the ones that have come together are destitute of will Only with the last separation does separation itself end and change to unification Now the Nationals are exerting themselves to set up the abstract lifeless unity of beehood but the self owned are going to fight for the unity willed by their own will for union This is the token of all reactionary wishes that they want to set up something general abstract an empty lifeless concept in distinction from which the self owned aspire to relieve the robust lively particular from the trashy burden of generalities The reactionaries would be glad to smite a people a nation forth from the earth the self owned have before their eyes only themselves In essentials the two efforts that are just now the order of the day to wit the restoration of provincial rights and of the old tribal divisions Franks Bavarians et cetera Lusatia et cetera and the restoration of the entire nationality coincide in one But the Germans will come into unison i e unite themselves only when they knock over their beehood as well as all the beehives in other words when they are more than Germans only then can they form a German Union They must not want to turn back into their nationality into the womb in order to be born again but let every one turn in to himself How ridiculously sentimental when one German grasps another s hand and presses it with sacred awe because he too is a German With that he is something great But this will certainly still be thought touching as long as people are enthusiastic for brotherliness i e as long as they have a family disposition From the superstition of piety from brotherliness or childlikeness or however else the soft hearted piety phrases run from the family spirit the Nationals who want to have a great family of Germans cannot liberate themselves Aside from this the so called Nationals would only have to understand themselves rightly in order to lift themselves out of their juncture with the good natured Teutomaniacs For the uniting for material ends and interests which they demand of the Germans comes to nothing else than a voluntary union Carriere inspired cries out one hundred sixty seven Railroads are to the more penetrating eye the way to a life of the people such as has not yet anywhere appeared in such significance Quite right it will be a life of the people that has nowhere appeared because it is not a life of the people So Carriere then combats himself p ten Pure humanity or manhood cannot be better represented than by a people fulfilling its mission Why by this nationality only is represented Washed out generality is lower than the form complete in itself which is itself a whole and lives as a living member of the truly general the organized Why the people is this very washed out generality and it is only a man that is the form complete in itself The impersonality of what they call people nation is clear also from this that a people which wants to bring its I into view to the best of its power puts at its head the ruler without will It finds itself in the alternative either to be subjected to a prince who realizes only himself his individual pleasure then it does not recognize in the absolute master its own will the so called will of the people or to seat on the throne a prince who gives effect to no will of his own then it has a prince without will whose place some ingenious clockwork would perhaps fill just as well Therefore insight need go only a step farther then it becomes clear of itself that the I of the people is an impersonal spiritual power the law The people s I therefore is a spook not an I I am I only by this that I make myself i e that it is not another who makes me but I must be my own work But how is it with this I of the people Chance plays it into the people s hand chance gives it this or that born lord accidents procure it the chosen one he is not its the sovereign people s product as I am my product Conceive of one wanting to talk you into believing that you were not your I but Tom or Jack was your I But so it is with the people and rightly For the people has an I as little as the eleven planets counted together have an I though they revolve around a common centre Bailly s utterance is representative of the slave disposition that folks manifest before the sovereign people as before the prince I have says he no longer any extra reason when the general reason has pronounced itself My first law was the nation s will as soon as it had assembled I knew nothing beyond its sovereign will He would have no extra reason and yet this extra reason alone accomplishes everything Just so Mirabeau inveighs in the words No power on earth has the right to say to the nation s representatives It is my will As with the Greeks there is now a wish to make man a zoon politicon a citizen of the State or political man So he ranked for a long time as a citizen of heaven But the Greek fell into ignominy along with his State the citizen of heaven likewise falls with heaven we on the other hand are not willing to go down along with the people the nation and nationality not willing to be merely political men or politicians Since the Revolution they have striven to make the people happy and in making the people happy great and the like they make Us unhappy the people s good hap is my mishap What empty talk the political liberals utter with emphatic decorum is well seen again in Nauwerk s On Taking Part in the State There complaint is made of those who are indifferent and do not take part who are not in the full sense citizens and the author speaks as if one could not be man at all if one did not take a lively part in State affairs i e if one were not a politician In this he is right for if the State ranks as the warder of everything human we can have nothing human without taking part in it But what does this make out against the egoist Nothing at all because the egoist is to himself the warder of the human and has nothing to say to the State except Get out of my sunshine Only when the State comes in contact with his ownness does the egoist take an active interest in it If the condition of the State does not bear hard on the closet philosopher is he to occupy himself with it because it is his most sacred duty So long as the State does according to his wish what need has he to look up from his studies Let those who from an interest of their own want to have conditions otherwise busy themselves with them Not now nor evermore will sacred duty bring folks to reflect about the State as little as they become disciples of science artists et cetera from sacred duty Egoism alone can impel them to it and will as soon as things have become much worse If you showed folks that their egoism demanded that they busy themselves with State affairs you would not have to call on them long if on the other hand you appeal to their love of fatherland and the like you will long preach to deaf hearts in behalf of this service of love Certainly in your sense the egoists will not participate in State affairs at all Nauwerk utters a genuine liberal phrase on p sixteen Man completely fulfils his calling only in feeling and knowing himself as a member of humanity and being active as such The individual cannot realize the idea of manhood if he does not stay himself upon all humanity if he does not draw his powers from it like Antaeus In the same place it is said Man s relation to the res publica is degraded to a purely private matter by the theological view is accordingly made away with by denial As if the political view did otherwise with religion There religion is a private matter If instead of sacred duty man s destiny the calling to full manhood and similar commandments it were held up to people that their self interest was infringed on when they let everything in the State go as it goes then without declamations they would be addressed as one will have to address them at the decisive moment if he wants to attain his end Instead of this the theology hating author says If there has ever been a time when the State laid claim to all that are hers such a time is ours The thinking man sees in participation in the theory and practice of the State a duty one of the most sacred duties that rest upon him and then takes under closer consideration the unconditional necessity that everybody participate in the State He in whose head or heart or both the State is seated he who is possessed by the State or the believer in the State is a politician and remains such to all eternity The State is the most necessary means for the complete development of mankind It assuredly has been so as long as we wanted to develop mankind but if we want to develop ourselves it can be to us only a means of hindrance Can State and people still be reformed and bettered now As little as the nobility the clergy the church et cetera they can be abrogated annihilated done away with not reformed Can I change a piece of nonsense into sense by reforming it or must I drop it outright Henceforth what is to be done is no longer about the State the form of the State et cetera but about me With this all questions about the prince s power the constitution et cetera sink into their true abyss and their true nothingness I this nothing shall put forth my creations from myself To the chapter of society belongs also the party whose praise has of late been sung In the State the party is current Party party who should not join one But the individual is unique one hundred sixty eight not a member of the party He unites freely and separates freely again The party is nothing but a State in the State and in this smaller bee State peace is also to rule just as in the greater The very people who cry loudest that there must be an opposition in the State inveigh against every discord in the party A proof that they too want only a State All parties are shattered not against the State but against the ego one hundred sixty nine One hears nothing oftener now than the admonition to remain true to his party party men despise nothing so much as a mugwump One must run with his party through thick and thin and unconditionally approve and represent its chief principles It does not indeed go quite so badly here as with closed societies because these bind their members to fixed laws or statutes e g the orders the Society of Jesus et cetera But yet the party ceases to be a union at the same moment at which it makes certain principles binding and wants to have them assured against attacks but this moment is the very birth act of the party As party it is already a born society a dead union an idea that has become fixed As party of absolutism it cannot will that its members should doubt the irrefragable truth of this principle they could cherish this doubt only if they were egoistic enough to want still to be something outside their party i e non partisans Non partisan they cannot be as party men but only as egoists If you are a Protestant and belong to that party you must only justify Protestantism at most purge it not reject it if you are a Christian and belong among men to the Christian party you cannot go beyond this as a member of this party but only when your egoism i e non partisanship impels you to it What exertions the Christians down to Hegel and the Communists have put forth to make their party strong they stuck to it that Christianity must contain the eternal truth and that one needs only to get at it make sure of it and justify it In short the party cannot bear non partisanship and it is in this that egoism appears What matters the party to me I shall find enough anyhow who unite with me without swearing allegiance to my flag He who passes over from one party to another is at once abused as a turncoat Certainly morality demands that one stand by his party and to become apostate from it is to spot oneself with the stain of faithlessness but ownness knows no commandment of faithfulness adhesion et cetera ownness permits everything even apostasy defection Unconsciously even the moral themselves let themselves be led by this principle when they have to judge one who passes over to their party nay they are likely to be making proselytes they should only at the same time acquire a consciousness of the fact that one must commit immoral actions in order to commit his own i e here that one must break faith yes even his oath in order to determine himself instead of being determined by moral considerations In the eyes of people of strict moral judgment an apostate always shimmers in equivocal colors and will not easily obtain their confidence for there sticks to him the taint of faithlessness i e of an immorality In the lower man this view is found almost generally advanced thinkers fall here too as always into an uncertainty and bewilderment and the contradiction necessarily founded in the principle of morality does not on account of the confusion of their concepts come clearly to their consciousness They do not venture to call the apostate immoral downright because they themselves entice to apostasy to defection from one religion to another et cetera still they cannot give up the standpoint of morality either And yet here the occasion was to be seized to step outside of morality Are the Own or Unique one hundred seventy perchance a party How could they be own if they were such as belonged to a party Or is one to hold with no party In the very act of joining them and entering their circle one forms a union with them that lasts as long as party and I pursue one and the same goal But to day I still share the party s tendency and by to morrow I can do so no longer and I become untrue to it The party has nothing binding obligatory for me and I do not have respect for it if it no longer pleases me I become its foe In every party that cares for itself and its persistence the members are unfree or better unown in that degree they lack egoism in that degree in which they serve this desire of the party The independence of the party conditions the lack of independence in the party members A party of whatever kind it may be can never do without a confession of faith For those who belong to the party must believe in its principle it must not be brought in doubt or put in question by them it must be the certain indubitable thing for the party member That is One must belong to a party body and soul else one is not truly a party man but more or less an egoist Harbor a doubt of Christianity and you are already no longer a true Christian you have lifted yourself to the effrontery of putting a question beyond it and haling Christianity before your egoistic judgment seat You have sinned against Christianity this party cause for it is surely not e g a cause for the Jews another party But well for you if you do not let yourself be affrighted your effrontery helps you to ownness So then an egoist could never embrace a party or take up with a party Oh yes only he cannot let himself be embraced and taken up by the party For him the party remains all the time nothing but a gathering he is one of the party he takes part The best State will clearly be that which has the most loyal citizens and the more the devoted mind for legality is lost so much the more will the State this system of morality this moral life itself be diminished in force and quality With the good citizens the good State too perishes and dissolves into anarchy and lawlessness Respect for the law By this cement the total of the State is held together The law is sacred and he who affronts it a criminal Without crime no State the moral world and this the State is is crammed full of scamps cheats liars thieves et cetera Since the State is the lordship of law its hierarchy it follows that the egoist in all cases where his advantage runs against the State s can satisfy himself only by crime The State cannot give up the claim that its laws and ordinances are sacred one hundred seventy one At this the individual ranks as the unholy one hundred seventy two barbarian natural man egoist over against the State exactly as he was once regarded by the Church before the individual the State takes on the nimbus of a saint one hundred seventy three Thus it issues a law against dueling Two men who are both at one in this that they are willing to stake their life for a cause no matter what are not to be allowed this because the State will not have it it imposes a penalty on it Where is the liberty of self determination then It is at once quite another situation if as e g in North America society determines to let the duelists bear certain evil consequences of their act e g withdrawal of the credit hitherto enjoyed To refuse credit is everybody s affair and if a society wants to withdraw it for this or that reason the man who is hit cannot therefore complain of encroachment on his liberty the society is simply availing itself of its own liberty That is no penalty for sin no penalty for a crime The duel is no crime there but only an act against which the society adopts counter measures resolves on a defence The State on the contrary stamps the duel as a crime i e as an injury to its sacred law it makes it a criminal case The society leaves it to the individual s decision whether he will draw upon himself evil consequences and inconveniences by his mode of action and hereby recognizes his free decision the State behaves in exactly the reverse way denying all right to the individual s decision and instead ascribing the sole right to its own decision the law of the State so that he who transgresses the State s commandment is looked upon as if he were acting against God s commandment a view which likewise was once maintained by the Church Here God is the Holy in and of himself and the commandments of the Church as of the State are the commandments of this Holy One which he transmits to the world through his anointed and Lords by the Grace of God If the Church had deadly sins the State has capital crimes if the one had heretics the other has traitors the one ecclesiastical penalties the other criminal penalties the one inquisitorial processes the other fiscal in short there sins here crimes there sinners here criminals there inquisition and here inquisition Will the sanctity of the State not fall like the Church s The awe of its laws the reverence for its highness the humility of its subjects will this remain Will the saint s face not be stripped of its adornment What a folly to ask of the State s authority that it should enter into an honorable fight with the individual and as they express themselves in the matter of freedom of the press share sun and wind equally If the State this thought is to be a de facto power it simply must be a superior power against the individual The State is sacred and must not expose itself to the impudent attacks of individuals If the State is sacred there must be censorship The political liberals admit the former and dispute the inference But in any case they concede repressive measures to it for they stick to this that State is more than the individual and exercises a justified revenge called punishment Punishment has a meaning only when it is to afford expiation for the injuring of a sacred thing If something is sacred to any one he certainly deserves punishment when he acts as its enemy A man who lets a man s life continue in existence because to him it is sacred and he has a dread of touching it is simply a religious man Weitling lays crime at the door of social disorder and lives in the expectation that under Communistic arrangements crimes will become impossible because the temptations to them e g money fall away As however his organized society is also exalted into a sacred and inviolable one he miscalculates in that good hearted opinion Such as with their mouth professed allegiance to the Communistic society but worked underhand for its ruin would not be lacking Besides Weitling has to keep on with curative means against the natural remainder of human diseases and weaknesses and curative means always announce to begin with that individuals will be looked upon as called to a particular salvation and hence treated according to the requirements of this human calling Curative means or healing is only the reverse side of punishment the theory of cure runs parallel with the theory of punishment if the latter sees in an action a sin against right the former takes it for a sin of the man against himself as a decadence from his health But the correct thing is that I regard it either as an action that suits me or as one that does not suit me as hostile or friendly to me i e that I treat it as my property which I cherish or demolish Crime or disease are not either of them an egoistic view of the matter i e a judgment starting from me but starting from another to wit whether it injures right general right or the health partly of the individual the sick one partly of the generality society Crime is treated inexorably disease with loving gentleness compassion and the like Punishment follows crime If crime falls because the sacred vanishes punishment must not less be drawn into its fall for it too has significance only over against something sacred Ecclesiastical punishments have been abolished Why Because how one behaves toward the holy God is his own affair But as this one punishment ecclesiastical punishment has fallen so all punishments must fall As sin against the so called God is a man s own affair so that against every kind of the so called sacred According to our theories of penal law with whose improvement in conformity to the times people are tormenting themselves in vain they want to punish men for this or that inhumanity and therein they make the silliness of these theories especially plain by their consistency hanging the little thieves and letting the big ones run For injury to property they have the house of correction and for violence to thought suppression of natural rights of man only representations and petitions The criminal code has continued existence only through the sacred and perishes of itself if punishment is given up Now they want to create everywhere a new penal law without indulging in a misgiving about punishment itself But it is exactly punishment that must make room for satisfaction which again cannot aim at satisfying right or justice but at procuring us a satisfactory outcome If one does to us what we will not put up with we break his power and bring our own to bear we satisfy ourselves on him and do not fall into the folly of wanting to satisfy right the spook It is not the sacred that is to defend itself against man but man against man as God too you know no longer defends himself against man God to whom formerly and in part indeed even now all the servants of God offered their hands to punish the blasphemer as they still at this very day lend their hands to the sacred This devotion to the sacred brings it to pass also that without lively participation of one s own one only delivers misdoers into the hands of the police and courts a non participating making over to the authorities who of course will best administer sacred matters The people is quite crazy for hounding the police on against everything that seems to it to be immoral often only unseemly and this popular rage for the moral protects the police institution more than the government could in any way protect it In crime the egoist has hitherto asserted himself and mocked at the sacred the break with the sacred or rather of the sacred may become general A revolution never returns but a mighty reckless shameless conscienceless proud crime does it not rumble in distant thunders and do you not see how the sky grows presciently silent and gloomy He who refuses to spend his powers for such limited societies as family party nation is still always longing for a worthier society and thinks he has found the true object of love perhaps in human society or mankind to sacrifice himself to which constitutes his honor from now on he lives for and serves mankind People is the name of the body State of the spirit of that ruling person that has hitherto suppressed me Some have wanted to transfigure peoples and States by broadening them out to mankind and general reason but servitude would only become still more intense with this widening and philanthropists and humanitarians are as absolute masters as politicians and diplomats Modern critics inveigh against religion because it sets God the divine moral et cetera outside of man or makes them something objective in opposition to which the critics rather transfer these very subjects into man But those critics none the less fall into the proper error of religion to give man a destiny in that they too want to have him divine human and the like morality freedom and humanity et cetera are his essence And like religion politics too wanted to educate man to bring him to the realization of his essence his destiny to make something out of him to wit a true man the one in the form of the true believer the other in that of the true citizen or subject In fact it comes to the same whether one calls the destiny the divine or human Under religion and politics man finds himself at the standpoint of should he should become this and that should be so and so With this postulate this commandment every one steps not only in front of another but also in front of himself Those critics say You should be a whole free man Thus they too stand in the temptation to proclaim a new religion to set up a new absolute an ideal to wit freedom Men should be free Then there might even arise missionaries of freedom as Christianity in the conviction that all were properly destined to become Christians sent out missionaries of the faith Freedom would then as have hitherto faith as Church morality as State constitute itself as a new community and carry on a like propaganda therefrom Certainly no objection can be raised against a getting together but so much the more must one oppose every renewal of the old care for us of culture directed toward an end in short the principle of making something out of us no matter whether Christians subjects or freemen and men One may well say with Feuerbach and others that religion has displaced the human from man and has transferred it so into another world that unattainable it went on with its own existence there as something personal in itself as a God but the error of religion is by no means exhausted with this One might very well let fall the personality of the displaced human might transform God into the divine and still remain religious For the religious consists in discontent with the present man i e in the setting up of a perfection to be striven for in man wrestling for his completion one hundred seventy four Ye therefore should be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect Matt five forty eight it consists in the fixation of an ideal an absolute Perfection is the supreme good the finis bonorum every one s ideal is the perfect man the true the free man et cetera The efforts of modern times aim to set up the ideal of the free man If one could find it there would be a new religion because a new ideal there would be a new longing a new torment a new devotion a new deity a new contrition With the ideal of absolute liberty the same turmoil is made as with everything absolute and according to Hess e g it is said to be realizable in absolute human society one hundred seventy five Nay this realization is immediately afterward styled a vocation just so he then defines liberty as morality the kingdom of justice i e equality and morality i e liberty is to begin et cetera Ridiculous is he who while fellows of his tribe family nation et cetera rank high is nothing but puffed up over the merit of his fellows but blinded too is he who wants only to be man Neither of them puts his worth in exclusiveness but in connectedness or in the tie that conjoins him with others in the ties of blood of nationality of humanity Through the Nationals of to day the conflict has again been stirred up between those who think themselves to have merely human blood and human ties of blood and the others who brag of their special blood and the special ties of blood If we disregard the fact that pride may mean conceit and take it for consciousness alone there is found to be a vast difference between pride in belonging to a nation and therefore being its property and that in calling a nationality one s property Nationality is my quality but the nation my owner and mistress If you have bodily strength you can apply it at a suitable place and have a self consciousness or pride of it if on the contrary your strong body has you then it pricks you everywhere and at the most unsuitable place to show its strength you can give nobody your hand without squeezing his The perception that one is more than a member of the family more than a fellow of the tribe more than an individual of the people et cetera has finally led to saying one is more than all this because one is man or the man is more than the Jew German et cetera Therefore be every one wholly and solely man Could one not rather say Because we are more than what has been stated therefore we will be this as well as that more also Man and German then man and Guelph et cetera The Nationals are in the right one cannot deny his nationality and the humanitarians are in the right one must not remain in the narrowness of the national In uniqueness one hundred seventy six the contradiction is solved the national is my quality But I am not swallowed up in my quality as the human too is my quality but I give to man his existence first through my uniqueness History seeks for Man but he is I you we Sought as a mysterious essence as the divine first as God then as Man humanity humaneness and mankind he is found as the individual the finite the unique one I am owner of humanity am humanity and do nothing for the good of another humanity Fool you who are a unique humanity that you make a merit of wanting to live for another than you are The hitherto considered relation of me to the world of men offers such a wealth of phenomena that it will have to be taken up again and again on other occasions but here where it was only to have its chief outlines made clear to the eye it must be broken off to make place for an apprehension of two other sides toward which it radiates For as I find myself in relation not merely to men so far as they present in themselves the concept man or are children of men children of Man as children of God are spoken of but also to that which they have of man and call their own and as therefore I relate myself not only to that which they are through man but also to their human possessions so besides the world of men the world of the senses and of ideas will have to be included in our survey and somewhat said of what men call their own of sensuous goods and of spiritual as well According as one had developed and clearly grasped the concept of man he gave it to us to respect as this or that person of respect and from the broadest understanding of this concept there proceeded at last the command to respect Man in every one But if I respect Man my respect must likewise extend to the human or what is Man s Men have somewhat of their own and I am to recognize this own and hold it sacred Their own consists partly in outward partly in inward possessions The former are things the latter spiritualities thoughts convictions noble feelings et cetera But I am always to respect only rightful or human possessions the wrongful and unhuman I need not spare for only Man s own is men s real own An inward possession of this sort is e g religion because religion is free i e is Man s I must not strike at it Just so honor is an inward possession it is free and must not be struck at by me Action for insult caricatures et cetera Religion and honor are spiritual property In tangible property the person stands foremost my person is my first property Hence freedom of the person but only the rightful or human person is free the other is locked up Your life is your property but it is sacred for men only if it is not that of an inhuman monster What a man as such cannot defend of bodily goods we may take from him this is the meaning of competition of freedom of occupation What he cannot defend of spiritual goods falls a prey to us likewise so far goes the liberty of discussion of science of criticism But consecrated goods are inviolable Consecrated and guaranteed by whom Proximately by the State society but properly by man or the concept the concept of the thing for the concept of consecrated goods is this that they are truly human or rather that the holder possesses them as man and not as un man one hundred seventy seven On the spiritual side man s faith is such goods his honor his moral feeling yes his feeling of decency modesty et cetera Actions speeches writings that touch honor are punishable attacks on the foundation of all religion attacks on political faith in short attacks on everything that a man rightly has How far critical liberalism would extend the sanctity of goods on this point it has not yet made any pronouncement and doubtless fancies itself to be ill disposed toward all sanctity but as it combats egoism it must set limits to it and must not let the un man pounce on the human To its theoretical contempt for the masses there must correspond a practical snub if it should get into power What extension the concept man receives and what comes to the individual man through it what therefore man and the human are on this point the various grades of liberalism differ and the political the social the humane man are each always claiming more than the other for man He who has best grasped this concept knows best what is man s The State still grasps this concept in political restriction society in social mankind so it is said is the first to comprehend it entirely or the history of mankind develops it But if man is discovered then we know also what pertains to man as his own man s property the human But let the individual man lay claim to ever so many rights because Man or the concept man entitles him to them i e because his being man does it what do I care for his right and his claim If he has his right only from Man and does not have it from me then for me he has no right His life e g counts to me only for what it is worth to me I respect neither a so called right of property or his claim to tangible goods nor yet his right to the sanctuary of his inner nature or his right to have the spiritual goods and divinities his gods remain unaggrieved His goods the sensuous as well as the spiritual are mine and I dispose of them as proprietor in the measure of my might In the property question lies a broader meaning than the limited statement of the question allows to be brought out Referred solely to what men call our possessions it is capable of no solution the decision is to be found only in him from whom we have everything Property depends on the owner The Revolution directed its weapons against everything which came from the grace of God e g against divine right in whose place the human was confirmed To that which is granted by the grace of God there is opposed that which is derived from the essence of man Now as men s relation to each other in opposition to the religious dogma which commands a Love one another for God s sake had to receive its human position by a Love each other for man s sake so the revolutionary teaching could not do otherwise than first as to what concerns the relation of men to the things of this world settle it that the world which hitherto was arranged according to God s ordinance henceforth belongs to Man The world belongs to Man and is to be respected by me as his property Property is what is mine Property in the civic sense means sacred property such that I must respect your property Respect for property Hence the politicians would like to have every one possess his little bit of property and they have in part brought about an incredible parcellation by this effort Each must have his bone on which he may find something to bite The position of affairs is different in the egoistic sense I do not step shyly back from your property but look upon it always as my property in which I need to respect nothing Pray do the like with what you call my property With this view we shall most easily come to an understanding with each other The political liberals are anxious that if possible all servitudes be dissolved and every one be free lord on his ground even if this ground has only so much area as can have its requirements adequately filled by the manure of one person The farmer in the story married even in his old age that he might profit by his wife s dung Be it ever so little if one only has somewhat of his own to wit a respected property The more such owners such cotters one hundred seventy eight the more free people and good patriots has the State Political liberalism like everything religious counts on respect humaneness the virtues of love Therefore does it live in incessant vexation For in practice people respect nothing and every day the small possessions are bought up again by greater proprietors and the free people change into day laborers If on the contrary the small proprietors had reflected that the great property was also theirs they would not have respectfully shut themselves out from it and would not have been shut out Property as the civic liberals understand it deserves the attacks of the Communists and Proudhon it is untenable because the civic proprietor is in truth nothing but a propertyless man one who is everywhere shut out Instead of owning the world as he might he does not own even the paltry point on which he turns around Proudhon wants not the proprietaire but the possesseur or usufruitier one hundred seventy nine What does that mean He wants no one to own the land but the benefit of it even though one were allowed only the hundredth part of this benefit this fruit is at any rate one s property which he can dispose of at will He who has only the benefit of a field is assuredly not the proprietor of it still less he who as Proudhon would have it must give up so much of this benefit as is not required for his wants but he is the proprietor of the share that is left him Proudhon therefore denies only such and such property not property itself If we want no longer to leave the land to the landed proprietors but to appropriate it to ourselves we unite ourselves to this end form a union a societe that makes itself proprietor if we have good luck in this then those persons cease to be landed proprietors And as from the land so we can drive them out of many another property yet in order to make it our property the property of the conquerors The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity but so called humanity too is as such only a thought spook the individuals are its reality And these individuals as a collective mass will treat land and earth not less arbitrarily than an isolated individual or so called proprietaire Even so therefore property remains standing and that as exclusive too in that humanity this great society excludes the individual from its property perhaps only leases to him gives him as a fief a piece of it as it besides excludes everything that is not humanity e g does not allow animals to have property So too it will remain and will grow to be That in which all want to have a share will be withdrawn from that individual who wants to have it for himself alone it is made a common estate As a common estate every one has his share in it and this share is his property Why so in our old relations a house which belongs to five heirs is their common estate but the fifth part of the revenue is each one s property Proudhon might spare his prolix pathos if he said There are some things that belong only to a few and to which we others will from now on lay claim or siege Let us take them because one comes to property by taking and the property of which for the present we are still deprived came to the proprietors likewise only by taking It can be utilized better if it is in the hands of us all than if the few control it Let us therefore associate ourselves for the purpose of this robbery vol Instead of this he tries to get us to believe that society is the original possessor and the sole proprietor of imprescriptible right against it the so called proprietors have become thieves La propriete c est le vol if it now deprives of his property the present proprietor it robs him of nothing as it is only availing itself of its imprescriptible right So far one comes with the spook of society as a moral person On the contrary what man can obtain belongs to him the world belongs to me Do you say anything else by your opposite proposition The world belongs to all All are I and again I et cetera But you make out of the all a spook and make it sacred so that then the all become the individual s fearful master Then the ghost of right places itself on their side Proudhon like the Communists fights against egoism Therefore they are continuations and consistent carryings out of the Christian principle the principle of love of sacrifice for something general something alien They complete in property e g only what has long been extant as a matter of fact viz the propertylessness of the individual When the law says Ad reges potestas omnium pertinet ad singulos proprietas omnia rex imperio possidet singuli dominio this means The king is proprietor for he alone can control and dispose of everything he has potestas and imperium over it The Communists make this clearer transferring that imperium to the society of all Therefore Because enemies of egoism they are on that account Christians or more generally speaking religious men believers in ghosts dependents servants of some generality God society et cetera In this too Proudhon is like the Christians that he ascribes to God that which he denies to men He names him e g page ninety the Proprietaire of the earth Herewith he proves that he cannot think away the proprietor as such he comes to a proprietor at last but removes him to the other world Neither God nor Man human society is proprietor but the individual Proudhon Weitling too thinks he is telling the worst about property when he calls it theft vol Passing quite over the embarrassing question what well founded objection could be made against theft we only ask Is the concept theft at all possible unless one allows validity to the concept property How can one steal if property is not already extant What belongs to no one cannot be stolen the water that one draws out of the sea he does not steal Accordingly property is not theft but a theft becomes possible only through property Weitling has to come to this too as he does regard everything as the property of all if something is the property of all then indeed the individual who appropriates it to himself steals Private property lives by grace of the law Only in the law has it its warrant for possession is not yet property it becomes mine only by assent of the law it is not a fact not un fait as Proudhon thinks but a fiction a thought This is legal property legitimate property guaranteed property It is mine not through me but through the law Nevertheless property is the expression for unlimited dominion over somewhat thing beast man which I can judge and dispose of as seems good to me According to Roman law indeed jus utendi et abutendi re sua quatenus juris ratio patitur an exclusive and unlimited right but property is conditioned by might What I have in my power that is my own So long as I assert myself as holder I am the proprietor of the thing if it gets away from me again no matter by what power e g through my recognition of a title of others to the thing then the property is extinct Thus property and possession coincide It is not a right lying outside my might that legitimizes me but solely my might if I no longer have this the thing vanishes away from me When the Romans no longer had any might against the Germans the world empire of Rome belonged to the latter and it would sound ridiculous to insist that the Romans had nevertheless remained properly the proprietors Whoever knows how to take and to defend the thing to him it belongs till it is again taken from him as liberty belongs to him who takes it Only might decides about property and as the State no matter whether State of well to do citizens or of ragamuffins or of men in the absolute is the sole mighty one it alone is proprietor I the unique one hundred eighty have nothing and am only enfeoffed am vassal and as such servitor Under the dominion of the State there is no property of mine I want to raise the value of myself the value of ownness and should I cheapen property No as I was not respected hitherto because people mankind and a thousand other generalities were put higher so property too has to this day not yet been recognized in its full value Property too was only the property of a ghost e g the people s property my whole existence belonged to the fatherland I belonged to the fatherland the people the State and therefore also everything that I called my own It is demanded of States that they make away with pauperism It seems to me this is asking that the State should cut off its own head and lay it at its feet for so long as the State is the ego the individual ego must remain a poor devil a non ego The State has an interest only in being itself rich whether Michael is rich and Peter poor is alike to it Peter might also be rich and Michael poor It looks on indifferently as one grows poor and the other rich unruffled by this alternation As individuals they are really equal before its face in this it is just before it both of them are nothing as we are altogether sinners before God on the other hand it has a very great interest in this that those individuals who make it their ego should have a part in its wealth it makes them partakers in its property Through property with which it rewards the individuals it tames them but this remains its property and every one has the usufruct of it only so long as he bears in himself the ego of the State or is a loyal member of society in the opposite case the property is confiscated or made to melt away by vexatious lawsuits The property then is and remains State property not property of the ego That the State does not arbitrarily deprive the individual of what he has from the State means simply that the State does not rob itself He who is a State ego i e a good citizen or subject holds his fief undisturbed as such an ego not as being an ego of his own According to the code property is what I call mine by virtue of God and law But it is mine by virtue of God and law only so long as the State has nothing against it In expropriations disarmaments and the like as e g the exchequer confiscates inheritances if the heirs do not put in an appearance early enough how plainly the else veiled principle that only the people the State is proprietor while the individual is feoffee strikes the eye The State I mean to say cannot intend that anybody should for his own sake have property or actually be rich nay even well to do it can acknowledge nothing grant nothing to me as me The State cannot check pauperism because the poverty of possession is a poverty of me He who is nothing but what chance or another to wit the State makes out of him also has quite rightly nothing but what another gives him And this other will give him only what he deserves i e what he is worth by service It is not he that realizes a value from himself the State realizes a value from him National economy busies itself much with this subject It lies far out beyond the national however and goes beyond the concepts and horizon of the State which knows only State property and can distribute nothing else For this reason it binds the possession of property to conditions as it binds everything to them e g marriage allowing validity only to the marriage sanctioned by it and wresting this out of my power But property is my property only when I hold it unconditionally only I as unconditioned ego have property enter a relation of love carry on free trade The State has no anxiety about me and mine but about itself and its I count for something to it only as its child as a son of the country as ego I am nothing at all for it For the State s understanding what befalls me as ego is something accidental my wealth as well as my impoverishment But if I with all that is mine am an accident in the State s eyes this proves that it cannot comprehend me I go beyond its concepts or its understanding is too limited to comprehend me Therefore it cannot do anything for me either Pauperism is the valuelessness of me the phenomenon that I cannot realize value from myself For this reason State and pauperism are one and the same The State does not let me come to my value and continues in existence only through my valuelessness it is forever intent on getting benefit from me i e exploiting me turning me to account using me up even if the use it gets from me consists only in my supplying a proles proletariat it wants me to be its creature Pauperism can be removed only when I as ego realize value from myself when I give my own self value and make my price myself I must rise in revolt to rise in the world What I produce flour linen or iron and coal which I toilsomely win from the earth et cetera is my work that I want to realize value from But then I may long complain that I am not paid for my work according to its value the payer will not listen to me and the State likewise will maintain an apathetic attitude so long as it does not think it must appease me that I may not break out with my dreaded might But this appeasing will be all and if it comes into my head to ask for more the State turns against me with all the force of its lion paws and eagle claws for it is the king of beasts it is lion and eagle If I refuse to be content with the price that it fixes for my ware and labor if I rather aspire to determine the price of my ware myself i e to pay myself in the first place I come into a conflict with the buyers of the ware If this were stilled by a mutual understanding the State would not readily make objections for how individuals get along with each other troubles it little so long as therein they do not get in its way Its damage and its danger begin only when they do not agree but in the absence of a settlement take each other by the hair The State cannot endure that man stand in a direct relation to man it must step between as mediator must intervene What Christ was what the saints the Church were the State has become to wit mediator It tears man from man to put itself between them as spirit The laborers who ask for higher pay are treated as criminals as soon as they want to compel it What are they to do Without compulsion they don t get it and in compulsion the State sees a self help a determination of price by the ego a genuine free realization of value from his property which it cannot admit of What then are the laborers to do Look to themselves and ask nothing about the State But as is the situation with regard to my material work so it is with my intellectual too The State allows me to realize value from all my thoughts and to find customers for them I do realize value from them e g in the very fact that they bring me honor from the listeners and the like but only so long as my thoughts are its thoughts If on the other hand I harbor thoughts that it cannot approve i e make its own then it does not allow me at all to realize value from them to bring them into exchange into commerce My thoughts are free only if they are granted to me by the State s grace i e if they are the State s thoughts It lets me philosophize freely only so far as I approve myself a philosopher of State against the State I must not philosophize gladly as it tolerates my helping it out of its deficiencies furthering it Therefore as I may behave only as an ego most graciously permitted by the State provided with its testimonial of legitimacy and police pass so too it is not granted me to realize value from what is mine unless this proves to be its which I hold as fief from it My ways must be its ways else it distrains me my thoughts its thoughts else it stops my mouth The State has nothing to be more afraid of than the value of me and nothing must it more carefully guard against than every occasion that offers itself to me for realizing value from myself I am the deadly enemy of the State which always hovers between the alternatives it or I Therefore it strictly insists not only on not letting me have a standing but also on keeping down what is mine In the State there is no property i e no property of the individual but only State property Only through the State have I what I have as I am only through it what I am My private property is only that which the State leaves to me of its cutting off others from it depriving them making it private it is State property But in opposition to the State I feel more and more clearly that there is still left me a great might the might over myself i e over everything that pertains only to me and that exists only in being my own What do I do if my ways are no longer its ways my thoughts no longer its thoughts I look to myself and ask nothing about it In my thoughts which I get sanctioned by no assent grant or grace I have my real property a property with which I can trade For as mine they are my creatures and I am in a position to give them away in return for other thoughts I give them up and take in exchange for them others which then are my new purchased property What then is my property Nothing but what is in my power To what property am I entitled To every property to which I empower myself one hundred eighty one I give myself the right of property in taking property to myself or giving myself the proprietor s power full power empowerment Everything over which I have might that cannot be torn from me remains my property well then let might decide about property and I will expect everything from my might Alien might might that I leave to another makes me an owned slave then let my own might make me an owner Let me then withdraw the might that I have conceded to others out of ignorance regarding the strength of my own might Let me say to myself what my might reaches to is my property and let me claim as property everything that I feel myself strong enough to attain and let me extend my actual property as far as I entitle i e empower myself to take Here egoism selfishness must decide not the principle of love not love motives like mercy gentleness good nature or even justice and equity for justitia too is a phenomenon of love a product of love love knows only sacrifices and demands self sacrifice Egoism does not think of sacrificing anything giving away anything that it wants it simply decides What I want I must have and will procure All attempts to enact rational laws about property have put out from the bay of love into a desolate sea of regulations Even Socialism and Communism cannot be excepted from this Every one is to be provided with adequate means for which it is little to the point whether one socialistically finds them still in a personal property or communistically draws them from the community of goods The individual s mind in this remains the same it remains a mind of dependence The distributing board of equity lets me have only what the sense of equity its loving care for all prescribes For me the individual there lies no less of a check in collective wealth than in that of individual others neither that is mine nor this whether the wealth belongs to the collectivity which confers part of it on me or to individual possessors is for me the same constraint as I cannot decide about either of the two On the contrary Communism by the abolition of all personal property only presses me back still more into dependence on another viz on the generality or collectivity and loudly as it always attacks the State what it intends is itself again a State a status a condition hindering my free movement a sovereign power over me Communism rightly revolts against the pressure that I experience from individual proprietors but still more horrible is the might that it puts in the hands of the collectivity Egoism takes another way to root out the non possessing rabble It does not say Wait for what the board of equity will bestow on you in the name of the collectivity for such bestowal took place in States from the most ancient times each receiving according to his desert and therefore according to the measure in which each was able to deserve it to acquire it by service but Take hold and take what you require With this the war of all against all is declared I alone decide what I will have Now that is truly no new wisdom for self seekers have acted so at all times Not at all necessary either that the thing be new if only consciousness of it is present But this latter will not be able to claim great age unless perhaps one counts in the Egyptian and Spartan law for how little current it is appears even from the stricture above which speaks with contempt of self seekers One is to know just this that the procedure of taking hold is not contemptible but manifests the pure deed of the egoist at one with himself Only when I expect neither from individuals nor from a collectivity what I can give to myself only then do I slip out of the snares of love the rabble ceases to be rabble only when it takes hold Only the dread of taking hold and the corresponding punishment thereof makes it a rabble Only that taking hold is sin crime only this dogma creates a rabble For the fact that the rabble remains what it is it because it allows validity to that dogma is to blame as well as more especially those who self seekingly to give them back their favorite word demand that the dogma be respected In short the lack of consciousness of that new wisdom the old consciousness of sin alone bears the blame If men reach the point of losing respect for property every one will have property as all slaves become free men as soon as they no longer respect the master as master Unions will then in this matter too multiply the individual s means and secure his assailed property According to the Communists opinion the commune should be proprietor On the contrary I am proprietor and I only come to an understanding with others about my property If the commune does not do what suits me I rise against it and defend my property I am proprietor but property is not sacred I should be merely possessor No hitherto one was only possessor secured in the possession of a parcel by leaving others also in possession of a parcel but now everything belongs to me I am proprietor of everything that I require and can get possession of If it is said socialistically society gives me what I require then the egoist says I take what I require If the Communists conduct themselves as ragamuffins the egoist behaves as proprietor All swan fraternities one hundred eighty two and attempts at making the rabble happy that spring from the principle of love must miscarry Only from egoism can the rabble get help and this help it must give to itself and will give to itself If it does not let itself be coerced into fear it is a power People would lose all respect if one did not coerce them so into fear says bugbear Law in Der gestiefelte Kater Property therefore should not and cannot be abolished it must rather be torn from ghostly hands and become my property then the erroneous consciousness that I cannot entitle myself to as much as I require will vanish But what cannot man require Well whoever requires much and understands how to get it has at all times helped himself to it as Napoleon did with the Continent and France with Algiers Hence the exact point is that the respectful rabble should learn at last to help itself to what it requires If it reaches out too far for you why then defend yourselves You have no need at all to good heartedly bestow anything on it and when it learns to know itself it or rather whoever of the rabble learns to know himself he casts off the rabble quality in refusing your alms with thanks But it remains ridiculous that you declare the rabble sinful and criminal if it is not pleased to live from your favors because it can do something in its own favor Your bestowals cheat it and put it off Defend your property then you will be strong if on the other hand you want to retain your ability to bestow and perhaps actually have the more political rights the more alms poor rates you can give this will work just as long as the recipients let you work it one hundred eighty three In short the property question cannot be solved so amicably as the Socialists yes even the Communists dream It is solved only by the war of all against all The poor become free and proprietors only when they rise Bestow ever so much on them they will still always want more for they want nothing less than that at last nothing more be bestowed It will be asked But how then will it be when the have nots take heart Of what sort is the settlement to be One might as well ask that I cast a child s nativity What a slave will do as soon as he has broken his fetters one must await In Kaiser s pamphlet worthless for lack of form as well as substance Die Persoenlichkeit des Eigentuemers in Bezug auf den Socialismus und Communismus et cetera he hopes from the State that it will bring about a leveling of property Always the State Herr Papa As the Church was proclaimed and looked upon as the mother of believers so the State has altogether the face of the provident father Competition shows itself most strictly connected with the principle of civism Is it anything else than equality egalite And is not equality a product of that same Revolution which was brought on by the commonalty the middle classes As no one is barred from competing with all in the State except the prince because he represents the State itself and working himself up to their height yes overthrowing or exploiting them for his own advantage soaring above them and by stronger exertion depriving them of their favorable circumstances this serves as a clear proof that before the State s judgment seat every one has only the value of a simple individual and may not count on any favoritism Outrun and outbid each other as much as you like and can that shall not trouble me the State Among yourselves you are free in competing you are competitors that is your social position But before me the State you are nothing but simple individuals one hundred eighty four What in the form of principle or theory was propounded as the equality of all has found here in competition its realization and practical carrying out for egalite is free competition All are before the State simple individuals in society or in relation to each other competitors I need be nothing further than a simple individual to be able to compete with all others aside from the prince and his family a freedom which formerly was made impossible by the fact that only by means of one s corporation and within it did one enjoy any freedom of effort In the guild and feudality the State is in an intolerant and fastidious attitude granting privileges in competition and liberalism it is in a tolerant and indulgent attitude granting only patents letters assuring the applicant that the business stands open patent to him or concessions Now as the State has thus left everything to the applicants it must come in conflict with all because each and all are entitled to make application It will be stormed and will go down in this storm Is free competition then really free nay is it really a competition to wit one of persons as it gives itself out to be because on this title it bases its right It originated you know in persons becoming free of all personal rule Is a competition free which the State this ruler in the civic principle hems in by a thousand barriers There is a rich manufacturer doing a brilliant business and I should like to compete with him Go ahead says the State I have no objection to make to your person as competitor Yes I reply but for that I need a space for buildings I need money That s bad but if you have no money you cannot compete You must not take anything from anybody for I protect property and grant it privileges Free competition is not free because I lack the THINGS for competition Against my person no objection can be made but because I have not the things my person too must step to the rear And who has the necessary things Perhaps that manufacturer Why from him I could take them away No the State has them as property the manufacturer only as fief as possession But since it is no use trying it with the manufacturer I will compete with that professor of jurisprudence the man is a booby and I who know a hundred times more than he shall make his class room empty Have you studied and graduated friend No but what of that I understand abundantly what is necessary for instruction in that department Sorry but competition is not free here Against your person there is nothing to be said but the thing the doctor s diploma is lacking And this diploma I the State demand Ask me for it respectfully first then we will see what is to be done This therefore is the freedom of competition The State my lord first qualifies me to compete But do persons really compete No again things only Moneys in the first place et cetera In the rivalry one will always be left behind another e g a poetaster behind a poet But it makes a difference whether the means that the unlucky competitor lacks are personal or material and likewise whether the material means can be won by personal energy or are to be obtained only by grace only as a present as when e g the poorer man must leave i e present to the rich man his riches But if I must all along wait for the State s approval to obtain or to use e g in the case of graduation the means I have the means by the grace of the State one hundred eighty five Free competition therefore has only the following meaning To the State all rank as its equal children and every one can scud and run to earn the State s goods and largess Therefore all do chase after havings holdings possessions be it of money or offices titles of honor et cetera after the things In the mind of the commonalty every one is possessor or owner Now whence comes it that the most have in fact next to nothing From this that the most are already joyful over being possessors at all even though it be of some rags as children are joyful in their first trousers or even the first penny that is presented to them More precisely however the matter is to be taken as follows Liberalism came forward at once with the declaration that it belonged to man s essence not to be property but proprietor As the consideration here was about man not about the individual the how much which formed exactly the point of the individual s special interest was left to him Hence the individual s egoism retained room for the freest play in this how much and carried on an indefatigable competition However the lucky egoism had to become a snag in the way of the less fortunate and the latter still keeping its feet planted on the principle of humanity put forward the question as to the how much of possession and answered it to the effect that man must have as much as he requires Will it be possible for my egoism to let itself be satisfied with that What man requires furnishes by no means a scale for measuring me and my needs for I may have use for less or more I must rather have so much as I am competent to appropriate Competition suffers from the unfavorable circumstance that the means for competing are not at every one s command because they are not taken from personality but from accident Most are without means and for this reason without goods Hence the Socialists demand the means for all and aim at a society that shall offer means Your money value say they we no longer recognize as your competence you must show another competence to wit your working force In the possession of a property or as possessor man does certainly show himself as man it was for this reason that we let the possessor whom we called proprietor keep his standing so long Yet you possess the things only so long as you are not put out of this property The possessor is competent but only so far as the others are incompetent Since your ware forms your competence only so long as you are competent to defend it i e as we are not competent to do anything with it look about you for another competence for we now by our might surpass your alleged competence It was an extraordinarily large gain made when the point of being regarded as possessors was put through Therein bondservice was abolished and every one who till then had been bound to the lord s service and more or less had been his property now became a lord But henceforth your having and what you have are no longer adequate and no longer recognized per contra your working and your work rise in value We now respect your subduing things as we formerly did your possessing them Your work is your competence You are lord or possessor only of what comes by work not by inheritance But as at the time everything has come by inheritance and every copper that you possess bears not a labor stamp but an inheritance stamp everything must be melted over But is my work then really as the Communists suppose my sole competence or does not this consist rather in everything that I am competent for And does not the workers society itself have to concede this e g in supporting also the sick children old men in short those who are incapable of work These are still competent for a good deal e g to preserve their life instead of taking it If they are competent to cause you to desire their continued existence they have a power over you To him who exercised utterly no power over you you would vouchsafe nothing he might perish Therefore what you are competent for is your competence If you are competent to furnish pleasure to thousands then thousands will pay you an honorarium for it for it would stand in your power to forbear doing it hence they must purchase your deed If you are not competent to captivate any one you may simply starve Now am I who am competent for much perchance to have no advantage over the less competent We are all in the midst of abundance now shall I not help myself as well as I can but only wait and see how much is left me in an equal division Against competition there rises up the principle of ragamuffin society partition To be looked upon as a mere part part of society the individual cannot bear because he is more his uniqueness puts from it this limited conception Hence he does not await his competence from the I sharing of others and even in the workers society there arises the misgiving that in an equal partition the strong will be exploited by the weak he awaits his competence rather from himself and says now What I am competent to have that is my competence What competence does not the child possess in its smiling its playing its screaming in short in its mere existence Are you capable of resisting its desire or do you not hold out to it as mother your breast as father as much of your possessions as it needs It compels you therefore it possesses what you call yours If your person is of consequence to me you pay me with your very existence if I am concerned only with one of your qualities then your compliance perhaps or your aid has a value a money value for me and I purchase it If you do not know how to give yourself any other than a money value in my estimation there may arise the case of which history tells us that Germans sons of the fatherland were sold to America Should those who let themselves be traded in be worth more to the seller He preferred the cash to this living ware that did not understand how to make itself precious to him That he discovered nothing more valuable in it was assuredly a defect of his competence but it takes a rogue to give more than he has How should he show respect when he did not have it nay hardly could have it for such a pack You behave egoistically when you respect each other neither as possessors nor as ragamuffins or workers but as a part of your competence as useful bodies Then you will neither give anything to the possessor proprietor for his possessions nor to him who works but only to him whom you require The North Americans ask themselves Do we require a king and answer Not a farthing are he and his work worth to us If it is said that competition throws every thing open to all the expression is not accurate and it is better put thus competition makes everything purchasable In abandoning one hundred eighty six it to them competition leaves it to their appraisal one hundred eighty seven or their estimation and demands a price one hundred eighty eight for it But the would be buyers mostly lack the means to make themselves buyers they have no money For money then the purchasable things are indeed to be had For money everything is to be had but it is exactly money that is lacking Where is one to get money this current or circulating property Know then you have as much money one hundred eighty nine as you have might for you count one hundred ninety for as much as you make yourself count for One pays not with money of which there may come a lack but with his competence by which alone we are competent one hundred ninety one for one is proprietor only so far as the arm of our power reaches Weitling has thought out a new means of payment work But the true means of payment remains as always competence With what you have within your competence you pay Therefore think on the enlargement of your competence This being admitted they are nevertheless right on hand again with the motto To each according to his competence Who is to give to me according to my competence Society Then I should have to put up with its estimation Rather I shall take according to my competence All belongs to all This proposition springs from the same unsubstantial theory To each belongs only what he is competent for If I say The world belongs to me properly that too is empty talk which has a meaning only in so far as I respect no alien property But to me belongs only as much as I am competent for or have within my competence One is not worthy to have what one through weakness lets be taken from him one is not worthy of it because one is not capable of it They raise a mighty uproar over the wrong of a thousand years which is being committed by the rich against the poor As if the rich were to blame for poverty and the poor were not in like manner responsible for riches Is there another difference between the two than that of competence and incompetence of the competent and incompetent Wherein pray does the crime of the rich consist In their hardheartedness But who then have maintained the poor who have cared for their nourishment who have given alms those alms that have even their name from mercy eleemosyne Have not the rich been merciful at all times are they not to this day tender hearted as poor taxes hospitals foundations of all sorts et cetera prove But all this does not satisfy you Doubtless then they are to share with the poor Now you are demanding that they shall abolish poverty Aside from the point that there might be hardly one among you who would act so and that this one would be a fool for it do ask yourselves why should the rich let go their fleeces and give up themselves thereby pursuing the advantage of the poor rather than their own You who have your thaler daily are rich above thousands who live on four groschen Is it for your interest to share with the thousands or is it not rather for theirs With competition is connected less the intention to do the thing best than the intention to make it as profitable as productive as possible Hence people study to get into the civil service pot boiling study study cringing and flattery routine and acquaintance with business work for appearances Hence while it is apparently a matter of doing good service in truth only a good business and earning of money are looked out for The job is done only ostensibly for the job s sake but in fact on account of the gain that it yields One would indeed prefer not to be censor but one wants to be advanced one would like to judge administer et cetera according to his best convictions but one is afraid of transference or even dismissal one must above all things live Thus these goings on are a fight for dear life and in gradation upward for more or less of a good living And yet withal their whole round of toil and care brings in for most only bitter life and bitter poverty All the bitter painstaking for this Restless acquisition does not let us take breath take a calm enjoyment we do not get the comfort of our possessions But the organization of labor touches only such labors as others can do for us e g slaughtering tillage et cetera the rest remain egoistic because e g no one can in your stead elaborate your musical compositions carry out your projects of painting et cetera nobody can replace Raphael s labors The latter are labors of a unique person one hundred ninety two which only he is competent to achieve while the former deserved to be called human since what is anybody s own in them is of slight account and almost any man can be trained to it Now as society can regard only labors for the common benefit human labors he who does anything unique remains without its care nay he may find himself disturbed by its intervention The unique person will work himself forth out of society all right but society brings forth no unique person Hence it is at any rate helpful that we come to an agreement about human labors that they may not as under competition claim all our time and toil So far Communism will bear its fruits For before the dominion of the commonalty even that for which all men are qualified or can be qualified was tied up to a few and withheld from the rest it was a privilege To the commonalty it looked equitable to leave free all that seemed to exist for every man But because left one hundred ninety three free it was yet given to no one but rather left to each to be got hold of by his human power By this the mind was turned to the acquisition of the human which henceforth beckoned to every one and there arose a movement which one hears so loudly bemoaned under the name of materialism Communism seeks to check its course spreading the belief that the human is not worth so much discomfort and with sensible arrangements could be gained without the great expense of time and powers which has hitherto seemed requisite But for whom is time to be gained For what does man require more time than is necessary to refresh his wearied powers of labor Here Communism is silent For what To take comfort in himself as the unique after he has done his part as man In the first joy over being allowed to stretch out their hands toward everything human people forgot to want anything else and they competed away vigorously as if the possession of the human were the goal of all our wishes But they have run themselves tired and are gradually noticing that possession does not give happiness Therefore they are thinking of obtaining the necessary by an easier bargain and spending on it only so much time and toil as its indispensableness exacts Riches fall in price and contented poverty the care free ragamuffin becomes the seductive ideal Should such human activities that every one is confident of his capacity for be highly salaried and sought for with toil and expenditure of all life forces Even in the every day form of speech If I were minister or even the then it should go quite otherwise that confidence expresses itself that one holds himself capable of playing the part of such a dignitary one does get a perception that to things of this sort there belongs not uniqueness but only a culture which is attainable even if not exactly by all at any rate by many i e that for such a thing one need only be an ordinary man If we assume that as order belongs to the essence of the State so subordination too is founded in its nature then we see that the subordinates or those who have received preferment disproportionately overcharge and overreach those who are put in the lower ranks But the latter take heart first from the Socialist standpoint but certainly with egoistic consciousness later of which we will therefore at once give their speech some coloring for the question By what then is your property secure you creatures of preferment and give themselves the answer By our refraining from interference And so by our protection And what do you give us for it Kicks and disdain you give to the common people police supervision and a catechism with the chief sentence Respect what is not yours what belongs to others respect others and especially your superiors But we reply If you want our respect buy it for a price agreeable to us We will leave you your property if you give a due equivalent for this leaving Really what equivalent does the general in time of peace give for the many thousands of his yearly income another for the sheer hundred thousands and millions yearly What equivalent do you give for our chewing potatoes and looking calmly on while you swallow oysters Only buy the oysters of us as dear as we have to buy the potatoes of you then you may go on eating them Or do you suppose the oysters do not belong to us as much as to you You will make an outcry over violence if we reach out our hands and help consume them and you are right Without violence we do not get them as you no less have them by doing violence to us But take the oysters and have done with it and let us consider our nearer property labor for the other is only possession We distress ourselves twelve hours in the sweat of our face and you offer us a few groschen for it Then take the like for your labor too Are you not willing You fancy that our labor is richly repaid with that wage while yours on the other hand is worth a wage of many thousands But if you did not rate yours so high and gave us a better chance to realize value from ours then we might well if the case demanded it bring to pass still more important things than you do for the many thousand thalers and if you got only such wages as we you would soon grow more industrious in order to receive more But if you render any service that seems to us worth ten and a hundred times more than our own labor why then you shall get a hundred times more for it too we on the other hand think also to produce for you things for which you will requite us more highly than with the ordinary day s wages We shall be willing to get along with each other all right if only we have first agreed on this that neither any longer needs to present anything to the other Then we may perhaps actually go so far as to pay even the cripples and sick and old an appropriate price for not parting from us by hunger and want for if we want them to live it is fitting also that we purchase the fulfilment of our will I say purchase and therefore do not mean a wretched alms For their life is the property even of those who cannot work if we no matter for what reason want them not to withdraw this life from us we can mean to bring this to pass only by purchase nay we shall perhaps maybe because we like to have friendly faces about us even want a life of comfort for them In short we want nothing presented by you but neither will we present you with anything For centuries we have handed alms to you from good hearted stupidity have doled out the mite of the poor and given to the masters the things that are not the masters now just open your wallet for henceforth our ware rises in price quite enormously We do not want to take from you anything anything at all only you are to pay better for what you want to have What then have you I have an estate of a thousand acres And I am your plowman and will henceforth attend to your fields only for one thaler a day wages Then I ll take another You won t find any for we plowmen are no longer doing otherwise and if one puts in an appearance who takes less then let him beware of us There is the housemaid she too is now demanding as much and you will no longer find one below this price Why then it is all over with me Not so fast You will doubtless take in as much as we and if it should not be so we will take off so much that you shall have wherewith to live like us But I am accustomed to live better We have nothing against that but it is not our lookout if you can clear more go ahead Are we to hire out under rates that you may have a good living The rich man always puts off the poor with the words What does your want concern me See to it how you make your way through the world that is your affair not mine Well let us let it be our affair then and let us not let the means that we have to realize value from ourselves be pilfered from us by the rich But you uncultured people really do not need so much Well we are taking somewhat more in order that for it we may procure the culture that we perhaps need But if you thus bring down the rich who is then to support the arts and sciences hereafter Oh well we must make it up by numbers we club together that gives a nice little sum besides you rich men now buy only the most tasteless books and the most lamentable Madonnas or a pair of lively dancer s legs O ill starred equality No my good old sir nothing of equality We only want to count for what we are worth and if you are worth more you shall count for more right along We only want to be worth our price and think to show ourselves worth the price that you will pay Is the State likely to be able to awaken so secure a temper and so forceful a self consciousness in the menial Can it make man feel himself nay may it even do so much as set this goal for itself Can it want the individual to recognize his value and realize this value from himself Let us keep the parts of the double question separate and see first whether the State can bring about such a thing As the unanimity of the plowmen is required only this unanimity can bring it to pass and a State law would be evaded in a thousand ways by competition and in secret But can the State bear with it The State cannot possibly bear with people s suffering coercion from another than it it could not therefore admit the self help of the unanimous plowmen against those who want to engage for lower wages Suppose however that the State made the law and all the plowmen were in accord with it could the State bear with it then In the isolated case yes but the isolated case is more than that it is a case of principle The question therein is of the whole range of the ego s self realization of value from himself and therefore also of his self consciousness against the State So far the Communists keep company but as self realization of value from self necessarily directs itself against the State so it does against society too and therewith reaches out beyond the commune and the communistic out of egoism Communism makes the maxim of the commonalty that every one is a possessor proprietor into an irrefragable truth into a reality since the anxiety about obtaining now ceases and every one has from the start what he requires In his labor force he has his competence and if he makes no use of it that is his fault The grasping and hounding is at an end and no competition is left as so often now without fruit because with every stroke of labor an adequate supply of the needful is brought into the house Now for the first time one is a real possessor because what one has in his labor force can no longer escape from him as it was continually threatening to do under the system of competition One is a care free and assured possessor And one is this precisely by seeking his competence no longer in a ware but in his own labor his competence for labor and therefore by being a ragamuffin a man of only ideal wealth I however cannot content myself with the little that I scrape up by my competence for labor because my competence does not consist merely in my labor By labor I can perform the official functions of a president a minister et cetera these offices demand only a general culture to wit such a culture as is generally attainable for general culture is not merely that which every one has attained but broadly that which every one can attain and therefore every special culture e g medical military philological of which no cultivated man believes that they surpass his powers or broadly only a skill possible to all But even if these offices may vest in every one yet it is only the individual s unique force peculiar to him alone that gives them so to speak life and significance That he does not manage his office like an ordinary man but puts in the competence of his uniqueness this he is not yet paid for when he is paid only in general as an official or a minister If he has done it so as to earn your thanks and you wish to retain this thankworthy force of the unique one you must not pay him like a mere man who performed only what was human but as one who accomplishes what is unique Do the like with your labor do There cannot be a general schedule price fixed for my uniqueness as there can for what I do as man Only for the latter can a schedule price be set Go right on then setting up a general appraisal for human labors but do not deprive your uniqueness of its desert Human or general needs can be satisfied through society for satisfaction of unique needs you must do some seeking A friend and a friendly service or even an individual s service society cannot procure you And yet you will every moment be in need of such a service and on the slightest occasions require somebody who is helpful to you Therefore do not rely on society but see to it that you have the wherewithal to purchase the fulfiment of your wishes Whether money is to be retained among egoists To the old stamp an inherited possession adheres If you no longer let yourselves be paid with it it is ruined if you do nothing for this money it loses all power Cancel the inheritance and you have broken off the executor s court seal For now everything is an inheritance whether it be already inherited or await its heir If it is yours wherefore do you let it be sealed up from you why do you respect the seal But why should you not create a new money Do you then annihilate the ware in taking from it the hereditary stamp Now money is a ware and an essential means or competence For it protects against the ossification of resources keeps them in flux and brings to pass their exchange If you know a better medium of exchange go ahead yet it will be a money again It is not the money that does you damage but your incompetence to take it Let your competence take effect collect yourselves and there will be no lack of money of your money the money of your stamp But working I do not call letting your competence take effect Those who are only looking for work and willing to work hard are preparing for their own selves the infallible upshot to be out of work Good and bad luck depend on money It is a power in the bourgeois period for this reason that it is only wooed on all hands like a girl indissolubly wedded by nobody All the romance and chivalry of wooing for a dear object come to life again in competition Money an object of longing is carried off by the bold knights of industry one hundred ninety four He who has luck takes home the bride The ragamuffin has luck he takes her into his household society and destroys the virgin In his house she is no longer bride but wife and with her virginity her family name is also lost As housewife the maiden Money is called Labor for Labor is her husband s name She is a possession of her husband s To bring this figure to an end the child of Labor and Money is again a girl an unwedded one and therefore Money but with the certain descent from Labor her father The form of the face the effigy bears another stamp Finally as regards competition once more it has a continued existence by this very means that all do not attend to their affair and come to an understanding with each other about it Bread e g is a need of all the inhabitants of a city therefore they might easily agree on setting up a public bakery Instead of this they leave the furnishing of the needful to the competing bakers Just so meat to the butchers wine to the wine dealers et cetera Abolishing competition is not equivalent to favoring the guild The difference is this In the guild baking et cetera is the affair of the guild brothers in competition the affair of chance competitors in the union of those who require baked goods and therefore my affair yours the affair of neither the guildic nor the concessionary baker but the affair of the united If I do not trouble myself about my affair I must be content with what it pleases others to vouchsafe me To have bread is my affair my wish and desire and yet people leave that to the bakers and hope at most to obtain through their wrangling their getting ahead of each other their rivalry in short their competition an advantage which one could not count on in the case of the guild brothers who were lodged entirely and alone in the proprietorship of the baking franchise What every one requires every one should also take a hand in procuring and producing it is his affair his property not the property of the guildic or concessionary master Let us look back once more The world belongs to the children of this world the children of men it is no longer God s world but man s As much as every man can procure of it let him call his only the true man the State human society or mankind will look to it that each shall make nothing else his own than what he appropriates as man i e in human fashion Unhuman appropriation is that which is not consented to by man i e it is a criminal appropriation as the human vice versa is a rightful one one acquired in the way of law So they talk since the Revolution But my property is not a thing since this has an existence independent of me only my might is my own Not this tree but my might or control over it is what is mine Now how is this might perversely expressed They say I have a right to this tree or it is my rightful property So I have earned it by might That the might must last in order that the tree may also be held or better that the might is not a thing existing of itself but has existence solely in the mighty ego in me the mighty is forgotten Might like other of my qualities e g humanity majesty et cetera is exalted to something existing of itself so that it still exists long after it has ceased to be my might Thus transformed into a ghost might is right This eternalized might is not extinguished even with my death but is transferred or bequeathed Things now really belong not to me but to right On the other side this is nothing but a hallucination of vision For the individual s might becomes permanent and a right only by others joining their might with his The delusion consists in their believing that they cannot withdraw their might The same phenomenon over again might is separated from me I cannot take back the might that I gave to the possessor One has granted power of attorney has given away his power has renounced coming to a better mind The proprietor can give up his might and his right to a thing by giving the thing away squandering it and the like And we should not be able likewise to let go the might that we lend to him The rightful man the just desires to call nothing his own that he does not have rightly or have the right to and therefore only legitimate property Now who is to be judge and adjudge his right to him At last surely Man who imparts to him the rights of man then he can say in an infinitely broader sense than Terence humani nihil a me alienum puto i e the human is my property However he may go about it so long as he occupies this standpoint he cannot get clear of a judge and in our time the multifarious judges that had been selected have set themselves against each other in two persons at deadly enmity to wit in God and Man The one party appeal to divine right the other to human right or the rights of man So much is clear that in neither case does the individual do the entitling himself Just pick me out an action to day that would not be a violation of right Every moment the rights of man are trampled under foot by one side while their opponents cannot open their mouth without uttering a blasphemy against divine right Give an alms you mock at a right of man because the relation of beggar and benefactor is an inhuman relation utter a doubt you sin against a divine right Eat dry bread with contentment you violate the right of man by your equanimity eat it with discontent you revile divine right by your repining There is not one among you who does not commit a crime at every moment your speeches are crimes and every hindrance to your freedom of speech is no less a crime Ye are criminals altogether Yet you are so only in that you all stand on the ground of right i e in that you do not even know and understand how to value the fact that you are criminals Inviolable or sacred property has grown on this very ground it is a juridical concept A dog sees the bone in another s power and stands off only if it feels itself too weak But man respects the other s right to his bone The latter action therefore ranks as human the former as brutal or egoistic And as here so in general it is called human when one sees in everything something spiritual here right i e makes everything a ghost and takes his attitude toward it as toward a ghost which one can indeed scare away at its appearance but cannot kill It is human to look at what is individual not as individual but as a generality In nature as such I no longer respect anything but know myself to be entitled to everything against it in the tree in that garden on the other hand I must respect alienness they say in one sided fashion property I must keep my hand off it This comes to an end only when I can indeed leave that tree to another as I leave my stick et cetera to another but do not in advance regard it as alien to me i e sacred Rather I make to myself no crime of felling it if I will and it remains my property however long I resign it to others it is and remains mine In the banker s fortune I as little see anything alien as Napoleon did in the territories of kings we have no dread of conquering it and we look about us also for the means thereto We strip off from it therefore the spirit of alienness of which we had been afraid Therefore it is necessary that I do not lay claim to anything more as man but to everything as I this I and accordingly to nothing human but to mine i e nothing that pertains to me as man but what I will and because I will it Rightful or legitimate property of another will be only that which you are content to recognize as such If your content ceases then this property has lost legitimacy for you and you will laugh at absolute right to it Besides the hitherto discussed property in the limited sense there is held up to our reverent heart another property against which we are far less to sin This property consists in spiritual goods in the sanctuary of the inner nature What a man holds sacred no other is to gibe at because untrue as it may be and zealously as one may in loving and modest wise seek to convince of a true sanctity the man who adheres to it and believes in it yet the sacred itself is always to be honored in it the mistaken man does believe in the sacred even though in an incorrect essence of it and so his belief in the sacred must at least be respected In ruder times than ours it was customary to demand a particular faith and devotion to a particular sacred essence and they did not take the gentlest way with those who believed otherwise since however freedom of belief spread itself more and more abroad the jealous God and sole Lord gradually melted into a pretty general supreme being and it satisfied humane tolerance if only every one revered something sacred Reduces to the human expression this sacred essence is man himself and the human With the deceptive semblance as if the human were altogether our own and free from all the otherworldliness with which that divine is tainted yes as if Man were as much as I or you there may arise even the proud fancy that the talk is no longer of a sacred essence and that we now feel ourselves everywhere at home and no longer in the uncanny one hundred ninety five i e in the sacred and in sacred awe in the ecstasy over Man discovered at last the egoistic cry of pain passes unheard and the spook that has become so intimate is taken for our true ego But Humanus is the saint s name see Goethe and the humane is only the most clarified sanctity The egoist makes the reverse declaration For this precise reason because you hold something sacred I gibe at you and even if I respected everything in you your sanctuary is precisely what I should not respect With these opposed views there must also be assumed a contradictory relation to spiritual goods the egoist insults them the religious man i e every one who puts his essence above himself must consistently protect them But what kind of spiritual goods are to be protected and what left unprotected depends entirely on the concept that one forms of the supreme being and he who fears God e g has more to shelter than he the liberal who fears Man In spiritual goods we are in distinction from the sensuous injured in a spiritual way and the sin against them consists in a direct desecration while against the sensuous a purloining or alienation takes place the goods themselves are robbed of value and of consecration not merely taken away the sacred is immediately compromised With the word irreverence or flippancy is designated everything that can be committed as crime against spiritual goods i e against everything that is sacred for us and scoffing reviling contempt doubt and the like are only different shades of criminal flippancy That desecration can be practised in the most manifold wise is here to be passed over and only that desecration is to be preferentially mentioned which threatens the sacred with danger through an unrestricted press As long as respect is demanded even for one spiritual essence speech and the press must be enthralled in the name of this essence for just so long the egoist might trespass against it by his utterances from which thing he must be hindered by due punishment at least if one does not prefer to take up the more correct means against it the preventive use of police authority e g censorship What a sighing for liberty of the press What then is the press to be liberated from Surely from a dependence a belonging and a liability to service But to liberate himself from that is every one s affair and it may with safety be assumed that when you have delivered yourself from liability to service that which you compose and write will also belong to you as your own instead of having been thought and indited in the service of some power What can a believer in Christ say and have printed that should be freer from that belief in Christ than he himself is If I cannot or may not write something perhaps the primary fault lies with me Little as this seems to hit the point so near is the application nevertheless to be found By a press law I draw a boundary for my publications or let one be drawn beyond which wrong and its punishment follows I myself limit myself If the press was to be free nothing would be so important as precisely its liberation from every coercion that could be put on it in the name of a law And that it might come to that I my own self should have to have absolved myself from obedience to the law Certainly the absolute liberty of the press is like every absolute liberty a nonentity The press can become free from full many a thing but always only from what I too am free from If we make ourselves free from the sacred if we have become graceless and lawless our words too will become so As little as we can be declared clear of every coercion in the world so little can our writing be withdrawn from it But as free as we are so free we can make it too It must therefore become our own instead of as hitherto serving a spook People do not yet know what they mean by their cry for liberty of the press What they ostensibly ask is that the State shall set the press free but what they are really after without knowing it themselves is that the press become free from the State or clear of the State The former is a petition to the State the latter an insurrection against the State As a petition for right even as a serious demanding of the right of liberty of the press it presupposes the State as the giver and can hope only for a present a permission a chartering Possible no doubt that a State acts so senselessly as to grant the demanded present but you may bet everything that those who receive the present will not know how to use it so long as they regard the State as a truth they will not trespass against this sacred thing and will call for a penal press law against every one who would be willing to dare this In a word the press does not become free from what I am not free from Do I perhaps hereby show myself an opponent of the liberty of the press On the contrary I only assert that one will never get it if one wants only it the liberty of the press i e if one sets out only for an unrestricted permission Only beg right along for this permission you may wait forever for it for there is no one in the world who could give it to you As long as you want to have yourselves entitled to the use of the press by a permission i e liberty of the press you live in vain hope and complaint Nonsense Why you yourself who harbor such thoughts as stand in your book can unfortunately bring them to publicity only through a lucky chance or by stealth nevertheless you will inveigh against one s pressing and importuning his own State till it gives the refused permission to print But an author thus addressed would perhaps for the impudence of such people goes far give the following reply Consider well what you say What then do I do to procure myself liberty of the press for my book Do I ask for permission or do I not rather without any question of legality seek a favorable occasion and grasp it in complete recklessness of the State and its wishes I the terrifying word must be uttered I cheat the State You unconsciously do the same From your tribunes you talk it into the idea that it must give up its sanctity and inviolability it must lay itself bare to the attacks of writers without needing on that account to fear danger But you are imposing on it for its existence is done for as soon as it loses its unapproachableness To you indeed it might well accord liberty of writing as England has done you are believers in the State and incapable of writing against the State however much you would like to reform it and remedy its defects But what if opponents of the State availed themselves of free utterance and stormed out against Church State morals and everything sacred with inexorable reasons You would then be the first in terrible agonies to call into life the September laws Too late would you then rue the stupidity that earlier made you so ready to fool and palaver into compliance the State or the government of the State But I prove by my act only two things This for one that the liberty of the press is always bound to favorable opportunities and accordingly will never be an absolute liberty but secondly this that he who would enjoy it must seek out and if possible create the favorable opportunity availing himself of his own advantage against the State and counting himself and his will more than the State and every superior power Not in the State but only against it can the liberty of the press be carried through if it is to be established it is to be obtained not as the consequence of a petition but as the work of an insurrection Every petition and every motion for liberty of the press is already an insurrection be it conscious or unconscious a thing which Philistine halfness alone will not and cannot confess to itself until with a shrinking shudder it shall see it clearly and irrefutably by the outcome For the requested liberty of the press has indeed a friendly and well meaning face at the beginning as it is not in the least minded ever to let the insolence of the press come into vogue but little by little its heart grows more hardened and the inference flatters its way in that really a liberty is not a liberty if it stands in the service of the State of morals or of the law A liberty indeed from the coercion of censorship it is yet not a liberty from the coercion of law The press once seized by the lust for liberty always wants to grow freer till at last the writer says to himself Really I am not wholly free till I ask about nothing and writing is free only when it is my own dictated to me by no power or authority by no faith no dread the press must not be free that is too little it must be mine ownness of the press or property in the press that is what I will take Why liberty of the press is only permission of the press and the State never will or can voluntarily permit me to grind it to nothingness by the press Let us now in conclusion bettering the above language which is still vague owing to the phrase liberty of the press rather put it thus Liberty of the press the liberals loud demand is assuredly possible in the State yes it is possible only in the State because it is a permission and consequently the permitter the State must not be lacking But as permission it has its limit in this very State which surely should not in reason permit more than is compatible with itself and its welfare the State fixes for it this limit as the law of its existence and of its extension That one State brooks more than another is only a quantitative distinction which alone nevertheless lies at the heart of the political liberals they want in Germany e g only a more extended broader accordance of free utterance The liberty of the press which is sought for is an affair of the people s and before the people the State possesses it I may make no use of it From the standpoint of property in the press the situation is different Let my people if they will go without liberty of the press I will manage to print by force or ruse I get my permission to print only from myself and my strength If the press is my own I as little need a permission of the State for employing it as I seek that permission in order to blow my nose The press is my property from the moment when nothing is more to me than myself for from this moment State Church people society and the like cease because they have to thank for their existence only the disrespect that I have for myself and with the vanishing of this undervaluation they themselves are extinguished they exist only when they exist above me exist only as powers and power holders Or can you imagine a State whose citizens one and all think nothing of it it would be as certainly a dream an existence in seeming as united Germany The press is my own as soon as I myself am my own a self owned man to the egoist belongs the world because he belongs to no power of the world With this my press might still be very unfree as e g at this moment But the world is large and one helps himself as well as he can If I were willing to abate from the property of my press I could easily attain the point where I might everywhere have as much printed as my fingers produced But as I want to assert my property I must necessarily swindle my enemies Would you not accept their permission if it were given you Certainly with joy for their permission would be to me a proof that I had fooled them and started them on the road to ruin I am not concerned for their permission but so much the more for their folly and their overthrow I do not sue for their permission as if I flattered myself like the political liberals that we both they and I could make out peaceably alongside and with each other yes probably raise and prop each other but I sue for it in order to make them bleed to death by it that the permitters themselves may cease at last I act as a conscious enemy overreaching them and utilizing their heedlessness The press is mine when I recognize outside myself no judge whatever over its utilization i e when my writing is no longer determined by morality or religion or respect for the State laws or the like but by me and my egoism Now what have you to reply to him who gives you so impudent an answer We shall perhaps put the question most strikingly by phrasing it as follows Whose is the press the people s State s or mine The politicals on their side intend nothing further than to liberate the press from personal and arbitrary interferences of the possessors of power without thinking of the point that to be really open for everybody it would also have to be free from the laws i e from the people s State s will They want to make a people s affair of it But having become the people s property it is still far from being mine rather it retains for me the subordinate significance of a permission The people plays judge over my thoughts it has the right of calling me to account for them or I am responsible to it for them Jurors when their fixed ideas are attacked have just as hard heads and hearts as the stiffest despots and their servile officials In the Liberale Bestrebungen one hundred ninety six E Bauer asserts that liberty of the press is impossible in the absolutist and the constitutional State whereas in the free State it finds its place Here the statement is it is recognized that the individual because he is no longer an individual but a member of a true and rational generality has the right to utter his mind So not the individual but the member has liberty of the press But if for the purpose of liberty of the press the individual must first give proof of himself regarding his belief in the generality the people if he does not have this liberty through might of his own then it is a people s liberty a liberty that he is invested with for the sake of his faith his membership The reverse is the case it is precisely as an individual that every one has open to him the liberty to utter his mind But he has not the right that liberty is assuredly not his sacred right He has only the might but the might alone makes him owner I need no concession for the liberty of the press do not need the people s consent to it do not need the right to it nor any justification The liberty of the press too like every liberty I must take the people as being the sole judge cannot give it to me It can put up with the liberty that I take or defend itself against it give bestow grant it it cannot I exercise it despite the people purely as an individual i e I get it by fighting the people my enemy and obtain it only when I really get it by such fighting i e take it But I take it because it is my property Sander against whom E Bauer writes lays claim page ninety nine to the liberty of the press as the right and the liberty of the citizen in the State What else does E Bauer do To him also it is only a right of the free citizen The liberty of the press is also demanded under the name of a general human right Against this the objection was well founded that not every man knew how to use it rightly for not every individual was truly man Never did a government refuse it to Man as such but Man writes nothing for the reason that he is a ghost It always refused it to individuals only and gave it to others e g its organs If then one would have it for all one must assert outright that it is due to the individual me not to man or to the individual so far as he is man Besides another than a man e g a beast can make no use of it The French government e g does not dispute the liberty of the press as a right of man but demands from the individual a security for his really being man for it assigns liberty of the press not to the individual but to man Under the exact pretence that it was not human what was mine was taken from me what was human was left to me undiminished Liberty of the press can bring about only a responsible press the irresponsible proceeds solely from property in the press For intercourse with men an express law conformity to which one may venture at times sinfully to forget but the absolute value of which one at no time ventures to deny is placed foremost among all who live religiously this is the law of love to which not even those who seem to fight against its principle and who hate its name have as yet become untrue for they also still have love yes they love with a deeper and more sublimated love they love man and mankind If we formulate the sense of this law it will be about as follows Every man must have a something that is more to him than himself You are to put your private interest in the background when it is a question of the welfare of others the weal of the fatherland of society the common weal the weal of mankind the good cause and the like Fatherland society mankind et cetera must be more to you than yourself and as against their interest your private interest must stand back for you must not be an egoist Love is a far reaching religious demand which is not as might be supposed limited to love to God and man but stands foremost in every regard Whatever we do think will the ground of it is always to be love Thus we may indeed judge but only with love The Bible may assuredly be criticised and that very thoroughly but the critic must before all things love it and see in it the sacred book Is this anything else than to say he must not criticise it to death he must leave it standing and that as a sacred thing that cannot be upset In our criticism on men too love must remain the unchanged key note Certainly judgments that hatred inspires are not at all our own judgments but judgments of the hatred that rules us rancorous judgments But are judgments that love inspires in us any more our own They are judgments of the love that rules us they are loving lenient judgments they are not our own and accordingly not real judgments at all He who burns with love for justice cries out fiat justitia pereat mundus He can doubtless ask and investigate what justice properly is or demands and in what it consists but not whether it is anything It is very true He who abides in love abides in God and God in him I John four sixteen God abides in him he does not get rid of God does not become godless and he abides in God does not come to himself and into his own home abides in love to God and does not become loveless God is love All times and all races recognize in this word the central point of Christianity God who is love is an officious God he cannot leave the world in peace but wants to make it blest God became man to make men divine one hundred ninety seven He has his hand in the game everywhere and nothing happens without it everywhere he has his best purposes his incomprehensible plans and decrees Reason which he himself is is to be forwarded and realized in the whole world His fatherly care deprives us of all independence We can do nothing sensible without its being said God did that and can bring upon ourselves no misfortune without hearing God ordained that we have nothing that we have not from him he gave everything But as God does so does Man God wants perforce to make the world blest and Man wants to make it happy to make all men happy Hence every man wants to awaken in all men the reason which he supposes his own self to have everything is to be rational throughout God torments himself with the devil and the philosopher does it with unreason and the accidental God lets no being go its own gait and Man likewise wants to make us walk only in human wise But whoso is full of sacred religious moral humane love loves only the spook the true man and persecutes with dull mercilessness the individual the real man under the phlegmatic legal title of measures against the un man He finds it praiseworthy and indispensable to exercise pitilessness in the harshest measure for love to the spook or generality commands him to hate him who is not ghostly i e the egoist or individual such is the meaning of the renowned love phenomenon that is called justice The criminally arraigned man can expect no forbearance and no one spreads a friendly veil over his unhappy nakedness Without emotion the stern judge tears the last rags of excuse from the body of the poor accused without compassion the jailer drags him into his damp abode without placability when the time of punishment has expired he thrusts the branded man again among men his good Christian loyal brethren who contemptuously spit on him Yes without grace a criminal deserving of death is led to the scaffold and before the eyes of a jubilating crowd the appeased moral law celebrates its sublime revenge For only one can live the moral law or the criminal Where criminals live unpunished the moral law has fallen and where this prevails those must go down Their enmity is indestructible The Christian age is precisely that of mercy love solicitude to have men receive what is due them yes to bring them to fulfil their human divine calling Therefore the principle has been put foremost for intercourse that this and that is man s essence and consequently his calling to which either God has called him or according to the concepts of to day his being man the species calls him Hence the zeal for conversion That the Communists and the humane expect from man more than the Christians do does not change the standpoint in the least Man shall get what is human If it was enough for the pious that what was divine became his part the humane demand that he be not curtailed of what is human Both set themselves against what is egoistic Of course for what is egoistic cannot be accorded to him or vested in him a fief he must procure it for himself Love imparts the former the latter can be given to me by myself alone Intercourse hitherto has rested on love regardful behavior doing for each other As one owed it to himself to make himself blessed or owed himself the bliss of taking up into himself the supreme essence and bringing it to a verite a truth and reality so one owed it to others to help them realize their essence and their calling in both cases one owed it to the essence of man to contribute to its realization But one owes it neither to himself to make anything out of himself nor to others to make anything out of them for one owes nothing to his essence and that of others Intercourse resting on essence is an intercourse with the spook not with anything real If I hold intercourse with the supreme essence I am not holding intercourse with myself and if I hold intercourse with the essence of man I am not holding intercourse with men The natural man s love becomes through culture a commandment But as commandment it belongs to Man as such not to me it is my essence one hundred ninety eight about which much ado one hundred ninety nine is made not my property Man i e humanity presents that demand to me love is demanded it is my duty Instead therefore of being really won for me it has been won for the generality Man as his property or peculiarity it becomes man i e every man to love love is the duty and calling of man et cetera Consequently I must again vindicate love for myself and deliver it out of the power of Man with the great M What was originally mine but accidentally mine instinctively mine I was invested with as the property of Man I became feoffee in loving I became the retainer of mankind only a specimen of this species and acted loving not as I but as man as a specimen of man i e humanly The whole condition of civilization is the feudal system the property being Man s or mankind s not mine A monstrous feudal State was founded the individual robbed of everything everything left to man The individual had to appear at last as a sinner through and through Am I perchance to have no lively interest in the person of another are his joy and his weal not to lie at my heart is the enjoyment that I furnish him not to be more to me than other enjoyments of my own On the contrary I can with joy sacrifice to him numberless enjoyments I can deny myself numberless things for the enhancement of his pleasure and I can hazard for him what without him was the dearest to me my life my welfare my freedom Why it constitutes my pleasure and my happiness to refresh myself with his happiness and his pleasure But myself my own self I do not sacrifice to him but remain an egoist and enjoy him If I sacrifice to him everything that but for my love to him I should keep that is very simple and even more usual in life than it seems to be but it proves nothing further than that this one passion is more powerful in me than all the rest Christianity too teaches us to sacrifice all other passions to this But if to one passion I sacrifice others I do not on that account go so far as to sacrifice myself nor sacrifice anything of that whereby I truly am myself I do not sacrifice my peculiar value my ownness Where this bad case occurs love cuts no better figure than any other passion that I obey blindly The ambitious man who is carried away by ambition and remains deaf to every warning that a calm moment begets in him has let this passion grow up into a despot against whom he abandons all power of dissolution he has given up himself because he cannot dissolve himself and consequently cannot absolve himself from the passion he is possessed I love men too not merely individuals but every one But I love them with the consciousness of egoism I love them because love makes me happy I love because loving is natural to me because it pleases me I know no commandment of love I have a fellow feeling with every feeling being and their torment torments their refreshment refreshes me too I can kill them not torture them Per contra the high souled virtuous Philistine prince Rudolph in The Mysteries of Paris because the wicked provoke his indignation plans their torture That fellow feeling proves only that the feeling of those who feel is mine too my property in opposition to which the pitiless dealing of the righteous man e g against notary Ferrand is like the unfeelingness of that robber who cut off or stretched his prisoners legs to the measure of his bedstead Rudolph s bedstead which he cuts men to fit is the concept of the good The feeling for right virtue et cetera makes people hard hearted and intolerant Rudolph does not feel like the notary but the reverse he feels that it serves the rascal right that is no fellow feeling You love man therefore you torture the individual man the egoist your philanthropy love of men is the tormenting of men If I see the loved one suffer I suffer with him and I know no rest till I have tried everything to comfort and cheer him if I see him glad I too become glad over his joy From this it does not follow that suffering or joy is caused in me by the same thing that brings out this effect in him as is sufficiently proved by every bodily pain which I do not feel as he does his tooth pains him but his pain pains me But because I cannot bear the troubled crease on the beloved forehead for that reason and therefore for my sake I kiss it away If I did not love this person he might go right on making creases they would not trouble me I am only driving away my trouble How now has anybody or anything whom and which I do not love a right to be loved by me Is my love first or is his right first Parents kinsfolk fatherland nation native town et cetera finally fellow men in general brothers fraternity assert that they have a right to my love and lay claim to it without further ceremony They look upon it as their property and upon me if I do not respect this as a robber who takes from them what pertains to them and is theirs I should love If love is a commandment and law then I must be educated into it cultivated up to it and if I trespass against it punished Hence people will exercise as strong a moral influence as possible on me to bring me to love And there is no doubt that one can work up and seduce men to love as one can to other passions e g if you like to hate Hate runs through whole races merely because the ancestors of the one belonged to the Guelphs those of the other to the Ghibellines But love is not a commandment but like each of my feelings my property Acquire i e purchase my property and then I will make it over to you A church a nation a fatherland a family et cetera that does not know how to acquire my love I need not love and I fix the purchase price of my love quite at my pleasure Selfish love is far distant from unselfish mystical or romantic love One can love everything possible not merely men but an object in general wine one s fatherland et cetera Love becomes blind and crazy by a must taking it out of my power infatuation romantic by a should entering into it i e the object s becoming sacred for me or my becoming bound to it by duty conscience oath Now the object no longer exists for me but I for it Love is a possessedness not as my feeling as such I rather keep it in my possession as property but through the alienness of the object For religious love consists in the commandment to love in the beloved a holy one or to adhere to a holy one for unselfish love there are objects absolutely lovable for which my heart is to beat e g fellow men or my wedded mate kinsfolk et cetera Holy love loves the holy in the beloved and therefore exerts itself also to make of the beloved more and more a holy one e g a man The beloved is an object that should be loved by me He is not an object of my love on account of because of or by my loving him but is an object of love in and of himself Not I make him an object of love but he is such to begin with for it is here irrelevant that he has become so by my choice if so it be as with a fiancee a spouse and the like since even so he has in any case as the person once chosen obtained a right of his own to my love and I because I have loved him am under obligation to love him forever He is therefore not an object of my love but of love in general an object that should be loved Love appertains to him is due to him or is his right while I am under obligation to love him My love i e the toll of love that I pay him is in truth his love which he only collects from me as toll Every love to which there clings but the smallest speck of obligation is an unselfish love and so far as this speck reaches a possessedness He who believes that he owes the object of his love anything loves romantically or religiously Family love e g as it is usually understood as piety is a religious love love of fatherland preached as patriotism likewise All our romantic love moves in the same pattern everywhere the hypocrisy or rather self deception of an unselfish love an interest in the object for the object s sake not for my sake and mine alone Religious or romantic love is distinguished from sensual love by the difference of the object indeed but not by the dependence of the relation to it In the latter regard both are possessedness but in the former the one object is profane the other sacred The dominion of the object over me is the same in both cases only that it is one time a sensuous one the other time a spiritual ghostly one My love is my own only when it consists altogether in a selfish and egoistic interest and when consequently the object of my love is really my object or my property I owe my property nothing and have no duty to it as little as I might have a duty to my eye if nevertheless I guard it with the greatest care I do so on my account Antiquity lacked love as little as do Christian times the god of love is older than the God of Love But the mystical possessedness belongs to the moderns The possessedness of love lies in the alienation of the object or in my powerlessness as against its alienness and superior power To the egoist nothing is high enough for him to humble himself before it nothing so independent that he would live for love of it nothing so sacred that he would sacrifice himself to it The egoist s love rises in selfishness flows in the bed of selfishness and empties into selfishness again Whether this can still be called love If you know another word for it go ahead and choose it then the sweet word love may wither with the departed world for the present I at least find none in our Christian language and hence stick to the old sound and love my object my property Only as one of my feelings do I harbor love but as a power above me as a divine power Feuerbach as a passion that I am not to cast off as a religious and moral duty I scorn it As my feeling it is mine as a principle to which I consecrate and vow my soul it is a dominator and divine just as hatred as a principle is diabolical one not better than the other In short egoistic love i e my love is neither holy nor unholy neither divine nor diabolical A love that is limited by faith is an untrue love The sole limitation that does not contradict the essence of love is the self limitation of love by reason intelligence Love that scorns the rigor the law of intelligence is theoretically a false love practically a ruinous one two hundred So love is in its essence rational So thinks Feuerbach the believer on the contrary thinks Love is in its essence believing The one inveighs against irrational the other against unbelieving love To both it can at most rank as a splen didum vitium Do not both leave love standing even in the form of unreason and unbelief They do not dare to say irrational or unbelieving love is nonsense is not love as little as they are willing to say irrational or unbelieving tears are not tears But if even irrational love et cetera must count as love and if they are nevertheless to be unworthy of man there follows simply this love is not the highest thing but reason or faith even the unreasonable and the unbelieving can love but love has value only when it is that of a rational or believing person It is an illusion when Feuerbach calls the rationality of love its self limitation the believer might with the same right call belief its self limitation Irrational love is neither false nor ruinous it does its service as love Toward the world especially toward men I am to assume a particular feeling and meet them with love with the feeling of love from the beginning Certainly in this there is revealed far more free will and self determination than when I let myself be stormed by way of the world by all possible feelings and remain exposed to the most checkered most accidental impressions I go to the world rather with a preconceived feeling as if it were a prejudice and a preconceived opinion I have prescribed to myself in advance my behavior toward it and despite all its temptations feel and think about it only as I have once determined to Against the dominion of the world I secure myself by the principle of love for whatever may come I love The ugly e g makes a repulsive impression on me but determined to love I master this impression as I do every antipathy But the feeling to which I have determined and condemned myself from the start is a narrow feeling because it is a predestined one of which I myself am not able to get clear or to declare myself clear Because preconceived it is a prejudice I no longer show myself in face of the world but my love shows itself The world indeed does not rule me but so much the more inevitably does the spirit of love rule me I have overcome the world to become a slave of this spirit If I first said I love the world I now add likewise I do not love it for I annihilate it as I annihilate myself I dissolve it I do not limit myself to one feeling for men but give free play to all that I am capable of Why should I not dare speak it out in all its glaringness Yes I utilize the world and men With this I can keep myself open to every impression without being torn away from myself by one of them I can love love with a full heart and let the most consuming glow of passion burn in my heart without taking the beloved one for anything else than the nourishment of my passion on which it ever refreshes itself anew All my care for him applies only to the object of my love only to him whom my love requires only to him the warmly loved How indifferent would he be to me without this my love I feed only my love with him I utilize him for this only I enjoy him Let us choose another convenient example I see how men are fretted in dark superstition by a swarm of ghosts If to the extent of my powers I let a bit of daylight fall in on the nocturnal spookery is it perchance because love to you inspires this in me Do I write out of love to men No I write because I want to procure for my thoughts an existence in the world and even if I foresaw that these thoughts would deprive you of your rest and your peace even if I saw the bloodiest wars and the fall of many generations springing up from this seed of thought I would nevertheless scatter it Do with it what you will and can that is your affair and does not trouble me You will perhaps have only trouble combat and death from it very few will draw joy from it If your weal lay at my heart I should act as the church did in withholding the Bible from the laity or Christian governments which make it a sacred duty for themselves to protect the common people from bad books But not only not for your sake not even for truth s sake either do I speak out what I think No I sing as the bird sings That on the bough alights The song that from me springs Is pay that well requites I sing because I am a singer But I use two hundred one you for it because I need two hundred two ears Where the world comes in my way and it comes in my way everywhere I consume it to quiet the hunger of my egoism For me you are nothing but my food even as I too am fed upon and turned to use by you We have only one relation to each other that of usableness of utility of use We owe each other nothing for what I seem to owe you I owe at most to myself If I show you a cheery air in order to cheer you likewise then your cheeriness is of consequence to me and my air serves my wish to a thousand others whom I do not aim to cheer I do not show it One has to be educated up to that love which founds itself on the essence of man or in the ecclesiastical and moral period lies upon us as a commandment In what fashion moral influence the chief ingredient of our education seeks to regulate the intercourse of men shall here be looked at with egoistic eyes in one example at least Those who educate us make it their concern early to break us of lying and to inculcate the principle that one must always tell the truth If selfishness were made the basis for this rule every one would easily understand how by lying he fools away that confidence in him which he hopes to awaken in others and how correct the maxim proves Nobody believes a liar even when he tells the truth Yet at the same time he would also feel that he had to meet with truth only him whom he authorized to hear the truth If a spy walks in disguise through the hostile camp and is asked who he is the askers are assuredly entitled to inquire after his name but the disguised man does not give them the right to learn the truth from him he tells them what he likes only not the fact And yet morality demands Thou shalt not lie By morality those persons are vested with the right to expect the truth but by me they are not vested with that right and I recognize only the right that I impart In a gathering of revolutionists the police force their way in and ask the orator for his name everybody knows that the police have the right to do so but they do not have it from the revolutionist since he is their enemy he tells them a false name and cheats them with a lie The police do not act so foolishly either as to count on their enemies love of truth on the contrary they do not believe without further ceremony but have the questioned individual identified if they can Nay the State everywhere proceeds incredulously with individuals because in their egoism it recognizes its natural enemy it invariably demands a voucher and he who cannot show vouchers falls a prey to its investigating inquisition The State does not believe nor trust the individual and so of itself places itself with him in the convention of lying it trusts me only when it has convinced itself of the truth of my statement for which there often remains to it no other means than the oath How clearly too this the oath proves that the State does not count on our credibility and love of truth but on our interest our selfishness it relies on our not wanting to fall foul of God by a perjury Now let one imagine a French revolutionist in the year seventeen eighty eight who among friends let fall the now well known phrase the world will have no rest till the last king is hanged with the guts of the last priest The king then still had all power and when the utterance is betrayed by an accident yet without its being possible to produce witnesses confession is demanded from the accused Is he to confess or not If he denies he lies and remains unpunished if he confesses he is candid and is beheaded If truth is more than everything else to him all right let him die Only a paltry poet could try to make a tragedy out of the end of his life for what interest is there in seeing how a man succumbs from cowardice But if he had the courage not to be a slave of truth and sincerity he would ask somewhat thus Why need the judges know what I have spoken among friends If I had wished them to know I should have said it to them as I said it to my friends I will not have them know it They force themselves into my confidence without my having called them to it and made them my confidants they will learn what I will keep secret Come on then you who wish to break my will by your will and try your arts You can torture me by the rack you can threaten me with hell and eternal damnation you can make me so nerveless that I swear a false oath but the truth you shall not press out of me for I will lie to you because I have given you no claim and no right to my sincerity Let God who is truth look down ever so threateningly on me let lying come ever so hard to me I have nevertheless the courage of a lie and even if I were weary of my life even if nothing appeared to me more welcome than your executioner s sword you nevertheless should not have the joy of finding in me a slave of truth whom by your priestly arts you make a traitor to his will When I spoke those treasonable words I would not have had you know anything of them I now retain the same will and do not let myself be frightened by the curse of the lie Sigismund is not a miserable caitiff because he broke his princely word but he broke the word because he was a caitiff he might have kept his word and would still have been a caitiff a priest ridden man Luther driven by a higher power became unfaithful to his monastic vow he became so for God s sake Both broke their oath as possessed persons Sigismund because he wanted to appear as a sincere professor of the divine truth i e of the true genuinely Catholic faith Luther in order to give testimony for the gospel sincerely and with entire truth with body and soul both became perjured in order to be sincere toward the higher truth Only the priests absolved the one the other absolved himself What else did both observe than what is contained in those apostolic words Thou hast not lied to men but to God They lied to men broke their oath before the world s eyes in order not to lie to God but to serve him Thus they show us a way to deal with truth before men For God s glory and for God s sake a breach of oath a lie a prince s word broken How would it be now if we changed the thing a little and wrote A perjury and lie for my sake Would not that be pleading for every baseness It seems so assuredly only in this it is altogether like the for God s sake For was not every baseness committed for God s sake were not all the scaffolds filled for his sake and all the auto da fes held for his sake was not all stupefaction introduced for his sake and do they not to day still for God s sake fetter the mind in tender children by religious education Were not sacred vows broken for his sake and do not missionaries and priests still go around every day to bring Jews heathen Protestants or Catholics et cetera to treason against the faith of their fathers for his sake And that should be worse with the for my sake What then does on my account mean There people immediately think of filthy lucre But he who acts from love of filthy lucre does it on his own account indeed as there is nothing anyhow that one does not do for his own sake among other things everything that is done for God s glory yet he for whom he seeks the lucre is a slave of lucre not raised above lucre he is one who belongs to lucre the money bag not to himself he is not his own Must not a man whom the passion of avarice rules follow the commands of this master and if a weak good naturedness once beguiles him does this not appear as simply an exceptional case of precisely the same sort as when pious believers are sometimes forsaken by their Lord s guidance and ensnared by the arts of the devil So an avaricious man is not a self owned man but a servant and he can do nothing for his own sake without at the same time doing it for his lord s sake precisely like the godly man Famous is the breach of oath which Francis II committed against Emperor Charles V Not later when he ripely weighed his promise but at once when he swore the oath King Francis took it back in thought as well as by a secret protestation documentarily subscribed before his councillors he uttered a perjury aforethought Francis did not show himself disinclined to buy his release but the price that Charles put on it seemed to him too high and unreasonable Even though Charles behaved himself in a sordid fashion when he sought to extort as much as possible it was yet shabby of Francis to want to purchase his freedom for a lower ransom and his later dealings among which there occurs yet a second breach of his word prove sufficiently how the huckster spirit held him enthralled and made him a shabby swindler However what shall we say to the reproach of perjury against him In the first place surely this again that not the perjury but his sordidness shamed him that he did not deserve contempt for his perjury but made himself guilty of perjury because he was a contemptible man But Francis s perjury regarded in itself demands another judgment One might say Francis did not respond to the confidence that Charles put in him in setting him free But if Charles had really favored him with confidence he would have named to him the price that he considered the release worth and would then have set him at liberty and expected Francis to pay the redemption sum Charles harbored no such trust but only believed in Francis s impotence and credulity which would not allow him to act against his oath but Francis deceived only this credulous calculation When Charles believed he was assuring himself of his enemy by an oath right there he was freeing him from every obligation Charles had given the king credit for a piece of stupidity a narrow conscience and without confidence in Francis counted only on Francis s stupidity i e conscientiousness he let him go from the Madrid prison only to hold him the more securely in the prison of conscientiousness the great jail built about the mind of man by religion he sent him back to France locked fast in invisible chains what wonder if Francis sought to escape and sawed the chains apart No man would have taken it amiss of him if he had secretly fled from Madrid for he was in an enemy s power but every good Christian cries out upon him that he wanted to loose himself from God s bonds too It was only later that the pope absolved him from his oath It is despicable to deceive a confidence that we voluntarily call forth but it is no shame to egoism to let every one who wants to get us into his power by an oath bleed to death by the unsuccessfulness of his untrustful craft If you have wanted to bind me then learn that I know how to burst your bonds The point is whether I give the confider the right to confidence If the pursuer of my friend asks me where he has fled to I shall surely put him on a false trail Why does he ask precisely me the pursued man s friend In order not to be a false traitorous friend I prefer to be false to the enemy I might certainly in courageous conscientiousness answer I will not tell so Fichte decides the case by that I should salve my love of truth and do for my friend as much as nothing for if I do not mislead the enemy he may accidentally take the right street and my love of truth would have given up my friend as a prey because it hindered me from the courage for a lie He who has in the truth an idol a sacred thing must humble himself before it must not defy its demands not resist courageously in short he must renounce the heroism of the lie For to the lie belongs not less courage than to the truth a courage that young men are most apt to be defective in who would rather confess the truth and mount the scaffold for it than confound the enemy s power by the impudence of a lie To them the truth is sacred and the sacred at all times demands blind reverence submission and self sacrifice If you are not impudent not mockers of the sacred you are tame and its servants Let one but lay a grain of truth in the trap for you you peck at it to a certainty and the fool is caught You will not lie Well then fall as sacrifices to the truth and become martyrs Martyrs for what For yourselves for self ownership No for your goddess the truth You know only two services only two kinds of servants servants of the truth and servants of the lie Then in God s name serve the truth Others again serve the truth also but they serve it in moderation and make e g a great distinction between a simple lie and a lie sworn to And yet the whole chapter of the oath coincides with that of the lie since an oath everybody knows is only a strongly assured statement You consider yourselves entitled to lie if only you do not swear to it besides One who is particular about it must judge and condemn a lie as sharply as a false oath But now there has been kept up in morality an ancient point of controversy which is customarily treated of under the name of the lie of necessity No one who dares plead for this can consistently put from him an oath of necessity If I justify my lie as a lie of necessity I should not be so pusillanimous as to rob the justified lie of the strongest corroboration Whatever I do why should I not do it entirely and without reservation reservatio mentalis If I once lie why then not lie completely with entire consciousness and all my might As a spy I should have to swear to each of my false statements at the enemy s demand determined to lie to him should I suddenly become cowardly and undecided in face of an oath Then I should have been ruined in advance for a liar and spy for you see I should be voluntarily putting into the enemy s hands a means to catch me The State too fears the oath of necessity and for this reason does not give the accused a chance to swear But you do not justify the State s fear you lie but do not swear falsely If e g you show some one a kindness and he is not to know it but he guesses it and tells you so to your face you deny if he insists you say honestly no If it came to swearing then you would refuse for from fear of the sacred you always stop half way Against the sacred you have no will of your own You lie in moderation as you are free in moderation religious in moderation the clergy are not to encroach over this point the most vapid of controversies is now being carried on on the part of the university against the church monarchically disposed in moderation you want a monarch limited by the constitution by a fundamental law of the State everything nicely tempered lukewarm half God s half the devil s There was a university where the usage was that every word of honor that must be given to the university judge was looked upon by the students as null and void For the students saw in the demanding of it nothing but a snare which they could not escape otherwise than by taking away all its significance He who at that same university broke his word of honor to one of the fellows was infamous he who gave it to the university judge derided in union with these very fellows the dupe who fancied that a word had the same value among friends and among foes It was less a correct theory than the constraint of practice that had there taught the students to act so as without that means of getting out they would have been pitilessly driven to treachery against their comrades But as the means approved itself in practice so it has its theoretical probation too A word of honor an oath is one only for him whom I entitle to receive it he who forces me to it obtains only a forced i e a hostile word the word of a foe whom one has no right to trust for the foe does not give us the right Aside from this the courts of the State do not even recognize the inviolability of an oath For if I had sworn to one who comes under examination that I would not declare anything against him the court would demand my declaration in spite of the fact that an oath binds me and in case of refusal would lock me up till I decided to become an oath breaker The court absolves me from my oath how magnanimous If any power can absolve me from the oath I myself am surely the very first power that has a claim to As a curiosity and to remind us of customary oaths of all sorts let place be given here to that which Emperor Paul commanded the captured Poles Kosciusko Potocki Niemcewicz et cetera to take when he released them We not merely swear fidelity and obedience to the emperor but also further promise to pour out our blood for his glory we obligate ourselves to discover everything threatening to his person or his empire that we ever learn we declare finally that in whatever part of the earth we may be a single word of the emperor shall suffice to make us leave everything and repair to him at once In one domain the principle of love seems to have been long outsoared by egoism and to be still in need only of sure consciousness as it were of victory with a good conscience This domain is speculation in its double manifestation as thinking and as trade One thinks with a will whatever may come of it one speculates however many may suffer under our speculative undertakings But when it finally becomes serious when even the last remnant of religiousness romance or humanity is to be done away then the pulse of religious conscience beats and one at least professes humanity The avaricious speculator throws some coppers into the poor box and does good the bold thinker consoles himself with the fact that he is working for the advancement of the human race and that his devastation turns to the good of mankind or in another case that he is serving the idea mankind the idea is to him that something of which he must say It is more to me than myself To this day thinking and trading have been done for God s sake Those who for six days were trampling down everything by their selfish aims sacrificed on the seventh to the Lord and those who destroyed a hundred good causes by their reckless thinking still did this in the service of another good cause and had yet to think of another besides themselves to whose good their self indulgence should turn of the people mankind and the like But this other thing is a being above them a higher or supreme being and therefore I say they are toiling for God s sake Hence I can also say that the ultimate basis of their actions is love Not a voluntary love however not their own but a tributary love or the higher being s own i e God s who himself is love in short not the egoistic but the religious a love that springs from their fancy that they must discharge a tribute of love i e that they must not be egoists If we want to deliver the world from many kinds of unfreedom we want this not on its account but on ours for as we are not world liberators by profession and out of love we only want to win it away from others We want to make it our own it is not to be any longer owned as serf by God the church nor by the law State but to be our own therefore we seek to win it to captivate it and by meeting it half way and devoting ourselves to it as to ourselves as soon as it belongs to us to complete and make superfluous the force that it turns against us If the world is ours it no longer attempts any force against us but only with us My selfishness has an interest in the liberation of the world that it may become my property Not isolation or being alone but society is man s original state Our existence begins with the most intimate conjunction as we are already living with our mother before we breathe when we see the light of the world we at once lie on a human being s breast again her love cradles us in the lap leads us in the go cart and chains us to her person with a thousand ties Society is our state of nature And this is why the more we learn to feel ourselves the connection that was formerly most intimate becomes ever looser and the dissolution of the original society more unmistakable To have once again for herself the child that once lay under her heart the mother must fetch it from the street and from the midst of its playmates The child prefers the intercourse that it enters into with its fellows to the society that it has not entered into but only been born in But the dissolution of society is intercourse or union A society does assuredly arise by union too but only as a fixed idea arises by a thought to wit by the vanishing of the energy of the thought the thinking itself this restless taking back all thoughts that make themselves fast from the thought If a union two hundred three has crystallized into a society it has ceased to be a coalition two hundred four for coalition is an incessant self uniting it has become a unitedness come to a standstill degenerated into a fixity it is dead as a union it is the corpse of the union or the coalition i e it is society community A striking example of this kind is furnished by the party That a society e g the society of the State diminishes my liberty offends me little Why I have to let my liberty be limited by all sorts of powers and by every one who is stronger nay by every fellow man and were I the autocrat of all the R I yet should not enjoy absolute liberty But ownness I will not have taken from me And ownness is precisely what every society has designs on precisely what is to succumb to its power A society which I join does indeed take from me many liberties but in return it affords me other liberties neither does it matter if I myself deprive myself of this and that liberty e g by any contract On the other hand I want to hold jealously to my ownness Every community has the propensity stronger or weaker according to the fulness of its power to become an authority to its members and to set limits for them it asks and must ask for a subject s limited understanding it asks that those who belong to it be subject to it be its subjects it exists only by subjection In this a certain tolerance need by no means be excluded on the contrary the society will welcome improvements corrections and blame so far as such are calculated for its gain but the blame must be well meaning it may not be insolent and disrespectful in other words one must leave uninjured and hold sacred the substance of the society The society demands that those who belong to it shall not go beyond it and exalt themselves but remain within the bounds of legality i e allow themselves only so much as the society and its law allow them There is a difference whether my liberty or my ownness is limited by a society If the former only is the case it is a coalition an agreement a union but if ruin is threatened to ownness it is a power of itself a power above me a thing unattainable by me which I can indeed admire adore reverence respect but cannot subdue and consume and that for the reason that I am resigned It exists by my resignation my self renunciation my spiritlessness two hundred five called HUMILITY two hundred six My humility makes its courage two hundred seven my submissiveness gives it its dominion But in reference to liberty State and union are subject to no essential difference The latter can just as little come into existence or continue in existence without liberty s being limited in all sorts of ways as the State is compatible with unmeasured liberty Limitation of liberty is inevitable everywhere for one cannot get rid of everything one cannot fly like a bird merely because one would like to fly so for one does not get free from his own weight one cannot live under water as long as he likes like a fish because one cannot do without air and cannot get free from this indispensable necessity and the like As religion and most decidedly Christianity tormented man with the demand to realize the unnatural and self contradictory so it is to be looked upon only as the true logical outcome of that religious overstraining and overwroughtness that finally liberty itself absolute liberty was exalted into an ideal and thus the nonsense of the impossible had to come glaringly to the light The union will assuredly offer a greater measure of liberty as well as and especially because by it one escapes all the coercion peculiar to State and society life admit of being considered as a new liberty but nevertheless it will still contain enough of unfreedom and involuntariness For its object is not this liberty which on the contrary it sacrifices to ownness but only ownness Referred to this the difference between State and union is great enough The former is an enemy and murderer of ownness the latter a son and company worker of it the former a spirit that would be adored in spirit and in truth the latter my work my product the State is the lord of my spirit who demands faith and prescribes to me articles of faith the creed of legality it exerts moral influence dominates my spirit drives away my ego to put itself in its place as my true ego in short the State is sacred and as against me the individual man it is the true man the spirit the ghost but the union is my own creation my creature not sacred not a spiritual power above my spirit as little as any association of whatever sort As I am not willing to be a slave of my maxims but lay them bare to my continual criticism without any warrant and admit no bail at all for their persistence so still less do I obligate myself to the union for my future and pledge my soul to it as is said to be done with the devil and is really the case with the State and all spiritual authority but I am and remain more to myself than State Church God and the like consequently infinitely more than the union too That society which Communism wants to found seems to stand nearest to coalition For it is to aim at the welfare of all oh yes of all cries Weitling innumerable times of all That does really look as if in it no one needed to take a back seat But what then will this welfare be Have all one and the same welfare are all equally well off with one and the same thing If that be so the question is of the true welfare Do we not with this come right to the point where religion begins its dominion of violence Christianity says Look not on earthly toys but seek your true welfare become pious Christians being Christians is the true welfare It is the true welfare of all because it is the welfare of Man as such this spook Now the welfare of all is surely to be your and my welfare too But if you and I do not look upon that welfare as our welfare will care then be taken for that in which we feel well On the contrary society has decreed a welfare as the true welfare and if this welfare were called e g enjoyment honestly worked for but you preferred enjoyable laziness enjoyment without work then society which cares for the welfare of all would wisely avoid caring for that in which you are well off Communism in proclaiming the welfare of all annuls outright the well being of those who hitherto lived on their income from investments and apparently felt better in that than in the prospect of Weitling s strict hours of labor Hence the latter asserts that with the welfare of thousands the welfare of millions cannot exist and the former must give up their special welfare for the sake of the general welfare No let people not be summoned to sacrifice their special welfare for the general for this Christian admonition will not carry you through they will better understand the opposite admonition not to let their own welfare be snatched from them by anybody but to put it on a permanent foundation Then they are of themselves led to the point that they care best for their welfare if they unite with others for this purpose i e sacrifice a part of their liberty yet not to the welfare of others but to their own An appeal to men s self sacrificing disposition and self renouncing love ought at last to have lost its seductive plausibility when after an activity of thousands of years it has left nothing behind but the misere of to day Why then still fruitlessly expect self sacrifice to bring us better times why not rather hope for them from usurpation Salvation comes no longer from the giver the bestower the loving one but from the taker the appropriater usurper the owner Communism and consciously or unconsciously egoism reviling humanism still count on love If community is once a need of man and he finds himself furthered by it in his aims then very soon because it has become his principle it prescribes to him its laws too the laws of society The principle of men exalts itself into a sovereign power over them becomes their supreme essence their God and as such lawgiver Communism gives this principle the strictest effect and Christianity is the religion of society for as Feuerbach rightly says although he does not mean it rightly love is the essence of man i e the essence of society or of societary Communistic man All religion is a cult of society this principle by which societary cultivated man is dominated neither is any god an ego s exclusive god but always a society s or community s be it of the society family Lar Penates or of a people national god or of all men he is a Father of all men Consequently one has a prospect of extirpating religion down to the ground only when one antiquates society and everything that flows from this principle But it is precisely in Communism that this principle seeks to culminate as in it everything is to become common for the establishment of equality If this equality is won liberty too is not lacking But whose liberty Society s Society is then all in all and men are only for each other It would be the glory of the love State But I would rather be referred to men s selfishness than to their kindnesses two hundred eight their mercy pity et cetera The former demands reciprocity as thou to me so I to thee does nothing gratis and may be won and bought But with what shall I obtain the kindness It is a matter of chance whether I am at the time having to do with a loving person The affectionate one s service can be had only by begging be it by my lamentable appearance by my need of help my misery my suffering What can I offer him for his assistance Nothing I must accept it as a present Love is unpayable or rather love can assuredly be paid for but only by counter love One good turn deserves another What paltriness and beggarliness does it not take to accept gifts year in and year out without service in return as they are regularly collected e g from the poor day laborer What can the receiver do for him and his donated pennies in which his wealth consists The day laborer would really have more enjoyment if the receiver with his laws his institutions et cetera all of which the day laborer has to pay for though did not exist at all And yet with it all the poor wight loves his master No community as the goal of history hitherto is impossible Let us rather renounce every hypocrisy of community and recognize that if we are equal as men we are not equal for the very reason that we are not men We are equal only in thoughts only when we are thought not as we really and bodily are I am ego and you are ego but I am not this thought of ego this ego in which we are all equal is only my thought I am man and you are man but man is only a thought a generality neither you nor I are speakable we are unutterable because only thoughts are speakable and consist in speaking Let us therefore not aspire to community but to one sidedness Let us not seek the most comprehensive commune human society but let us seek in others only means and organs which we may use as our property As we do not see our equals in the tree the beast so the presupposition that others are our equals springs from a hypocrisy No one is my equal but I regard him equally with all other beings as my property In opposition to this I am told that I should be a man among fellow men Judenfrage p sixty I should respect the fellow man in them For me no one is a person to be respected not even the fellow man but solely like other beings an object in which I take an interest or else do not an interesting or uninteresting object a usable or unusable person And if I can use him I doubtless come to an understanding and make myself at one with him in order by the agreement to strengthen my power and by combined force to accomplish more than individual force could effect In this combination I see nothing whatever but a multiplication of my force and I retain it only so long as it is my multiplied force But thus it is a union Neither a natural ligature nor a spiritual one holds the union together and it is not a natural not a spiritual league It is not brought about by one blood not by one faith spirit In a natural league like a family a tribe a nation yes mankind the individuals have only the value of specimens of the same species or genus in a spiritual league like a commune a church the individual signifies only a member of the same spirit what you are in both cases as a unique person must be suppressed Only in the union can you assert yourself as unique because the union does not possess you but you possess it or make it of use to you Property is recognized in the union and only in the union because one no longer holds what is his as a fief from any being The Communists are only consistently carrying further what had already been long present during religious evolution and especially in the State to wit propertylessness i e the feudal system The State exerts itself to tame the desirous man in other words it seeks to direct his desire to it alone and to content that desire with what it offers To sate the desire for the desirous man s sake does not come into its mind on the contrary it stigmatizes as an egoistic man the man who breathes out unbridled desire and the egoistic man is its enemy He is this for it because the capacity to agree with him is wanting to the State the egoist is precisely what it cannot comprehend Since the State as nothing else is possible has to do only for itself it does not take care for my needs but takes care only of how it shall make away with me i e make out of me another ego a good citizen It takes measures for the improvement of morals And with what does it win individuals for itself With itself i e with what is the State s with State property It will be unremittingly active in making all participants in its goods providing all with the good things of culture it presents them its education opens to them the access to its institutions of culture capacitates them to come to property i e to a fief in the way of industry et cetera For all these fiefs it demands only the just rent of continual thanks But the unthankful forget to pay these thanks Now neither can society do essentially otherwise than the State You bring into a union your whole power your competence and make yourself count in a society you are employed with your working power in the former you live egoistically in the latter humanly i e religiously as a member in the body of this Lord to a society you owe what you have and are in duty bound to it are possessed by social duties a union you utilize and give it up undutifully and unfaithfully when you see no way to use it further If a society is more than you then it is more to you than yourself a union is only your instrument or the sword with which you sharpen and increase your natural force the union exists for you and through you the society conversely lays claim to you for itself and exists even without you in short the society is sacred the union your own the society consumes you you consume the union Nevertheless people will not be backward with the objection that the agreement which has been concluded may again become burdensome to us and limit our freedom they will say we too would at last come to this that every one must sacrifice a part of his freedom for the sake of the generality But the sacrifice would not be made for the generality s sake a bit as little as I concluded the agreement for the generality s or even for any other man s sake rather I came into it only for the sake of my own benefit from selfishness two hundred nine But as regards the sacrificing surely I sacrifice only that which does not stand in my power i e I sacrifice nothing at all To come back to property the lord is proprietor Choose then whether you want to be lord or whether society shall be On this depends whether you are to be an owner or a ragamuffin The egoist is owner the Socialist a ragamuffin But ragamuffinism or propertylessness is the sense of feudalism of the feudal system which since the last century has only changed its overlord putting Man in the place of God and accepting as a fief from Man what had before been a fief from the grace of God That the ragamuffinism of Communism is carried out by the humane principle into the absolute or most ragamuffinly ragamuffinism has been shown above but at the same time also how ragamuffinism can only thus swing around into ownness The old feudal system was so thoroughly trampled into the ground in the Revolution that since then all reactionary craft has remained fruitless and will always remain fruitless because the dead is dead but the resurrection too had to prove itself a truth in Christian history and has so proved itself for in another world feudalism is risen again with a glorified body the new feudalism under the suzerainty of Man Christianity is not annihilated but the faithful are right in having hitherto trustfully assumed of every combat against it that this could serve only for the purgation and confirmation of Christianity for it has really only been glorified and Christianity exposed is the human Christianity We are still living entirely in the Christian age and the very ones who feel worst about it are the most zealously contributing to complete it The more human the dearer has feudalism become to us for we the less believe that it still is feudalism we take it the more confidently for ownness and think we have found what is most absolutely our own when we discover the human Liberalism wants to give me what is mine but it thinks to procure it for me not under the title of mine but under that of the human As if it were attainable under this mask The rights of man the precious work of the Revolution have the meaning that the Man in me entitles two hundred ten me to this and that I as individual i e as this man am not entitled but Man has the right and entitles me Hence as man I may well be entitled but as I am more than man to wit a special man it may be refused to this very me the special one If on the other hand you insist on the value of your gifts keep up their price do not let yourselves be forced to sell out below price do not let yourselves be talked into the idea that your ware is not worth its price do not make yourselves ridiculous by a ridiculous price but imitate the brave man who says I will sell my life property dear the enemy shall not have it at a cheap bargain then you have recognized the reverse of Communism as the correct thing and the word then is not Give up your property but Get the value out of your property Over the portal of our time stands not that Know thyself of Apollo but a Get the value out of thyself Proudhon calls property robbery le vol But alien property and he is talking of this alone is not less existent by renunciation cession and humility it is a present Why so sentimentally call for compassion as a poor victim of robbery when one is just a foolish cowardly giver of presents Why here again put the fault on others as if they were robbing us while we ourselves do bear the fault in leaving the others unrobbed The poor are to blame for there being rich men Universally no one grows indignant at his but at alien property They do not in truth attack property but the alienation of property They want to be able to call more not less theirs they want to call everything theirs They are fighting therefore against alienness or to form a word similar to property against alienty And how do they help themselves therein Instead of transforming the alien into own they play impartial and ask only that all property be left to a third party e g human society They revendicate the alien not in their own name but in a third party s Now the egoistic coloring is wiped off and everything is so clean and human Propertylessness or ragamuffinism this then is the essence of Christianity as it is the essence of all religiousness i e godliness morality humanity and only announced itself most clearly and as glad tidings became a gospel capable of development in the absolute religion We have before us the most striking development in the present fight against property a fight which is to bring Man to victory and make propertylessness complete victorious humanity is the victory of Christianity But the Christianity exposed thus is feudalism completed the most all embracing feudal system i e perfect ragamuffinism Once more then doubtless a revolution against the feudal system Revolution and insurrection must not be looked upon as synonymous The former consists in an overturning of conditions of the established condition or status the State or society and is accordingly a political or social act the latter has indeed for its unavoidable consequence a transformation of circumstances yet does not start from it but from men s discontent with themselves is not an armed rising but a rising of individuals a getting up without regard to the arrangements that spring from it The Revolution aimed at new arrangements insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves be arranged but to arrange ourselves and sets no glittering hopes on institutions It is not a fight against the established since if it prospers the established collapses of itself it is only a working forth of me out of the established If I leave the established it is dead and passes into decay Now as my object is not the overthrow of an established order but my elevation above it my purpose and deed are not a political or social but as directed toward myself and my ownness alone an egoistic purpose and deed The revolution commands one to make arrangements the insurrection two hundred eleven demands that he rise or exalt himself two hundred twelve What constitution was to be chosen this question busied the revolutionary heads and the whole political period foams with constitutional fights and constitutional questions as the social talents too were uncommonly inventive in societary arrangement phalansteries and the like The insurgent two hundred thirteen strives to become constitutionless While to get greater clearness I am thinking up a comparison the founding of Christianity comes unexpectedly into my mind On the liberal side it is noted as a bad point in the first Christians that they preached obedience to the established heathen civil order enjoined recognition of the heathen authorities and confidently delivered a command Give to the emperor that which is the emperor s Yet how much disturbance arose at the same time against the Roman supremacy how mutinous did the Jews and even the Romans show themselves against their own temporal government in short how popular was political discontent Those Christians would hear nothing of it would not side with the liberal tendencies The time was politically so agitated that as is said in the gospels people thought they could not accuse the founder of Christianity more successfully than if they arraigned him for political intrigue and yet the same gospels report that he was precisely the one who took least part in these political doings But why was he not a revolutionist not a demagogue as the Jews would gladly have seen him why was he not a liberal Because he expected no salvation from a change of conditions and this whole business was indifferent to him He was not a revolutionist like e g Caesar but an insurgent not a State overturner but one who straightened himself up That was why it was for him only a matter of Be ye wise as serpents which expresses the same sense as in the special case that Give to the emperor that which is the emperor s for he was not carrying on any liberal or political fight against the established authorities but wanted to walk his own way untroubled about and undisturbed by these authorities Not less indifferent to him than the government were its enemies for neither understood what he wanted and he had only to keep them off from him with the wisdom of the serpent But even though not a ringleader of popular mutiny not a demagogue or revolutionist he and every one of the ancient Christians was so much the more an insurgent who lifted himself above everything that seemed sublime to the government and its opponents and absolved himself from everything that they remained bound to and who at the same time cut off the sources of life of the whole heathen world with which the established State must wither away as a matter of course precisely because he put from him the upsetting of the established he was its deadly enemy and real annihilator for he walled it in confidently and recklessly carrying up the building of his temple over it without heeding the pains of the immured Now as it happened to the heathen order of the world will the Christian order fare likewise A revolution certainly does not bring on the end if an insurrection is not consummated first My intercourse with the world what does it aim at I want to have the enjoyment of it therefore it must be my property and therefore I want to win it I do not want the liberty of men nor their equality I want only my power over them I want to make them my property i e material for enjoyment And if I do not succeed in that well then I call even the power over life and death which Church and State reserved to themselves mine Brand that officer s widow who in the flight in Russia after her leg has been shot away takes the garter from it strangles her child therewith and then bleeds to death alongside the corpse brand the memory of the infanticide Who knows if this child had remained alive how much it might have been of use to the world The mother murdered it because she wanted to die satisfied and at rest Perhaps this case still appeals to your sentimentality and you do not know how to read out of it anything further Be it so I on my part use it as an example for this that my satisfaction decides about my relation to men and that I do not renounce from any access of humility even the power over life and death As regards social duties in general another does not give me my position toward others therefore neither God nor humanity prescribes to me my relation to men but I give myself this position This is more strikingly said thus I have no duty to others as I have a duty even to myself e g that of self preservation and therefore not suicide only so long as I distinguish myself from myself my immortal soul from my earthly existence et cetera I no longer humble myself before any power and I recognize that all powers are only my power which I have to subject at once when they threaten to become a power against or above me each of them must be only one of my means to carry my point as a hound is our power against game but is killed by us if it should fall upon us ourselves All powers that dominate me I then reduce to serving me The idols exist through me I need only refrain from creating them anew then they exist no longer higher powers exist only through my exalting them and abasing myself Consequently my relation to the world is this I no longer do anything for it for God s sake I do nothing for man s sake but what I do I do for my sake Thus alone does the world satisfy me while it is characteristic of the religious standpoint in which I include the moral and humane also that from it everything remains a pious wish pium desiderium i e an other world matter something unattained Thus the general salvation of men the moral world of a general love eternal peace the cessation of egoism et cetera Nothing in this world is perfect With this miserable phrase the good part from it and take flight into their closet to God or into their proud self consciousness But we remain in this imperfect world because even so we can use it for our self enjoyment My intercourse with the world consists in my enjoying it and so consuming it for my self enjoyment Intercourse is the enjoyment of the world and belongs to my self enjoyment III MY SELF ENJOYMENT We stand at the boundary of a period The world hitherto took thought for nothing but the gain of life took care for life For whether all activity is put on the stretch for the life of this world or of the other for the temporal or for the eternal whether one hankers for daily bread Give us our daily bread or for holy bread the true bread from heaven the bread of God that comes from heaven and gives life to the world the bread of life John six whether one takes care for dear life or for life to eternity this does not change the object of the strain and care which in the one case as in the other shows itself to be life Do the modern tendencies announce themselves otherwise People now want nobody to be embarrassed for the most indispensable necessaries of life but want every one to feel secure as to these and on the other hand they teach that man has this life to attend to and the real world to adapt himself to without vain care for another Let us take up the same thing from another side When one is anxious only to live he easily in this solicitude forgets the enjoyment of life If his only concern is for life and he thinks if I only have my dear life he does not apply his full strength to using i e enjoying life But how does one use life In using it up like the candle which one uses in burning it up One uses life and consequently himself the living one in consuming it and himself Enjoyment of life is using life up Now we are in search of the enjoyment of life And what did the religious world do It went in search of life Wherein consists the true life the blessed life et cetera How is it to be attained What must man do and become in order to become a truly living man How does he fulfil this calling These and similar questions indicate that the askers were still seeking for themselves to wit themselves in the true sense in the sense of true living What I am is foam and shadow what I shall be is my true self To chase after this self to produce it to realize it constitutes the hard task of mortals who die only to rise again live only to die live only to find the true life Not till I am certain of myself and no longer seeking for myself am I really my property I have myself therefore I use and enjoy myself On the other hand I can never take comfort in myself so long as I think that I have still to find my true self and that it must come to this that not I but Christ or some other spiritual i e ghostly self e g the true man the essence of man and the like lives in me A vast interval separates the two views In the old I go toward myself in the new I start from myself in the former I long for myself in the latter I have myself and do with myself as one does with any other property I enjoy myself at my pleasure I am no longer afraid for my life but squander it Henceforth the question runs not how one can acquire life but how one can squander enjoy it or not how one is to produce the true self in himself but how one is to dissolve himself to live himself out What else should the ideal be but the sought for ever distant self One seeks for himself consequently one does not yet have himself one aspires toward what one ought to be consequently one is not it One lives in longing and has lived thousands of years in it in hope Living is quite another thing in enjoyment Does this perchance apply only to the so called pious No it applies to all who belong to the departing period of history even to its men of pleasure For them too the work days were followed by a Sunday and the rush of the world by the dream of a better world of a general happiness of humanity in short by an ideal But philosophers especially are contrasted with the pious Now have they been thinking of anything else than the ideal been planning for anything else than the absolute self Longing and hope everywhere and nothing but these For me call it romanticism If the enjoyment of life is to triumph over the longing for life or hope of life it must vanquish this in its double significance which Schiller introduces in his Ideal and Life it must crush spiritual and secular poverty exterminate the ideal and the want of daily bread He who must expend his life to prolong life cannot enjoy it and he who is still seeking for his life does not have it and can as little enjoy it both are poor but blessed are the poor Those who are hungering for the true life have no power over their present life but must apply it for the purpose of thereby gaining that true life and must sacrifice it entirely to this aspiration and this task If in the case of those devotees who hope for a life in the other world and look upon that in this world as merely a preparation for it the tributariness of their earthly existence which they put solely into the service of the hoped for heavenly existence is pretty distinctly apparent one would yet go far wrong if one wanted to consider the most rationalistic and enlightened as less self sacrificing Oh there is to be found in the true life a much more comprehensive significance than the heavenly is competent to express Now is not to introduce the liberal concept of it at once the human and truly human life the true one And is every one already leading this truly human life from the start or must he first raise himself to it with hard toil Does he already have it as his present life or must he struggle for it as his future life which will become his part only when he is no longer tainted with any egoism In this view life exists only to gain life and one lives only to make the essence of man alive in oneself one lives for the sake of this essence One has his life only in order to procure by means of it the true life cleansed of all egoism Hence one is afraid to make any use he likes of his life it is to serve only for the right use In short one has a calling in life a task in life one has something to realize and produce by his life a something for which our life is only means and implement a something that is worth more than this life a something to which one owes his life One has a God who asks a living sacrifice Only the rudeness of human sacrifice has been lost with time human sacrifice itself has remained unabated and criminals hourly fall sacrifices to justice and we poor sinners slay our own selves as sacrifices for the human essence the idea of mankind humanity and whatever the idols or gods are called besides But because we owe our life to that something therefore this is the next point we have no right to take it from us The conservative tendency of Christianity does not permit thinking of death otherwise than with the purpose to take its sting from it and live on and preserve oneself nicely The Christian lets everything happen and come upon him if he the arch Jew can only haggle and smuggle himself into heaven he must not kill himself he must only preserve himself and work at the preparation of a future abode Conservatism or conquest of death lies at his heart the last enemy that is abolished is death two hundred fourteen Christ has taken the power from death and brought life and imperishable being to light by the gospel two hundred fifteen Imperishableness stability The moral man wants the good the right and if he takes to the means that lead to this goal really lead to it then these means are not his means but those of the good right et cetera itself These means are never immoral because the good end itself mediates itself through them the end sanctifies the means They call this maxim jesuitical but it is moral through and through The moral man acts in the service of an end or an idea he makes himself the tool of the idea of the good as the pious man counts it his glory to be a tool or instrument of God To await death is what the moral commandment postulates as the good to give it to oneself is immoral and bad suicide finds no excuse before the judgment seat of morality If the religious man forbids it because you have not given yourself life but God who alone can also take it from you again as if even talking in this conception God did not take it from me just as much when I kill myself as when a tile from the roof or a hostile bullet fells me for he would have aroused the resolution of death in me too the moral man forbids it because I owe my life to the fatherland et cetera because I do not know whether I may not yet accomplish good by my life Of course for in me good loses a tool as God does an instrument If I am immoral the good is served in my amendment if I am ungodly God has joy in my penitence Suicide therefore is ungodly as well as nefarious If one whose standpoint is religiousness takes his own life he acts in forgetfulness of God but if the suicide s standpoint is morality he acts in forgetfulness of duty immorally People worried themselves much with the question whether Emilia Galotti s death can be justified before morality they take it as if it were suicide which it is too in substance That she is so infatuated with chastity this moral good as to yield up even her life for it is certainly moral but again that she fears the weakness of her flesh is immoral two hundred sixteen Such contradictions form the tragic conflict universally in the moral drama and one must think and feel morally to be able to take an interest in it What holds good of piety and morality will necessarily apply to humanity also because one owes his life likewise to man mankind or the species Only when I am under obligation to no being is the maintaining of life my affair A leap from this bridge makes me free But if we owe the maintaining of our life to that being that we are to make alive in ourselves it is not less our duty not to lead this life according to our pleasure but to shape it in conformity to that being All my feeling thinking and willing all my doing and designing belongs to him What is in conformity to that being is to be inferred from his concept and how differently has this concept been conceived or how differently has that being been imagined What demands the Supreme Being makes on the Mohammedan what different ones the Christian again thinks he hears from him how divergent therefore must the shaping of the lives of the two turn out Only this do all hold fast that the Supreme Being is to judge two hundred seventeen our life But the pious who have their judge in God and in his word a book of directions for their life I everywhere pass by only reminiscently because they belong to a period of development that has been lived through and as petrifactions they may remain in their fixed place right along in our time it is no longer the pious but the liberals who have the floor and piety itself cannot keep from reddening its pale face with liberal coloring But the liberals do not adore their judge in God and do not unfold their life by the directions of the divine word but regulate two hundred eighteen themselves by man they want to be not divine but human and to live so Man is the liberal s supreme being man the judge of his life humanity his directions or catechism God is spirit but man is the most perfect spirit the final result of the long chase after the spirit or of the searching in the depths of the Godhead i e in the depths of the spirit Every one of your traits is to be human you yourself are to be so from top to toe in the inward as in the outward for humanity is your calling Calling destiny task What one can become he does become A born poet may well be hindered by the disfavor of circumstances from standing on the high level of his time and after the great studies that are indispensable for this producing consummate works of art but he will make poetry be he a plowman or so lucky as to live at the court of Weimar A born musician will make music no matter whether on all instruments or only on an oaten pipe A born philosophical head can give proof of itself as university philosopher or as village philosopher Finally a born dolt who as is very well compatible with this may at the same time be a sly boots will as probably every one who has visited schools is in a position to exemplify to himself by many instances of fellow scholars always remain a blockhead let him have been drilled and trained into the chief of a bureau or let him serve that same chief as bootblack Nay the born shallow pates indisputably form the most numerous class of men And why indeed should not the same distinctions show themselves in the human species that are unmistakable in every species of beasts The more gifted and the less gifted are to be found everywhere Only a few however are so imbecile that one could not get ideas into them Hence people usually consider all men capable of having religion In a certain degree they may be trained to other ideas too e g to some musical intelligence even some philosophy et cetera At this point then the priesthood of religion of morality of culture of science et cetera takes its start and the Communists e g want to make everything accessible to all by their public school There is heard a common assertion that this great mass cannot get along without religion the Communists broaden it into the proposition that not only the great mass but absolutely all are called to everything Not enough that the great mass has been trained to religion now it is actually to have to occupy itself with everything human Training is growing ever more general and more comprehensive You poor beings who could live so happily if you might skip according to your mind you are to dance to the pipe of schoolmasters and bear leaders in order to perform tricks that you yourselves would never use yourselves for And you do not even kick out of the traces at last against being always taken otherwise than you want to give yourselves No you mechanically recite to yourselves the question that is recited to you What am I called to What ought I to do You need only ask thus to have yourselves told what you ought to do and ordered to do it to have your calling marked out for you or else to order yourselves and impose it on yourselves according to the spirit s prescription Then in reference to the will the word is I will to do what I ought A man is called to nothing and has no calling no destiny as little as a plant or a beast has a calling The flower does not follow the calling to complete itself but it spends all its forces to enjoy and consume the world as well as it can i e it sucks in as much of the juices of the earth as much air of the ether as much light of the sun as it can get and lodge The bird lives up to no calling but it uses its forces as much as is practicable it catches beetles and sings to its heart s delight But the forces of the flower and the bird are slight in comparison to those of a man and a man who applies his forces will affect the world much more powerfully than flower and beast A calling he has not but he has forces that manifest themselves where they are because their being consists solely in their manifestation and are as little able to abide inactive as life which if it stood still only a second would no longer be life Now one might call out to the man use your force Yet to this imperative would be given the meaning that it was man s task to use his force It is not so Rather each one really uses his force without first looking upon this as his calling at all times every one uses as much force as he possesses One does say of a beaten man that he ought to have exerted his force more but one forgets that if in the moment of succumbing he had had the force to exert his forces e g bodily forces he would not have failed to do it even if it was only the discouragement of a minute this was yet a destitution of force a minute long Forces may assuredly be sharpened and redoubled especially by hostile resistance or friendly assistance but where one misses their application one may be sure of their absence too One can strike fire out of a stone but without the blow none comes out in like manner a man too needs impact Now for this reason that forces always of themselves show themselves operative the command to use them would be superfluous and senseless To use his forces is not man s calling and task but is his act real and extant at all times Force is only a simpler word for manifestation of force Now as this rose is a true rose to begin with this nightingale always a true nightingale so I am not for the first time a true man when I fulfil my calling live up to my destiny but I am a true man from the start My first babble is the token of the life of a true man the struggles of my life are the outpourings of his force my last breath is the last exhalation of the force of the man The true man does not lie in the future an object of longing but lies existent and real in the present Whatever and whoever I may be joyous and suffering a child or a graybeard in confidence or doubt in sleep or in waking I am it I am the true man But if I am Man and have really found in myself him whom religious humanity designated as the distant goal then everything truly human is also my own What was ascribed to the idea of humanity belongs to me That freedom of trade e g which humanity has yet to attain and which like an enchanting dream people remove to humanity s golden future I take by anticipation as my property and carry it on for the time in the form of smuggling There may indeed be but few smugglers who have sufficient understanding to thus account to themselves for their doings but the instinct of egoism replaces their consciousness Above I have shown the same thing about freedom of the press Everything is my own therefore I bring back to myself what wants to withdraw from me but above all I always bring myself back when I have slipped away from myself to any tributariness But this too is not my calling but my natural act Enough there is a mighty difference whether I make myself the starting point or the goal As the latter I do not have myself am consequently still alien to myself am my essence my true essence and this true essence alien to me will mock me as a spook of a thousand different names Because I am not yet I another like God the true man the truly pious man the rational man the freeman et cetera is I my ego Still far from myself I separate myself into two halves of which one the one unattained and to be fulfilled is the true one The one the untrue must be brought as a sacrifice to wit the unspiritual one The other the true is to be the whole man to wit the spirit Then it is said The spirit is man s proper essence or man exists as man only spiritually Now there is a greedy rush to catch the spirit as if one would then have bagged himself and so in chasing after himself one loses sight of himself whom he is And as one stormily pursues his own self the never attained so one also despises shrewd people s rule to take men as they are and prefers to take them as they should be and for this reason hounds every one on after his should be self and endeavors to make all into equally entitled equally respectable equally moral or rational men two hundred nineteen Yes if men were what they should be could be if all men were rational all loved each other as brothers then it would be a paradisiacal life two hundred twenty All right men are as they should be can be What should they be Surely not more than they can be And what can they be Not more again than they can i e than they have the competence the force to be But this they really are because what they are not they are incapable of being for to be capable means really to be One is not capable for anything that one really is not one is not capable of anything that one does not really do Could a man blinded by cataract see Oh yes if he had his cataract successfully removed But now he cannot see because he does not see Possibility and reality always coincide One can do nothing that one does not as one does nothing that one cannot The singularity of this assertion vanishes when one reflects that the words it is possible that almost never contain another meaning than I can imagine that e g It is possible for all men to live rationally i e I can imagine that all et cetera Now since my thinking cannot and accordingly does not cause all men to live rationally but this must still be left to the men themselves general reason is for me only thinkable a thinkableness but as such in fact a reality that is called a possibility only in reference to what I can not bring to pass to wit the rationality of others So far as depends on you all men might be rational for you have nothing against it nay so far as your thinking reaches you perhaps cannot discover any hindrance either and accordingly nothing does stand in the way of the thing in your thinking it is thinkable to you As men are not all rational though it is probable that they cannot be so If something which one imagines to be easily possible is not or does not happen then one may be assured that something stands in the way of the thing and that it is impossible Our time has its art science et cetera the art may be bad in all conscience but may one say that we deserved to have a better and could have it if we only would We have just as much art as we can have Our art of to day is the only art possible and therefore real at the time Even in the sense to which one might at last still reduce the word possible that it should mean future it retains the full force of the real If one says e g It is possible that the sun will rise to morrow this means only for to day to morrow is the real future for I suppose there is hardly need of the suggestion that a future is real future only when it has not yet appeared Yet wherefore this dignifying of a word If the most prolific misunderstanding of thousands of years were not in ambush behind it if this single concept of the little word possible were not haunted by all the spooks of possessed men its contemplation should trouble us little here The thought it was just now shown rules the possessed world Well then possibility is nothing but thinkableness and innumerable sacrifices have hitherto been made to hideous thinkableness It was thinkable that men might become rational thinkable that they might know Christ thinkable that they might become moral and enthusiastic for the good thinkable that they might all take refuge in the Church s lap thinkable that they might meditate speak and do nothing dangerous to the State thinkable that they might be obedient subjects but because it was thinkable it was so ran the inference possible and further because it was possible to men right here lies the deceptive point because it is thinkable to me it is possible to men therefore they ought to be so it was their calling and finally one is to take men only according to this calling only as called men not as they are but as they ought to be And the further inference Man is not the individual but man is a thought an ideal to which the individual is related not even as the child to the man but as a chalk point to a point thought of or as a finite creature to the eternal Creator or according to modern views as the specimen to the species Here then comes to light the glorification of humanity the eternal immortal for whose glory in majorem humanitatis gloriam the individual must devote himself and find his immortal renown in having done something for the spirit of humanity Thus the thinkers rule in the world as long as the age of priests or of schoolmasters lasts and what they think of is possible but what is possible must be realized They think an ideal of man which for the time is real only in their thoughts but they also think the possibility of carrying it out and there is no chance for dispute the carrying out is really thinkable it is an idea But you and I we may indeed be people of whom a Krummacher can think that we might yet become good Christians if however he wanted to labor with us we should soon make it palpable to him that our Christianity is only thinkable but in other respects impossible if he grinned on and on at us with his obtrusive thoughts his good belief he would have to learn that we do not at all need to become what we do not like to become And so it goes on far beyond the most pious of the pious If all men were rational if all did right if all were guided by philanthropy et cetera Reason right philanthropy et cetera are put before the eyes of men as their calling as the goal of their aspiration And what does being rational mean Giving oneself a hearing two hundred twenty one No reason is a book full of laws which are all enacted against egoism History hitherto is the history of the intellectual man After the period of sensuality history proper begins i e the period of intellectuality two hundred twenty two spirituality two hundred twenty three non sensuality supersensuality nonsensicality Man now begins to want to be and become something What Good beautiful true more precisely moral pious agreeable et cetera He wants to make of himself a proper man something proper Man is his goal his ought his destiny calling task his ideal he is to himself a future otherworldly he And what makes a proper fellow of him Being true being good being moral and the like Now he looks askance at every one who does not recognize the same what seek the same morality have the same faith he chases out separatists heretics sects et cetera No sheep no dog exerts itself to become a proper sheep a proper dog no beast has its essence appear to it as a task i e as a concept that it has to realize It realizes itself in living itself out i e dissolving itself passing away It does not ask to be or to become anything other than it is Do I mean to advise you to be like the beasts That you ought to become beasts is an exhortation which I certainly cannot give you as that would again be a task an ideal How doth the little busy bee improve each shining hour In works of labor or of skill I would be busy too for Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do It would be the same too as if one wished for the beasts that they should become human beings Your nature is once for all a human one you are human natures i e human beings But just because you already are so you do not still need to become so Beasts too are trained and a trained beast executes many unnatural things But a trained dog is no better for itself than a natural one and has no profit from it even if it is more companionable for us Exertions to form all men into moral rational pious human et cetera beings i e training were in vogue from of yore They are wrecked against the indomitable quality of I against own nature against egoism Those who are trained never attain their ideal and only profess with their mouth the sublime principles or make a profession a profession of faith In face of this profession they must in life acknowledge themselves sinners altogether and they fall short of their ideal are weak men and bear with them the consciousness of human weakness It is different if you do not chase after an ideal as your destiny but dissolve yourself as time dissolves everything The dissolution is not your destiny because it is present time Yet the culture the religiousness of men has assuredly made them free but only free from one lord to lead them to another I have learned by religion to tame my appetite I break the world s resistance by the cunning that is put in my hand by science I even serve no man I am no man s lackey But then it comes You must obey God more than man Just so I am indeed free from irrational determination by my impulses but obedient to the master Reason I have gained spiritual freedom freedom of the spirit But with that I have then become subject to that very spirit The spirit gives me orders reason guides me they are my leaders and commanders The rational the servants of the spirit rule But if I am not flesh I am in truth not spirit either Freedom of the spirit is servitude of me because I am more than spirit or flesh Without doubt culture has made me powerful It has given me power over all motives over the impulses of my nature as well as over the exactions and violences of the world I know and have gained the force for it by culture that I need not let myself be coerced by any of my appetites pleasures emotions et cetera I am their master in like manner I become through the sciences and arts the master of the refractory world whom sea and earth obey and to whom even the stars must give an account of themselves The spirit has made me master But I have no power over the spirit itself From religion culture I do learn the means for the vanquishing of the world but not how I am to subdue God too and become master of him for God is the spirit And this same spirit of which I am unable to become master may have the most manifold shapes he may be called God or National Spirit State Family Reason also Liberty Humanity Man I receive with thanks what the centuries of culture have acquired for me I am not willing to throw away and give up anything of it I have not lived in vain The experience that I have power over my nature and need not be the slave of my appetites shall not be lost to me the experience that I can subdue the world by culture s means is too dear bought for me to be able to forget it But I want still more People ask what can man do what can he accomplish what goods procure and put down the highest of everything as a calling As if everything were possible to me If one sees somebody going to ruin in a mania a passion et cetera e g in the huckster spirit in jealousy the desire is stirred to deliver him out of this possession and to help him to self conquest We want to make a man of him That would be very fine if another possession were not immediately put in the place of the earlier one But one frees from the love of money him who is a thrall to it only to deliver him over to piety humanity or some principle else and to transfer him to a fixed standpoint anew This transference from a narrow standpoint to a sublime one is declared in the words that the sense must not be directed to the perishable but to the imperishable alone not to the temporal but to the eternal absolute divine purely human et cetera to the spiritual People very soon discerned that it was not indifferent what one set his affections on or what one occupied himself with they recognized the importance of the object An object exalted above the individuality of things is the essence of things yes the essence is alone the thinkable in them it is for the thinking man Therefore direct no longer your sense to the things but your thoughts to the essence Blessed are they who see not and yet believe i e blessed are the thinkers for they have to do with the invisible and believe in it Yet even an object of thought that constituted an essential point of contention centuries long comes at last to the point of being no longer worth speaking of This was discerned but nevertheless people always kept before their eyes again a self valid importance of the object an absolute value of it as if the doll were not the most important thing to the child the Koran to the Turk As long as I am not the sole important thing to myself it is indifferent of what object I make much and only my greater or lesser delinquency against it is of value The degree of my attachment and devotion marks the standpoint of my liability to service the degree of my sinning shows the measure of my ownness But finally and in general one must know how to put everything out of his mind if only so as to be able to go to sleep Nothing may occupy us with which we do not occupy ourselves the victim of ambition cannot run away from his ambitious plans nor the God fearing man from the thought of God infatuation and possessedness coincide To want to realize his essence or live conformably to his concept which with believers in God signifies as much as to be pious and with believers in humanity means living humanly is what only the sensual and sinful man can propose to himself the man so long as he has the anxious choice between happiness of sense and peace of soul so long as he is a poor sinner The Christian is nothing but a sensual man who knowing of the sacred and being conscious that he violates it sees in himself a poor sinner sensualness recognized as sinfulness is Christian consciousness is the Christian himself And if sin and sinfulness are now no longer taken into the mouths of moderns but instead of that egoism self seeking selfishness and the like engage them if the devil has been translated into the un man or egoistic man is the Christian less present then than before Is not the old discord between good and evil is not a judge over us man is not a calling the calling to make oneself man left If they no longer name it calling but task or very likely duty the change of name is quite correct because man is not like God a personal being that can call but outside the name the thing remains as of old Every one has a relation to objects and more every one is differently related to them Let us choose as an example that book to which millions of men had a relation for two thousand years the Bible What is it what was it to each Absolutely only what he made out of it For him who makes to himself nothing at all out of it it is nothing at all for him who uses it as an amulet it has solely the value the significance of a means of sorcery for him who like children plays with it it is nothing but a plaything et cetera Now Christianity asks that it shall be the same for all say the sacred book or the sacred Scriptures This means as much as that the Christian s view shall also be that of other men and that no one may be otherwise related to that object And with this the ownness of the relation is destroyed and one mind one disposition is fixed as the true the only true one In the limitation of the freedom to make of the Bible what I will the freedom of making in general is limited and the coercion of a view or a judgment is put in its place He who should pass the judgment that the Bible was a long error of mankind would judge criminally In fact the child who tears it to pieces or plays with it the Inca Atahualpa who lays his ear to it and throws it away contemptuously when it remains dumb judges just as correctly about the Bible as the priest who praises in it the Word of God or the critic who calls it a job of men s hands For how we toss things about is the affair of our option our free will we use them according to our heart s pleasure or more clearly we use them just as we can Why what do the parsons scream about when they see how Hegel and the speculative theologians make speculative thoughts out of the contents of the Bible Precisely this that they deal with it according to their heart s pleasure or proceed arbitrarily with it But because we all show ourselves arbitrary in the handling of objects i e do with them as we like best at our liking the philosopher likes nothing so well as when he can trace out an idea in everything as the God fearing man likes to make God his friend by everything and so e g by keeping the Bible sacred therefore we nowhere meet such grievous arbitrariness such a frightful tendency to violence such stupid coercion as in this very domain of our own free will If we proceed arbitrarily in taking the sacred objects thus or so how is it then that we want to take it ill of the parson spirits if they take us just as arbitrarily in their fashion and esteem us worthy of the heretic s fire or of another punishment perhaps of the censorship What a man is he makes out of things as you look at the world so it looks at you again Then the wise advice makes itself heard again at once You must only look at it rightly unbiasedly et cetera As if the child did not look at the Bible rightly and unbiasedly when it makes it a plaything That shrewd precept is given us e g by Feuerbach One does look at things rightly when one makes of them what one will by things objects in general are here understood such as God our fellow men a sweetheart a book a beast et cetera And therefore the things and the looking at them are not first but I am my will is One will bring thoughts out of the things will discover reason in the world will have sacredness in it therefore one shall find them Seek and ye shall find What I will seek I determine I want e g to get edification from the Bible it is to be found I want to read and test the Bible thoroughly my outcome will be a thorough instruction and criticism to the extent of my powers I elect for myself what I have a fancy for and in electing I show myself arbitrary Connected with this is the discernment that every judgment which I pass upon an object is the creature of my will and that discernment again leads me to not losing myself in the creature the judgment but remaining the creator the judger who is ever creating anew All predicates of objects are my statements my judgments my creatures If they want to tear themselves loose from me and be something for themselves or actually overawe me then I have nothing more pressing to do than to take them back into their nothing i e into me the creator God Christ trinity morality the good et cetera are such creatures of which I must not merely allow myself to say that they are truths but also that they are deceptions As I once willed and decreed their existence so I want to have license to will their non existence too I must not let them grow over my head must not have the weakness to let them become something absolute whereby they would be eternalized and withdrawn from my power and decision With that I should fall a prey to the principle of stability the proper life principle of religion which concerns itself with creating sanctuaries that must not be touched eternal truths in short that which shall be sacred and depriving you of what is yours The object makes us into possessed men in its sacred form just as in its profane as a supersensuous object just as it does as a sensuous one The appetite or mania refers to both and avarice and longing for heaven stand on a level When the rationalists wanted to win people for the sensuous world Lavater preached the longing for the invisible The one party wanted to call forth emotion the other motion activity The conception of objects is altogether diverse even as God Christ the world et cetera were and are conceived of in the most manifold wise In this every one is a dissenter and after bloody combats so much has at last been attained that opposite views about one and the same object are no longer condemned as heresies worthy of death The dissenters reconcile themselves to each other But why should I only dissent think otherwise about a thing why not push the thinking otherwise to its last extremity viz that of no longer having any regard at all for the thing and therefore thinking its nothingness crushing it Then the conception itself has an end because there is no longer anything to conceive of Why am I to say let us suppose God is not Allah not Brahma not Jehovah but God but not God is nothing but a deception Why do people brand me if I am an atheist Because they put the creature above the creator They honor and serve the creature more than the Creator two hundred twenty four and require a ruling object that the subject may be right submissive I am to bend beneath the absolute I ought to By the realm of thoughts Christianity has completed itself the thought is that inwardness in which all the world s lights go out all existence becomes existenceless the inward man the heart the head is all in all This realm of thoughts awaits its deliverance awaits like the Sphinx Oedipus s key word to the riddle that it may enter in at last to its death I am the annihilator of its continuance for in the creator s realm it no longer forms a realm of its own not a State in the State but a creature of my creative thoughtlessness Only together and at the same time with the benumbed thinking world can the world of Christians Christianity and religion itself come to its downfall only when thoughts run out are there no more believers To the thinker his thinking is a sublime labor a sacred activity and it rests on a firm faith the faith in truth At first praying is a sacred activity then this sacred devotion passes over into a rational and reasoning thinking which however likewise retains in the sacred truth its un derangeable basis of faith and is only a marvelous machine that the spirit of truth winds up for its service Free thinking and free science busy me for it is not I that am free not I that busy myself but thinking is free and busies me with heaven and the heavenly or divine that is properly with the world and the worldly not this world but another world it is only the reversing and deranging of the world a busying with the essence of the world therefore a derangement The thinker is blind to the immediateness of things and incapable of mastering them he does not eat does not drink does not enjoy for the eater and drinker is never the thinker nay the latter forgets eating and drinking his getting on in life the cares of nourishment et cetera over his thinking he forgets it as the praying man too forgets it This is why he appears to the forceful son of nature as a queer Dick a fool even if he does look upon him as holy just as lunatics appeared so to the ancients Free thinking is lunacy because it is pure movement of the inwardness of the merely inward man which guides and regulates the rest of the man The shaman and the speculative philosopher mark the bottom and top rounds on the ladder of the inward man the Mongol Shaman and philosopher fight with ghosts demons spirits gods Totally different from this free thinking is own thinking my thinking a thinking which does not guide me but is guided continued or broken off by me at my pleasure The distinction of this own thinking from free thinking is similar to that of own sensuality which I satisfy at pleasure from free unruly sensuality to which I succumb Feuerbach in the Principles of the Philosophy of the Future is always harping upon being In this he too with all his antagonism to Hegel and the absolute philosophy is stuck fast in abstraction for being is abstraction as is even the I Only I am not abstraction alone I am all in all consequently even abstraction or nothing I am all and nothing I am not a mere thought but at the same time I am full of thoughts a thought world Hegel condemns the own mine two hundred twenty five opinion two hundred twenty six Absolute thinking is that thinking which forgets that it is my thinking that I think and that it exists only through me But I as I swallow up again what is mine am its master it is only my opinion which I can at any moment change i e annihilate take back into myself and consume Feuerbach wants to smite Hegel s absolute thinking with unconquered being But in me being is as much conquered as thinking is It is my being as the other is my thinking With this of course Feuerbach does not get further than to the proof trivial in itself that I require the senses for everything or that I cannot entirely do without these organs Certainly I cannot think if I do not exist sensuously But for thinking as well as for feeling and so for the abstract as well as for the sensuous I need above all things myself this quite particular myself this unique myself If I were not this one e g Hegel I should not look at the world as I do look at it I should not pick out of it that philosophical system which just I as Hegel do et cetera I should indeed have senses as do other people too but I should not utilize them as I do Thus the reproach is brought up against Hegel by Feuerbach two hundred twenty seven that he misuses language understanding by many words something else than what natural consciousness takes them for and yet he too commits the same fault when he gives the sensuous a sense of unusual eminence Thus it is said p sixty nine the sensuous is not the profane the destitute of thought the obvious that which is understood of itself But if it is the sacred the full of thought the recondite that which can be understood only through mediation well then it is no longer what people call the sensuous The sensuous is only that which exists for the senses what on the other hand is enjoyable only to those who enjoy with more than the senses who go beyond sense enjoyment or sense reception is at most mediated or introduced by the senses i e the senses constitute a condition for obtaining it but it is no longer anything sensuous The sensuous whatever it may be when taken up into me becomes something non sensuous which however may again have sensuous effects e g by the stirring of my emotions and my blood It is well that Feuerbach brings sensuousness to honor but the only thing he is able to do with it is to clothe the materialism of his new philosophy with what had hitherto been the property of idealism the absolute philosophy As little as people let it be talked into them that one can live on the spiritual alone without bread so little will they believe his word that as a sensuous being one is already everything and so spiritual full of thoughts et cetera Nothing at all is justified by being What is thought of is as well as what is not thought of the stone in the street is and my notion of it is too Both are only in different spaces the former in airy space the latter in my head in me for I am space like the street The professionals the privileged brook no freedom of thought i e no thoughts that do not come from the Giver of all good be he called God pope church or whatever else If anybody has such illegitimate thoughts he must whisper them into his confessor s ear and have himself chastised by him till the slave whip becomes unendurable to the free thoughts In other ways too the professional spirit takes care that free thoughts shall not come at all first and foremost by a wise education He on whom the principles of morality have been duly inculcated never becomes free again from moralizing thoughts and robbery perjury overreaching and the like remain to him fixed ideas against which no freedom of thought protects him He has his thoughts from above and gets no further It is different with the holders of concessions or patents Every one must be able to have and form thoughts as he will If he has the patent or the concession of a capacity to think he needs no special privilege But as all men are rational it is free to every one to put into his head any thoughts whatever and to the extent of the patent of his natural endowment to have a greater or less wealth of thoughts Now one hears the admonitions that one is to honor all opinions and convictions that every conviction is authorized that one must be tolerant to the views of others et cetera But your thoughts are not my thoughts and your ways are not my ways Or rather I mean the reverse Your thoughts are my thoughts which I dispose of as I will and which I strike down unmercifully they are my property which I annihilate as I list I do not wait for authorization from you first to decompose and blow away your thoughts It does not matter to me that you call these thoughts yours too they remain mine nevertheless and how I will proceed with them is my affair not a usurpation It may please me to leave you in your thoughts then I keep still Do you believe thoughts fly around free like birds so that every one may get himself some which he may then make good against me as his inviolable property What is flying around is all mine Do you believe you have your thoughts for yourselves and need answer to no one for them or as you do also say you have to give an account of them to God only No your great and small thoughts belong to me and I handle them at my pleasure The thought is my own only when I have no misgiving about bringing it in danger of death every moment when I do not have to fear its loss as a loss for me a loss of me The thought is my own only when I can indeed subjugate it but it never can subjugate me never fanaticizes me makes me the tool of its realization So freedom of thought exists when I can have all possible thoughts but the thoughts become property only by not being able to become masters In the time of freedom of thought thoughts ideas rule but if I attain to property in thought they stand as my creatures If the hierarchy had not so penetrated men to the innermost as to take from them all courage to pursue free thoughts i e thoughts perhaps displeasing to God one would have to consider freedom of thought just as empty a word as say a freedom of digestion According to the professionals opinion the thought is given to me according to the freethinkers I seek the thought There the truth is already found and extant only I must receive it from its Giver by grace here the truth is to be sought and is my goal lying in the future toward which I have to run In both cases the truth the true thought lies outside me and I aspire to get it be it by presentation grace be it by earning merit of my own Therefore one The truth is a privilege two No the way to it is patent to all and neither the Bible nor the holy fathers nor the church nor any one else is in possession of the truth but one can come into possession of it by speculating Both one sees are propertyless in relation to the truth they have it either as a fief for the holy father e g is not a unique person as unique he is this Sixtus Clement et cetera but he does not have the truth as Sixtus Clement et cetera but as holy father i e as a spirit or as an ideal As a fief it is only for a few the privileged as an ideal for all the patentees Freedom of thought then has the meaning that we do indeed all walk in the dark and in the paths of error but every one can on this path approach the truth and is accordingly on the right path All roads lead to Rome to the world s end et cetera Hence freedom of thought means this much that the true thought is not my own for if it were this how should people want to shut me off from it Thinking has become entirely free and has laid down a lot of truths which I must accommodate myself to It seeks to complete itself into a system and to bring itself to an absolute constitution In the State e g it seeks for the idea say till it has brought out the rational State in which I am then obliged to be suited in man anthropology till it has found man The thinker is distinguished from the believer only by believing much more than the latter who on his part thinks of much less as signified by his faith creed The thinker has a thousand tenets of faith where the believer gets along with few but the former brings coherence into his tenets and takes the coherence in turn for the scale to estimate their worth by If one or the other does not fit into his budget he throws it out The thinkers run parallel to the believers in their pronouncements Instead of If it is from God you will not root it out the word is If it is from the truth is true et cetera instead of Give God the glory Give truth the glory But it is very much the same to me whether God or the truth wins first and foremost I want to win Aside from this how is an unlimited freedom to be thinkable inside of the State or society The State may well protect one against another but yet it must not let itself be endangered by an unmeasured freedom a so called unbridledness Thus in freedom of instruction the State declares only this that it is suited with every one who instructs as the State or speaking more comprehensibly the political power would have it The point for the competitors is this as the State would have it If the clergy e g does not will as the State does then it itself excludes itself from competition vid France The limit that is necessarily drawn in the State for any and all competition is called the oversight and superintendence of the State In bidding freedom of instruction keep within the due bounds the State at the same time fixes the scope of freedom of thought because as a rule people do not think farther than their teachers have thought Hear Minister Guizot The great difficulty of to day is the guiding and dominating of the mind Formerly the church fulfilled this mission now it is not adequate to it It is from the university that this great service must be expected and the university will not fail to perform it We the government have the duty of supporting it therein The charter calls for the freedom of thought and that of conscience two hundred twenty eight So in favor of freedom of thought and conscience the minister demands the guiding and dominating of the mind Catholicism haled the examinee before the forum of ecclesiasticism Protestantism before that of biblical Christianity It would be but little bettered if one haled him before that of reason as Ruge e g wants to two hundred twenty nine Whether the church the Bible or reason to which moreover Luther and Huss already appealed is the sacred authority makes no difference in essentials The question of our time does not become soluble even when one puts it thus Is anything general authorized or only the individual Is the generality such as State law custom morality et cetera authorized or individuality It becomes soluble for the first time when one no longer asks after an authorization at all and does not carry on a mere fight against privileges A rational freedom of teaching which recognizes only the conscience of reason two hundred thirty does not bring us to the goal we require an egoistic freedom of teaching rather a freedom of teaching for all ownness wherein I become audible and can announce myself unchecked That I make myself audible two hundred thirty one this alone is reason two hundred thirty two be I ever so irrational in my making myself heard and so hearing myself others as well as I myself enjoy me and at the same time consume me What would be gained if as formerly the orthodox I the loyal I the moral I et cetera was free now the rational I should become free Would this be the freedom of me If I am free as rational I then the rational in me or reason is free and this freedom of reason or freedom of the thought was the ideal of the Christian world from of old They wanted to make thinking and as aforesaid faith is also thinking as thinking is faith free the thinkers i e the believers as well as the rational were to be free for the rest freedom was impossible But the freedom of thinkers is the freedom of the children of God and at the same time the most merciless hierarchy or dominion of the thought for I succumb to the thought If thoughts are free I am their slave I have no power over them and am dominated by them But I want to have the thought want to be full of thoughts but at the same time I want to be thoughtless and instead of freedom of thought I preserve for myself thoughtlessness If the point is to have myself understood and to make communications then assuredly I can make use only of human means which are at my command because I am at the same time man And really I have thoughts only as man as I I am at the same time thoughtless two hundred thirty three He who cannot get rid of a thought is so far only man is a thrall of language this human institution this treasury of human thoughts Language or the word tyrannizes hardest over us because it brings up against us a whole army of fixed ideas Just observe yourself in the act of reflection right now and you will find how you make progress only by becoming thoughtless and speechless every moment You are not thoughtless and speechless merely in say sleep but even in the deepest reflection yes precisely then most so And only by this thoughtlessness this unrecognized freedom of thought or freedom from the thought are you your own Only from it do you arrive at putting language to use as your property If thinking is not my thinking it is merely a spun out thought it is slave work or the work of a servant obeying at the word For not a thought but I am the beginning for my thinking and therefore I am its goal too even as its whole course is only a course of my self enjoyment for absolute or free thinking on the other hand thinking itself is the beginning and it plagues itself with propounding this beginning as the extremest abstraction e g as being This very abstraction or this thought is then spun out further Absolute thinking is the affair of the human spirit and this is a holy spirit Hence this thinking is an affair of the parsons who have a sense for it a sense for the highest interests of mankind for the spirit To the believer truths are a settled thing a fact to the freethinker a thing that is still to be settled Be absolute thinking ever so unbelieving its incredulity has its limits and there does remain a belief in the truth in the spirit in the idea and its final victory this thinking does not sin against the holy spirit But all thinking that does not sin against the holy spirit is belief in spirits or ghosts I can as little renounce thinking as feeling the spirit s activity as little as the activity of the senses As feeling is our sense for things so thinking is our sense for essences thoughts Essences have their existence in everything sensuous especially in the word The power of words follows that of things first one is coerced by the rod afterward by conviction The might of things overcomes our courage our spirit against the power of a conviction and so of the word even the rack and the sword lose their overpoweringness and force The men of conviction are the priestly men who resist every enticement of Satan Christianity took away from the things of this world only their irresistibleness made us independent of them In like manner I raise myself above truths and their power as I am supersensual so I am supertrue Before me truths are as common and as indifferent as things they do not carry me away and do not inspire me with enthusiasm There exists not even one truth not right not freedom humanity et cetera that has stability before me and to which I subject myself They are words nothing but words as all things are to the Christian nothing but vain things In words and truths every word is a truth as Hegel asserts that one cannot tell a lie there is no salvation for me as little as there is for the Christian in things and vanities As the riches of this world do not make me happy so neither do its truths It is now no longer Satan but the spirit that plays the story of the temptation and he does not seduce by the things of this world but by its thoughts by the glitter of the idea Along with worldly goods all sacred goods too must be put away as no longer valuable Truths are phrases ways of speaking words Greek logos brought into connection or into an articulate series they form logic science philosophy For thinking and speaking I need truths and words as I do foods for eating without them I cannot think nor speak Truths are men s thoughts set down in words and therefore just as extant as other things although extant only for the mind or for thinking they are human institutions and human creatures and even if they are given out for divine revelations there still remains in them the quality of alienness for me yes as my own creatures they are already alienated from me after the act of creation The Christian man is the man with faith in thinking who believes in the supreme dominion of thoughts and wants to bring thoughts so called principles to dominion Many a one does indeed test the thoughts and chooses none of them for his master without criticism but in this he is like the dog who sniffs at people to smell out his master he is always aiming at the ruling thought The Christian may reform and revolt an infinite deal may demolish the ruling concepts of centuries he will always aspire to a new principle or new master again always set up a higher or deeper truth again always call forth a cult again always proclaim a spirit called to dominion lay down a law for all If there is even one truth only to which man has to devote his life and his powers because he is man then he is subjected to a rule dominion law et cetera he is a servingman It is supposed that e g man humanity liberty et cetera are such truths On the other hand one can say thus Whether you will further occupy yourself with thinking depends on you only know that if in your thinking you would like to make out anything worthy of notice many hard problems are to be solved without vanquishing which you cannot get far There exists therefore no duty and no calling for you to meddle with thoughts ideas truths but if you will do so you will do well to utilize what the forces of others have already achieved toward clearing up these difficult subjects Thus therefore he who will think does assuredly have a task which he consciously or unconsciously sets for himself in willing that but no one has the task of thinking or of believing In the former case it may be said You do not go far enough you have a narrow and biased interest you do not go to the bottom of the thing in short you do not completely subdue it But on the other hand however far you may come at any time you are still always at the end you have no call to step farther and you can have it as you will or as you are able It stands with this as with any other piece of work which you can give up when the humor for it wears off Just so if you can no longer believe a thing you do not have to force yourself into faith or to busy yourself lastingly as if with a sacred truth of the faith as theologians or philosophers do but you can tranquilly draw back your interest from it and let it run Priestly spirits will indeed expound this your lack of interest as laziness thoughtlessness obduracy self deception and the like But do you just let the trumpery lie notwithstanding No thing two hundred thirty four no so called highest interest of mankind no sacred cause two hundred thirty five is worth your serving it and occupying yourself with it for its sake you may seek its worth in this alone whether it is worth anything to you for your sake Become like children the biblical saying admonishes us But children have no sacred interest and know nothing of a good cause They know all the more accurately what they have a fancy for and they think over to the best of their powers how they are to arrive at it Thinking will as little cease as feeling But the power of thoughts and ideas the dominion of theories and principles the sovereignty of the spirit in short the hierarchy lasts as long as the parsons i e theologians philosophers statesmen philistines liberals schoolmasters servants parents children married couples Proudhon George Sand Bluntschli et cetera et cetera have the floor the hierarchy will endure as long as people believe in think of or even criticise principles for even the most inexorable criticism which undermines all current principles still does finally believe in the principle Every one criticises but the criterion is different People run after the right criterion The right criterion is the first presupposition The critic starts from a proposition a truth a belief This is not a creation of the critic but of the dogmatist nay commonly it is actually taken up out of the culture of the time without further ceremony like e g liberty humanity et cetera The critic has not discovered man but this truth has been established as man by the dogmatist and the critic who besides may be the same person with him believes in this truth this article of faith In this faith and possessed by this faith he criticises The secret of criticism is some truth or other this remains its energizing mystery But I distinguish between servile and own criticism If I criticise under the presupposition of a supreme being my criticism serves the being and is carried on for its sake if e g I am possessed by the belief in a free State then everything that has a bearing on it I criticise from the standpoint of whether it is suitable to this State for I love this State if I criticise as a pious man then for me everything falls into the classes of divine and diabolical and before my criticism nature consists of traces of God or traces of the devil hence names like Godsgift Godmount the Devil s Pulpit et cetera men of believers and unbelievers et cetera if I criticise while believing in man as the true essence then for me everything falls primarily into the classes of man and the un man et cetera Criticism has to this day remained a work of love for at all times we exercised it for the love of some being All servile criticism is a product of love a possessedness and proceeds according to that New Testament precept Test everything and hold fast the good two hundred thirty six The good is the touchstone the criterion The good returning under a thousand names and forms remained always the presupposition remained the dogmatic fixed point for this criticism remained the fixed idea The critic in setting to work impartially presupposes the truth and seeks for the truth in the belief that it is to be found He wants to ascertain the true and has in it that very good Presuppose means nothing else than put a thought in front or think something before everything else and think the rest from the starting point of this that has been thought i e measure and criticise it by this In other words this is as much as to say that thinking is to begin with something already thought If thinking began at all instead of being begun if thinking were a subject an acting personality of its own as even the plant is such then indeed there would be no abandoning the principle that thinking must begin with itself But it is just the personification of thinking that brings to pass those innumerable errors In the Hegelian system they always talk as if thinking or the thinking spirit i e personified thinking thinking as a ghost thought and acted in critical liberalism it is always said that criticism does this and that or else that self consciousness finds this and that But if thinking ranks as the personal actor thinking itself must be presupposed if criticism ranks as such a thought must likewise stand in front Thinking and criticism could be active only starting from themselves would have to be themselves the presupposition of their activity as without being they could not be active But thinking as a thing presupposed is a fixed thought a dogma thinking and criticism therefore can start only from a dogma i e from a thought a fixed idea a presupposition With this we come back again to what was enunciated above that Christianity consists in the development of a world of thoughts or that it is the proper freedom of thought the free thought the free spirit The true criticism which I called servile is therefore just as much free criticism for it is not my own The case stands otherwise when what is yours is not made into something that is of itself not personified not made independent an a spirit to itself Your thinking has for a presupposition not thinking but you But thus you do presuppose yourself after all Yes but not for myself but for my thinking Before my thinking there is I From this it follows that my thinking is not preceded by a thought or that my thinking is without a presupposition For the presupposition which I am for my thinking is not one made by thinking not one thought of but it is posited thinking itself it is the owner of the thought and proves only that thinking is nothing more than property i e that an independent thinking a thinking spirit does not exist at all This reversal of the usual way of regarding things might so resemble an empty playing with abstractions that even those against whom it is directed would acquiesce in the harmless aspect I give it if practical consequences were not connected with it To bring these into a concise expression the assertion now made is that man is not the measure of all things but I am this measure The servile critic has before his eye another being an idea which he means to serve therefore he only slays the false idols for his God What is done for the love of this being what else should it be but a work of love But I when I criticise do not even have myself before my eyes but am only doing myself a pleasure amusing myself according to my taste according to my several needs I chew the thing up or only inhale its odor The distinction between the two attitudes will come out still more strikingly if one reflects that the servile critic because love guides him supposes he is serving the thing cause itself The truth or truth in general people are bound not to give up but to seek for What else is it but the etre supreme the highest essence Even true criticism would have to despair if it lost faith in the truth And yet the truth is only a thought but it is not merely a thought but the thought that is above all thoughts the irrefragable thought it is the thought itself which gives the first hallowing to all others it is the consecration of thoughts the absolute the sacred thought The truth wears longer than all the gods for it is only in the truth s service and for love of it that people have overthrown the gods and at last God himself The truth outlasts the downfall of the world of gods for it is the immortal soul of this transitory world of gods it is Deity itself I will answer Pilate s question What is truth Truth is the free thought the free idea the free spirit truth is what is free from you what is not your own what is not in your power But truth is also the completely unindependent impersonal unreal and incorporeal truth cannot step forward as you do cannot move change develop truth awaits and receives everything from you and itself is only through you for it exists only in your head You concede that the truth is a thought but say that not every thought is a true one or as you are also likely to express it not every thought is truly and really a thought And by what do you measure and recognize the thought By your impotence to wit by your being no longer able to make any successful assault on it When it overpowers you inspires you and carries you away then you hold it to be the true one Its dominion over you certifies to you its truth and when it possesses you and you are possessed by it then you feel well with it for then you have found your lord and master When you were seeking the truth what did your heart then long for For your master You did not aspire to your might but to a Mighty One and wanted to exalt a Mighty One Exalt ye the Lord our God The truth my dear Pilate is the Lord and all who seek the truth are seeking and praising the Lord Where does the Lord exist Where else but in your head He is only spirit and wherever you believe you really see him there he is a ghost for the Lord is merely something that is thought of and it was only the Christian pains and agony to make the invisible visible the spiritual corporeal that generated the ghost and was the frightful misery of the belief in ghosts As long as you believe in the truth you do not believe in yourself and you are a servant a religious man You alone are the truth or rather you are more than the truth which is nothing at all before you You too do assuredly ask about the truth you too do assuredly criticise but you do not ask about a higher truth to wit one that should be higher than you nor criticise according to the criterion of such a truth You address yourself to thoughts and notions as you do to the appearances of things only for the purpose of making them palatable to you enjoyable to you and your own you want only to subdue them and become their owner you want to orient yourself and feel at home in them and you find them true or see them in their true light when they can no longer slip away from you no longer have any unseized or uncomprehended place or when they are right for you when they are your property If afterward they become heavier again if they wriggle themselves out of your power again then that is just their untruth to wit your impotence Your impotence is their power your humility their exaltation Their truth therefore is you or is the nothing which you are for them and in which they dissolve their truth is their nothingness Only as the property of me do the spirits the truths get to rest and they then for the first time really are when they have been deprived of their sorry existence and made a property of mine when it is no longer said the truth develops itself rules asserts itself history also a concept wins the victory and the like The truth never has won a victory but was always my means to the victory like the sword the sword of truth The truth is dead a letter a word a material that I can use up All truth by itself is dead a corpse it is alive only in the same way as my lungs are alive to wit in the measure of my own vitality Truths are material like vegetables and weeds as to whether vegetable or weed the decision lies in me Objects are to me only material that I use up Wherever I put my hand I grasp a truth which I trim for myself The truth is certain to me and I do not need to long after it To do the truth a service is in no case my intent it is to me only a nourishment for my thinking head as potatoes are for my digesting stomach or as a friend is for my social heart As long as I have the humor and force for thinking every truth serves me only for me to work it up according to my powers As reality or worldliness is vain and a thing of naught for Christians so is the truth for me It exists exactly as much as the things of this world go on existing although the Christian has proved their nothingness but it is vain because it has its value not in itself but in me Of itself it is valueless The truth is a creature As you produce innumerable things by your activity yes shape the earth s surface anew and set up works of men everywhere so too you may still ascertain numberless truths by your thinking and we will gladly take delight in them Nevertheless as I do not please to hand myself over to serve your newly discovered machines mechanically but only help to set them running for my benefit so too I will only use your truths without letting myself be used for their demands All truths beneath me are to my liking a truth above me a truth that I should have to direct myself by I am not acquainted with For me there is no truth for nothing is more than I Not even my essence not even the essence of man is more than I than I this drop in the bucket this insignificant man You believe that you have done the utmost when you boldly assert that because every time has its own truth there is no absolute truth Why with this you nevertheless still leave to each time its truth and you quite genuinely create an absolute truth a truth that no time lacks because every time however its truth may be still has a truth Is it meant only that people have been thinking in every time and so have had thoughts or truths and that in the subsequent time these were other than they were in the earlier No the word is to be that every time had its truth of faith and in fact none has yet appeared in which a higher truth has not been recognized a truth that people believed they must subject themselves to as highness and majesty Every truth of a time is its fixed idea and if people later found another truth this always happened only because they sought for another they only reformed the folly and put a modern dress on it For they did want who would dare doubt their justification for this they wanted to be inspired by an idea They wanted to be dominated possessed by a thought The most modern ruler of this kind is our essence or man For all free criticism a thought was the criterion for own criticism I am I the unspeakable and so not the merely thought of for what is merely thought of is always speakable because word and thought coincide That is true which is mine untrue that whose own I am true e g the union untrue the State and society Free and true criticism takes care for the consistent dominion of a thought an idea a spirit own criticism for nothing but my self enjoyment But in this the latter is in fact and we will not spare it this ignominy like the bestial criticism of instinct I like the criticising beast am concerned only for myself not for the cause I am the criterion of truth but I am not an idea but more than idea i e unutterable My criticism is not a free criticism not free from me and not servile not in the service of an idea but an own criticism True or human criticism makes out only whether something is suitable to man to the true man but by own criticism you ascertain whether it is suitable to you Free criticism busies itself with ideas and therefore is always theoretical However it may rage against ideas it still does not get clear of them It pitches into the ghosts but it can do this only as it holds them to be ghosts The ideas it has to do with do not fully disappear the morning breeze of a new day does not scare them away The critic may indeed come to ataraxy before ideas but he never gets rid of them i e he will never comprehend that above the bodily man there does not exist something higher to wit liberty his humanity et cetera He always has a calling of man still left humanity And this idea of humanity remains unrealized just because it is an idea and is to remain such If on the other hand I grasp the idea as my idea then it is already realized because I am its reality its reality consists in the fact that I the bodily have it They say the idea of liberty realizes itself in the history of the world The reverse is the case this idea is real as a man thinks it and it is real in the measure in which it is idea i e in which I think it or have it It is not the idea of liberty that develops itself but men develop themselves and of course in this self development develop their thinking too In short the critic is not yet owner because he still fights with ideas as with powerful aliens as the Christian is not owner of his bad desires so long as he has to combat them for him who contends against vice vice exists Criticism remains stuck fast in the freedom of knowing the freedom of the spirit and the spirit gains its proper freedom when it fills itself with the pure true idea this is the freedom of thinking which cannot be without thoughts Criticism smites one idea only by another e g that of privilege by that of manhood or that of egoism by that of unselfishness In general the beginning of Christianity comes on the stage again in its critical end egoism being combated here as there I am not to make myself the individual count but the idea the general Why warfare of the priesthood with egoism of the spiritually minded with the worldly minded constitutes the substance of all Christian history In the newest criticism this war only becomes all embracing fanaticism complete Indeed neither can it pass away till it passes thus after it has had its life and its rage out Whether what I think and do is Christian what do I care Whether it is human liberal humane whether unhuman illiberal inhuman what do I ask about that If only it accomplishes what I want if only I satisfy myself in it then overlay it with predicates as you will it is all alike to me Perhaps I too in the very next moment defend myself against my former thoughts I too am likely to change suddenly my mode of action but not on account of its not corresponding to Christianity not on account of its running counter to the eternal rights of man not on account of its affronting the idea of mankind humanity and humanitarianism but because I am no longer all in it because it no longer furnishes me any full enjoyment because I doubt the earlier thought or no longer please myself in the mode of action just now practised As the world as property has become a material with which I undertake what I will so the spirit too as property must sink down into a material before which I no longer entertain any sacred dread Then firstly I shall shudder no more before a thought let it appear as presumptuous and devilish as it will because if it threatens to become too inconvenient and unsatisfactory for me its end lies in my power but neither shall I recoil from any deed because there dwells in it a spirit of godlessness immorality wrongfulness as little as saint Boniface pleased to desist through religious scrupulousness from cutting down the sacred oak of the heathens If the things of the world have once become vain the thoughts of the spirit must also become vain No thought is sacred for let no thought rank as devotions two hundred thirty seven no feeling is sacred no sacred feeling of friendship mother s feelings et cetera no belief is sacred They are all alienable my alienable property and are annihilated as they are created by me The Christian can lose all things or objects the most loved persons these objects of his love without giving up himself i e in the Christian sense his spirit his soul as lost The owner can cast from him all the thoughts that were dear to his heart and kindled his zeal and will likewise gain a thousandfold again because he their creator remains Unconsciously and involuntarily we all strive toward ownness and there will hardly be one among us who has not given up a sacred feeling a sacred thought a sacred belief nay we probably meet no one who could not still deliver himself from one or another of his sacred thoughts All our contention against convictions starts from the opinion that maybe we are capable of driving our opponent out of his intrenchments of thought But what I do unconsciously I half do and therefore after every victory over a faith I become again the prisoner possessed of a faith which then takes my whole self anew into its service and makes me an enthusiast for reason after I have ceased to be enthusiastic for the Bible or an enthusiast for the idea of humanity after I have fought long enough for that of Christianity Doubtless as owner of thoughts I shall cover my property with my shield just as I do not as owner of things willingly let everybody help himself to them but at the same time I shall look forward smilingly to the outcome of the battle smilingly lay the shield on the corpses of my thoughts and my faith smilingly triumph when I am beaten That is the very humor of the thing Every one who has sublimer feelings is able to vent his humor on the pettinesses of men but to let it play with all great thoughts sublime feelings noble inspiration and sacred faith presupposes that I am the owner of all If religion has set up the proposition that we are sinners altogether I set over against it the other we are perfect altogether For we are every moment all that we can be and we never need be more Since no defect cleaves to us sin has no meaning either Show me a sinner in the world still if no one any longer needs to do what suits a superior If I only need do what suits myself I am no sinner if I do not do what suits myself as I do not injure in myself a holy one if on the other hand I am to be pious then I must do what suits God if I am to act humanly I must do what suits the essence of man the idea of mankind et cetera What religion calls the sinner humanitarianism calls the egoist But once more if I need not do what suits any other is the egoist in whom humanitarianism has borne to itself a new fangled devil anything more than a piece of nonsense The egoist before whom the humane shudder is a spook as much as the devil is he exists only as a bogie and phantasm in their brain If they were not unsophisticatedly drifting back and forth in the antediluvian opposition of good and evil to which they have given the modern names of human and egoistic they would not have freshened up the hoary sinner into an egoist either and put a new patch on an old garment But they could not do otherwise for they hold it for their task to be men They are rid of the Good One good is left two hundred thirty eight We are perfect altogether and on the whole earth there is not one man who is a sinner There are crazy people who imagine that they are God the Father God the Son or the man in the moon and so too the world swarms with fools who seem to themselves to be sinners but as the former are not the man in the moon so the latter are not sinners Their sin is imaginary Yet it is insidiously objected their craziness or their possessedness is at least their sin Their possessedness is nothing but what they could achieve the result of their development just as Luther s faith in the Bible was all that he was competent to make out The one brings himself into the madhouse with his development the other brings himself therewith into the Pantheon and to the loss of Valhalla There is no sinner and no sinful egoism Get away from me with your philanthropy Creep in you philanthropist into the dens of vice linger awhile in the throng of the great city will you not everywhere find sin and sin and again sin Will you not wail over corrupt humanity not lament at the monstrous egoism Will you see a rich man without finding him pitiless and egoistic Perhaps you already call yourself an atheist but you remain true to the Christian feeling that a camel will sooner go through a needle s eye than a rich man not be an un man How many do you see anyhow that you would not throw into the egoistic mass What therefore has your philanthropy love of man found Nothing but unlovable men And where do they all come from From you from your philanthropy You brought the sinner with you in your head therefore you found him therefore you inserted him everywhere Do not call men sinners and they are not you alone are the creator of sinners you who fancy that you love men are the very one to throw them into the mire of sin the very one to divide them into vicious and virtuous into men and un men the very one to befoul them with the slaver of your possessedness for you love not men but man But I tell you you have never seen a sinner you have only dreamed of him Self enjoyment is embittered to me by my thinking I must serve another by my fancying myself under obligation to him by my holding myself called to self sacrifice resignation enthusiasm All right if I no longer serve any idea any higher essence then it is clear of itself that I no longer serve any man either but under all circumstances myself But thus I am not merely in fact or in being but also for my consciousness the unique two hundred thirty nine There pertains to you more than the divine the human et cetera yours pertains to you Look upon yourself as more powerful than they give you out for and you have more power look upon yourself as more and you have more You are then not merely called to everything divine entitled to everything human but owner of what is yours i e of all that you possess the force to make your own two hundred forty i e you are appropriate two hundred forty one and capacitated for everything that is yours People have always supposed that they must give me a destiny lying outside myself so that at last they demanded that I should lay claim to the human because I am man This is the Christian magic circle Fichte s ego too is the same essence outside me for every one is ego and if only this ego has rights then it is the ego it is not I But I am not an ego along with other egos but the sole ego I am unique Hence my wants too are unique and my deeds in short everything about me is unique And it is only as this unique I that I take everything for my own as I set myself to work and develop myself only as this I do not develop man nor as man but as I I develop myself This is the meaning of the unique one III THE UNIQUE ONE Pre Christian and Christian times pursue opposite goals the former wants to idealize the real the latter to realize the ideal the former seeks the holy spirit the latter the glorified body Hence the former closes with insensitiveness to the real with contempt for the world the latter will end with the casting off of the ideal with contempt for the spirit The opposition of the real and the ideal is an irreconcilable one and the one can never become the other if the ideal became the real it would no longer be the ideal and if the real became the ideal the ideal alone would be but not at all the real The opposition of the two is not to be vanquished otherwise than if some one annihilates both Only in this some one the third party does the opposition find its end otherwise idea and reality will ever fail to coincide The idea cannot be so realized as to remain idea but is realized only when it dies as idea and it is the same with the real But now we have before us in the ancients adherents of the idea in the moderns adherents of reality Neither can get clear of the opposition and both pine only the one party for the spirit and when this craving of the ancient world seemed to be satisfied and this spirit to have come the others immediately for the secularization of this spirit again which must forever remain a pious wish The pious wish of the ancients was sanctity the pious wish of the moderns is corporeity But as antiquity had to go down if its longing was to be satisfied for it consisted only in the longing so too corporeity can never be attained within the ring of Christianness As the trait of sanctification or purification goes through the old world the washings et cetera so that of incorporation goes through the Christian world God plunges down into this world becomes flesh and wants to redeem it i e fill it with himself but since he is the idea or the spirit people e g Hegel in the end introduce the idea into everything into the world and prove that the idea is that reason is in everything Man corresponds in the culture of to day to what the heathen Stoics set up as the wise man the latter like the former a fleshless being The unreal wise man this bodiless holy one of the Stoics became a real person a bodily Holy One in God made flesh the unreal man the bodiless ego will become real in the corporeal ego in me There winds its way through Christianity the question about the existence of God which taken up ever and ever again gives testimony that the craving for existence corporeity personality reality was incessantly busying the heart because it never found a satisfying solution At last the question about the existence of God fell but only to rise up again in the proposition that the divine had existence Feuerbach But this too has no existence and neither will the last refuge that the purely human is realizable afford shelter much longer No idea has existence for none is capable of corporeity The scholastic contention of realism and nominalism has the same content in short this spins itself out through all Christian history and cannot end in it The world of Christians is working at realizing ideas in the individual relations of life the institutions and laws of the Church and the State but they make resistance and always keep back something unembodied unrealizable Nevertheless this embodiment is restlessly rushed after no matter in what degree corporeity constantly fails to result For realities matter little to the realizer but it matters everything that they be realizations of the idea Hence he is ever examining anew whether the realized does in truth have the idea its kernel dwelling in it and in testing the real he at the same time tests the idea whether it is realizable as he thinks it or is only thought by him incorrectly and for that reason unfeasibly The Christian is no longer to care for family State et cetera as existences Christians are not to sacrifice themselves for these divine things like the ancients but these are only to be utilized to make the spirit alive in them The real family has become indifferent and there is to arise out of it an ideal one which would then be the truly real a sacred family blessed by God or according to the liberal way of thinking a rational family With the ancients family State fatherland et cetera is divine as a thing extant with the moderns it is still awaiting divinity as extant it is only sinful earthly and has still to be redeemed i e to become truly real This has the following meaning The family et cetera is not the extant and real but the divine the idea is extant and real whether this family will make itself real by taking up the truly real the idea is still unsettled It is not the individual s task to serve the family as the divine but reversely to serve the divine and to bring to it the still undivine family i e to subject everything in the idea s name to set up the idea s banner everywhere to bring the idea to real efficacy But since the concern of Christianity as of antiquity is for the divine they always come out at this again on their opposite ways At the end of heathenism the divine becomes the extramundane at the end of Christianity the intramundane Antiquity does not succeed in putting it entirely outside the world and when Christianity accomplishes this task the divine instantly longs to get back into the world and wants to redeem the world But within Christianity it does not and cannot come to this that the divine as intramundane should really become the mundane itself there is enough left that does and must maintain itself unpenetrated as the bad irrational accidental egoistic the mundane in the bad sense Christianity begins with God s becoming man and carries on its work of conversion and redemption through all time in order to prepare for God a reception in all men and in everything human and to penetrate everything with the spirit it sticks to preparing a place for the spirit When the accent was at last laid on Man or mankind it was again the idea that they pronounced eternal Man does not die They thought they had now found the reality of the idea Man is the I of history of the world s history it is he this ideal that really develops i e realizes himself He is the really real and corporeal one for history is his body in which individuals are only members Christ is the I of the world s history even of the pre Christian in modern apprehension it is man the figure of Christ has developed into the figure of man man as such man absolutely is the central point of history In man the imaginary beginning returns again for man is as imaginary as Christ is Man as the I of the world s history closes the cycle of Christian apprehensions Christianity s magic circle would be broken if the strained relation between existence and calling i e between me as I am and me as I should be ceased it persists only as the longing of the idea for its bodiliness and vanishes with the relaxing separation of the two only when the idea remains idea as man or mankind is indeed a bodiless idea is Christianity still extant The corporeal idea the corporeal or completed spirit floats before the Christian as the end of the days or as the goal of history it is not present time to him The individual can only have a part in the founding of the Kingdom of God or according to the modern notion of the same thing in the development and history of humanity and only so far as he has a part in it does a Christian or according to the modern expression human value pertain to him for the rest he is dust and a worm bag That the individual is of himself a world s history and possesses his property in the rest of the world s history goes beyond what is Christian To the Christian the world s history is the higher thing because it is the history of Christ or man to the egoist only his history has value because he wants to develop only himself not the mankind idea not God s plan not the purposes of Providence not liberty and the like He does not look upon himself as a tool of the idea or a vessel of God he recognizes no calling he does not fancy that he exists for the further development of mankind and that he must contribute his mite to it but he lives himself out careless of how well or ill humanity may fare thereby If it were not open to confusion with the idea that a state of nature is to be praised one might recall Lenau s Three Gypsies What am I in the world to realize ideas To do my part by my citizenship say toward the realization of the idea State or by marriage as husband and father to bring the idea of the family into an existence What does such a calling concern me I live after a calling as little as the flower grows and gives fragrance after a calling The ideal Man is realized when the Christian apprehension turns about and becomes the proposition I this unique one am man The conceptual question what is man has then changed into the personal question who is man With what the concept was sought for in order to realize it with who it is no longer any question at all but the answer is personally on hand at once in the asker the question answers itself They say of God Names name thee not That holds good of me no concept expresses me nothing that is designated as my essence exhausts me they are only names Likewise they say of God that he is perfect and has no calling to strive after perfection That too holds good of me alone I am owner of my might and I am so when I know myself as unique In the unique one the owner himself returns into his creative nothing out of which he is born Every higher essence above me be it God be it man weakens the feeling of my uniqueness and pales only before the sun of this consciousness If I concern myself for myself two hundred forty two the unique one then my concern rests on its transitory mortal creator who consumes himself and I may say All things are nothing to me two hundred forty three THE END INDEX The following index to this translation of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum is intended to help one after reading the book to find a passage which he remembers It is not a concordance to aid in analytical study Hence the designations of the matter referred to are in a form intended to be recognized by the person who remembers the passage I have generally preferred so far as convenience permitted to use the words of the text itself being confident that a description of the subject matter in words more appropriate to the summary form of the index would never help any person to find his passage If the designations are recognizable I have permitted them to be rough Of necessity the index has been made hastily and I hereby confess it to be guilty of all the faults that an index can possess though I hope that the page numbers will prove to be accurate The faults that I am most ashamed of are the incompleteness which usually omits the shorter occurrences of a given word or idea and the indefiniteness of the ff which does not tell the reader how far the reference extends It has actually not been in my power to avoid either of these faults and I hope they will not prevent the index from being of very considerable use to those who pay continued attention to the book These two faults will be found least noticeable in the references to proper names and quotations therefore the reader who wants to find a passage will do best to remember if possible a conspicuous proper name or a quotation whose source is known perhaps oftenest from the Bible and look up his passage by that In the indexing of quotations however I have omitted anonymous proverbs lines of German hymns and quotations of whose authorship I was whether pardonably or unpardonably ignorant The abbreviations are ftn footnote f and next page ff and following pages S T B Age coming of
