Proofreading Team BULFINCH S MYTHOLOGY THE AGE OF FABLE THE AGE OF CHIVALRY LEGENDS OF CHARLEMAGNE BY THOMAS BULFINCH COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME Editor s Note The etext contains only THE AGE OF CHIVALRY PUBLISHERS PREFACE No new edition of Bulfinch s classic work can be considered complete without some notice of the American scholar to whose wide erudition and painstaking care it stands as a perpetual monument The Age of Fable has come to be ranked with older books like Pilgrim s Progress Gulliver s Travels The Arabian Nights Robinson Crusoe and five or six other productions of world wide renown as a work with which every one must claim some acquaintance before his education can be called really complete Many readers of the present edition will probably recall coming in contact with the work as children and it may be added will no doubt discover from a fresh perusal the source of numerous bits of knowledge that have remained stored in their minds since those early years Yet to the majority of this great circle of readers and students the name Bulfinch in itself has no significance Thomas Bulfinch was a native of Boston Mass where he was born in seventeen ninety six His boyhood was spent in that city and he prepared for college in the Boston schools He finished his scholastic training at Harvard College and after taking his degree was for a period a teacher in his home city For a long time later in life he was employed as an accountant in the Boston Merchants Bank His leisure time he used for further pursuit of the classical studies which he had begun at Harvard and his chief pleasure in life lay in writing out the results of his reading in simple condensed form for young or busy readers The plan he followed in this work to give it the greatest possible usefulness is set forth in the Author s Preface Age of Fable First Edition eighteen fifty five The Age of Chivalry eighteen fifty eight The Boy Inventor eighteen sixty Legends of Charlemagne or Romance of the Middle Ages eighteen sixty three Poetry of the Age of Fable eighteen sixty three Oregon and Eldorado or Romance of the Rivers eighteen sixty In this complete edition of his mythological and legendary lore The Age of Fable The Age of Chivalry and Legends of Charlemagne are included Scrupulous care has been taken to follow the original text of Bulfinch but attention should be called to some additional sections which have been inserted to add to the rounded completeness of the work and which the publishers believe would meet with the sanction of the author himself as in no way intruding upon his original plan but simply carrying it out in more complete detail The section on Northern Mythology has been enlarged by a retelling of the epic of the Nibelungen Lied together with a summary of Wagner s version of the legend in his series of music dramas Under the head of Hero Myths of the British Race have been included outlines of the stories of Beowulf Cuchulain Hereward the Wake and Robin Hood Of the verse extracts which occur throughout the text thirty or more have been added from literature which has appeared since Bulfinch s time extracts that he would have been likely to quote had he personally supervised the new edition Finally the index has been thoroughly overhauled and indeed remade All the proper names in the work have been entered with references to the pages where they occur and a concise explanation or definition of each has been given Thus what was a mere list of names in the original has been enlarged into a small classical and mythological dictionary which it is hoped will prove valuable for reference purposes not necessarily connected with The Age of Fable Acknowledgments are due the writings of doctor Oliver Huckel for information on the point of Wagner s rendering of the Nibelungen legend and M I Ebbutt s authoritative volume on Hero Myths and Legends of the British Race from which much of the information concerning the British heroes has been obtained AUTHOR S PREFACE If no other knowledge deserves to be called useful but that which helps to enlarge our possessions or to raise our station in society then Mythology has no claim to the appellation But if that which tends to make us happier and better can be called useful then we claim that epithet for our subject For Mythology is the handmaid of literature and literature is one of the best allies of virtue and promoters of happiness Without a knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated When Byron calls Rome the Niobe of nations or says of Venice She looks a Sea Cybele fresh from ocean he calls up to the mind of one familiar with our subject illustrations more vivid and striking than the pencil could furnish but which are lost to the reader ignorant of mythology Milton abounds in similar allusions The short poem Comus contains more than thirty such and the ode On the Morning of the Nativity half as many Through Paradise Lost they are scattered profusely This is one reason why we often hear persons by no means illiterate say that they cannot enjoy Milton But were these persons to add to their more solid acquirements the easy learning of this little volume much of the poetry of Milton which has appeared to them harsh and crabbed would be found musical as is Apollo s lute Our citations taken from more than twenty five poets from Spenser to Longfellow will show how general has been the practice of borrowing illustrations from mythology The prose writers also avail themselves of the same source of elegant and suggestive illustration One can hardly take up a number of the Edinburgh or Quarterly Review without meeting with instances In Macaulay s article on Milton there are twenty such But how is mythology to be taught to one who does not learn it through the medium of the languages of Greece and Rome To devote study to a species of learning which relates wholly to false marvels and obsolete faiths is not to be expected of the general reader in a practical age like this The time even of the young is claimed by so many sciences of facts and things that little can be spared for set treatises on a science of mere fancy But may not the requisite knowledge of the subject be acquired by reading the ancient poets in translations We reply the field is too extensive for a preparatory course and these very translations require some previous knowledge of the subject to make them intelligible Let any one who doubts it read the first page of the Aeneid and see what he can make of the hatred of Juno the decree of the Parcae the judgment of Paris and the honors of Ganymede without this knowledge Shall we be told that answers to such queries may be found in notes or by a reference to the Classical Dictionary We reply the interruption of one s reading by either process is so annoying that most readers prefer to let an allusion pass unapprehended rather than submit to it Moreover such sources give us only the dry facts without any of the charm of the original narrative and what is a poetical myth when stripped of its poetry The story of Ceyx and Halcyone which fills a chapter in our book occupies but eight lines in the best Smith s Classical Dictionary and so of others Our work is an attempt to solve this problem by telling the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement We have endeavored to tell them correctly according to the ancient authorities so that when the reader finds them referred to he may not be at a loss to recognize the reference Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study but as a relaxation from study to give our work the charm of a story book yet by means of it to impart a knowledge of an important branch of education The index at the end will adapt it to the purposes of reference and make it a Classical Dictionary for the parlor Most of the classical legends in Stories of Gods and Heroes are derived from Ovid and Virgil They are not literally translated for in the author s opinion poetry translated into literal prose is very unattractive reading Neither are they in verse as well for other reasons as from a conviction that to translate faithfully under all the embarrassments of rhyme and measure is impossible The attempt has been made to tell the stories in prose preserving so much of the poetry as resides in the thoughts and is separable from the language itself and omitting those amplifications which are not suited to the altered form The Northern mythological stories are copied with some abridgment from Mallet s Northern Antiquities These chapters with those on Oriental and Egyptian mythology seemed necessary to complete the subject though it is believed these topics have not usually been presented in the same volume with the classical fables The poetical citations so freely introduced are expected to answer several valuable purposes They will tend to fix in memory the leading fact of each story they will help to the attainment of a correct pronunciation of the proper names and they will enrich the memory with many gems of poetry some of them such as are most frequently quoted or alluded to in reading and conversation Having chosen mythology as connected with literature for our province we have endeavored to omit nothing which the reader of elegant literature is likely to find occasion for Such stories and parts of stories as are offensive to pure taste and good morals are not given But such stories are not often referred to and if they occasionally should be the English reader need feel no mortification in confessing his ignorance of them Our work is not for the learned nor for the theologian nor for the philosopher but for the reader of English literature of either sex who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers lecturers essayists and poets and those which occur in polite conversation In the Stories of Gods and Heroes the compiler has endeavored to impart the pleasures of classical learning to the English reader by presenting the stories of Pagan mythology in a form adapted to modern taste In King Arthur and His Knights and The Mabinogeon the attempt has been made to treat in the same way the stories of the second age of fable the age which witnessed the dawn of the several states of Modern Europe It is believed that this presentation of a literature which held unrivalled sway over the imaginations of our ancestors for many centuries will not be without benefit to the reader in addition to the amusement it may afford The tales though not to be trusted for their facts are worthy of all credit as pictures of manners and it is beginning to be held that the manners and modes of thinking of an age are a more important part of its history than the conflicts of its peoples generally leading to no result Besides this the literature of romance is a treasure house of poetical material to which modern poets frequently resort The Italian poets Dante and Ariosto the English Spenser Scott and Tennyson and our own Longfellow and Lowell are examples of this These legends are so connected with each other so consistently adapted to a group of characters strongly individualized in Arthur Launcelot and their compeers and so lighted up by the fires of imagination and invention that they seem as well adapted to the poet s purpose as the legends of the Greek and Roman mythology And if every well educated young person is expected to know the story of the Golden Fleece why is the quest of the Sangreal less worthy of his acquaintance Or if an allusion to the shield of Achilles ought not to pass unapprehended why should one to Excalibar the famous sword of Arthur Of Arthur who to upper light restored With that terrific sword Which yet he brandishes for future war Shall lift his country s fame above the polar star Footnote Wordsworth It is an additional recommendation of our subject that it tends to cherish in our minds the idea of the source from which we sprung We are entitled to our full share in the glories and recollections of the land of our forefathers down to the time of colonization thence The associations which spring from this source must be fruitful of good influences among which not the least valuable is the increased enjoyment which such associations afford to the American traveller when he visits England and sets his foot upon any of her renowned localities The legends of Charlemagne and his peers are necessary to complete the subject In an age when intellectual darkness enveloped Western Europe a constellation of brilliant writers arose in Italy Of these Pulci born in fourteen thirty two Boiardo fourteen thirty four and Ariosto fourteen seventy four took for their subjects the romantic fables which had for many ages been transmitted in the lays of bards and the legends of monkish chroniclers These fables they arranged in order adorned with the embellishments of fancy amplified from their own invention and stamped with immortality It may safely be asserted that as long as civilization shall endure these productions will retain their place among the most cherished creations of human genius In Stories of Gods and Heroes King Arthur and His Knights and The Mabinogeon the aim has been to supply to the modern reader such knowledge of the fables of classical and mediaeval literature as is needed to render intelligible the allusions which occur in reading and conversation The Legends of Charlemagne is intended to carry out the same design Like the earlier portions of the work it aspires to a higher character than that of a piece of mere amusement It claims to be useful in acquainting its readers with the subjects of the productions of the great poets of Italy Some knowledge of these is expected of every well educated young person In reading these romances we cannot fail to observe how the primitive inventions have been used again and again by successive generations of fabulists The Siren of Ulysses is the prototype of the Siren of Orlando and the character of Circe reappears in Alcina The fountains of Love and Hatred may be traced to the story of Cupid and Psyche and similar effects produced by a magic draught appear in the tale of Tristram and Isoude and substituting a flower for the draught in Shakspeare s Midsummer Night s Dream There are many other instances of the same kind which the reader will recognize without our assistance The sources whence we derive these stories are first the Italian poets named above next the Romans de Chevalerie of the Comte de Tressan lastly certain German collections of popular tales Some chapters have been borrowed from Leigh Hunt s Translations from the Italian Poets It seemed unnecessary to do over again what he had already done so well yet on the other hand those stories could not be omitted from the series without leaving it incomplete THOMAS BULFINCH CONTENTS KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS I Introduction II The Mythical History of England III Merlin IV Arthur V Arthur Continued VI Sir Gawain VII

Champion of Ireland Hereward the Wake Robin Hood GLOSSARY KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION On the decline of the Roman power about five centuries after Christ the countries of Northern Europe were left almost destitute of a national government Numerous chiefs more or less powerful held local sway as far as each could enforce his dominion and occasionally those chiefs would unite for a common object but in ordinary times they were much more likely to be found in hostility to one another In such a state of things the rights of the humbler classes of society were at the mercy of every assailant and it is plain that without some check upon the lawless power of the chiefs society must have relapsed into barbarism Such checks were found first in the rivalry of the chiefs themselves whose mutual jealousy made them restraints upon one another secondly in the influence of the Church which by every motive pure or selfish was pledged to interpose for the protection of the weak and lastly in the generosity and sense of right which however crushed under the weight of passion and selfishness dwell naturally in the heart of man From this last source sprang Chivalry which framed an ideal of the heroic character combining invincible strength and valor justice modesty loyalty to superiors courtesy to equals compassion to weakness and devotedness to the Church an ideal which if never met with in real life was acknowledged by all as the highest model for emulation The word Chivalry is derived from the French cheval a horse The word knight which originally meant boy or servant was particularly applied to a young man after he was admitted to the privilege of bearing arms This privilege was conferred on youths of family and fortune only for the mass of the people were not furnished with arms The knight then was a mounted warrior a man of rank or in the service and maintenance of some man of rank generally possessing some independent means of support but often relying mainly on the gratitude of those whom he served for the supply of his wants and often no doubt resorting to the means which power confers on its possessor In time of war the knight was with his followers in the camp of his sovereign or commanding in the field or holding some castle for him In time of peace he was often in attendance at his sovereign s court gracing with his presence the banquets and tournaments with which princes cheered their leisure Or he was traversing the country in quest of adventure professedly bent on redressing wrongs and enforcing rights sometimes in fulfilment of some vow of religion or of love These wandering knights were called knights errant they were welcome guests in the castles of the nobility for their presence enlivened the dulness of those secluded abodes and they were received with honor at the abbeys which often owed the best part of their revenues to the patronage of the knights but if no castle or abbey or hermitage were at hand their hardy habits made it not intolerable to them to lie down supperless at the foot of some wayside cross and pass the night It is evident that the justice administered by such an instrumentality must have been of the rudest description The force whose legitimate purpose was to redress wrongs might easily be perverted to inflict them Accordingly we find in the romances which however fabulous in facts are true as pictures of manners that a knightly castle was often a terror to the surrounding country that is dungeons were full of oppressed knights and ladies waiting for some champion to appear to set them free or to be ransomed with money that hosts of idle retainers were ever at hand to enforce their lord s behests regardless of law and justice and that the rights of the unarmed multitude were of no account This contrariety of fact and theory in regard to chivalry will account for the opposite impressions which exist in men s minds respecting it While it has been the theme of the most fervid eulogium on the one part it has been as eagerly denounced on the other On a cool estimate we cannot but see reason to congratulate ourselves that it has given way in modern times to the reign of law and that the civil magistrate if less picturesque has taken the place of the mailed champion THE TRAINING OF A KNIGHT The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father s house to the court or castle of their future patron and placed under the care of a governor who taught them the first articles of religion and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court They were called pages valets or varlets and their office was to carve to wait at table and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers that is in hunting falconry and fishing and in wrestling tilting with spears and performing other military exercises on horseback At fourteen the page became an esquire and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises To vault on a horse in heavy armor to run to scale walls and spring over ditches under the same encumbrance to wrestle to wield the battle axe for a length of time without raising the visor or taking breath to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood which was usually conferred at twenty one years of age when the young man s education was supposed to be completed In the meantime the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex and the page was encouraged at a very early age to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments words and actions The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight and her smiles bestowed at once by affection and gratitude were held out as the recompense of his well directed valor Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love and the order of knighthood endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn After undergoing a severe fast and spending whole nights in prayer the candidate confessed and received the sacrament He then clothed himself in snow white garments and repaired to the church or the hall where the ceremony was to take place bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck which the officiating priest took and blessed and then returned to him The candidate then with folded arms knelt before the presiding knight who after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission administered to him the oaths and granted his request Some of the knights present sometimes even ladies and damsels handed to him in succession the spurs the coat of mail the hauberk the armlet and gauntlet and lastly he girded on the sword He then knelt again before the president who rising from his seat gave him the accolade which consisted of three strokes with the flat of a sword on the shoulder or neck of the candidate accompanied by the words In the name of God of saint Michael and saint George I make thee a knight be valiant courteous and loyal Then he received his helmet his shield and spear and thus the investiture ended FREEMEN VILLAINS SERFS AND CLERKS The other classes of which society was composed were first FREEMEN owners of small portions of land independent though they sometimes voluntarily became the vassals of their more opulent neighbors whose power was necessary for their protection The other two classes which were much the most numerous were either serfs or villains both of which were slaves The SERFS were in the lowest state of slavery All the fruits of their labor belonged to the master whose land they tilled and by whom they were fed and clothed The VILLIANS were less degraded Their situation seems to have resembled that of the Russian peasants at this day Like the serfs they were attached to the soil and were transferred with it by purchase but they paid only a fixed rent to the landlord and had a right to dispose of any surplus that might arise from their industry The term clerk was of very extensive import It comprehended originally such persons only as belonged to the clergy or clerical order among whom however might be found a multitude of married persons artisans or others But in process of time a much wider rule was established every one that could read being accounted a clerk or clericus and allowed the benefit of clergy that is exemption from capital and some other forms of punishment in case of crime TOURNAMENTS The splendid pageant of a tournament between knights its gaudy accessories and trappings and its chivalrous regulations originated in France Tournaments were repeatedly condemned by the Church probably on account of the quarrels they led to and the often fatal results The joust or just was different from the tournament In these knights fought with their lances and their object was to unhorse their antagonists while the tournaments were intended for a display of skill and address in evolutions and with various weapons and greater courtesy was observed in the regulations By these it was forbidden to wound the horse or to use the point of the sword or to strike a knight after he had raised his vizor or unlaced his helmet The ladies encouraged their knights in these exercises they bestowed prizes and the conqueror s feats were the theme of romance and song The stands overlooking the ground of course were varied in the shapes of towers terraces galleries and pensile gardens magnificently decorated with tapestry pavilions and banners Every combatant proclaimed the name of the lady whose servant d amour he was He was wont to look up to the stand and strengthen his courage by the sight of the bright eyes that were raining their influence on him from above The knights also carried FAVORS consisting of scarfs veils sleeves bracelets clasps in short some piece of female habiliment attached to their helmets shields or armor If during the combat any of these appendages were dropped or lost the fair donor would at times send her knight new ones especially if pleased with his exertions MAIL ARMOR Mail armor of which the hauberk is a species and which derived its name from maille a French word for MESH was of two kinds PLATE or SCALE mail and CHAIN mail It was originally used for the protection of the body only reaching no lower than the knees It was shaped like a carter s frock and bound round the waist by a girdle Gloves and hose of mail were afterwards added and a hood which when necessary was drawn over the head leaving the face alone uncovered To protect the skin from the impression of the iron network of the chain mail a quilted lining was employed which however was insufficient and the bath was used to efface the marks of the armor The hauberk was a complete covering of double chain mail Some hauberks opened before like a modern coat others were closed like a shirt The chain mail of which they were composed was formed by a number of iron links each link having others inserted into it the whole exhibiting a kind of network of which in some instances at least the meshes were circular with each link separately riveted The hauberk was proof against the most violent blow of a sword but the point of a lance might pass through the meshes or drive the iron into the flesh To guard against this a thick and well stuffed doublet was worn underneath under which was commonly added an iron breastplate Hence the expression to pierce both plate and mail so common in the earlier poets Mail armor continued in general use till about the year thirteen hundred when it was gradually supplanted by plate armor or suits consisting of pieces or plates of solid iron adapted to the different parts of the body Shields were generally made of wood covered with leather or some similar substance To secure them in some sort from being cut through by the sword they were surrounded with a hoop of metal HELMETS The helmet was composed of two parts the HEADPIECE which was strengthened within by several circles of iron and the VISOR which as the name implies was a sort of grating to see through so contrived as by sliding in a groove or turning on a pivot to be raised or lowered at pleasure Some helmets had a further improvement called a BEVER from the Italian bevere to drink The VENTAYLE or air passage is another name for this To secure the helmet from the possibility of falling or of being struck off it was tied by several laces to the meshes of the hauberk consequently when a knight was overthrown it was necessary to undo these laces before he could be put to death though this was sometimes effected by lifting up the skirt of the hauberk and stabbing him in the belly The instrument of death was a small dagger worn on the right side ROMANCES In ages when there were no books when noblemen and princes themselves could not read history or tradition was monopolized by the story tellers They inherited generation after generation the wondrous tales of their predecessors which they retailed to the public with such additions of their own as their acquired information supplied them with Anachronisms became of course very common and errors of geography of locality of manners equally so Spurious genealogies were invented in which Arthur and his knights and Charlemagne and his paladins were made to derive their descent from Aeneas Hector or some other of the Trojan heroes With regard to the derivation of the word Romance we trace it to the fact that the dialects which were formed in Western Europe from the admixture of Latin with the native languages took the name of Langue Romaine The French language was divided into two dialects The river Loire was their common boundary In the provinces to the south of that river the affirmative YES was expressed by the word oc in the north it was called oil oui and hence Dante has named the southern language langue d oc and the northern langue d oil The latter which was carried into England by the Normans and is the origin of the present French may be called the French Romane and the former the Provencal or Provencial Romane because it was spoken by the people of Provence and Languedoc southern provinces of France These dialects were soon distinguished by very opposite characters A soft and enervating climate a spirit of commerce encouraged by an easy communication with other maritime nations the influx of wealth and a more settled government may have tended to polish and soften the diction of the Provencials whose poets under the name of Troubadours were the masters of the Italians and particularly of Petrarch Their favorite pieces were Sirventes satirical pieces love songs and Tensons which last were a sort of dialogue in verse between two poets who questioned each other on some refined points of loves casuistry It seems the Provencials were so completely absorbed in these delicate questions as to neglect and despise the composition of fabulous histories of adventure and knighthood which they left in a great measure to the poets of the northern part of the kingdom called Trouveurs At a time when chivalry excited universal admiration and when all the efforts of that chivalry were directed against the enemies of religion it was natural that literature should receive the same impulse and that history and fable should be ransacked to furnish examples of courage and piety that might excite increased emulation Arthur and Charlemagne were the two heroes selected for this purpose Arthur s pretensions were that he was a brave though not always a successful warrior he had withstood with great resolution the arms of the infidels that is to say of the Saxons and his memory was held in the highest estimation by his countrymen the Britons who carried with them into Wales and into the kindred country of Armorica or Brittany the memory of his exploits which their national vanity insensibly exaggerated till the little prince of the Silures South Wales was magnified into the conqueror of England of Gaul and of the greater part of Europe His genealogy was gradually carried up to an imaginary Brutus and to the period of the Trojan war and a sort of chronicle was composed in the Welsh or Armorican language which under the pompous title of the History of the Kings of Britain was translated into Latin by Geoffrey of Monmouth about the year eleven fifty The Welsh critics consider the material of the work to have been an older history written by saint Talian Bishop of saint Asaph in the seventh century As to Charlemagne though his real merits were sufficient to secure his immortality it was impossible that his HOLY WARS against the Saracens should not become a favorite topic for fiction Accordingly the fabulous history of these wars was written probably towards the close of the eleventh century by a monk who thinking it would add dignity to his work to embellish it with a contemporary name boldly ascribed it to Turpin who was Archbishop of Rheims about the year seven hundred seventy three These fabulous chronicles were for a while imprisoned in languages of local only or of professional access Both Turpin and Geoffrey might indeed be read by ecclesiastics the sole Latin scholars of those times and Geoffrey s British original would contribute to the gratification of Welshmen but neither could become extensively popular till translated into some language of general and familiar use The Anglo Saxon was at that time used only by a conquered and enslaved nation the Spanish and Italian languages were not yet formed the Norman French alone was spoken and understood by the nobility in the greater part of Europe and therefore was a proper vehicle for the new mode of composition That language was fashionable in England before the Conquest and became after that event the only language used at the court of London As the various conquests of the Normans and the enthusiastic valor of that extraordinary people had familiarized the minds of men with the most marvellous events their poets eagerly seized the fabulous legends of Arthur and Charlemagne translated them into the language of the day and soon produced a variety of imitations The adventures attributed to these monarchs and to their distinguished warriors together with those of many other traditionary or imaginary heroes composed by degrees that formidable body of marvellous histories which from the dialect in which the most ancient of them were written were called Romances METRICAL ROMANCES The earliest form in which romances appear is that of a rude kind of verse In this form it is supposed they were sung or recited at the feasts of princes and knights in their baronial halls The following specimen of the language and style of Robert de Beauvais who flourished in twelve fifty seven is from Sir Walter Scott s Introduction to the Romance of Sir Tristrem Ne voil pas emmi dire Ici diverse la matyere Entre ceus qui solent cunter E de le cunte Tristran parler I will not say too much about it So diverse is the matter Among those who are in the habit of telling And relating the story of Tristran This is a specimen of the language which was in use among the nobility of England in the ages immediately after the Norman conquest The following is a specimen of the English that existed at the same time among the common people Robert de Brunne speaking of his Latin and French authorities says Als thai haf wryten and sayd Haf I alle in myn Inglis layd In symple speche as I couthe That is lightest in manne s mouthe Alle for the luf of symple men That strange Inglis cannot ken The strange Inglis being the language of the previous specimen It was not till toward the end of the thirteenth century that the PROSE romances began to appear These works generally began with disowning and discrediting the sources from which in reality they drew their sole information As every romance was supposed to be a real history the compilers of those in prose would have forfeited all credit if they had announced themselves as mere copyists of the minstrels On the contrary they usually state that as the popular poems upon the matter in question contain many lesings they had been induced to translate the real and true history of such or such a knight from the original Latin or Greek or from the ancient British or Armorican authorities which authorities existed only in their own assertion A specimen of the style of the prose romances may be found in the following extract from one of the most celebrated and latest of them the Morte d Arthur of Sir Thomas Mallory of the date of fourteen eighty five From this work much of the contents of this volume has been drawn with as close an adherence to the original style as was thought consistent with our plan of adapting our narrative to the taste of modern readers It is notoyrly knowen thorugh the vnyuersal world that there been ix worthy and the best that ever were That is to wete thre paynyms three Jewes and three crysten men As for the paynyms they were tofore the Incarnacyon of Cryst whiche were

places both in frensshe and englysshe and the thyrd and last was Godefray of boloyn CHAPTER II THE MYTHICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND The illustrious poet Milton in his History of England is the author whom we chiefly follow in this chapter According to the earliest accounts Albion a giant and son of Neptune a contemporary of Hercules ruled over the island to which he gave his name Presuming to oppose the progress of Hercules in his western march he was slain by him Another story is that Histion the son of Japhet the son of Noah had four sons Francus Romanus Alemannus and Britto from whom descended the French Roman German and British people Rejecting these and other like stories Milton gives more regard to the story of Brutus the Trojan which he says is supported by descents of ancestry long continued laws and exploits not plainly seeming to be borrowed or devised which on the common belief have wrought no small impression defended by many denied utterly by few The principal authority is Geoffrey of Monmouth whose history written in the twelfth century purports to be a translation of a history of Britain brought over from the opposite shore of France which under the name of Brittany was chiefly peopled by natives of Britain who from time to time emigrated thither driven from their own country by the inroads of the Picts and Scots According to this authority Brutus was the son of Silvius and he of Ascanius the son of Aeneas whose flight from Troy and settlement in Italy are narrated in Stories of Gods and Heroes Brutus at the age of fifteen attending his father to the chase unfortunately killed him with an arrow Banished therefor by his kindred he sought refuge in that part of Greece where Helenus with a band of Trojan exiles had become established But Helenus was now dead and the descendants of the Trojans were oppressed by Pandrasus the king of the country Brutus being kindly received among them so throve in virtue and in arms as to win the regard of all the eminent of the land above all others of his age In consequence of this the Trojans not only began to hope but secretly to persuade him to lead them the way to liberty To encourage them they had the promise of help from Assaracus a noble Greek youth whose mother was a Trojan He had suffered wrong at the hands of the king and for that reason the more willingly cast in his lost with the Trojan exiles Choosing a fit opportunity Brutus with his countrymen withdrew to the woods and hills as the safest place from which to expostulate and sent this message to Pandrasus That the Trojans holding it unworthy of their ancestors to serve in a foreign land had retreated to the woods choosing rather a savage life than a slavish one If that displeased him then with his leave they would depart to some other country Pandrasus not expecting so bold a message from the sons of captives went in pursuit of them with such forces as he could gather and met them on the banks of the Achelous where Brutus got the advantage and took the king captive The result was that the terms demanded by the Trojans were granted the king gave his daughter Imogen in marriage to Brutus and furnished shipping money and fit provision for them all to depart from the land The marriage being solemnized and shipping from all parts got together the Trojans in a fleet of no less than three hundred and twenty sail betook themselves to the sea On the third day they arrived at a certain island which they found destitute of inhabitants though there were appearances of former habitation and among the ruins a temple of Diana Brutus here performing sacrifice at the shrine of the goddess invoked an oracle for his guidance in these lines Goddess of shades and huntress who at will Walk saint on the rolling sphere and through the deep On thy third realm the earth look now and tell What land what seat of rest thou bidd saint me seek What certain seat where I may worship thee For aye with temples vowed and virgin choirs To whom sleeping before the altar Diana in a vision thus answered Brutus far to the west in the ocean wide Beyond the realm of Gaul a land there lies Seagirt it lies where giants dwelt of old Now void it fits thy people thither bend Thy course there shalt thou find a lasting seat There to thy sons another Troy shall rise And kings be born of thee whose dreaded might Shall awe the world and conquer nations bold Brutus guided now as he thought by divine direction sped his course towards the west and arriving at a place on the Tyrrhene sea found there the descendants of certain Trojans who with Antenor came into Italy of whom Corineus was the chief These joined company and the ships pursued their way till they arrived at the mouth of the river Loire in France where the expedition landed with a view to a settlement but were so rudely assaulted by the inhabitants that they put to sea again and arrived at a part of the coast of Britain now called Devonshire where Brutus felt convinced that he had found the promised end of his voyage landed his colony and took possession The island not yet Britain but Albion was in a manner desert and inhospitable occupied only by a remnant of the giant race whose excessive force and tyranny had destroyed the others The Trojans encountered these and extirpated them Corineus in particular signalizing himself by his exploits against them from whom Cornwall takes its name for that region fell to his lot and there the hugest giants dwelt lurking in rocks and caves till Corineus rid the land of them Brutus built his capital city and called it Trojanova New Troy changed in time to Trinovantus now London Footnote For noble Britons sprong from Trojans bold And Troynovant was built of old Troy s ashes cold SPENSER Book III Canto IX thirty eight and having governed the isle twenty four years died leaving three sons Locrine Albanact and Camber Locrine had the middle part Camber the west called Cambria from him and Albanact Albania now Scotland Locrine was married to Guendolen the daughter of Corineus but having seen a fair maid named Estrildis who had been brought captive from Germany he became enamoured of her and had by her a daughter whose name was Sabra This matter was kept secret while Corineus lived but after his death Locrine divorced Guendolen and made Estrildis his queen Guendolen all in rage departed to Cornwall where Madan her son lived who had been brought up by Corineus his grandfather Gathering an army of her father s friends and subjects she gave battle to her husband s forces and Locrine was slain Guendolen caused her rival Estrildis with her daughter Sabra to be thrown into the river from which cause the river thenceforth bore the maiden s name which by length of time is now changed into Sabrina or Severn Milton alludes to this in his address to the rivers Severn swift guilty of maiden s death and in his Comus tells the story with a slight variation thus There is a gentle nymph not far from hence That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream Sabrina is her name a virgin pure Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine That had the sceptre from his father Brute She guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit Of her enraged step dame Guendolen Commended her fair innocence to the flood That stayed her night with his cross flowing course The water nymphs that in the bottom played Held up their pearled wrists and took her in Bearing her straight to aged Nereus hall Who piteous of her woes reared her lank head And gave her to his daughters to imbathe In nectared lavers strewed with asphodel And through the porch and inlet of each sense Dropped in ambrosial oils till she revived And underwent a quick immortal change Made goddess of the river et cetera If our readers ask when all this took place we must answer in the first place that mythology is not careful of dates and next that as Brutus was the great grandson of Aeneas it must have been not far from a century subsequent to the Trojan war or about eleven hundred years before the invasion of the island by Julius Caesar This long interval is filled with the names of princes whose chief occupation was in warring with one another Some few whose names remain connected with places or embalmed in literature we will mention BLADUD Bladud built the city of Bath and dedicated the medicinal waters to Minerva He was a man of great invention and practised the arts of magic till having made him wings to fly he fell down upon the temple of Apollo in Trinovant and so died after twenty years reign LEIR Leir who next reigned built Leicester and called it after his name He had no male issue but only three daughters When grown old he determined to divide his kingdom among his daughters and bestow them in marriage But first to try which of them loved him best he determined to ask them solemnly in order and judge of the warmth of their affection by their answers Goneril the eldest knowing well her father s weakness made answer that she loved him above her soul Since thou so honorest my declining age said the old man to thee and to thy husband I give the third part of my realm Such good success for a few words soon uttered was ample instruction to Regan the second daughter what to say She therefore to the same question replied that she loved him more than all the world beside and so received an equal reward with her sister But Cordelia the youngest and hitherto the best beloved though having before her eyes the reward of a little easy soothing and the loss likely to attend plain dealing yet was not moved from the solid purpose of a sincere and virtuous answer and replied Father my love towards you is as my duty bids They who pretend beyond this flatter When the old man sorry to hear this and wishing her to recall these words persisted in asking she still restrained her expressions so as to say rather less than more than the truth Then Leir all in a passion burst forth Since thou hast not reverenced thy aged father like thy sisters think not to have any part in my kingdom or what else I have and without delay giving in marriage his other daughters Goneril to the Duke of Albany and Regan to the Duke of Cornwall he divides his kingdom between them and goes to reside with his eldest daughter attended only by a hundred knights But in a short time his attendants being complained of as too numerous and disorderly are reduced to thirty Resenting that affront the old king betakes him to his second daughter but she instead of soothing his wounded pride takes part with her sister and refuses to admit a retinue of more than five Then back he returns to the other who now will not receive him with more than one attendant Then the remembrance of Cordeilla comes to his thoughts and he takes his journey into France to seek her with little hope of kind consideration from one whom he had so injured but to pay her the last recompense he can render confession of his injustice When Cordeilla is informed of his approach and of his sad condition she pours forth true filial tears And not willing that her own or others eyes should see him in that forlorn condition she sends one of her trusted servants to meet him and convey him privately to some comfortable abode and to furnish him with such state as befitted his dignity After which Cordeilla with the king her husband went in state to meet him and after an honorable reception the king permitted his wife Cordeilla to go with an army and set her father again upon his throne They prospered subdued the wicked sisters and their consorts and Leir obtained the crown and held it three years Cordeilla succeeded him and reigned five years but the sons of her sisters after that rebelled against her and she lost both her crown and life Shakspeare has chosen this story as the subject of his tragedy of King Lear varying its details in some respects The madness of Leir and the ill success of Cordeilla s attempt to reinstate her father are the principal variations and those in the names will also be noticed Our narrative is drawn from Milton s History and thus the reader will perceive that the story of Leir has had the distinguished honor of being told by the two acknowledged chiefs of British literature FERREX AND PORREX Ferrex and Porrex were brothers who held the kingdom after Leir They quarrelled about the supremacy and Porrex expelled his brother who obtaining aid from Suard king of the Franks returned and made war upon Porrex Ferrex was slain in battle and his forces dispersed When their mother came to hear of her son s death who was her favorite she fell into a great rage and conceived a mortal hatred against the survivor She took therefore her opportunity when he was asleep fell upon him and with the assistance of her women tore him in pieces This horrid story would not be worth relating were it not for the fact that it has furnished the plot for the first tragedy which was written in the English language It was entitled Gorboduc but in the second edition Ferrex and Porrex and was the production of Thomas Sackville afterwards Earl of Dorset and Thomas Norton a barrister Its date was fifteen sixty one DUNWALLO MOLMUTIUS This is the next name of note Molmutius established the Molmutine laws which bestowed the privilege of sanctuary on temples cities and the roads leading to them and gave the same protection to ploughs extending a religious sanction to the labors of the field Shakspeare alludes to him in Cymbeline Act III Scene one Molmutius made our laws Who was the first of Britain which did put His brows within a golden crown and called Himself a king BRENNUS AND BELINUS The sons of Molmutius succeeded him They quarrelled and Brennus was driven out of the island and took refuge in Gaul where he met with such favor from the king of the Allobroges that he gave him his daughter in marriage and made him his partner on the throne Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous leader of the Gauls who took Rome in the time of Camillus Geoffrey of Monmouth claims the glory of the conquest for the British prince after he had become king of the Allobroges ELIDURE After Belinus and Brennus there reigned several kings of little note and then came Elidure Arthgallo his brother being king gave great offence to his powerful nobles who rose against him deposed him and advanced Elidure to the throne Arthgallo fled and endeavored to find assistance in the neighboring kingdoms to reinstate him but found none Elidure reigned prosperously and wisely After five years possession of the kingdom one day when hunting he met in the forest his brother Arthgallo who had been deposed After long wandering unable longer to bear the poverty to which he was reduced he had returned to Britain with only ten followers designing to repair to those who had formerly been his friends Elidure at the sight of his brother in distress forgetting all animosities ran to him and embraced him He took Arthgallo home with him and concealed him in the palace After this he feigned himself sick and calling his nobles about him induced them partly by persuasion partly by force to consent to his abdicating the kingdom and reinstating his brother on the throne The agreement being ratified Elidure took the crown from his own head and put it on his brother s head Arthgallo after this reigned ten years well and wisely exercising strict justice towards all men He died and left the kingdom to his sons who reigned with various fortunes but were not long lived and left no offspring so that Elidure was again advanced to the throne and finished the course of his life in just and virtuous actions receiving the name of THE PIOUS from the love and admiration of his subjects Wordsworth has taken the story of Artegal and Elidure for the subject of a poem which is No two of Poems founded on the Affections LUD After Elidure the Chronicle names many kings but none of special note till we come to Lud who greatly enlarged Trinovant his capital and surrounded it with a wall He changed its name bestowing upon it his own so that henceforth it was called Lud s town afterwards London Lud was buried by the gate of the city called after him Ludgate He had two sons but they were not old enough at the time of their father s death to sustain the cares of government and therefore their uncle Caswallaun or Cassibellaunus succeeded to the kingdom He was a brave and magnificent prince so that his fame reached to distant countries CASSIBELLAUNUS About this time it happened as is found in the Roman histories that Julius Caesar having subdued Gaul came to the shore opposite Britain And having resolved to add this island also to his conquests he prepared ships and transported his army across the sea to the mouth of the River Thames Here he was met by Cassibellaun with all his forces and a battle ensued in which Nennius the brother of Cassibellaun engaged in single combat with Csesar After several furious blows given and received the sword of Caesar stuck so fast in the shield of Nennius that it could not be pulled out and the combatants being separated by the intervention of the troops Nennius remained possessed of this trophy At last after the greater part of the day was spent the Britons poured in so fast that Caesar was forced to retire to his camp and fleet And finding it useless to continue the war any longer at that time he returned to Gaul Shakspeare alludes to Cassibellaunus in Cymbeline The famed Cassibelan who was once at point O giglot fortune to master Caesar s sword Made Lud s town with rejoicing fires bright And Britons strut with courage KYMBELINUS OR CYMBELINE Caesar on a second invasion of the island was more fortunate and compelled the Britons to pay tribute Cymbeline the nephew of the king was delivered to the Romans as a hostage for the faithful fulfilment of the treaty and being carried to Rome by Caesar he was there brought up in the Roman arts and accomplishments Being afterwards restored to his country and placed on the throne he was attached to the Romans and continued through all his reign at peace with them His sons Guiderius and Arviragus who made their appearance in Shakspeare s play of Cymbeline succeeded their father and refusing to pay tribute to the Romans brought on another invasion Guiderius was slain but Arviragus afterward made terms with the Romans and reigned prosperously many years ARMORICA The next event of note is the conquest and colonization of Armorica by Maximus a Roman general and Conan lord of Miniadoc or Denbigh land in Wales The name of the country was changed to Brittany or Lesser Britain and so completely was it possessed by the British colonists that the language became assimilated to that spoken in Wales and it is said that to this day the peasantry of the two countries can understand each other when speaking their native language The Romans eventually succeeded in establishing themselves in the island and after the lapse of several generations they became blended with the natives so that no distinction existed between the two races When at length the Roman armies were withdrawn from Britain their departure was a matter of regret to the inhabitants as it left them without protection against the barbarous tribes Scots Picts and Norwegians who harassed the country incessantly This was the state of things when the era of King Arthur began The adventure of Albion the giant with Hercules is alluded to by Spenser Faery Queene Book IV Canto xi For Albion the son of Neptune was Who for the proof of his great puissance Out of his Albion did on dry foot pass Into old Gaul that now is cleped France To fight with Hercules that did advance To vanquish all the world with matchless might And there his mortal part by great mischance Was slain

none	none	Buried under something which enclosed him like a coffin or bier CHAPTER IV ARTHUR We shall begin our history of King Arthur by giving those particulars of his life which appear to rest on historical evidence and then proceed to record those legends concerning him which form the earliest portion of British literature Arthur was a prince of the tribe of Britons called Silures whose country was South Wales the son of Uther named Pendragon a title given to an elective sovereign paramount over the many kings of Britain He appears to have commenced his martial career about the year five hundred and was raised to the Pendragonship about ten years later He is said to have gained twelve victories over the Saxons The most important of them was that of Badon by some supposed to be Bath by others Berkshire This was the last of his battles with the Saxons and checked their progress so effectually that Arthur experienced no more annoyance from them and reigned in peace until the revolt of his nephew Modred twenty years later which led to the fatal battle of Camlan in Cornwall in five hundred forty two Modred was slain and Arthur mortally wounded was conveyed by sea to Glastonbury where he died and was buried Tradition preserved the memory of the place of his interment within the abbey as we are told by Giraldus Cambrensis who was present when the grave was opened by command of Henry II about eleven fifty and saw the bones and sword of the monarch and a leaden cross let into his tombstone with the inscription in rude Roman letters Here lies buried the famous King Arthur in the island Avalonia This story has been elegantly versified by Warton A popular traditional belief was long entertained among the Britons that Arthur was not dead but had been carried off to be healed of his wounds in Fairy land and that he would reappear to avenge his countrymen and reinstate them in the sovereignty of Britain In Warton s Ode a bard relates to King Henry the traditional story of Arthur s death and closes with these lines Yet in vain a paynim foe Armed with fate the mighty blow For when he fell the Elfin queen All in secret and unseen O er the fainting hero threw Her mantle of ambrosial blue And bade her spirits bear him far In Merlin s agate axled car To her green isle s enamelled steep Far in the navel of the deep O er his wounds she sprinkled dew From flowers that in Arabia grew There he reigns a mighty king Thence to Britain shall return If right prophetic rolls I learn Borne on victory s spreading plume His ancient sceptre to resume His knightly table to restore And brave the tournaments of yore After this narration another bard came forward who recited a different story When Arthur bowed his haughty crest No princess veiled in azure vest Snatched him by Merlin s powerful spell In groves of golden bliss to dwell But when he fell with winged speed His champions on a milk white steed From the battle s hurricane Bore him to Joseph s towered fane In the fair vale of Avalon There with chanted orison And the long blaze of tapers clear The stoled fathers met the bier Through the dim aisles in order dread Of martial woe the chief they led And deep entombed in holy ground Before the altar s solemn bound Footnote Glastonbury Abbey said to be founded by Joseph of Arimathea in a spot anciently called the island or valley of Avalonia Tennyson in his Palace of Art alludes to the legend of Arthur s rescue by the Faery queen thus Or mythic Uther s deeply wounded son In some fair space of sloping greens Lay dozing in the vale of Avalon And watched by weeping queens It must not be concealed that the very existence of Arthur has been denied by some Milton says of him As to Arthur more renowned in songs and romances than in true stories who he was and whether ever any such reigned in Britain hath been doubted heretofore and may again with good reason Modern critics however admit that there was a prince of this name and find proof of it in the frequent mention of him in the writings of the Welsh bards But the Arthur of romance according to mister Owen a Welsh scholar and antiquarian is a mythological person Arthur he says is the Great Bear as the name literally implies Arctos Arcturus and perhaps this constellation being so near the pole and visibly describing a circle in a small space is the origin of the famous Round Table KING ARTHUR Constans king of Britain had three sons Moines Ambrosius otherwise called Uther and Pendragon Moines soon after his accession to the crown was vanquished by the Saxons in consequence of the treachery of his seneschal Vortigern and growing unpopular through misfortune he was killed by his subjects and the traitor Vortigern chosen in his place Vortigern was soon after defeated in a great battle by Uther and Pendragon the surviving brothers of Moines and Pendragon ascended the throne This prince had great confidence in the wisdom of Merlin and made him his chief adviser About this time a dreadful war arose between the Saxons and Britons Merlin obliged the royal brothers to swear fidelity to each other but predicted that one of them must fall in the first battle The Saxons were routed and Pendragon being slain was succeeded by Uther who now assumed in addition to his own name the appellation of Pendragon Merlin still continued a favorite counsellor At the request of Uther he transported by magic art enormous stones from Ireland to form the sepulchre of Pendragon These stones constitute the monument now called Stonehenge on Salisbury plain Merlin next proceeded to Carlisle to prepare the Round Table at which he seated an assemblage of the great nobles of the country The companions admitted to this high order were bound by oath to assist each other at the hazard of their own lives to attempt singly the most perilous adventures to lead when necessary a life of monastic solitude to fly to arms at the first summons and never to retire from battle till they had defeated the enemy unless night intervened and separated the combatants Soon after this institution the king invited all his barons to the celebration of a great festival which he proposed holding annually at Carlisle As the knights had obtained the sovereign s permission to bring their ladies along with them the beautiful Igerne accompanied her husband Gorlois Duke of Tintadel to one of these anniversaries The king became deeply enamoured of the duchess and disclosed his passion but Igerne repelled his advances and revealed his solicitations to her husband On hearing this the duke instantly removed from court with Igerne and without taking leave of Uther The king complained to his council of this want of duty and they decided that the duke should be summoned to court and if refractory should be treated as a rebel As he refused to obey the citation the king carried war into the estates of his vassal and besieged him in the strong castle of Tintadel Merlin transformed the king into the likeness of Gorlois and enabled him to have many stolen interviews with Igerne At length the duke was killed in battle and the king espoused Igerne From this union sprang Arthur who succeeded his father Uther upon the throne ARTHUR CHOSEN KING Arthur though only fifteen years old at his father s death was elected king at a general meeting of the nobles It was not done without opposition for there were many ambitious competitors For while he linger d there A doubt that ever smoulder d in the hearts Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm Flash d forth and into war for most of these Made head against him crying Who is he That he should rule us who hath proven him King Uther s son for lo we look at him And find nor face nor bearing limbs nor voice Are like to those of Uther whom we knew Coming of Arthur But Bishop Brice a person of great sanctity on Christmas eve addressed the assembly and represented that it would well become them at that solemn season to put up their prayers for some token which should manifest the intentions of Providence respecting their future sovereign This was done and with such success that the service was scarcely ended when a miraculous stone was discovered before the church door and in the stone was firmly fixed a sword with the following words engraven on its hilt I am hight Escalibore Unto a king fair tresore Bishop Brice after exhorting the assembly to offer up their thanksgiving for this signal miracle proposed a law that whoever should be able to draw out the sword from the stone should be acknowledged as sovereign of the Britons and his proposal was decreed by general acclamation The tributary kings of Uther and the most famous knights successively put their strength to the proof but the miraculous sword resisted all their efforts It stood till Candlemas it stood till Easter and till Pentecost when the best knights in the kingdom usually assembled for the annual tournament Arthur who was at that time serving in the capacity of squire to his foster brother Sir Kay attended his master to the lists Sir Kay fought with great valor and success but had the misfortune to break his sword and sent Arthur to his mother for a new one Arthur hastened home but did not find the lady but having observed near the church a sword sticking in a stone he galloped to the place drew out the sword with great ease and delivered it to his master Sir Kay would willingly have assumed to himself the distinction conferred by the possession of the sword but when to confirm the doubters the sword was replaced in the stone he was utterly unable to withdraw it and it would yield a second time to no hand but Arthur s Thus decisively pointed out by Heaven as their king Arthur was by general consent proclaimed as such and an early day appointed for his solemn coronation Immediately after his election to the crown Arthur found himself opposed by eleven kings and one duke who with a vast army were actually encamped in the forest of Rockingham By Merlin s advice Arthur sent an embassy to Brittany to solicit the aid of King Ban and King Bohort two of the best knights in the world They accepted the call and with a powerful army crossed the sea landing at Portsmouth where they were received with great rejoicing The rebel kings were still superior in numbers but Merlin by a powerful enchantment caused all their tents to fall down at once and in the confusion Arthur with his allies fell upon them and totally routed them After defeating the rebels Arthur took the field against the Saxons As they were too strong for him unaided he sent an embassy to Armorica beseeching the assistance of Hoel who soon after brought over an army to his aid The two kings joined their forces and sought the enemy whom they met and both sides prepared for a decisive engagement Arthur himself as Geoffrey of Monmouth relates dressed in a breastplate worthy of so great a king places on his head a golden helmet engraved with the semblance of a dragon Over his shoulders he throws his shield called Priwen on which a picture of the Holy Virgin constantly recalled her to his memory Girt with Caliburn a most excellent sword and fabricated in the isle of Avalon he graces his right hand with the lance named Ron This was a long and broad spear well contrived for slaughter After a severe conflict Arthur calling on the name of the Virgin rushes into the midst of his enemies and destroys multitudes of them with the formidable Caliburn and puts the rest to flight Hoel being detained by sickness took no part in this battle This is called the victory of Mount Badon and however disguised by fable it is regarded by historians as a real event The feats performed by Arthur at the battle of Badon Mount are thus celebrated in Drayton s verse They sung how he himself at Badon bore that day When at the glorious goal his British sceptre lay Two daies together how the battel stronglie stood Pendragon s worthie son who waded there in blood Three hundred Saxons slew with his owne valiant hand Song IV GUENEVER Merlin had planned for Arthur a marriage with the daughter of King Laodegan of Carmalide By his advice Arthur paid a visit to the court of that sovereign attended only by Merlin and by thirty nine knights whom the magician had selected for that service On their arrival they found Laodegan and his peers sitting in council endeavoring but with small prospect of success to devise means of resisting the impending attack of Ryence king of Ireland who with fifteen tributary kings and an almost innumerable army had nearly surrounded the city Merlin who acted as leader of the band of British knights announced them as strangers who came to offer the king their services in his wars but under the express condition that they should be at liberty to conceal their names and quality until they should think proper to divulge them These terms were thought very strange but were thankfully accepted and the strangers after taking the usual oath to the king retired to the lodging which Merlin had prepared for them A few days after this the enemy regardless of a truce into which they had entered with King Laodegan suddenly issued from their camp and made an attempt to surprise the city Cleodalis the king s general assembled the royal forces with all possible despatch Arthur and his companions also flew to arms and Merlin appeared at their head bearing a standard on which was emblazoned a terrific dragon Merlin advanced to the gate and commanded the porter to open it which the porter refused to do without the king s order Merlin thereupon took up the gate with all its appurtenances of locks bars bolts et cetera and directed his troops to pass through after which he replaced it in perfect order He then set spurs to his horse and dashed at the head of his little troop into a body of two thousand pagans The disparity of numbers being so enormous Merlin cast a spell upon the enemy so as to prevent their seeing the small number of their assailants notwithstanding which the British knights were hard pressed But the people of the city who saw from the walls this unequal contest were ashamed of leaving the small body of strangers to their fate so they opened the gate and sallied forth The numbers were now more nearly equal and Merlin revoked his spell so that the two armies encountered on fair terms Where Arthur Ban Bohort and the rest fought the king s army had the advantage but in another part of the field the king himself was surrounded and carried off by the enemy The sad sight was seen by Guenever the fair daughter of the king who stood on the city wall and looked at the battle She was in dreadful distress tore her hair and swooned away But Merlin aware of what passed in every part of the field suddenly collected his knights led them out of the battle intercepted the passage of the party who were carrying away the king charged them with irresistible impetuosity cut in pieces or dispersed the whole escort and rescued the king In the fight Arthur encountered Caulang a giant fifteen feet high and the fair Guenever who had already began to feel a strong interest in the handsome young stranger trembled for the issue of the contest But Arthur dealing a dreadful blow on the shoulder of the monster cut through his neck so that his head hung over on one side and in this condition his horse carried him about the field to the great horror and dismay of the Pagans Guenever could not refrain from expressing aloud her wish that the gentle knight who dealt with giants so dexterously were destined to become her husband and the wish was echoed by her attendants The enemy soon turned their backs and fled with precipitation closely pursued by Laodegan and his allies After the battle Arthur was disarmed and conducted to the bath by the princess Guenever while his friends were attended by the other ladies of the court After the bath the knights were conducted to a magnificent entertainment at which they were diligently served by the same fair attendants Laodegan more and more anxious to know the name and quality of his generous deliverers and occasionally forming a secret wish that the chief of his guests might be captivated by the charms of his daughter appeared silent and pensive and was scarcely roused from his reverie by the banters of his courtiers Arthur having had an opportunity of explaining to Guenever his great esteem for her merit was in the joy of his heart and was still further delighted by hearing from Merlin the late exploits of Gawain at London by means of which his immediate return to his dominions was rendered unnecessary and he was left at liberty to protract his stay at the court of Laodegan Every day contributed to increase the admiration of the whole court for the gallant strangers and the passion of Guenever for their chief and when at last Merlin announced to the king that the object of the visit of the party was to procure a bride for their leader Laodegan at once presented Guenever to Arthur telling him that whatever might be his rank his merit was sufficient to entitle him to the possession of the heiress of Carmalide And could he find a woman in her womanhood As great as he was in his manhood The twain together might change the world Guinevere Arthur accepted the lady with the utmost gratitude and Merlin then proceeded to satisfy the king of the rank of his son in law upon which Laodegan with all his barons hastened to do homage to their lawful sovereign the successor of Uther Pendragon The fair Guenever was then solemnly betrothed to Arthur and a magnificent festival was proclaimed which lasted seven days At the end of that time the enemy appearing again with renewed force it became necessary to resume military operations Footnote Guenever the name of Arthur s queen also written Genievre and Geneura is familiar to all who are conversant with chivalric lore It is to her adventures and those of her true knight Sir Launcelot that Dante alludes in the beautiful episode of Francesca di Rimini We must now relate what took place at and near London while Arthur was absent from his capital At this very time a band of young heroes were on their way to Arthur s court for the purpose of receiving knighthood from him They were Gawain and his three brothers nephews of Arthur sons of King Lot and Galachin another nephew son of King Nanters King Lot had been one of the rebel chiefs whom Arthur had defeated but he now hoped by means of the young men to be reconciled to his brother in law He equipped his sons and his nephew with the utmost magnificence giving them a splendid retinue of young men sons of earls and barons all mounted on the best horses with complete suits of choice armor They numbered in all seven hundred but only nine had yet received the order of knighthood the rest were candidates for that honor and anxious to earn it by an early encounter with the enemy Gawain the leader was a knight of wonderful strength but what was most remarkable about him was that his strength was greater at certain hours of the day than at others From nine o clock till noon his strength was doubled and so it was from three to evensong for the rest of the time it was less remarkable though at all times surpassing that of ordinary men After a march of three days they arrived in the vicinity of London where they expected to find Arthur and his court and very unexpectedly fell in with a large convoy belonging to the enemy consisting of numerous carts and wagons all loaded with provisions and escorted by three thousand men who had been collecting spoil from all the country round A single charge from Gawain s impetuous cavalry was sufficient to disperse the escort and recover the convoy which was instantly despatched to London But before long a body of seven thousand fresh soldiers advanced to the attack of the five princes and their little army Gawain singling out a chief named Choas of gigantic size began the battle by splitting him from the crown of the head to the breast Galachin encountered King Sanagran who was also very huge and cut off his head Agrivain and Gahariet also performed prodigies of valor Thus they kept the great army of assailants at bay though hard pressed till of a sudden they perceived a strong body of the citizens advancing from London where the convoy which had been recovered by Gawain had arrived and informed the mayor and citizens of the danger of their deliverer The arrival of the Londoners soon decided the contest The enemy fled in all directions and Gawain and his friends escorted by the grateful citizens entered London and were received with acclamations CHAPTER V ARTHUR Continued After the great victory of Mount Badon by which the Saxons were for the time effectually put down Arthur turned his arms against the Scots and Picts whom he routed at Lake Lomond and compelled to sue for mercy He then went to York to keep his Christmas and employed himself in restoring the Christian churches which the Pagans had rifled and overthrown The following summer he conquered Ireland and then made a voyage with his fleet to Iceland which he also subdued The kings of Gothland and of the Orkneys came voluntarily and made their submission promising to pay tribute Then he returned to Britain where having established the kingdom he dwelt twelve years in peace During this time he invited over to him all persons whatsoever that were famous for valor in foreign nations and augmented the number of his domestics and introduced such politeness into his court as people of the remotest countries thought worthy of their imitation So that there was not a nobleman who thought himself of any consideration unless his clothes and arms were made in the same fashion as those of Arthur s knights Finding himself so powerful at home Arthur began to form designs for extending his power abroad So having prepared his fleet he first attempted Norway that he might procure the crown of it for Lot his sister s husband Arthur landed in Norway fought a great battle with the king of that country defeated him and pursued the victory till he had reduced the whole country under his dominion and established Lot upon the throne Then Arthur made a voyage to Gaul and laid siege to the city of Paris Gaul was at that time a Roman province and governed by Flollo the Tribune When the siege of Paris had continued a month and the people began to suffer from famine Flollo challenged Arthur to single combat proposing to decide the conquest of the province in that way Arthur gladly accepted the challenge and slew his adversary in the contest upon which the citizens surrendered the city to him After the victory Arthur divided his army into two parts one of which he committed to the conduct of Hoel whom he ordered to march into Aquitaine while he with the other part should endeavor to subdue the other provinces At the end of nine years in which time all the parts of Gaul were entirely reduced Arthur returned to Paris where he kept his court and calling an assembly of the clergy and people established peace and the just administration of the laws in that kingdom Then he bestowed Normandy upon Bedver his butler and the province of Andegavia upon Kay his steward Footnote This name in the French romances is spelled Queux which means head cook This would seem to imply that it was a title and not a name yet the personage who bore it is never mentioned by any other He is the chief if not the only comic character among the heroes of Arthur s court He is the Seneschal or Steward his duties also embracing those of chief of the cooks In the romances his general character is a compound of valor and buffoonery always ready to fight and generally getting the worst of the battle He is also sarcastic and abusive in his remarks by which he often gets into trouble Yet Arthur seems to have an attachment to him and often takes his advice which is generally wrong and several other provinces upon his great men that attended him And having settled the peace of the cities and countries he returned back in the beginning of spring to Britain Upon the approach of the feast of Pentecost Arthur the better to demonstrate his joy after such triumphant successes and for the more solemn observation of that festival and reconciling the minds of the princes that were now subject to him resolved during that season to hold a magnificent court to place the crown upon his head and to invite all the kings and dukes under his subjection to the solemnity And he pitched upon Caerleon the City of Legions as the proper place for his purpose For besides its great wealth above the other cities its situation upon the river Usk near the Severn sea was most pleasant and fit for so great a solemnity For on one side it was washed by that noble river so that the kings and princes from the countries beyond the seas might have the convenience of sailing up to it On the other side the beauty of the meadows and groves and magnificence of the royal palaces with lofty gilded roofs that adorned it made it even rival the grandeur of Rome It was also famous for two churches whereof one was adorned with a choir of virgins who devoted themselves wholly to the service of God and the other maintained a convent of priests Besides there was a college of two hundred philosophers who being learned in astronomy and the other arts were diligent in observing the courses of the stars and gave Arthur true predictions of the events that would happen In this place therefore which afforded such delights were preparations made for the ensuing festival Footnote Several cities are allotted to King Arthur by the romance writers The principal are Caerleon Camelot and Carlisle Caerleon derives its name from its having been the station of one of the legions during the dominion of the Romans It is called by Latin writers Urbs Legionum the City of Legions The former word being rendered into Welsh by Caer meaning city and the latter contracted into lleon The river Usk retains its name in modern geography and there is a town or city of Caerleon upon it though the city of Cardiff is thought to be the scene of Arthur s court Chester also bears in Welsh the name of Caerleon for Chester derived from castra Latin for camp is the designation of military headquarters Camelot is thought to be Winchester Shalott is Guilford Hamo s Port is Southampton Carlisle is the city still retaining that name near the Scottish border But this name is also sometimes applied to other places which were like itself military stations Ambassadors were then sent into several kingdoms to invite to court the princes both of Gaul and of the adjacent islands Accordingly there came Augusel king of Albania now Scotland Cadwallo king of Venedotia now North Wales Sater king of Demetia now South Wales also the archbishops of the metropolitan sees London and York and Dubricius bishop of Caerleon the City of Legions This prelate who was primate of Britain was so eminent for his piety that he could cure any sick person by his prayers There were also the counts of the principal cities and many other worthies of no less dignity From the adjacent islands came Guillamurius king of Ireland Gunfasius king of the Orkneys Malvasius king of Iceland Lot king of Norway Bedver the butler Duke of Normandy Kay the sewer Duke of Andegavia also the twelve peers of Gaul and Hoel Duke of the Armorican Britons with his nobility who came with such a train of mules horses and rich furniture as it is difficult to describe Besides these there remained no prince of any consideration on this side of Spain who came not upon this invitation And no wonder when Arthur s munificence which was celebrated over the whole world made him beloved by all people When all were assembled upon the day of the solemnity the archbishops were conducted to the palace in order to place the crown upon the king s head Then Dubricius inasmuch as the court was held in his diocese made himself ready to celebrate the office As soon as the king was invested with his royal habiliments he was conducted in great pomp to the metropolitan church having four kings viz of Albania Cornwall Demetia and Venedotia bearing four golden swords before him On another part was the queen dressed out in her richest ornaments conducted by the archbishops and bishops to the Church of Virgins the four queens also of the kings last mentioned bearing before her four white doves according to ancient custom When the whole procession was ended so transporting was the harmony of the musical instruments and voices whereof there was a vast variety in both churches that the knights who attended were in doubt which to prefer and therefore crowded from the one to the other by turns and were far from being tired of the solemnity though the whole day had been spent in it At last when divine service was over at both churches the king and queen put off their crowns and putting on their lighter ornaments went to the banquet When they had all taken their seats according to precedence Kay the sewer in rich robes of ermine with a thousand young noblemen all in like manner clothed in rich attire served up the dishes From another part Bedver the butler was followed by the same number of attendants who waited with all kinds of cups and drinking vessels And there was food and drink in abundance and everything was of the best kind and served in the best manner For at that time Britain had arrived at such a pitch of grandeur that in riches luxury and politeness it far surpassed all other kingdoms As soon as the banquets were over they went into the fields without the city to divert themselves with various sports such as shooting with bows and arrows tossing the pike casting of heavy stones and rocks playing at dice and the like and all these inoffensively and without quarrelling In this manner were three days spent and after that they separated and the kings and noblemen departed to their several homes After this Arthur reigned five years in peace Then came ambassadors from Lucius Tiberius Procurator under Leo Emperor of Rome demanding tribute But Arthur refused to pay tribute and prepared for war As soon as the necessary dispositions were made he committed the government of his kingdom to his nephew Modred and to Queen Guenever and marched with his army to Hamo s Port where the wind stood fair for him The army crossed over in safety and landed at the mouth of the river Barba And there they pitched their tents to wait the arrival of the kings of the islands As soon as all the forces were arrived Arthur marched forward to Augustodunum and encamped on the banks of the river Alba Here repeated battles were fought in all which the Britons under their valiant leaders Hoel Duke of Armorica and Gawain nephew to Arthur had the advantage At length Lucius Tiberius determined to retreat and wait for the Emperor Leo to join him with fresh troops But Arthur anticipating this event took possession of a certain valley and closed up the way of retreat to Lucius compelling him to fight a decisive battle in which Arthur lost some of the bravest of his knights and most faithful followers But on the other hand Lucius Tiberius was slain and his army totally defeated The fugitives dispersed over the country some to the by ways and woods some to cities and towns and all other places where they could hope for safety Arthur stayed in those parts till the next winter was over and employed his time in restoring order and settling the government He then returned into England and celebrated his victories with great splendor Then the king stablished all his knights and to them that were not rich he gave lands and charged them all never to do outrage nor murder and always to flee treason also by no means to be cruel but to give mercy unto him that asked mercy upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship and always to do ladies damosels and gentlewomen service upon pain of death Also that no man take battle in a wrongful quarrel for no law nor for any world s goods Unto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round both old and young And at every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost KING ARTHUR SLAYS THE GIANT OF saint MICHAEL S MOUNT While the army was encamped in Brittany awaiting the arrival of the kings there came a countryman to Arthur and told him that a giant whose cave was on a neighboring mountain called saint Michael s Mount had for a long time been accustomed to carry off the children of the peasants to devour them And now he hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her attendants and hath carried her away in spite of all they could do Now fellow said King Arthur canst thou bring me there where this giant haunteth Yea sure said the good man lo yonder where thou seest two great fires there shalt thou find him and more treasure than I suppose is in all France beside Then the king called to him Sir Bedver and Sir Kay and commanded them to make ready horse and harness for himself and them for after evening he would ride on pilgrimage to saint Michael s Mount So they three departed and rode forth till they came to the foot of the mount And there the king commanded them to tarry for he would himself go up into that mount So he ascended the hill till he came to a great fire and there he found an aged woman sitting by a new made grave making great sorrow Then King Arthur saluted her and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentation to whom she answered Sir knight speak low for yonder is a devil and if he hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee For ye cannot make resistance to him he is so fierce and so strong He hath murdered the Duchess which here lieth who was the fairest of all the world wife to Sir Hoel Duke of Brittany Dame said the king I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur to treat with that tyrant Fie on such treaties said she he setteth not by the king nor by no man else Well said Arthur I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words So he went forth by the crest of the hill and saw where the giant sat at supper gnawing on the limb of a man and baking his broad limbs at the fire and three fair damsels lying bound whose lot it was to be devoured in their turn When King Arthur beheld that he had great compassion on them so that his heart bled for sorrow Then he hailed the giant saying He that all the world ruleth give thee short life and shameful death Why hast thou murdered this Duchess Therefore come forth for this day thou shalt die by my hand Then the giant started up and took a great club and smote at the king and smote off his coronal and then the king struck him in the belly with his sword and made a fearful wound Then the giant threw away his club and caught the king in his arms so that he crushed his ribs Then the three maidens kneeled down and prayed for help and comfort for Arthur And Arthur weltered and wrenched so that he was one while under and another time above And so weltering and wallowing they rolled down the hill and ever as they weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger and it fortuned they came to the place where the two knights were And when they saw the king fast in the giant s arms they came and loosed him Then the king commanded Sir Kay to smite off the giant s head and to set it on the truncheon of a spear and fix it on the barbican that all the people might see and behold it This was done and anon it was known through all the country wherefor the people came and thanked the king And he said Give your thanks to God and take ye the giant s spoil and divide it among you And King Arthur caused a church to be builded on that hill in honor of saint Michael KING ARTHUR GETS A SWORD FROM THE LADY OF THE LAKE One day King Arthur rode forth and on a sudden he was ware of three churls chasing Merlin to have slain him And the king rode unto them and bade them Flee churls Then were they afraid when they saw a knight and fled O Merlin said Arthur here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been by Nay said Merlin not so for I could save myself if I would but thou art more near thy death than I am So as they went thus talking King Arthur perceived where sat a knight on horseback as if to guard the pass Sir knight said Arthur for what cause abidest thou here Then the knight said There may no knight ride this way unless he just with me for such is the custom of the pass I will amend that custom said the king Then they ran together and they met so hard that their spears were shivered Then they drew their swords and fought a strong battle with many great strokes But at length the sword of the knight smote King Arthur s sword in two pieces Then said the knight unto Arthur Thou art in my power whether to save thee or slay thee and unless thou yield thee as overcome and recreant thou shalt die As for death said King Arthur welcome be it when it cometh but to yield me unto thee as recreant I will not Then he leapt upon the knight and took him by the middle and threw him down but the knight was a passing strong man and anon he brought Arthur under him and would have razed off his helm to slay him Then said Merlin Knight hold thy hand for this knight is a man of more worship than thou art aware of Why who is he said the knight It is King Arthur Then would he have slain him for dread of his wrath and lifted up his sword to slay him and therewith Merlin cast an enchantment on the knight so that he fell to the earth in a great sleep Then Merlin took up King Arthur and set him on his horse Alas said Arthur what hast thou done Merlin hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts Care ye not said Merlin he is wholer than ye be He is only asleep and will wake in three hours Then the king and he departed and went till they came to a hermit that was a good man and a great leech So the hermit searched all his wounds and applied good salves and the king was there three days and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go So they departed and as they rode Arthur said I have no sword No matter said Merlin hereby is a sword that shall be yours So they rode till they came to a lake which was a fair water and broad And in the midst of the lake Arthur was aware of an arm clothed in white samite Footnote Samite a sort of silk stuff that held a fair sword in the hand Lo said Merlin yonder is that sword that I spake of It belongeth to the Lady of the Lake and if she will thou mayest take it but if she will not it will not be in thy power to take it So Sir Arthur and Merlin alighted from their horses and went into a boat And when they came to the sword that the hand held Sir Arthur took it by the handle and took it to him and the arm and the hand went under the water Then they returned unto the land and rode forth And Sir Arthur looked on the sword and liked it right well So they rode unto Caerleon whereof his knights were passing glad And when they heard of his adventures they marvelled that he would jeopard his person so alone But all men of worship said it was a fine thing to be under such a chieftain as would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did CHAPTER VI SIR GAWAIN Sir Gawain was nephew to King Arthur by his sister Morgana married to Lot king of Orkney who was by Arthur made king of Norway Sir Gawain was one of the most famous knights of the Round Table and is characterized by the romancers as the SAGE and COURTEOUS Gawain To this Chaucer alludes in his Squiere s Tale where the strange knight salueth all the court With so high reverence and observance As well in speeche as in countenance That Gawain with his olde curtesie Though he were come agen out of faerie Ne coude him not amenden with a word Gawain s brothers were Agrivain Gahariet and Gareth SIR GAWAIN S MARRIAGE Once upon a time King Arthur held his court in merry Carlisle when a damsel came before him and craved a boon It was for vengeance upon a caitiff knight who had made her lover captive and despoiled her of her lands King Arthur commanded to bring him his sword Excalibar and to saddle his steed and rode forth without delay to right the lady s wrong Ere long he reached the castle of the grim baron and challenged him to the conflict But the castle stood on magic ground and the spell was such that no knight could tread thereon but straight his courage fell and his strength decayed King Arthur felt the charm and before a blow was struck his sturdy limbs lost their strength and his head grew faint He was fain to yield himself prisoner to the churlish knight who refused to release him except upon condition that he should return at the end of a year and bring a true answer to the question What thing is it which women most desire or in default thereof surrender himself and his lands King Arthur accepted the terms and gave his oath to return at the time appointed During the year the king rode east and he rode west and inquired of all whom he met what thing it is which all women most desire Some told him riches some pomp and state some mirth some flattery and some a gallant knight But in the diversity of answers he could find no sure dependence The year was well nigh spent when one day as he rode thoughtfully through a forest he saw sitting beneath a tree a lady of such hideous aspect that he turned away his eyes and when she greeted him in seemly sort made no answer What wight art thou the lady said that will not speak to me It may chance that I may resolve thy doubts though I be not fair of aspect If thou wilt do so said King Arthur choose what reward thou wilt thou grim lady and it shall be given thee Swear me this upon thy faith she said and Arthur swore it Then the lady told him the secret and demanded her reward which was that the king should find some fair and courtly knight to be her husband King Arthur hastened to the grim baron s castle and told him one by one all the answers which he had received from his various advisers except the last and not one was admitted as the true one Now yield thee Arthur the giant said for thou hast not paid thy ransom and thou and thy lands are forfeited to me Then King Arthur said Yet hold thy hand thou proud baron I pray thee hold thy hand And give me leave to speak once more In rescue of my land This morn as I came over a moor I saw a lady set Between an oak and a green holly All clad in red scarlett She says ALL WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR WILL This is their chief desire Now yield as thou art a baron true That I have paid my hire It was my sister that told thee this the churlish baron exclaimed Vengeance light on her I will some time or other do her as ill a turn King Arthur rode homeward but not light of heart for he remembered the promise he was under to the loathly lady to give her one of his young and gallant knights for a husband He told his grief to Sir Gawain his nephew and he replied Be not sad my lord for I will marry the loathly lady King Arthur replied Now nay now nay good Sir Gawaine My sister s son ye be The loathly lady s all too grim And all too foule for thee But Gawain persisted and the king at last with sorrow of heart consented that Gawain should be his ransom So one day the king and his knights rode to the forest met the loathly lady and brought her to the court Sir Gawain stood the scoffs and jeers of his companions as he best might and the marriage was solemnized but not with the usual festivities Chaucer tells us There was no joye ne feste at alle There n as but hevinesse and mochel sorwe For prively he wed her on the morwe And all day after hid him as an owle So wo was him his wife loked so foule Footnote N AS is NOT WAS contracted in modern phrase THERE WAS NOT MOCHEL SORWE is much sorrow MORWE is MORROW When night came and they were alone together Sir Gawain could not conceal his aversion and the lady asked him why he sighed so heavily and turned away his face He candidly confessed it was on account of three things her age her ugliness and her low degree The lady not at all offended replied with excellent arguments to all his objections She showed him that with age is discretion with ugliness security from rivals and that all true gentility depends not upon the accident of birth but upon the character of the individual Sir Gawain made no reply but turning his eyes on his bride what was his amazement to perceive that she wore no longer the unseemly aspect that had so distressed him She then told him that the form she had worn was not her true form but a disguise imposed upon her by a wicked enchanter and that she was condemned to wear it until two things should happen one that she should obtain some young and gallant knight to be her husband This having been done one half of the charm was removed She was now at liberty to wear her true form for half the time and she bade him choose whether he would have her fair by day and ugly by night or the reverse Sir Gawain would fain have had her look her best by night when he alone would see her and show her repulsive visage if at all to others But she reminded him how much more pleasant it would be to her to wear her best looks in the throng of knights and ladies by day Sir Gawain yielded and gave up his will to hers This alone was wanting to dissolve the charm The lovely lady now with joy assured him that she should change no more but as she now was so would she remain by night as well as by day Sweet blushes stayned her rud red cheek Her eyen were black as sloe The ripening cherrye swelled her lippe And all her neck was snow Sir Gawain kist that ladye faire Lying upon the sheete And swore as he was a true knight The spice was never so swete The dissolution of the charm which had held the lady also released her brother the grim baron for he too had been implicated in it He ceased to be a churlish oppressor and became a gallant and generous knight as any at Arthur s court CHAPTER VII CARADOC BRIEFBRAS OR CARADOC WITH THE SHRUNKEN ARM Caradoc was the son of Ysenne the beautiful niece of Arthur He was ignorant who his father was till it was discovered in the following manner When the youth was of proper years to receive the honors of knighthood King Arthur held a grand court for the purpose of knighting him On this occasion a strange knight presented himself and challenged the knights of Arthur s court to exchange blow for blow with him His proposal was this to lay his neck on a block for any knight to strike on condition that if he survived the blow the knight should submit in turn to the same experiment Sir Kay who was usually ready to accept all challenges pronounced this wholly unreasonable and declared that he would not accept it for all the wealth in the world And when the knight offered his sword with which the operation was to be performed no person ventured to accept it till Caradoc growing angry at the disgrace which was thus incurred by the Round Table threw aside his mantle and took it Do you do this as one of the best knights said the stranger No he replied but as one of the most foolish The stranger lays his head upon the block receives a blow which sends it rolling from his shoulders walks after it picks it up replaces it with great success and says he will return when the court shall be assembled next year and claim his turn When the anniversary arrived both parties were punctual to their engagement Great entreaties were used by the king and queen and the whole court in behalf of Caradoc but the stranger was inflexible The young knight laid his head upon the block and more than once desired him to make an end of the business and not keep him longer in so disagreeable a state of expectation At last the stranger strikes him gently with the side of the sword bids him rise and reveals to him the fact that he is his father the enchanter Eliaures and that he gladly owns him for a son having proved his courage and fidelity to his word But the favor of enchanters is short lived and uncertain Eliaures fell under the influence of a wicked woman who to satisfy her pique against Caradoc persuaded the enchanter to fasten on his arm a serpent which remained there sucking at his flesh and blood no human skill sufficing either to remove the reptile or alleviate the torments which Caradoc endured Caradoc was betrothed to Guimier sister to his bosom friend Cador and daughter to the king of Cornwall As soon as they were informed of his deplorable condition they set out for Nantes where Caradoc s castle was that Guimier might attend upon him When Caradoc heard of their coming his first emotion was that of joy and love But soon he began to fear that the sight of his emaciated form and of his sufferings would disgust Guimier and this apprehension became so strong that he departed secretly from Nantes and hid himself in a hermitage He was sought far and near by the knights of Arthur s court and Cador made a vow never to desist from the quest till he should have found him After long wandering Cador discovered his friend in the hermitage reduced almost to a skeleton and apparently near his death All other means of relief having already been tried in vain Cador at last prevailed on the enchanter Eliaures to disclose the only method which could avail for his rescue A maiden must be found his equal in birth and beauty and loving him better than herself so that she would expose herself to the same torment to deliver him Two vessels were then to be provided the one filled with sour wine and the other with milk Caradoc must enter the first so that the wine should reach his neck and the maiden must get into the other and exposing her bosom upon the edge of the vessel invite the serpent to forsake the withered flesh of his victim for this fresh and inviting food The vessels were to be placed three feet apart and as the serpent crossed from one to the other a knight was to cut him in two If he failed in his blow Caradoc would indeed be delivered but it would be only to see his fair champion suffering the same cruel and hopeless torment The sequel may be easily foreseen Guimier willingly exposed herself to the perilous adventure and Cador with a lucky blow killed the serpent The arm in which Caradoc had suffered so long recovered its strength but not its shape in consequence of which he was called Caradoc Briefbras Caradoc of the Shrunken Arm Caradoc and Guimier are the hero and heroine of the ballad Of the Boy and the Mantle which follows THE BOY AND THE MANTLE In Carlisle dwelt King Arthur A prince of passing might And there maintained his Table Round Beset with many a knight And there he kept his Christmas With mirth and princely cheer When lo a strange and cunning boy Before him did appear A kirtle and a mantle This boy had him upon With brooches rings and ouches Full daintily bedone He had a sash of silk About his middle meet And thus with seemly curtesie He did King Arthur greet God speed thee brave King Arthur Thus feasting in thy bower And Guenever thy goodly queen That fair and peerless flower Ye gallant lords and lordlings I wish you all take heed Lest what ye deem a blooming rose Should prove a cankered weed Then straightway from his bosom A little wand he drew And with it eke a mantle Of wondrous shape and hue Now have thou here King Arthur Have this here of me And give unto thy comely queen All shapen as you see No wife it shall become That once hath been to blame Then every knight in Arthur s court Sly glanced at his dame And first came Lady Guenever The mantle she must try This dame she was new fangled one And of a roving eye When she had taken the mantle And all with it was clad From top to toe it shivered down As though with shears beshred One while it was too long Another while too short And wrinkled on her shoulders In most unseemly sort Now green now red it seemed Then all of sable hue Beshrew me quoth King Arthur I think thou be saint not true Down she threw the mantle No longer would she stay But storming like a fury To her chamber flung away She cursed the rascal weaver That had the mantle wrought And doubly cursed the froward imp Who thither had it brought I had rather live in deserts Beneath the greenwood tree Than here base king among thy grooms The sport of them and thee Sir Kay called forth his lady And bade her to come near Yet dame if thou be guilty I pray thee now forbear This lady pertly giggling With forward step came on And boldly to the little boy With fearless face is gone When she had taken the mantle With purpose for to wear It shrunk up to her shoulder And left her back all bare Then every merry knight That was in Arthur s court Gibed and laughed and flouted To see that pleasant sport Down she threw the mantle No longer bold or gay But with a face all pale and wan To her chamber slunk away Then forth came an old knight A pattering o er his creed And proffered to the little boy Five nobles to his meed And all the time of Christmas Plum porridge shall be thine If thou wilt let my lady fair Within the mantle shine A saint his lady seemed With step demure and slow And gravely to the mantle With mincing face doth go When she the same had taken That was so fine and thin It shrivelled all about her And showed her dainty skin Ah little did her mincing Or his long prayers bestead She had no more hung on her Than a tassel and a thread Down she threw the mantle With terror and dismay And with a face of scarlet To her chamber hied away Sir Cradock called his lady And bade her to come near Come win this mantle lady And do me credit here Come win this mantle lady For now it shall be thine If thou hast never done amiss Since first I made thee mine The lady gently blushing With modest grace came on And now to try the wondrous charm Courageously is gone When she had ta en the mantle And put it on her back About the hem it seemed To wrinkle and to crack Lie still she cried O mantle And shame me not for naught I ll freely own whate er amiss Or blameful I have wrought Once I kissed Sir Cradock Beneath the greenwood tree Once I kissed Sir Cradock s mouth Before he married me When she had thus her shriven And her worst fault had told The mantle soon became her Right comely as it should Most rich and fair of color Like gold it glittering shone And much the knights in Arthur s court Admired her every one Footnote one New fangled fond of novelty The ballad goes on to tell of two more trials of a similar kind made by means of a boar s head and a drinking horn in both of which the result was equally favorable with the first to Sir Cradock and his lady It then concludes as follows Thus boar s head horn and mantle Were this fair couple s meed And all such constant lovers God send them well to speed Percy s Reliques CHAPTER VIII LAUNCELOT OF THE LAKE King Ban of Brittany the faithful ally of Arthur was attacked by his enemy Claudas and after a long war saw himself reduced to the possession of a single fortress where he was besieged by his enemy In this extremity he determined to solicit the assistance of Arthur and escaped in a dark night with his wife Helen and his infant son Launcelot leaving his castle in the hands of his seneschal who immediately surrendered the place to Claudas The flames of his burning citadel reached the eyes of the unfortunate monarch during his flight and he expired with grief The wretched Helen leaving her child on the brink of a lake flew to receive the last sighs of her husband and on returning perceived the little Launcelot in the arms of a nymph who on the approach of the queen threw herself into the lake with the child This nymph was Viviane mistress of the enchanter Merlin better known by the name of the Lady of the Lake Launcelot received his appellation from having been educated at the court of this enchantress whose palace was situated in the midst not of a real but like the appearance which deceives the African traveller of an imaginary lake whose deluding resemblance served as a barrier to her residence Here she dwelt not alone but in the midst of a numerous retinue and a splendid court of knights and damsels The queen after her double loss retired to a convent where she was joined by the widow of Bohort for this good king had died of grief on hearing of the death of his brother Ban His two sons Lionel and Bohort were rescued by a faithful knight and arrived in the shape of greyhounds at the palace of the lake where having resumed their natural form they were educated along with their cousin Launcelot The fairy when her pupil had attained the age of eighteen conveyed him to the court of Arthur for the purpose of demanding his admission to the honor of knighthood and at the first appearance of the youthful candidate the graces of his person which were not inferior to his courage and skill in arms made an instantaneous and indelible impression on the heart of Guenever while her charms inspired him with an equally ardent and constant passion The mutual attachment of these lovers exerted from that time forth an influence over the whole history of Arthur For the sake of Guenever Launcelot achieved the conquest of Northumberland defeated Gallehaut King of the Marches who afterwards became his most faithful friend and ally exposed himself in numberless encounters and brought hosts of prisoners to the feet of his sovereign SIR LAUNCELOT After King Arthur was come from Rome into England all the knights of the Table Round resorted unto him and made him many justs and tournaments And in especial Sir Launcelot of the Lake in all tournaments and justs and deeds of arms both for life and death passed all other knights and was never overcome except it were by treason or enchantment and he increased marvellously in worship wherefore Queen Guenever had him in great favor above all other knights And for certain he loved the queen again above all other ladies and for her he did many deeds of arms and saved her from peril through his noble chivalry Thus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game and then he thought to prove himself in strange adventures so he bade his nephew Sir Lionel to make him ready for we two will seek adventures So they mounted on their horses armed at all sights and rode into a forest and so into a deep plain And the weather was hot about noon and Sir Launcelot had great desire to sleep Then Sir Lionel espied a great apple tree that stood by a hedge and he said Brother yonder is a fair shadow there may we rest us and our horses It is well said replied Sir Launcelot So they there alighted and Sir Launcelot laid him down and his helm under his head and soon was asleep passing fast And Sir Lionel waked while he slept And presently there came three knights riding as fast as ever they might ride and there followed them but one knight And Sir Lionel thought he never saw so great a knight before So within a while this great knight overtook one of those knights and smote him so that he fell to the earth Then he rode to the second knight and smote him and so he did to the third knight Then he alighted down and bound all the three knights fast with their own bridles When Sir Lionel saw him do thus he thought to assay him and made him ready silently not to awake Sir Launcelot and rode after the strong knight and bade him turn And the other smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man fell to the earth and then he alighted down and bound Sir Lionel and threw him across his own horse and so he served them all four and rode with them away to his own castle And when he came there he put them in a deep prison in which were many more knights in great distress Now while Sir Launcelot lay under the apple tree sleeping there came by him four queens of great estate And that the heat should not grieve them there rode four knights about them and bare a cloth of green silk on four spears betwixt them and the sun And the queens rode on four white mules Thus as they rode they heard by them a great horse grimly neigh Then they were aware of a sleeping knight that lay all armed under an apple tree and as the queens looked on his face they knew it was Sir Launcelot Then they began to strive for that knight and each one said she would have him for her love We will not strive said Morgane le Fay that was King Arthur s sister for I will put an enchantment upon him that he shall not wake for six hours and we will take him away to my castle and then when he is surely within my hold I will take the enchantment from him and then let him choose which of us he will have for his love So the enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot And then they laid him upon his shield and bare him so on horseback between two knights and brought him unto the castle and laid him in a chamber and at night they sent him his supper And on the morning came early those four queens richly dight and bade him good morning and he them again Sir knight they said thou must understand thou art our prisoner and we know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot of the Lake King Ban s son and that thou art the noblest knight living And we know well that there can no lady have thy love but one and that is Queen Guenever and now thou shalt lose her for ever and she thee and therefore it behooveth thee now to choose one of us I am the Queen Morgane le Fay and here is the Queen of North Wales and the Queen of Eastland and the Queen of the Isles Now choose one of us which thou wilt have for if thou choose not in this prison thou shalt die This is a hard case said Sir Launcelot that either I must die or else choose one of you yet had I liever to die in this prison with worship than to have one of you for my paramour for ye be false enchantresses Well said the queens is this your answer that ye will refuse us Yea on my life it is said Sir Launcelot Then they departed making great sorrow Then at noon came a damsel unto him with his dinner and asked him What cheer Truly fair damsel said Sir Launcelot never so ill Sir said she if you will be ruled by me I will help you out of this distress If ye will promise me to help my father on Tuesday next who hath made a tournament betwixt him and the king of North Wales for last Tuesday my father lost the field Fair maiden said Sir Launcelot tell me what is your father s name and then will I give you an answer Sir knight she said my father is King Bagdemagus I know him well said Sir Launcelot for a noble king and a good knight and by the faith of my body I will be ready to do your father and you service at that day So she departed and came on the next morning early and found him ready and brought him out of twelve locks and brought him to his own horse and lightly he saddled him and so rode forth And on the Tuesday next he came to a little wood where the tournament should be And there were scaffolds and holds that lords and ladies might look on and give the prize Then came into the field the king of North Wales with eightscore helms and King Badgemagus came with fourscore helms And then they couched their spears and came together with a great dash and there were overthrown at the first encounter twelve of King Bagdemagus s party and six of the king of North Wales s party and King Bagdemagus s party had the worse With that came Sir Launcelot of the Lake and thrust in with his spear in the thickest of the press and he smote down five knights ere he held his hand and he smote down the king of North Wales and he brake his thigh in that fall And then the knights of the king of North Wales would just no more and so the gree was given to King Bagdemagus And Sir Launcelot rode forth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle and there he had passing good cheer both with the king and with his daughter And on the morn he took his leave and told the king he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel that went from him when he slept So he departed and by adventure he came to the same forest where he was taken sleeping And in the highway he met a damsel riding on a white palfrey and they saluted each other Fair damsel said Sir Launcelot know ye in this country any adventures Sir knight said the damsel here are adventures near at hand if thou durst pursue them Why should I not prove adventures said Sir Launcelot since for that cause came I hither Sir said she hereby dwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for any man I know except thou overmatch him His name is Sir Turquine and as I understand he is a deadly enemy of King Arthur and he has in his prison good knights of Arthur s court threescore and more that he hath won with his own hands Damsel said Launcelot I pray you bring me unto this knight So she told him Hereby within this mile is his castle and by it on the left hand is a ford for horses to drink of and over that ford there groweth a fair tree and on that tree hang many shields that good knights wielded aforetime that are now prisoners and on the tree hangeth a basin of copper and latten and if thou strike upon that basin thou shalt hear tidings And Sir Launcelot departed and rode as the damsel had shown him and shortly he came to the ford and the tree where hung the shields and the basin And among the shields he saw Sir Lionel s and Sir Hector s shields besides many others of knights that he knew Then Sir Launcelot struck on the basin with the butt of his spear and long he did so but he saw no man And at length he was ware of a great knight that drove a horse before him and across the horse there lay an armed knight bounden And as they came near Sir Launcelot thought he should know the captive knight Then Sir Launcelot saw that it was Sir Gaheris Sir Gawain s brother a knight of the Table Round Now fair knight said Sir Launcelot put that wounded knight off the horse and let him rest awhile and let us two prove our strength For as it is told me thou hast done great despite and shame unto knights of the Round Table therefore now defend thee If thou be of the Table Round said Sir Turquine I defy thee and all thy fellowship That is overmuch said said Sir Launcelot Then they put their spears in the rests and came together with their horses as fast as they might run And each smote the other in the middle of their shields so that their horses fell under them and the knights were both staggered and as soon as they could clear their horses they drew out their swords and came together eagerly and each gave the other many strong strokes for neither shield nor harness might withstand their strokes So within a while both had grimly wounds and bled grievously Then at the last they were breathless both and stood leaning upon their swords Now fellow said Sir Turquine thou art the stoutest man that ever I met with and best breathed and so be it thou be not the knight that I hate above all other knights the knight that slew my brother Sir Carados I will gladly accord with thee and for thy love I will deliver all the prisoners that I have What knight is he that thou hatest so above others Truly said Sir Turquine his name is Sir Launcelot of the Lake I am Sir Launcelot of the Lake King Ban s son of Benwick and very knight of the Table Round and now I defy thee do thy best Ah said Sir Turquine Launcelot thou art to me the most welcome that ever was knight for we shall never part till the one of us be dead And then they hurtled together like two wild bulls rashing and lashing with their swords and shields so that sometimes they fell as it were headlong Thus they fought two hours and more till the ground where they fought was all bepurpled with blood Then at the last Sir Turquine waxed sore faint and gave somewhat aback and bare his shield full low for weariness That spied Sir Launcelot and leapt then upon him fiercely as a lion and took him by the beaver of his helmet and drew him down on his knees And he raised off his helm and smote his neck in sunder And Sir Gaheris when he saw Sir Turquine slain said Fair lord I pray you tell me your name for this day I say ye are the best knight in the world for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the best knight except you that ever I saw Sir my name is Sir Launcelot du Lac that ought to help you of right for King Arthur s sake and in especial for Sir Gawain s sake your own dear brother Now I pray you that ye go into yonder castle and set free all the prisoners ye find there for I am sure ye shall find there many knights of the Table Round and especially my brother Sir Lionel I pray you greet them all from me and tell them I bid them take there such stuff as they find and tell my brother to go unto the court and abide me there for by the feast of Pentecost I think to be there but at this time I may not stop for I have adventures on hand So he departed and Sir Gaheris rode into the castle and took the keys from the porter and hastily opened the prison door and let out all the prisoners There was Sir Kay Sir Brandeles and Sir Galynde Sir Bryan and Sir Alyduke Sir Hector de Marys and Sir Lionel and many more And when they saw Sir Gaheris they all thanked him for they thought because he was wounded that he had slain Sir Turquine Not so said Sir Gaheris it was Sir Launcelot that slew him right worshipfully I saw it with mine eyes Sir Launcelot rode till at nightfall he came to a fair castle and therein he found an old gentlewoman who lodged him with good will and there he had good cheer for him and his horse And when time was his host brought him to a fair chamber over the gate to his bed Then Sir Launcelot unarmed him and set his harness by him and went to bed and anon he fell asleep And soon after there came one on horseback and knocked at the gate in great haste and when Sir Launcelot heard this he arose and looked out of the window and saw by the moonlight three knights riding after that one man and all three lashed on him with their swords and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended himself Truly said Sir Launcelot yonder one knight will I help for it is shame to see three knights on one Then he took his harness and went out at the window by a sheet down to the four knights and he said aloud Turn you knights unto me and leave your fighting with that knight Then the knights left Sir Kay for it was he they were upon and turned unto Sir Launcelot and struck many great strokes at Sir Launcelot and assailed him on every side Then Sir Kay addressed him to help Sir Launcelot but he said Nay sir I will none of your help let me alone with them So Sir Kay suffered him to do his will and stood one side And within six strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them down Then they all cried Sir knight we yield us unto you As to that said Sir Launcelot I will not take your yielding unto me If so be ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the Seneschal I will save your lives but else not Fair knight then they said we will do as thou commandest us Then shall ye said Sir Launcelot on Whitsunday next go unto the court of King Arthur and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever and say that Sir Kay sent you thither to be her prisoners Sir they said it shall be done by the faith of our bodies and then they swore every knight upon his sword And so Sir Launcelot suffered them to depart On the morn Sir Launcelot rose early and left Sir Kay sleeping and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay s armor and his shield and armed him and went to the stable and took his horse and so he departed Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot And then he espied that he had taken his armor and his horse Now by my faith I know well said Sir Kay that he will grieve some of King Arthur s knights for they will deem that it is I and will be bold to meet him But by cause of his armor I am sure I shall ride in peace Then Sir Kay thanked his host and departed Sir Launcelot rode in a deep forest and there he saw four knights under an oak and they were of Arthur s court There was Sir Sagramour le Desirus and Hector de Marys and Sir Gawain and Sir Uwaine As they spied Sir Launcelot they judged by his arms it had been Sir Kay Now by my faith said Sir Sagramour I will prove Sir Kay s might and got his spear in his hand and came towards Sir Launcelot Therewith Sir Launcelot couched his spear against him and smote Sir Sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth Then said Sir Hector Now shall ye see what I may do with him But he fared worse than Sir Sagramour for Sir Launcelot s spear went through his shoulder and bare him from his horse to the ground By my faith said Sir Uwaine yonder is a strong knight and I fear he hath slain Sir Kay and taken his armor And therewith Sir Uwaine took his spear in hand and rode toward Sir Launcelot and Sir Launcelot met him on the plain and gave him such a buffet that he was staggered and wist not where he was Now see I well said Sir Gawain that I must encounter with that knight Then he adjusted his shield and took a good spear in his hand and Sir Launcelot knew him well Then they let run their horses with all their mights and each knight smote the other in the middle of his shield But Sir Gawain s spear broke and Sir Launcelot charged so sore upon him that his horse fell over backward Then Sir Launcelot passed by smiling with himself and he said Good luck be with him that made this spear for never came a better into my hand Then the four knights went each to the other and comforted one another What say ye to this adventure said Sir Gawain that one spear hath felled us all four I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot said Sir Hector I know it by his riding And Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries till by fortune he came to a fair castle and as he passed beyond the castle he thought he heard two bells ring And then he perceived how a falcon came flying over his head toward a high elm and she had long lunys Footnote LUNYS the string with which the falcon is held about her feet and she flew unto the elm to take her perch and the lunys got entangled in the bough and when she would have taken her flight she hung by the legs fast and Sir Launcelot saw how she hung and beheld the fair falcon entangled and he was sorry for her Then came a lady out of the castle and cried aloud O Launcelot Launcelot as thou art the flower of all knights help me to get my hawk for if my hawk be lost my lord will slay me he is so hasty What is your lord s name said Sir Launcelot His name is Sir Phelot a knight that belongeth to the king of North Wales Well fair lady since ye know my name and require me of knighthood to help you I will do what I may to get your hawk and yet in truth I am an ill climber and the tree is passing high and few boughs to help me And therewith Sir Launcelot alighted and tied his horse to the tree and prayed the lady to unarm him And when he was unarmed he put off his jerkin and with might and force he clomb up to the falcon and tied the lunys to a rotten bough and threw the hawk down with it and the lady got the hawk in her hand Then suddenly there came out of the castle her husband all armed and with his naked sword in his hand and said O Knight Launcelot now have I got thee as I would and stood at the boll of the tree to slay him Ah lady said Sir Launcelot why have ye betrayed me She hath done said Sir Phelot but as I commanded her and therefore there is none other way but thine hour is come and thou must die That were shame unto thee said Sir Launcelot thou an armed knight to slay a naked man by treason Thou gettest none other grace said Sir Phelot and therefore help thyself if thou canst Alas said Sir Launcelot that ever a knight should die weaponless And therewith he turned his eyes upward and downward and over his head he saw a big bough leafless and he brake it off from the trunk And then he came lower and watched how his own horse stood and suddenly he leapt on the further side of his horse from the knight Then Sir Phelot lashed at him eagerly meaning to have slain him But Sir Launcelot put away the stroke with the big bough and smote Sir Phelot therewith on the side of the head so that he fell down in a swoon to the ground Then Sir Launcelot took his sword out of his hand and struck his head from the body Then said the lady Alas why hast thou slain my husband I am not the cause said Sir Launcelot for with falsehood ye would have slain me and now it is fallen on yourselves Thereupon Sir Launcelot got all his armor and put it upon him hastily for fear of more resort for the knight s castle was so nigh And as soon as he might he took his horse and departed and thanked God he had escaped that adventure And two days before the feast of Pentecost Sir Launcelot came home and the king and all the court were passing glad of his coming And when Sir Gawain Sir Uwaine Sir Sagramour and Sir Hector de Marys saw Sir Launcelot in Sir Kay s armor then they wist well it was he that smote them down all with one spear Then there was laughing and merriment among them and from time to time came all the knights that Sir Turquine had prisoners and they all honored and worshipped Sir Launcelot Then Sir Gaheris said I saw all the battle from the beginning to the end and he told King Arthur all how it was Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued him and how he made the knights yield to me and not to him And there they were all three and confirmed it all And by my faith said Sir Kay because Sir Launcelot took my harness and left me his I rode in peace and no man would have to do with me And so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of the world and most was he honored of high and low

none	none	 THE ADVENTURE OF THE CART It befell in the month of May Queen Guenever called to her knights of the Table Round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside Westminster and I warn you that there be none of you but he be well horsed and that ye all be clothed in green either silk or cloth and I shall bring with me ten ladies and every knight shall have a lady behind him and every knight shall have a squire and two yeoman and all well horsed
3436_172162_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 For thus it chanced one morn when all the court Green suited but with plumes that mock d the May Had been their wont a maying 
none	none	Guinevere So they made them ready and these were the names of the knights Sir Kay the Seneschal Sir Agrivaine Sir Brandiles Sir Sagramour le Desirus Sir Dodynas le Sauvage Sir Ozanna Sir Ladynas Sir Persant of Inde Sir Ironside and Sir Pelleas and these ten knights made them ready in the freshest manner to ride with the queen 
3436_172162_000007_000001	train-clean-100	So upon the morn they took their horses with the queen and rode a maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them in great joy and delight 
none	none	Now there was a knight named Maleagans son to King Brademagus who loved Queen Guenever passing well and so had he done long and many years 
3436_172162_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Now this knight Sir Maleagans learned the queen s purpose and that she had no men of arms with her but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights 
3436_172162_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 In the merry month of May In a morn at break of day With a troop of damsels playing The Queen forsooth went forth a maying 
3436_172162_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Old Song 
3436_172162_000010_000000	train-clean-100	So when the queen had mayed and all were bedecked with herbs mosses and flowers in the best manner and freshest right then came out of a wood Sir Maleagans with eightscore men well harnessed and bade the queen and her knights yield them prisoners 
none	none	Traitor knight said Queen Guenever what wilt thou do 
3436_172162_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Wilt thou shame thyself 
none	none	Bethink thee how thou art a king s son and a knight of the Table Round and how thou art about to dishonor all knighthood and thyself Be it as it may said Sir Maleagans know you well madam I have loved you many a year and never till now could I get you to such advantage as I do now and therefore I will take you as I find you Then the ten knights of the Round Table drew their swords and the other party run at them with their spears and the ten knights manfully abode them and smote away their spears 
3436_172162_000010_000004	train-clean-100	Then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth 
none	none	So when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed and needs must be slain at the last then for pity and sorrow she cried Sir Maleagans slay not my noble knights and I will go with you upon this covenant that they be led with me wheresoever thou leadest me Madame said Maleagans for your sake they shall be led with you into my own castle if that ye will be ruled and ride with me Then Sir Maleagans charged them all that none should depart from the queen for he dreaded lest Sir Launcelot should have knowledge of what had been done Then the queen privily called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly horsed to whom she said Go thou when thou seest thy time and bear this ring unto Sir Launcelot and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me And spare not thy horse said the queen neither for water nor for land So the child espied his time and lightly he took his horse with the spurs and departed as fast as he might 
3436_172162_000011_000002	train-clean-100	And when Sir Maleagans saw him so flee he understood that it was by the queen s commandment for to warn Sir Launcelot 
3436_172162_000011_000003	train-clean-100	Then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at him but the child went from them all 
none	none	Then Sir Maleagans said to the queen Madam ye are about to betray me but I shall arrange for Sir Launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you Then he rode with her and them all to his castle in all the haste that they might 
3436_172162_000011_000005	train-clean-100	And by the way Sir Maleagans laid in ambush the best archers that he had to wait for Sir Launcelot 
none	none	And the child came to Westminster and found Sir Launcelot and told his message and delivered him the queen s ring Alas said Sir Launcelot now am I shamed for ever unless I may rescue that noble lady Then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might and men say he took the water at Westminster Bridge and made his horse swim over Thames unto Lambeth 
3436_172162_000011_000007	train-clean-100	Then within a while he came to a wood where was a narrow way and there the archers were laid in ambush 
3436_172162_000011_000008	train-clean-100	And they shot at him and smote his horse so that he fell 
3436_172162_000011_000009	train-clean-100	Then Sir Launcelot left his horse and went on foot but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them 
3436_172162_000011_000010	train-clean-100	 Alas for shame said Sir Launcelot that ever one knight should betray another but it is an old saw a good man is never in danger but when he is in danger of a coward Then Sir Launcelot went awhile and he was exceedingly cumbered by his armor his shield and his spear and all that belonged to him 
3436_172162_000011_000011	train-clean-100	Then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood 
3436_172162_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Now at this time carts were little used except for carrying offal and for conveying criminals to execution 
3436_172162_000012_000001	train-clean-100	But Sir Launcelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen so he demanded of the carter that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward 
3436_172162_000012_000002	train-clean-100	The carter consented and Sir Launcelot placed himself in the cart and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress 
3436_172162_000012_000003	train-clean-100	Then it happened Sir Gawain passed by and seeing an armed knight travelling in that unusual way he drew near to see who it might be 
3436_172162_000012_000004	train-clean-100	Then Sir Launcelot told him how the queen had been carried off and how in hastening to her rescue his horse had been disabled and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise 
3436_172162_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Then Sir Gawain said Surely it is unworthy of a knight to travel in such sort but Sir Launcelot heeded him not 
3436_172162_000013_000000	train-clean-100	At nightfall they arrived at a castle and the lady thereof came out at the head of her damsels to welcome Sir Gawain 
3436_172162_000013_000001	train-clean-100	But to admit his companion whom she supposed to be a criminal or at least a prisoner it pleased her not however to oblige Sir Gawain she consented 
3436_172162_000013_000002	train-clean-100	At supper Sir Launcelot came near being consigned to the kitchen and was only admitted to the lady s table at the earnest solicitation of Sir Gawain 
3436_172162_000013_000003	train-clean-100	Neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him 
3436_172162_000013_000004	train-clean-100	He seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed 
none	none	Next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen 
3436_172162_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Sir Gawain thought it might be so and became equally eager to depart 
3436_172162_000014_000002	train-clean-100	The lady of the castle supplied Sir Launcelot with a horse and they traversed the plain at full speed 
3436_172162_000014_000003	train-clean-100	They learned from some travellers whom they met that there were two roads which led to the castle of Sir Maleagans 
none	none	Here therefore the friends separated Sir Launcelot found his way beset with obstacles which he encountered successfully but not without much loss of time 
3436_172162_000014_000005	train-clean-100	As evening approached he was met by a young and sportive damsel who gayly proposed to him a supper at her castle 
3436_172162_000014_000006	train-clean-100	The knight who was hungry and weary accepted the offer though with no very good grace 
3436_172162_000014_000007	train-clean-100	He followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper but was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances 
none	none	Suddenly the scene changed and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled when again there was a change and he found himself alone with his fair hostess who informed him that she was none other than his guardian fairy who had but subjected him to tests of his courage and fidelity 
3436_172162_000014_000009	train-clean-100	The next day the fairy brought him on his road and before parting gave him a ring which she told him would by its changes of color disclose to him all enchantments and enable him to subdue them 
3436_172162_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Sir Launcelot pursued his journey without being much incommoded except by the taunts of travellers who all seemed to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart 
3436_172162_000015_000001	train-clean-100	One more insolent than the rest had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry 
3436_172162_000015_000002	train-clean-100	Launcelot after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn 
3436_172162_000016_000000	train-clean-100	At night he was received at another castle with great apparent hospitality but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains 
3436_172162_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment he burst his chains seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it broke open the gates of the tower and continued his journey 
3436_172162_000016_000002	train-clean-100	At length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent which could only be passed on a narrow bridge on which a false step would prove his destruction 
none	none	Launcelot leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side passed over the bridge and was attacked as soon as he reached the bank by a lion and a leopard both of which he slew and then exhausted and bleeding seated himself on the grass and endeavored to bind up his wounds when he was accosted by Brademagus the father of Maleagans whose castle was then in sight and at no great distance This king no less courteous than his son was haughty and insolent after complimenting Sir Launcelot on the valor and skill he had displayed in the perils of the bridge and the wild beasts offered him his assistance and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle but could only be rescued by encountering Maleagans Launcelot demanded the battle for the next day and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower and under the eyes of the fair captive 
3436_172162_000016_000005	train-clean-100	Launcelot was enfeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit and the contest for a time was doubtful till Guenever exclaimed Ah Launcelot my knight truly have I been told that thou art no longer worthy of me These words instantly revived the drooping knight he resumed at once his usual superiority and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary 
3436_172162_000017_000000	train-clean-100	He was on the point of sacrificing him to his resentment when Guenever moved by the entreaties of Brademagus ordered him to withhold the blow and he obeyed 
none	none	The castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal Launcelot hastened to the apartment of the queen threw himself at her feet and was about to kiss her hand when she exclaimed Ah Launcelot why do I see thee again yet feel thee to be no longer worthy of me after having been disgracefully drawn about the country in a She had not time to finish the phrase for her lover suddenly started from her and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady rushed out of the castle threw his sword and his shield to the right and left ran furiously into the woods and disappeared 
3436_172162_000018_000000	train-clean-100	It seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted Launcelot at every step had reached the ears of Sir Kay who had told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonored 
3436_172162_000018_000001	train-clean-100	But Guenever had full leisure to repent the haste with which she had given credit to the tale 
3436_172162_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Three days elapsed during which Launcelot wandered without knowing where he went till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation and that it was his duty to set her right 
none	none	He therefore returned compelled Maleagans to release his prisoners and taking the road by which they expected the arrival of Sir Gawain had the satisfaction of meeting him the next day after which the whole company proceeded gayly towards Camelot CHAPTER X THE LADY OF SHALOTT King Arthur proclaimed a solemn tournament to be held at Winchester The king not less impatient than his knights for this festival set off some days before to superintend the preparations leaving the queen with her court at Camelot Sir Launcelot under pretence of indisposition remained behind also His intention was to attend the tournament in disguise and having communicated his project to Guenever he mounted his horse set off without any attendant and counterfeiting the feebleness of age took the most unfrequented road to Winchester and passed unnoticed as an old knight who was going to be a spectator of the sports Even Arthur and Gawain who happened to behold him from the windows of a castle under which he passed were the dupes of his disguise But an accident betrayed him His horse happened to stumble and the hero forgetting for a moment his assumed character recovered the animal with a strength and agility so peculiar to himself that they instantly recognized the inimitable Launcelot They suffered him however to proceed on his journey without interruption convinced that his extraordinary feats of arms must discover him at the approaching festival In the evening Launcelot was magnificently entertained as a stranger knight at the neighboring castle of Shalott The lord of this castle had a daughter of exquisite beauty and two sons lately received into the order of knighthood one of whom was at that time ill in bed and thereby prevented from attending the tournament for which both brothers had long made preparation Launcelot offered to attend the other if he were permitted to borrow the armor of the invalid and the lord of Shalott without knowing the name of his guest being satisfied from his appearance that his son could not have a better assistant in arms most thankfully accepted the offer In the meantime the young lady who had been much struck by the first appearance of the stranger knight continued to survey him with increased attention and before the conclusion of supper became so deeply enamoured of him that after frequent changes of color and other symptoms which Sir Launcelot could not possibly mistake she was obliged to retire to her chamber and seek relief in tears Sir Launcelot hastened to convey to her by means of her brother the information that his heart was already disposed of but that it would be his pride and pleasure to act as her knight at the approaching tournament The lady obliged to be satisfied with that courtesy presented him her scarf to be worn at the tournament Launcelot set off in the morning with the young knight who on their approaching Winchester carried him to the castle of a lady sister to the lord of Shalott by whom they were hospitably entertained The next day they put on their armor which was perfectly plain and without any device as was usual to youths during the first year of knighthood their shields being only painted red as some color was necessary to enable them to be recognized by their attendants Launcelot wore on his crest the scarf of the maid of Shalott and thus equipped proceeded to the tournament where the knights were divided into two companies the one commanded by Sir Galehaut the other by King Arthur Having surveyed the combat for a short time from without the lists and observed that Sir Galehaut s party began to give way they joined the press and attacked the royal knights the young man choosing such adversaries as were suited to his strength while his companion selected the principal champions of the Round Table and successively overthrew Gawain Bohort and Lionel The astonishment of the spectators was extreme for it was thought that no one but Launcelot could possess such invincible force yet the favor on his crest seemed to preclude the possibility of his being thus disguised for Launcelot had never been known to wear the badge of any but his sovereign lady At length Sir Hector Launcelot s brother engaged him and after a dreadful combat wounded him dangerously in the head but was himself completely stunned by a blow on the helmet and felled to the ground after which the conqueror rode off at full speed attended by his companion They returned to the castle of Shalott where Launcelot was attended with the greatest care by the good earl by his two sons and above all by his fair daughter whose medical skill probably much hastened the period of his recovery His health was almost completely restored when Sir Hector Sir Bohort and Sir Lionel who after the return of the court to Camelot had undertaken the quest of their relation discovered him walking on the walls of the castle Their meeting was very joyful they passed three days in the castle amidst constant festivities and bantered each other on the events of the tournament Launcelot though he began by vowing vengeance against the author of his wound yet ended by declaring that he felt rewarded for the pain by the pride he took in witnessing his brother s extraordinary prowess He then dismissed them with a message to the queen promising to follow immediately it being necessary that he should first take a formal leave of his kind hosts as well as of the fair maid of Shalott The young lady after vainly attempting to detain him by her tears and solicitations saw him depart without leaving her any ground for hope It was early summer when the tournament took place but some months had passed since Launcelot s departure and winter was now near at hand The health and strength of the Lady of Shalott had gradually sunk and she felt that she could not live apart from the object of her affections She left the castle and descending to the river s brink placed herself in a boat which she loosed from its moorings and suffered to bear her down the current toward Camelot One morning as Arthur and Sir Lionel looked from the window of the tower the walls of which were washed by a river they descried a boat richly ornamented and covered with an awning of cloth of gold which appeared to be floating down the stream without any human guidance It struck the shore while they watched it and they hastened down to examine it Beneath the awning they discovered the dead body of a beautiful woman in whose features Sir Lionel easily recognized the lovely maid of Shalott Pursuing their search they discovered a purse richly embroidered with gold and jewels and within the purse a letter which Arthur opened and found addressed to himself and all the knights of the Round Table stating that Launcelot of the Lake the most accomplished of knights and most beautiful of men but at the same time the most cruel and inflexible had by his rigor produced the death of the wretched maiden whose love was no less invincible than his cruelty The king immediately gave orders for the interment of the lady with all the honors suited to her rank at the same time explaining to the knights the history of her affection for Launcelot which moved the compassion and regret of all Tennyson has chosen the story of the Lady of Shalott for the subject of a poem The catastrophe is told thus Under tower and balcony By garden wall and gallery A gleaming shape she floated by A corse between the houses high Silent into Camelot Out upon the wharfs they came Knight and burgher lord and dame And round the prow they read her name The Lady of Shalott Who is this and what is here And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer And they crossed themselves for fear All the knights at Camelot But Launcelot mused a little space He said She has a lovely face God in his mercy lend her grace The Lady of Shalott CHAPTER XI QUEEN GUENEVER S PERIL It happened at this time that Queen Guenever was thrown into great peril of her life A certain squire who was in her immediate service having some cause of animosity to Sir Gawain determined to destroy him by poison at a public entertainment For this purpose he concealed the poison in an apple of fine appearance which he placed on the top of several others and put the dish before the queen hoping that as Sir Gawain was the knight of greatest dignity she would present the apple to him But it happened that a Scottish knight of high distinction who arrived on that day was seated next to the queen and to him as a stranger she presented the apple which he had no sooner eaten than he was seized with dreadful pain and fell senseless The whole court was of course thrown into confusion the knights rose from table darting looks of indignation at the wretched queen whose tears and protestations were unable to remove their suspicions In spite of all that could be done the knight died and nothing remained but to order a magnificent funeral and monument for him which was done Some time after Sir Mador brother of the murdered knight arrived at Arthur s court in quest of him While hunting in the forest he by chance came to the spot where the monument was erected read the inscription and returned to court determined on immediate and signal vengeance He rode into the hall loudly accused the queen of treason and insisted on her being given up for punishment unless she should find by a certain day a knight hardy enough to risk his life in support of her innocence Arthur powerful as he was did not dare to deny the appeal but was compelled with a heavy heart to accept it and Mador sternly took his departure leaving the royal couple plunged in terror and anxiety During all this time Launcelot was absent and no one knew where he was He fled in anger from his fair mistress upon being reproached by her with his passion for the Lady of Shalott which she had hastily inferred from his wearing her scarf at the tournament He took up his abode with a hermit in the forest and resolved to think no more of the cruel beauty whose conduct he thought must flow from a wish to get rid of him Yet calm reflection had somewhat cooled his indignation and he had begun to wish though hardly able to hope for a reconciliation when the news of Sir Mador s challenge fortunately reached his ears The intelligence revived his spirits and he began to prepare with the utmost cheerfulness for a contest which if successful would insure him at once the affection of his mistress and the gratitude of his sovereign The sad fate of the Lady of Shalott had ere this completely acquitted Launcelot in the queen s mind of all suspicion of his fidelity and she lamented most grievously her foolish quarrel with him which now at her time of need deprived her of her most efficient champion As the day appointed by Sir Mador was fast approaching it became necessary that she should procure a champion for her defence and she successively adjured Sir Hector Sir Lionel Sir Bohort and Sir Gawain to undertake the battle She fell on her knees before them called heaven to witness her innocence of the crime alleged against her but was sternly answered by all that they could not fight to maintain the innocence of one whose act and the fatal consequence of it they had seen with their own eyes She retired therefore dejected and disconsolate but the sight of the fatal pile on which if guilty she was doomed to be burned exciting her to fresh effort she again repaired to Sir Bohort threw herself at his feet and piteously calling on him for mercy fell into a swoon The brave knight was not proof against this He raised her up and hastily promised that he would undertake her cause if no other or better champion should present himself He then summoned his friends and told them his resolution and as a mortal combat with Sir Mador was a most fearful enterprise they agreed to accompany him in the morning to the hermitage in the forest where he proposed to receive absolution from the hermit and to make his peace with Heaven before he entered the lists As they approached the hermitage they espied a knight riding in the forest whom they at once recognized as Sir Launcelot Overjoyed at the meeting they quickly in answer to his questions confirmed the news of the queen s imminent danger and received his instructions to return to court to comfort her as well as they could but to say nothing of his intention of undertaking her defence which he meant to do in the character of an unknown adventurer On their return to the castle they found that mass was finished and had scarcely time to speak to the queen before they were summoned into the hall to dinner A general gloom was spread over the countenances of all the guests Arthur himself was unable to conceal his dejection and the wretched Guenever motionless and bathed in tears sat in trembling expectation of Sir Mador s appearance Nor was it long ere he stalked into the hall and with a voice of thunder rendered more impressive by the general silence demanded instant justice on the guilty party Arthur replied with dignity that little of the day was yet spent and that perhaps a champion might yet be found capable of satisfying his thirst for battle Sir Bohort now rose from table and shortly returning in complete armor resumed his place after receiving the embraces and thanks of the king who now began to resume some degree of confidence Sir Mador growing impatient again repeated his denunciations of vengeance and insisted that the combat should no longer be postponed In the height of the debate there came riding into the hall a knight mounted on a black steed and clad in black armor with his visor down and lance in hand Sir said the king is it your will to alight and partake of our cheer Nay sir he replied I come to save a lady s life The queen hath ill bestowed her favors and honored many a knight that in her hour of need she should have none to take her part Thou that darest accuse her of treachery stand forth for to day shalt thou need all thy might Sir Mador though surprised was not appalled by the stern challenge and formidable appearance of his antagonist but prepared for the encounter At the first shock both were unhorsed They then drew their swords and commenced a combat which lasted from noon till evening when Sir Mador whose strength began to fail was felled to the ground by Launcelot and compelled to sue for mercy The victor whose arm was already raised to terminate the life of his opponent instantly dropped his sword courteously lifted up the fainting Sir Mador frankly confessing that he had never before encountered so formidable an enemy The other with similar courtesy solemnly renounced all further projects of vengeance for his brother s death and the two knights now become fast friends embraced each other with the greatest cordiality In the meantime Arthur having recognized Sir Launcelot whose helmet was now unlaced rushed down into the lists followed by all his knights to welcome and thank his deliverer Guenever swooned with joy and the place of combat suddenly exhibited a scene of the most tumultuous delight The general satisfaction was still further increased by the discovery of the real culprit Having accidentally incurred some suspicion he confessed his crime and was publicly punished in the presence of Sir Mador The court now returned to the castle which with the title of La Joyeuse Garde bestowed upon it in memory of the happy event was conferred on Sir Launcelot by Arthur as a memorial of his gratitude CHAPTER XII TRISTRAM AND ISOUDE Meliadus was king of Leonois or Lionesse a country famous in the annals of romance which adjoined the kingdom of Cornwall but has now disappeared from the map having been it is said overwhelmed by the ocean Meliadus was married to Isabella sister of Mark king of Cornwall A fairy fell in love with him and drew him away by enchantment while he was engaged in hunting

none	none	Meliadus after seven years married again and the new queen being jealous of the influence of Tristram with his father laid plots for his life which were discovered by Gouvernail who in consequence fled with the boy to the court of the king of France where Tristram was kindly received and grew up improving in every gallant and knightly accomplishment adding to his skill in arms the arts of music and of chess 
3905_172165_000002_000001	train-clean-360	In particular he devoted himself to the chase and to all woodland sports so that he became distinguished above all other chevaliers of the court for his knowledge of all that relates to hunting 
3905_172165_000002_000002	train-clean-360	No wonder that Belinda the king s daughter fell in love with him but as he did not return her passion she in a sudden impulse of anger excited her father against him and he was banished the kingdom 
3905_172165_000002_000003	train-clean-360	The princess soon repented of her act and in despair destroyed herself having first written a most tender letter to Tristram sending him at the same time a beautiful and sagacious dog of which she was very fond desiring him to keep it as a memorial of her 
none	none	Meliadus was now dead and as his queen Tristram s stepmother held the throne Gouvernail was afraid to carry his pupil to his native country and took him to Cornwall to his uncle Mark who gave him a kind reception King Mark resided at the castle of Tintadel already mentioned in the history of Uther and Igerne In this court Tristram became distinguished in all the exercises incumbent on a knight nor was it long before he had an opportunity of practically employing his valor and skill Moraunt a celebrated champion brother to the queen of Ireland arrived at the court to demand tribute of King Mark 
3905_172165_000003_000003	train-clean-360	The knights of Cornwall are in ill repute in romance for their cowardice and they exhibited it on this occasion 
3905_172165_000003_000004	train-clean-360	King Mark could find no champion who dared to encounter the Irish knight till his nephew Tristram who had not yet received the honors of knighthood craved to be admitted to the order offering at the same time to fight the battle of Cornwall against the Irish champion 
3905_172165_000003_000005	train-clean-360	King Mark assented with reluctance Tristram received the accolade which conferred knighthood upon him and the place and time were assigned for the encounter 
none	none	Without attempting to give the details of this famous combat the first and one of the most glorious of Tristram s exploits we shall only say that the young knight though severely wounded cleft the head of Moraunt leaving a portion of his sword in the wound Moraunt half dead with his wound and the disgrace of his defeat hastened to hide himself in his ship sailed away with all speed for Ireland and died soon after arriving in his own country 
3905_172165_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The kingdom of Cornwall was thus delivered from its tribute Tristram weakened by loss of blood fell senseless

3905_172165_000005_000008	train-clean-360	The strange harper was sent for and conveyed to the palace where finding that he was in Ireland whose champion he had lately slain he concealed his name and called himself Tramtris 
3905_172165_000005_000009	train-clean-360	The queen undertook his cure and by a medicated bath gradually restored him to health 
none	none	His skill in music and in games occasioned his being frequently called to court and he became the instructor of the princess Isoude in minstrelsy and poetry who profited so well under his care that she soon had no equal in the kingdom except her instructor 
3905_172165_000006_000000	train-clean-360	At this time a tournament was held at which many knights of the Round Table and others were present 
3905_172165_000006_000001	train-clean-360	On the first day a Saracen prince named Palamedes obtained the advantage over all 
none	none	They brought him to the court and gave him a feast at which Tristram just recovering from his wound was present The fair Isoude appeared on this occasion in all her charms 
3905_172165_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Palamedes could not behold them without emotion and made no effort to conceal his love 
3905_172165_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Tristram perceived it and the pain he felt from jealousy taught him how dear the fair Isoude had already become to him 
3905_172165_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Next day the tournament was renewed 
3905_172165_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Tristram still feeble from his wound rose during the night took his arms and concealed them in a forest near the place of the contest and after it had begun mingled with the combatants 
none	none	He overthrew all that encountered him in particular Palamedes whom he brought to the ground with a stroke of his lance and then fought him hand to hand bearing off the prize of the tourney 
3905_172165_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But his exertions caused his wound to reopen he bled fast and in this sad state yet in triumph they bore him to the palace 
none	none	The fair Isoude devoted herself to his relief with an interest which grew more vivid day by day and her skilful care soon restored him to health 
3905_172165_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It happened one day that a damsel of the court entering the closet where Tristram s arms were deposited perceived that a part of the sword had been broken off 
3905_172165_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It occurred to her that the missing portion was like that which was left in the skull of Moraunt the Irish champion 
3905_172165_000008_000002	train-clean-360	She imparted her thought to the queen who compared the fragment taken from her brother s wound with the sword of Tristram and was satisfied that it was part of the same and that the weapon of Tristram was that which reft her brother s life

3905_172165_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Tristram was cited before the whole court and reproached with having dared to present himself before them after having slain their kinsman 
3905_172165_000008_000005	train-clean-360	He acknowledged that he had fought with Moraunt to settle the claim for tribute and said that it was by force of winds and waves alone that he was thrown on their coast 
3905_172165_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The queen demanded vengeance for the death of her brother the fair Isoude trembled and grew pale but a murmur rose from all the assembly that the life of one so handsome and so brave should not be taken for such a cause and generosity finally triumphed over resentment in the mind of the king 
none	none	Tristram was dismissed in safety but commanded to leave the kingdom without delay and never to return thither under pain of death Tristram went back with restored health to Cornwall 
3905_172165_000009_000000	train-clean-360	King Mark made his nephew give him a minute recital of his adventures 
none	none	Tristram told him all minutely but when he came to speak of the fair Isoude he described her charms with a warmth and energy such as none but a lover could display 
3905_172165_000009_000002	train-clean-360	King Mark was fascinated with the description and choosing a favorable time demanded a boon Footnote Good faith was the very corner stone of chivalry 
3905_172165_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Whenever a knight s word was pledged it mattered not how rashly it was to be redeemed at any price 
none	none	Hence the sacred obligation of the boon granted by a knight to his suppliant Instances without number occur in romance in which a knight by rashly granting an indefinite boon was obliged to do or suffer something extremely to his prejudice But it is not in romance alone that we find such singular instances of adherence to an indefinite promise 
3905_172165_000009_000006	train-clean-360	The history of the times presents authentic transactions equally embarrassing and absurd SCOTT note to Sir Tristram of his nephew who readily granted it 
none	none	The king made him swear upon the holy reliques that he would fulfil his commands Then Mark directed him to go to Ireland and obtain for him the fair Isoude to be queen of Cornwall 
3905_172165_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Tristram believed it was certain death for him to return to Ireland and how could he act as ambassador for his uncle in such a cause 
3905_172165_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Yet bound by his oath he hesitated not for an instant He only took the precaution to change his armor 
3905_172165_000010_000002	train-clean-360	He embarked for Ireland but a tempest drove him to the coast of England near Camelot where King Arthur was holding his court attended by the knights of the Round Table and many others the most illustrious in the world 
none	none	Tristram kept himself unknown 
3905_172165_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He took part in many justs he fought many combats in which he covered himself with glory 
none	none	One day he saw among those recently arrived the king of Ireland father of the fair Isoude 
3905_172165_000011_000003	train-clean-360	This prince accused of treason against his liege sovereign Arthur came to Camelot to free himself from the charge 
none	none	Blaanor one of the most redoubtable warriors of the Round Table was his accuser and Argius the king had neither youthful vigor nor strength to encounter him He must therefore seek a champion to sustain his innocence But the knights of the Round Table were not at liberty to fight against one another unless in a quarrel of their own 
3905_172165_000011_000007	train-clean-360	Argius heard of the great renown of the unknown knight he also was witness of his exploits 
3905_172165_000011_000008	train-clean-360	He sought him and conjured him to adopt his defence and on his oath declared that he was innocent of the crime of which he was accused 
3905_172165_000011_000009	train-clean-360	Tristram readily consented and made himself known to the king who on his part promised to reward his exertions if successful with whatever gift he might ask 
3905_172165_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Tristram fought with Blaanor and overthrew him and held his life in his power 
none	none	The fallen warrior called on him to use his right of conquest and strike the fatal blow
3905_172165_000012_000002	train-clean-360	 God forbid said Tristram that I should take the life of so brave a knight He raised him up and restored him to his friends 
3905_172165_000012_000003	train-clean-360	The judges of the field decided that the king of Ireland was acquitted of the charge against him and they led Tristram in triumph to his tent 
none	none	King Argius full of gratitude conjured Tristram to accompany him to his kingdom 
3905_172165_000012_000005	train-clean-360	They departed together and arrived in Ireland and the queen forgetting her resentment for her brother s death exhibited to the preserver of her husband s life nothing but gratitude and good will 
none	none	How happy a moment for Isoude who knew that her father had promised his deliverer whatever boon he might ask But the unhappy Tristram gazed on her with despair at the thought of the cruel oath which bound him His magnanimous soul subdued the force of his love He revealed the oath which he had taken and with trembling voice demanded the fair Isoude for his uncle Argius consented and soon all was prepared for the departure of Isoude 
3905_172165_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Brengwain her favorite maid of honor was to accompany her 
none	none	On the day of departure the queen took aside this devoted attendant and told her that she had observed that her daughter and Tristram were attached to one another and that to avert the bad effects of this inclination she had procured from a powerful fairy a potent philter love draught which she directed Brengwain to administer to Isoude and to King Mark on the evening of their marriage Isoude and Tristram embarked together 
3905_172165_000015_000001	train-clean-360	A favorable wind filled the sails and promised them a fortunate voyage 
none	none	The lovers gazed upon one another and could not repress their sighs 
3905_172165_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Love seemed to light up all his fires on their lips as in their hearts 
3905_172165_000015_000004	train-clean-360	The day was warm they suffered from thirst 
none	none	Isoude first complained Tristram descried the bottle containing the love draught which Brengwain had been so imprudent as to leave in sight 
3905_172165_000015_000006	train-clean-360	He took it gave some of it to the charming Isoude and drank the remainder himself 
none	none	The dog Houdain licked the cup The ship arrived in Cornwall and Isoude was married to King Mark The old monarch was delighted with his bride and his gratitude to Tristram was unbounded 
3905_172165_000015_000009	train-clean-360	He loaded him with honors and made him chamberlain of his palace thus giving him access to the queen at all times 
3905_172165_000016_000000	train-clean-360	In the midst of the festivities of the court which followed the royal marriage an unknown minstrel one day presented himself bearing a harp of peculiar construction 
3905_172165_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He excited the curiosity of King Mark by refusing to play upon it till he should grant him a boon 
none	none	The king having promised to grant his request the minstrel who was none other than the Saracen knight Sir Palamedes the lover of the fair Isoude sung to the harp a lay in which he demanded Isoude as the promised gift 
3905_172165_000016_000003	train-clean-360	King Mark could not by the laws of knighthood withhold the boon 
3905_172165_000016_000004	train-clean-360	The lady was mounted on her horse and led away by her triumphant lover Tristram it is needless to say was absent at the time and did not return until their departure 
none	none	When he heard what had taken place he seized his rote and hastened to the shore where Isoude and her new master had already embarked Tristram played upon his rote and the sound reached the ears of Isoude who became so deeply affected that Sir Palamedes was induced to return with her to land that they might see the unknown musician Tristram watched his opportunity seized the lady s horse by the bridle and plunged with her into the forest tauntingly informing his rival that what he had got by the harp he had lost by the rote Palamedes pursued and a combat was about to commence the result of which must have been fatal to one or other of these gallant knights but Isoude stepped between them and addressing Palamedes said You tell me that you love me you will not then deny me the request I am about to make Lady he replied I will perform your bidding Leave then said she this contest and repair to King Arthur s court and salute Queen Guenever from me tell her that there are in the world but two ladies herself and I and two lovers hers and mine and come thou not in future in any place where I am Palamedes burst into tears
3905_172165_000016_000008	train-clean-360	 Ah lady said he I will obey you but I beseech you that you will not for ever steel your heart against me Palamedes she replied may I never taste of joy again if I ever quit my first love Palamedes then went his way 
none	none	The lovers remained a week in concealment after which Tristram restored Isoude to her husband advising him in future to reward minstrels in some other way 
3905_172165_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The king showed much gratitude to Tristram but in the bottom of his heart he cherished bitter jealousy of him 
none	none	One day Tristram and Isoude were alone together in her private chamber 
3905_172165_000017_000002	train-clean-360	A base and cowardly knight of the court named Andret spied them through a keyhole 
3905_172165_000017_000003	train-clean-360	They sat at a table of chess but were not attending to the game 
3905_172165_000017_000004	train-clean-360	Andret brought the king having first raised his suspicions and placed him so as to watch their motions 
3905_172165_000017_000005	train-clean-360	The king saw enough to confirm his suspicions and he burst into the apartment with his sword drawn and had nearly slain Tristram before he was put on his guard 
3905_172165_000017_000006	train-clean-360	But Tristram avoided the blow drew his sword and drove before him the cowardly monarch chasing him through all the apartments of the palace giving him frequent blows with the flat of his sword while he cried in vain to his knights to save him 
none	none	They were not inclined or did not dare to interpose in his behalf 
3905_172165_000018_000000	train-clean-360	A proof of the great popularity of the tale of Sir Tristram is the fact that the Italian poets Boiardo and Ariosto have founded upon it the idea of the two enchanted fountains which produced the opposite effects of love and hatred 
3905_172165_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Boiardo thus describes the fountain of hatred 
none	none	Fair was that fountain sculptured all of gold With alabaster sculptured rich and rare And in its basin clear thou might saint behold The flowery marge reflected fresh and fair Sage Merlin framed the font so legends bear When on fair Isoude doated Tristram brave That the good errant knight arriving there Might quaff oblivion in the enchanted wave And leave his luckless love and scape his timeless grave But ne er the warrior s evil fate allowed His steps that fountain s charmed verge to gain Though restless roving on adventure proud He traversed oft the land and oft the main CHAPTER XIII TRISTRAM AND ISOUDE Continued After this affair Tristram was banished from the kingdom and Isoude shut up in a tower which stood on the bank of a river Tristram could not resolve to depart without some further communication with his beloved so he concealed himself in the forest till at last he contrived to attract her attention by means of twigs which he curiously peeled and sent down the stream under her window By this means many secret interviews were obtained Tristram dwelt in the forest sustaining himself by game which the dog Houdain ran down for him for this faithful animal was unequalled in the chase and knew so well his master s wish for concealment that in the pursuit of his game he never barked At length Tristram departed but left Houdain with Isoude as a remembrancer of him Sir Tristram wandered through various countries achieving the most perilous enterprises and covering himself with glory yet unhappy at the separation from his beloved Isoude At length King Mark s territory was invaded by a neighboring chieftain and he was forced to summon his nephew to his aid Tristram obeyed the call put himself at the head of his uncle s vassals and drove the enemy out of the country Mark was full of gratitude and Tristram restored to favor and to the society of his beloved Isoude seemed at the summit of happiness But a sad reverse was at hand Tristram had brought with him a friend named Pheredin son of the king of Brittany This young knight saw Queen Isoude and could not resist her charms Knowing the love of his friend for the queen and that that love was returned Pheredin concealed his own until his health failed and he feared he was drawing near his end He then wrote to the beautiful queen that he was dying for love of her The gentle Isoude in a moment of pity for the friend of Tristram returned him an answer so kind and compassionate that it restored him to life A few days afterwards Tristram found this letter The most terrible jealousy took possession of his soul he would have slain Pheredin who with difficulty made his escape Then Tristram mounted his horse and rode to the forest where for ten days he took no rest nor food At length he was found by a damsel lying almost dead by the brink of a fountain She recognized him and tried in vain to rouse his attention At last recollecting his love for music she went and got her harp and played thereon Tristram was roused from his reverie tears flowed he breathed more freely he took the harp from the maiden and sung this lay with a voice broken with sobs Sweet I sang in former days Kind love perfected my lays Now my art alone displays The woe that on my being preys Charming love delicious power Worshipped from my earliest hour Thou who life on all dost shower Love my life thou dost devour In death s hour I beg of thee Isoude dearest enemy Thou who erst couldst kinder be When I m gone forget not me On my gravestone passers by Oft will read as low I lie Never wight in love could vie With Tristram yet she let him die Tristram having finished his lay wrote it off and gave it to the damsel conjuring her to present it to the queen Meanwhile Queen Isoude was inconsolable at the absence of Tristram She discovered that it was caused by the fatal letter which she had written to Pheredin Innocent but in despair at the sad effects of her letter she wrote another to Pheredin charging him never to see her again The unhappy lover obeyed this cruel decree He plunged into the forest and died of grief and love in a hermit s cell Isoude passed her days in lamenting the absence and unknown fate of Tristram One day her jealous husband having entered her chamber unperceived overheard her singing the following lay My voice to piteous wail is bent My harp to notes of languishment Ah love delightsome days be meant For happier wights with hearts content Ah Tristram far away from me Art thou from restless anguish free Ah couldst thou so one moment be From her who so much loveth thee The king hearing these words burst forth in a rage but Isoude was too wretched to fear his violence You have heard me she said I confess it all I love Tristram and always shall love him Without doubt he is dead and died for me I no longer wish to live The blow that shall finish my misery will be most welcome The king was moved at the distress of the fair Isoude and perhaps the idea of Tristram s death tended to allay his wrath He left the queen in charge of her women commanding them to take especial care lest her despair should lead her to do harm to herself Tristram meanwhile distracted as he was rendered a most important service to the shepherds by slaying a gigantic robber named Taullas who was in the habit of plundering their flocks and rifling their cottages The shepherds in their gratitude to Tristram bore him in triumph to King Mark to have him bestow on him a suitable reward No wonder Mark failed to recognize in the half clad wild man before him his nephew Tristram but grateful for the service the unknown had rendered he ordered him to be well taken care of and gave him in charge to the queen and her women Under such care Tristram rapidly recovered his serenity and his health so that the romancer tells us he became handsomer than ever King Mark s jealousy revived with Tristram s health and good looks and in spite of his debt of gratitude so lately increased he again banished him from the court Sir Tristram left Cornwall and proceeded into the land of Loegria England in quest of adventures One day he entered a wide forest The sound of a little bell showed him that some inhabitant was near He followed the sound and found a hermit who informed him that he was in the forest of Arnantes belonging to the fairy Viviane the Lady of the Lake who smitten with love for King Arthur had found means to entice him to this forest where by enchantments she held him a prisoner having deprived him of all memory of who and what he was The hermit informed him that all the knights of the Round Table were out in search of the king and that he Tristram was now in the scene of the most grand and important adventures This was enough to animate Tristram in the search He had not wandered far before he encountered a knight of Arthur s court who proved to be Sir Kay the Seneschal who demanded of him whence he came Tristram answering From Cornwall Sir Kay did not let slip the opportunity of a joke at the expense of the Cornish knight Tristram chose to leave him in his error and even confirmed him in it for meeting some other knights Tristram declined to just with them They spent the night together at an abbey where Tristram submitted patiently to all their jokes The Seneschal gave the word to his companions that they should set out early next day and intercept the Cornish knight on his way and enjoy the amusement of seeing his fright when they should insist on running a tilt with him Tristram next morning found himself alone he put on his armor and set out to continue his quest He soon saw before him the Seneschal and the three knights who barred the way and insisted on a just Tristram excused himself a long time at last he reluctantly took his stand He encountered them one after the other and overthrew them all four man and horse and then rode off bidding them not to forget their friend the knight of Cornwall Tristram had not ridden far when he met a damsel who cried out Ah my lord hasten forward and prevent a horrid treason Tristram flew to her assistance and soon reached a spot where he beheld a knight whom three others had borne to the ground and were unlacing his helmet in order to cut off his head Tristram flew to the rescue and slew with one stroke of his lance one of the assailants The knight recovering his feet sacrificed another to his vengeance and the third made his escape The rescued knight then raised the visor of his helmet and a long white beard fell down upon his breast The majesty and venerable air of this knight made Tristram suspect that it was none other than Arthur himself and the prince confirmed his conjecture Tristram would have knelt before him but Arthur received him in his arms and inquired his name and country but Tristram declined to disclose them on the plea that he was now on a quest requiring secrecy At this moment the damsel who had brought Tristram to the rescue darted forward and seizing the king s hand drew from his finger a ring the gift of the fairy and by that act dissolved the enchantment Arthur having recovered his reason and his memory offered to Tristram to attach him to his court and to confer honors and dignities upon him but Tristram declined all and only consented to accompany him till he should see him safe in the hands of his knights Soon after Hector de Marys rode up and saluted the king who on his part introduced him to Tristram as one of the bravest of his knights Tristram took leave of the king and his faithful follower and continued his quest We cannot follow Tristram through all the adventures which filled this epoch of his history Suffice it to say he fulfilled on all occasions the duty of a true knight rescuing the oppressed redressing wrongs abolishing evil customs and suppressing injustice thus by constant action endeavoring to lighten the pains of absence from her he loved In the meantime Isoude separated from her dear Tristram passed her days in languor and regret At length she could no longer resist the desire to hear some news of her lover She wrote a letter and sent it by one of her damsels niece of her faithful Brengwain One day Tristram weary with his exertions had dismounted and laid himself down by the side of a fountain and fallen asleep The damsel of Queen Isoude arrived at the same fountain and recognized Passebreul the horse of Tristram and presently perceived his master asleep He was thin and pale showing evident marks of the pain he suffered in separation from his beloved She awakened him and gave him the letter which she bore and Tristram enjoyed the pleasure so sweet to a lover of hearing from and talking about the object of his affections He prayed the damsel to postpone her return till after the magnificent tournament which Arthur had proclaimed should have taken place and conducted her to the castle of Persides a brave and loyal knight who received her with great consideration Tristram conducted the damsel of Queen Isoude to the tournament and had her placed in the balcony among the ladies of the queen He glanced and saw the stately galleries Dame damsel each through worship of their Queen White robed in honor of the stainless child And some with scatter d jewels like a bank Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire He looked but once and veiled his eyes again The Last Tournament He then joined the tourney Nothing could exceed his strength and valor Launcelot admired him and by a secret presentiment declined to dispute the honor of the day with a knight so gallant and so skilful Arthur descended from the balcony to greet the conqueror but the modest and devoted Tristram content with having borne off the prize in the sight of the messenger of Isoude made his escape with her and disappeared The next day the tourney recommenced Tristram assumed different armor that he might not be known but he was soon detected by the terrible blows that he gave Arthur and Guenever had no doubt that it was the same knight who had borne off the prize of the day before Arthur s gallant spirit was roused After Launcelot of the Lake and Sir Gawain he was accounted the best knight of the Round Table He went privately and armed himself and came into the tourney in undistinguished armor He ran a just with Tristram whom he shook in his seat but Tristram who did not know him threw him out of the saddle Arthur recovered himself and content with having made proof of the stranger knight bade Launcelot finish the adventure and vindicate the honor of the Round Table Sir Launcelot at the bidding of the monarch assailed Tristram whose lance was already broken in former encounters But the law of this sort of combat was that the knight after having broken his lance must fight with his sword and must not refuse to meet with his shield the lance of his antagonist Tristram met Launcelot s charge upon his shield which that terrible lance could not fail to pierce It inflicted a wound upon Tristram s side and breaking left the iron in the wound But Tristram also with his sword smote so vigorously on Launcelot s casque that he cleft it and wounded his head The wound was not deep but the blood flowed into his eyes and blinded him for a moment and Tristram who thought himself mortally wounded retired from the field Launcelot declared to the king that he had never received such a blow in his life before Tristram hastened to Gouvernail his squire who drew forth the iron bound up the wound and gave him immediate ease Tristram after the tournament kept retired in his tent but Arthur with the consent of all the knights of the Round Table decreed him the honors of the second day But it was no longer a secret that the victor of the two days was the same individual and Gouvernail being questioned confirmed the suspicions of Launcelot and Arthur that it was no other than Sir Tristram of Leonais the nephew of the king of Cornwall King Arthur who desired to reward his distinguished valor and knew that his Uncle Mark had ungratefully banished him would have eagerly availed himself of the opportunity to attach Tristram to his court all the knights of the Round Table declaring with acclamation that it would be impossible to find a more worthy companion But Tristram had already departed in search of adventures and the damsel of Queen Isoude returned to her mistress CHAPTER XIV SIR TRISTRAM S BATTLE WITH SIR LAUNCELOT Sir Tristram rode through a forest and saw ten men fighting and one man did battle against nine So he rode to the knights and cried to them bidding them cease their battle for they did themselves great shame so many knights to fight against one Then answered the master of the knights his name was Sir Breuse sans Pitie who was at that time the most villanous knight living Sir knight what have ye to do to meddle with us If ye be wise depart on your way as you came for this knight shall not escape us That were pity said Sir Tristram that so good a knight should be slain so cowardly therefore I warn you I will succor him with all my puissance Then Sir Tristram alighted off his horse because they were on foot that they should not slay his horse And he smote on the right hand and on the left so vigorously that well nigh at every stroke he struck down a knight At last they fled with Breuse sans Pitie into the tower and shut Sir Tristram without the gate Then Sir Tristram returned back to the rescued knight and found him sitting under a tree sore wounded Fair knight said he how is it with you Sir knight said Sir Palamedes for he it was I thank you of your great goodness for ye have rescued me from death What is your name said Sir Tristram He said My name is Sir Palamedes Say ye so said Sir Tristram now know that thou art the man in the world that I most hate therefore make thee ready for I will do battle with thee What is your name said Sir Palamedes My name is Sir Tristram your mortal enemy It may be so said Sir Palamedes but you have done overmuch for me this day that I should fight with you Moreover it will be no honor for you to have to do with me for you are fresh and I am wounded Therefore if you will needs have to do with me assign me a day and I shall meet you without fail You say well said Sir Tristram now I assign you to meet me in the meadow by the river of Camelot where Merlin set the monument So they were agreed Then they departed and took their ways diverse Sir Tristram passed through a great forest into a plain till he came to a priory and there he reposed him with a good man six days Then departed Sir Tristram and rode straight into Camelot to the monument of Merlin and there he looked about him for Sir Palamedes And he perceived a seemly knight who came riding against him all in white with a covered shield When he came nigh Sir Tristram said aloud Welcome sir knight and well and truly have you kept your promise Then they made ready their shields and spears and came together with all the might of their horses so fiercely that both the horses and the knights fell to the earth And as soon as they might they quitted their horses and struck together with bright swords as men of might and each wounded the other wonderfully sore so that the blood ran out upon the grass Thus they fought for the space of four hours and never one would speak to the other one word Then at last spake the white knight and said Sir thou fightest wonderful well as ever I saw knight therefore if it please you tell me your name Why dost thou ask my name said Sir Tristram art thou not Sir Palamedes No fair knight said he I am Sir Launcelot of the Lake Alas said Sir Tristram what have I done for you are the man of the world that I love best Fair knight said Sir Launcelot tell me your name Truly said he my name is Sir Tristram de Lionesse Alas alas said Sir Launcelot what adventure has befallen me And therewith Sir Launcelot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword and Sir Tristram kneeled down and yielded him up his sword and so either gave other the degree And then they both went to the stone and sat them down upon it and took off their helms and each kissed the other a hundred times And then anon they rode toward Camelot and on the way they met with Sir Gawain and Sir Gaheris that had made promise to Arthur never to come again to the court till they had brought Sir Tristram with them Return again said Sir Launcelot for your quest is done for I have met with Sir Tristram Lo here he is in his own person Then was Sir Gawain glad and said to Sir Tristram Ye are welcome With this came King Arthur and when he wist there was Sir Tristram he ran unto him and took him by the hand and said Sir Tristram ye are as welcome as any knight that ever came to this court Then Sir Tristram told the king how he came thither for to have had to do with Sir Palamedes and how he had rescued him from Sir Breuse sans Pitie and the nine knights Then King Arthur took Sir Tristram by the hand and went to the Table Round and Queen Guenever came and many ladies with her and all the ladies said with one voice Welcome Sir Tristram Welcome said the knights Welcome said Arthur for one of the best of knights and the gentlest of the world and the man of most worship for of all manner of hunting thou bearest the prize and of all measures of blowing thou art the beginning and of all the terms of hunting and hawking ye are the inventor and of all instruments of music ye are the best skilled therefore gentle knight said Arthur ye are welcome to this court And then King Arthur made Sir Tristram knight of the Table Round with great nobley and feasting as can be thought SIR TRISTRAM AS A SPORTSMAN Tristram is often alluded to by the Romancers as the great authority and model in all matters relating to the chase In the Faery Queene Tristram in answer to the inquiries of Sir Calidore informs him of his name and parentage and concludes All which my days I have not lewdly spent Nor spilt the blossom of my tender years In idlesse but as was convenient Have trained been with many noble feres In gentle thewes and such like seemly leers Mongst which my most delight hath always been To hunt the salvage chace amongst my peers Of all that rangeth in the forest green Of which none is to me unknown that yet was seen Ne is there hawk which mantleth on her perch Whether high towering or accosting low But I the measure of her flight do search And all her prey and all her diet know Such be our joys which in these forests grow Footnote Feres companions thewes labors leers learning CHAPTER XV THE ROUND TABLE The famous enchanter Merlin had exerted all his skill in fabricating the Round Table Of the seats which surrounded it he had constructed thirteen in memory of the thirteen Apostles Twelve of these seats only could be occupied and they only by knights of the highest fame the thirteenth represented the seat of the traitor Judas It remained always empty It was called the PERILOUS SEAT ever since a rash and haughty Saracen knight had dared to place himself in it when the earth opened and swallowed him up In our great hall there stood a vacant chair Fashion d by Merlin ere he past away And carven with strange figures and in and out The figures like a serpent ran a scroll Of letters in a tongue no man could read And Merlin call d it The Siege perilous Perilous for good and ill for there he said No man could sit but he should lose himself The Holy Grail A magic power wrote upon each seat the name of the knight who was entitled to sit in it No one could succeed to a vacant seat unless he surpassed in valor and glorious deeds the knight who had occupied it before him without this qualification he would be violently repelled by a hidden force Thus proof was made of all those who presented themselves to replace any companions of the order who had fallen One of the principal seats that of Moraunt of Ireland had been vacant ten years and his name still remained over it ever since the time when that distinguished champion fell beneath the sword of Sir Tristram Arthur now took Tristram by the hand and led him to that seat Immediately the most melodious sounds were heard and exquisite perfumes filled the place the name of Moraunt disappeared and that of Tristram blazed forth in light The rare modesty of Tristram had now to be subjected to a severe task for the clerks charged with the duty of preserving the annals of the Round Table attended and he was required by the law of his order to declare what feats of arms he had accomplished to entitle him to take that seat This ceremony being ended Tristram received the congratulations of all his companions Sir Launcelot and Guenever took the occasion to speak to him of the fair Isoude and to express their wish that some happy chance might bring her to the kingdom of Loegria While Tristram was thus honored and caressed at the court of King Arthur the most gloomy and malignant jealousy harassed the soul of Mark He could not look upon Isoude without remembering that she loved Tristram and the good fortune of his nephew goaded him to thoughts of vengeance He at last resolved to go disguised into the kingdom of Loegria attack Tristram by stealth and put him to death He took with him two knights brought up in his court who he thought were devoted to him and not willing to leave Isoude behind named two of her maidens to attend her together with her faithful Brengwain and made them accompany him Having arrived in the neighborhood of Camelot Mark imparted his plan to his two knights but they rejected it with horror nay more they declared that they would no longer remain in his service and left him giving him reason to suppose that they should repair to the court to accuse him before Arthur It was necessary for Mark to meet and rebut their accusation so leaving Isoude in an abbey he pursued his way alone to Camelot Mark had not ridden far when he encountered a party of knights of Arthur s court and would have avoided them for he knew their habit of challenging to a just every stranger knight whom they met But it was too late They had seen his armor and recognized him as a Cornish knight and at once resolved to have some sport with him It happened they had with them Daguenet King Arthur s fool who though deformed and weak of body was not wanting in courage The knights as Mark approached laid their plan that Daguenet should personate Sir Launcelot of the Lake and challenge the Cornish knight They equipped him in armor belonging to one of their number who was ill and sent him forward to the cross road to defy the strange knight Mark who saw that his antagonist was by no means formidable in appearance was not disinclined to the combat but when the dwarf rode towards him calling out that he was Sir Launcelot of the Lake his fears prevailed he put spurs to his horse and rode away at full speed pursued by the shouts and laughter of the party Meanwhile Isoude remaining at the abbey with her faithful Brengwain found her only amusement in walking occasionally in a forest adjoining the abbey There on the brink of a fountain girdled with trees she thought of her love and sometimes joined her voice and her harp in lays reviving the memory of its pains or pleasures One day the caitiff knight Breuse the Pitiless heard her voice concealed himself and drew near She sang Sweet silence shadowy bower and verdant lair Ye court my troubled spirit to repose Whilst I such dear remembrance rises there Awaken every echo with my woes Within these woods by nature s hand arrayed A fountain springs and feeds a thousand flowers Ah how my groans do all its murmurs aid How my sad eyes do swell it with their showers What doth my knight the while to him is given A double meed in love and arms emprise Him the Round Table elevates to heaven Tristram ah me he hears not Isoude s cries Breuse the Pitiless who like most other caitiffs had felt the weight of Tristram s arm and hated him accordingly at hearing his name breathed forth by the beautiful songstress impelled by a double impulse rushed forth from his concealment and laid hands on his victim Isoude fainted and Brengwain filled the air with her shrieks Breuse carried Isoude to the place where he had left his horse but the animal had got away from his bridle and was at some distance He was obliged to lay down his fair burden and go in pursuit of his horse Just then a knight came up drawn by the cries of Brengwain and demanded the cause of her distress She could not speak but pointed to her mistress lying insensible on the ground Breuse had by this time returned and the cries of Brengwain renewed at seeing him sufficiently showed the stranger the cause of the distress Tristram spurred his horse towards Breuse who not unprepared ran to the encounter Breuse was unhorsed and lay motionless pretending to be dead but when the stranger knight left him to attend to the distressed damsels he mounted his horse and made his escape The knight now approached Isoude gently raised her head drew aside the golden hair which covered her countenance gazed thereon for an instant uttered a cry and fell back insensible Brengwain came her cares soon restored her mistress to life and they then turned their attention to the fallen warrior They raised his visor and discovered the countenance of Sir Tristram Isoude threw herself on the body of her lover and bedewed his face with her tears Their warmth revived the knight and Tristram on awaking found himself in the arms of his dear Isoude It was the law of the Round Table that each knight after his admission should pass the next ten days in quest of adventures during which time his companions might meet him in disguised armor and try their strength with him Tristram had now been out seven days and in that time had encountered many of the best knights of the Round Table and acquitted himself with honor During the remaining three days Isoude remained at the abbey under his protection and then set out with her maidens escorted by Sir Tristram to rejoin King Mark at the court of Camelot This happy journey was one of the brightest epochs in the lives of Tristram and Isoude He celebrated it by a lay upon the harp in a peculiar measure to which the French give the name of Triolet With fair Isoude and with love Ah how sweet the life I lead How blest for ever thus to rove With fair Isoude and with love As she wills I live and move And cloudless days to days succeed With fair Isoude and with love Ah how sweet the life I lead Journeying on from break of day Feel you not fatigued my fair Yon green turf invites to play Journeying on from day to day Ah let us to that shade away Were it but to slumber there Journeying on from break of day Feel you not fatigued my fair They arrived at Camelot where Sir Launcelot received them most cordially Isoude was introduced to King Arthur and Queen Guenever who welcomed her as a sister As King Mark was held in arrest under the accusation of the two Cornish knights Queen Isoude could not rejoin her husband and Sir Launcelot placed his castle of La Joyeuse Garde at the disposal of his friends who there took up their abode King Mark who found himself obliged to confess the truth of the charge against him or to clear himself by combat with his accusers preferred the former and King Arthur as his crime had not been perpetrated remitted the penalty only enjoining upon him under pain of his signal displeasure to lay aside all thoughts of vengeance against his nephew In the presence of the king and his court all parties were formally reconciled Mark and his queen departed for their home and Tristram remained at Arthur s court CHAPTER XVI SIR PALAMEDES While Sir Tristram and the fair Isoude abode yet at La Joyeuse Garde Sir Tristram rode forth one day without armor having no weapon but his spear and his sword And as he rode he came to a place where he saw two knights in battle and one of them had gotten the better and the other lay overthrown The knight who had the better was Sir Palamedes When Sir Palamedes knew Sir Tristram he cried out Sir Tristram now we be met and ere we depart we will redress our old wrongs As for that said Sir Tristram there never yet was Christian man that might make his boast that I ever fled from him and thou that art a Saracen shalt never say that of me And therewith Sir Tristram made his horse to run and with all his might came straight upon Sir Palamedes and broke his spear upon him Then he drew his sword and struck at Sir Palamedes six great strokes upon his helm Sir Palamedes saw that Sir Tristram had not his armor on and he marvelled at his rashness and his great folly and said to himself If I meet and slay him I am shamed wheresoever I go Then Sir Tristram cried out and said Thou coward knight why wilt thou not do battle with me for have thou no doubt I shall endure all thy malice Ah Sir Tristram said Sir Palamedes thou knowest I may not fight with thee for shame for thou art here naked and I am armed now I require that thou answer me a question that I shall ask you Tell me what it is said Sir Tristram I put the case said Palamedes that you were well armed and I naked as ye be what would you do to me now by your true knighthood Ah said Sir Tristram now I understand thee well Sir Palamedes and as God bless me what I shall say shall not be said for fear that I have of thee But if it were so thou shouldest depart from me for I would not have to do with thee No more will I with thee said Sir Palamedes and therefore ride forth on thy way As for that I may choose said Sir Tristram either to ride or to abide But Sir Palamedes I marvel at one thing that thou art so good a knight yet that thou wilt not be christened As for that said Sir Palamedes I may not yet be christened for a vow which I made many years ago yet in my heart I believe in our Saviour and his mild mother Mary but I have yet one battle to do and when that is done I will be christened with a good will By my head said Sir Tristram as for that one battle thou shalt seek it no longer for yonder is a knight whom you have smitten down Now help me to be clothed in his armor and I will soon fulfil thy vow As ye will said Sir Palamedes so shall it be So they rode both unto that knight that sat on a bank and Sir Tristram saluted him and he full weary saluted him again Sir said Sir Tristram I pray you to lend me your whole armor for I am unarmed and I must do battle with this knight Sir said the hurt knight you shall have it with a right good will Then Sir Tristram unarmed Sir Galleron for that was the name of the hurt knight and he as well as he could helped to arm Sir Tristram Then Sir Tristram mounted upon his own horse and in his hand he took Sir Galleron s spear Thereupon Sir Palamedes was ready and so they came hurling together and each smote the other in the midst of their shields Sir Palamedes spear broke and Sir Tristram smote down the horse Then Sir Palamedes leapt from his horse and drew out his sword That saw Sir Tristram and therewith he alighted and tied his horse to a tree Then they came together as two wild beasts lashing the one on the other and so fought more than two hours and often Sir Tristram smote such strokes at Sir Palamedes that he made him to kneel and Sir Palamedes broke away Sir Tristram s shield and wounded him Then Sir Tristram was wroth out of measure and he rushed to Sir Palamedes and wounded him passing sore through the shoulder and by fortune smote Sir Palamedes sword out of his hand And if Sir Palamedes had stooped for his sword Sir Tristram had slain him Then Sir Palamedes stood and beheld his sword with a full sorrowful heart Now said Sir Tristram I have thee at a vantage as thou hadst me to day but it shall never be said in court or among good knights that Sir Tristram did slay any knight that was weaponless therefore take thou thy sword and let us fight this battle to the end Then spoke Sir Palamedes to Sir Tristram I have no wish to fight this battle any more The offence that I have done unto you is not so great but that if it please you we may be friends All that I have offended is for the love of the queen La Belle Isoude and I dare maintain that she is peerless among ladies and for that offence ye have given me many grievous and sad strokes and some I have given you again Wherefore I require you my lord Sir Tristram forgive me all that I have offended you and this day have me unto the next church and first I will be clean confessed and after that see you that I be truly baptized and then we will ride together unto the court of my lord King Arthur so that we may be there at the feast of Pentecost Now take your horse said Sir Tristram and as you have said so shall it be done So they took their horses and Sir Galleron rode with them When they came to the church of Carlisle the bishop commanded to fill a great vessel with water and when he had hallowed it he then confessed Sir Palamedes clean and christened him and Sir Tristram and Sir Galleron were his godfathers Then soon after they departed and rode towards Camelot where the noble King Arthur and Queen Guenever were keeping a court royal And the king and all the court were glad that Sir Palamedes was christened Then Sir Tristram returned again to La Joyeuse Garde and Sir Palamedes went his way Not long after these events Sir Gawain returned from Brittany and related to King Arthur the adventure which befell him in the forest of Breciliande how Merlin had there spoken to him and enjoined him to charge the king to go without delay upon the quest of the Holy Greal While King Arthur deliberated Tristram determined to enter upon the quest and the more readily as it was well known to him that this holy adventure would if achieved procure him the pardon of all his sins He immediately departed for the kingdom of Brittany hoping there to obtain from Merlin counsel as to the proper course to pursue to insure success CHAPTER XVII SIR TRISTRAM On arriving in Brittany Tristram found King Hoel engaged in a war with a rebellious vassal and hard pressed by his enemy His best knights had fallen in a late battle and he knew not where to turn for assistance Tristram volunteered his aid It was accepted and the army of Hoel led by Tristram and inspired by his example gained a complete victory The king penetrated by the most lively sentiments of gratitude and having informed himself of Tristram s birth offered him his daughter in marriage The princess was beautiful and accomplished and bore the same name with the Queen of Cornwall but this one is designated by the Romancers as Isoude of the White Hands to distinguish her from Isoude the Fair How can we describe the conflict that agitated the heart of Tristram He adored the first Isoude but his love for her was hopeless and not unaccompanied by remorse Moreover the sacred quest on which he had now entered demanded of him perfect purity of life It seemed as if a happy destiny had provided for him in the charming princess Isoude of the White Hands the best security for all his good resolutions This last reflection determined him They were married and passed some months in tranquil happiness at the court of King Hoel The pleasure which Tristram felt in his wife s society increased day by day An inward grace seemed to stir within him from the moment when he took the oath to go on the quest of the Holy Greal it seemed even to triumph over the power of the magic love potion The war which had been quelled for a time now burst out anew Tristram as usual was foremost in every danger The enemy was worsted in successive conflicts and at last shut himself up in his principal city Tristram led on the attack of the city As he mounted a ladder to scale the walls he was struck on the head by a fragment of rock which the besieged threw down upon him It bore him to the ground where he lay insensible As soon as he recovered consciousness he demanded to be carried to his wife The princess skilled in the art of surgery would not suffer any one but herself to touch her beloved husband Her fair hands bound up his wounds Tristram kissed them with gratitude which began to grow into love At first the devoted cares of Isoude seemed to meet with great success but after a while these flattering appearances vanished and in spite of all her care the malady grew more serious day by day In this perplexity an old squire of Tristram s reminded his master that the princess of Ireland afterwards queen of Cornwall had once cured him under circumstances quite as discouraging He called Isoude of the White Hands to him told her of his former cure added that he believed that the Queen Isoude could heal him and that he felt sure that she would come to his relief if sent for Isoude of the White Hands consented that Gesnes a trusty man and skilful navigator should be sent to Cornwall Tristram called him and giving him a ring Take this he said to the Queen of Cornwall Tell her that Tristram near to death demands her aid If you succeed in bringing her with you place white sails to your vessel on your return that we may know of your success when the vessel first heaves in sight But if Queen Isoude refuses put on black sails they will be the presage of my impending death Gesnes performed his mission successfully King Mark happened to be absent from his capital and the queen readily consented to return with the bark to Brittany Gesnes clothed his vessel in the whitest of sails and sped his way back to Brittany Meantime the wound of Tristram grew more desperate day by day His strength quite prostrated no longer permitted him to be carried to the seaside daily as had been his custom from the first moment when it was possible for the bark to be on the way homeward He called a young damsel and gave her in charge to keep watch in the direction of Cornwall and to come and tell him the color of the sails of the first vessel she should see approaching When Isoude of the White Hands consented that the queen of Cornwall should be sent for she had not known all the reasons which she had for fearing the influence which renewed intercourse with that princess might have on her own happiness She had now learned more and felt the danger more keenly She thought if she could only keep the knowledge of the queen s arrival from her husband she might employ in his service any resources which her skill could supply and still avert the dangers which she apprehended When the vessel was seen approaching with its white sails sparkling in the sun the damsel by command of her mistress carried word to Tristram that the sails were black Tristram penetrated with inexpressible grief breathed a profound sigh turned away his face and said Alas my beloved we shall never see one another again Then he commended himself to God and breathed his last The death of Tristram was the first intelligence which the queen of Cornwall heard on landing She was conducted almost senseless into the chamber of Tristram and expired holding him in her arms Tristram before his death had requested that his body should be sent to Cornwall and that his sword with a letter he had written should be delivered to King Mark The remains of Tristram and Isoude were embarked in a vessel along with the sword which was presented to the king of Cornwall He was melted with tenderness when he saw the weapon which slew Moraunt of Ireland which had so often saved his life and redeemed the honor of his kingdom In the letter Tristram begged pardon of his uncle and related the story of the amorous draught Mark ordered the lovers to be buried in his own chapel From the tomb of Tristram there sprung a vine which went along the walls and descended into the grave of the queen It was cut down three times but each time sprung up again more vigorous than before and this wonderful plant has ever since shaded the tombs of Tristram and Isoude Spenser introduces Sir Tristram in his Faery Queene In Book VI Canto ii Sir Calidore encounters in the forest a young hunter whom he thus describes Him steadfastly he marked and saw to be A goodly youth of amiable grace Yet but a slender slip that scarce did see Yet seventeen yeares but tall and faire of face That sure he deemed him borne of noble race All in a woodman s jacket he was clad Of Lincoln greene belayed with silver lace And on his head an

none	none	 PERCEVAL 
3436_172171_000005_000000	train-clean-100	The father and two elder brothers of Perceval had fallen in battle or tournaments and hence as the last hope of his family his mother retired with him into a solitary region where he was brought up in total ignorance of arms and chivalry 
3436_172171_000005_000001	train-clean-100	He was allowed no weapon but a lyttel Scots spere which was the only thing of all her lordes faire gere that his mother carried to the wood with her 
3436_172171_000005_000002	train-clean-100	In the use of this he became so skilful that he could kill with it not only the animals of the chase for the table but even birds on the wing 
3436_172171_000005_000003	train-clean-100	At length however Perceval was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor 
3436_172171_000005_000004	train-clean-100	He said to his mother Mother what are those yonder They are angels my son said she 
3436_172171_000005_000005	train-clean-100	 By my faith I will go and become an angel with them And Perceval went to the road and met them 
none	none	Tell me good lad said one of them sawest thou a knight pass this way either today or yesterday I know not said he what a knight is Such an one as I am said the knight If thou wilt tell me what I ask thee I will tell thee what thou askest me Gladly will I do so said Sir Owain for that was the knight s name
3436_172171_000005_000008	train-clean-100	 What is this demanded Perceval touching the saddle 
none	none	It is a saddle said Owain 
3436_172171_000005_000010	train-clean-100	Then he asked about all the accoutrements which he saw upon the men and the horses and about the arms and what they were for and how they were used 
none	none	And Sir Owain showed him all those things fully And Perceval in return gave him such information as he had 
3436_172171_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Then Perceval returned to his mother and said to her Mother those were not angels but honorable knights Then his mother swooned away 
3436_172171_000006_000001	train-clean-100	And Perceval went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle and he took a bony piebald horse which seemed to him the strongest of them 
none	none	And he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses 
3436_172171_000006_000003	train-clean-100	When he came again to his mother the countess had recovered from her swoon 
3436_172171_000006_000004	train-clean-100	 My son said she desirest thou to ride forth Yes with thy leave said he 
none	none	Go forward then she said to the court of Arthur where there are the best and the noblest and the most bountiful of men and tell him thou art Perceval the son of Pelenore and ask of him to bestow knighthood on thee And whenever thou seest a church repeat there thy pater noster and if thou see meat and drink and hast need of them thou mayest take them If thou hear an outcry of one in distress proceed toward it especially if it be the cry of a woman and render her what service thou canst 
3436_172171_000006_000008	train-clean-100	If thou see a fair jewel win it for thus shalt thou acquire fame yet freely give it to another for thus thou shalt obtain praise 
3436_172171_000006_000009	train-clean-100	If thou see a fair woman pay court to her for thus thou wilt obtain love 
3436_172171_000007_000000	train-clean-100	After this discourse Perceval mounted the horse and taking a number of sharp pointed sticks in his hand he rode forth 
3436_172171_000007_000001	train-clean-100	And he rode far in the woody wilderness without food or drink 
3436_172171_000007_000002	train-clean-100	At last he came to an opening in the wood where he saw a tent and as he thought it might be a church he said his pater noster to it 
3436_172171_000007_000003	train-clean-100	And he went towards it and the door of the tent was open 
none	none	And Perceval dismounted and entered the tent In the tent he found a maiden sitting with a golden frontlet on her forehead and a gold ring on her hand And Perceval said Maiden I salute you for my mother told me whenever I met a lady I must respectfully salute her Perceiving in one corner of the tent some food two flasks full of wine and some boar s flesh roasted he said My mother told me whenever I saw meat and drink to take it And he ate greedily for he was very hungry The maiden said Sir thou hadst best go quickly from here for fear that my friends should come and evil should befall you But Perceval said My mother told me wheresoever I saw a fair jewel to take it and he took the gold ring from her finger and put it on his own and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers then he mounted his horse and rode away 
3436_172171_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Perceval journeyed on till he arrived at Arthur s court 
none	none	And it so happened that just at that time an uncourteous knight had offered Queen Guenever a gross insult 
3436_172171_000008_000002	train-clean-100	For when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet this knight struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queen s face and over her stomacher Then he said If any have boldness to avenge this insult to Guenever let him follow me to the meadow So the knight took his horse and rode to the meadow carrying away the golden goblet 
none	none	And all the household hung down their heads and no one offered to follow the knight to take vengeance upon him 
3436_172171_000008_000004	train-clean-100	For it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him 
3436_172171_000008_000005	train-clean-100	Just then behold Perceval entered the hall upon the bony piebald horse with his uncouth trappings 
none	none	In the centre of the hall stood Kay the Seneschal Tell me tall man said Perceval is that Arthur yonder What wouldst thou with Arthur asked Kay My mother told me to go to Arthur and receive knighthood from him By my faith said he thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with arms Then all the household began to jeer and laugh at him But there was a certain damsel who had been a whole year at Arthur s court and had never been known to smile 
3436_172171_000008_000010	train-clean-100	And the king s fool Footnote A fool was a common appendage of the courts of those days when this romance was written 
3436_172171_000008_000011	train-clean-100	A fool was the ornament held in next estimation to a dwarf 
3436_172171_000008_000012	train-clean-100	He wore a white dress with a yellow bonnet and carried a bell or bawble in his hand 
none	none	Though called a fool his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of oracular meaning in them had said that this damsel would not smile till she had seen him who would be the flower of chivalry 
3436_172171_000008_000014	train-clean-100	Now this damsel came up to Perceval and told him smiling that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights 
3436_172171_000008_000015	train-clean-100	 Truly said Kay thou art ill taught to remain a year at Arthur s court with choice of society and smile on no one and now before the face of Arthur and all his knights to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood and he gave her a box on the ear that she fell senseless to the ground 
none	none	Then said Kay to Perceval Go after the knight who went hence to the meadow overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms and thou shalt have knighthood I will do so tall man said Perceval 
3436_172171_000008_000017	train-clean-100	So he turned his horse s head toward the meadow 
3436_172171_000008_000018	train-clean-100	And when he came there the knight was riding up and down proud of his strength and valor and noble mien 
none	none	Tell me said the knight didst thou see any one coming after me from the court The tall man that was there said Perceval told me to come and overthrow thee and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armor for myself Silence said the knight go back to the court and tell Arthur either to come himself or to send some other to fight with me and unless he do so quickly I will not wait for him By my faith said Perceval choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly for I will have the horse and the arms and the goblet Upon this the knight ran at him furiously and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear between the neck and the shoulder
3436_172171_000008_000020	train-clean-100	 Ha ha lad said Perceval my mother s servants were not used to play with me in this wise so thus will I play with thee And he threw at him one of his sharp pointed sticks and it struck him in the eye and came out at the back of his head so that he fell down lifeless 
none	none	Verily said Sir Owain the son of Urien to Kay the Seneschal thou wast ill advised to send that madman after the knight for he must either be overthrown or flee and either way it will be a disgrace to Arthur and his warriors therefore will I go to see what has befallen him So Sir Owain went to the meadow and he found Perceval trying in vain to get the dead knight s armor off in order to clothe himself with it 
3436_172171_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Sir Owain unfastened the armor and helped Perceval to put it on and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur for Perceval had never used stirrup nor spur but rode without saddle and urged on his horse with a stick 
none	none	Then Owain would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due but Perceval said I will not come to the court till I have encountered the tall man that is there to revenge the injury he did to the maiden But take thou the goblet to Queen Guenever and tell King Arthur that wherever I am I will be his vassal and will do him what profit and service I can And Sir Owain went back to the court and related all these things to Arthur and Guenever and to all the household 
3436_172171_000010_000000	train-clean-100	And Perceval rode forward 
3436_172171_000010_000001	train-clean-100	And he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle and on the border of the lake he saw a hoary headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion and his attendants were fishing in the lake 
none	none	When the hoary headed man beheld Perceval approaching he arose and went into the castle Perceval rode to the castle and the door was open and he entered the hall And the hoary headed man received Perceval courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion 
3436_172171_000010_000005	train-clean-100	When it was time the tables were set and they went to meat 
none	none	And when they had finished their meat the hoary headed man asked Perceval if he knew how to fight with the sword I know not said Perceval but were I to be taught doubtless I should And the hoary headed man said to him I am thy uncle thy mother s brother I am called King Pecheur Footnote The word means both FISHER and SINNER Thou shalt remain with me a space in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries and courtesy and noble bearing And this do thou remember if thou seest aught to cause thy wonder ask not the meaning of it if no one has the courtesy to inform thee the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher While Perceval and his uncle discoursed together Perceval beheld two youths enter the hall bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size with blood dropping from its point to the ground 
3436_172171_000010_000007	train-clean-100	And when all the company saw this they began to weep and lament 
3436_172171_000010_000008	train-clean-100	But for all that the man did not break off his discourse with Perceval 
3436_172171_000010_000009	train-clean-100	And as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw he forebore to ask him concerning it 
none	none	Now the cup that Perceval saw was the Sangreal and the spear the sacred spear and afterwards King Pecheur removed with those sacred relics into a far country One evening Perceval entered a valley and came to a hermit s cell and the hermit welcomed him gladly and there he spent the night And in the morning he arose and when he went forth behold a shower of snow had fallen in the night and a hawk had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell And the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away and a raven alighted on the bird And Perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow and the redness of the blood to the hair of the lady that best he loved which was blacker than jet and to her skin which was whiter than the snow and to the two red spots upon her cheeks which were redder than the blood upon the snow 
3436_172171_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Now Arthur and his household were in search of Perceval and by chance they came that way 
none	none	Know ye said Arthur who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder Lord said one of them I will go and learn who he is So the youth came to the place where Perceval was and asked him what he did thus and who he was 
3436_172171_000012_000002	train-clean-100	But Perceval was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer 
none	none	Then the youth thrust at Perceval with his lance and Perceval turned upon him and struck him to the ground 
3436_172171_000012_000004	train-clean-100	And when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated Sir Kay said I will go myself And when he greeted Perceval and got no answer he spoke to him rudely and angrily 
3436_172171_000012_000005	train-clean-100	And Perceval thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade 
none	none	And while he lay thus stunned his horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace 
3436_172171_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Then said Sir Gawain surnamed the Golden Tongued because he was the most courteous knight in Arthur s court It is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought unadvisedly for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves 
none	none	If it seem well to thee lord I will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought and if he has I will ask him courteously to come and visit thee And Perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought and Sir Gawain came to him and said If I thought it would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me I would converse with thee 
3436_172171_000014_000001	train-clean-100	I have also a message from Arthur unto thee to pray thee to come and visit him 
3436_172171_000014_000002	train-clean-100	And two men have been before on this errand That is true said Perceval and uncourteously they came 
3436_172171_000014_000003	train-clean-100	They attacked me and I was annoyed thereat 
none	none	Then he told him the thought that occupied his mind and Gawain said This was not an ungentle thought and I should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it Then said Perceval Tell me is Sir Kay in Arthur s court He is said Gawain and truly he is the knight who fought with thee last Verily said Perceval I am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden Then Perceval told him his name and said Who art thou And he replied I am Gawain I am right glad to meet thee said Perceval for I have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness and I solicit thy fellowship Thou shalt have it by my faith and grant me thine said he
3436_172171_000014_000007	train-clean-100	 Gladly will I do so answered Perceval 
3436_172171_000015_000000	train-clean-100	So they went together to Arthur and saluted him 
none	none	Behold lord said Gawain him whom thou hast sought so long Welcome unto thee chieftain said Arthur 
3436_172171_000016_000001	train-clean-100	And hereupon there came the queen and her handmaidens and Perceval saluted them 
none	none	And they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome And Arthur did him great honor and respect and they returned towards Caerleon CHAPTER XIX THE SANGREAL OR HOLY GRAAL The Sangreal was the cup from which our Saviour drank at his last supper He was supposed to have given it to Joseph of Arimathea who carried it to Europe together with the spear with which the soldier pierced the Saviour s side From generation to generation one of the descendants of Joseph of Arimathea had been devoted to the guardianship of these precious relics but on the sole condition of leading a life of purity in thought word and deed For a long time the Sangreal was visible to all pilgrims and its presence conferred blessings upon the land in which it was preserved But at length one of those holy men to whom its guardianship had descended so far forgot the obligation of his sacred office as to look with unhallowed eye upon a young female pilgrim whose robe was accidentally loosened as she knelt before him The sacred lance instantly punished his frailty spontaneously falling upon him and inflicting a deep wound The marvellous wound could by no means be healed and the guardian of the Sangreal was ever after called Le Roi Pescheur The Sinner King The Sangreal withdrew its visible presence from the crowds who came to worship and an iron age succeeded to the happiness which its presence had diffused among the tribes of Britain But then the times Grew to such evil that the Holy cup Was caught away to heaven and disappear d The Holy Grail We have told in the history of Merlin how that great prophet and enchanter sent a message to King Arthur by Sir Gawain directing him to undertake the recovery of the Sangreal informing him at the same time that the knight who should accomplish that sacred quest was already born and of a suitable age to enter upon it Sir Gawain delivered his message and the king was anxiously revolving in his mind how best to achieve the enterprise when at the vigil of Pentecost all the fellowship of the Round Table being met together at Camelot as they sat at meat suddenly there was heard a clap of thunder and then a bright light burst forth and every knight as he looked on his fellow saw him in seeming fairer than ever before All the hall was filled with sweet odors and every knight had such meat and drink as he best loved Then there entered into the hall the Holy Graal covered with white samite so that none could see it and it passed through the hall suddenly and disappeared During this time no one spoke a word but when they had recovered breath to speak King Arthur said Certainly we ought greatly to thank the Lord for what he hath showed us this day Then Sir Gawain rose up and made a vow that for twelve months and a day he would seek the Sangreal and not return till he had seen it if so he might speed When they of the Round Table heard Sir Gawain say so they arose the most part of them and vowed the same When King Arthur heard this he was greatly displeased for he knew well that they might not gainsay their vows Alas said he to Sir Gawain you have nigh slain me with the vow and promise that ye have made for ye have bereft me of the fairest fellowship that ever were seen together in any realm of the world for when they shall depart hence I am sure that all shall never meet more in this world SIR GALAHAD At that time there entered the hall a good old man and with him he brought a young knight and these words he said Peace be with you fair lords Then the old man said unto King Arthur Sir I bring you here a young knight that is of kings lineage and of the kindred of Joseph of Arimathea being the son of Dame Elaine the daughter of King Pelles king of the foreign country Now the name of the young knight was Sir Galahad and he was the son of Sir Launcelot du Lac but he had dwelt with his mother at the court of King Pelles his grandfather till now he was old enough to bear arms and his mother had sent him in the charge of a holy hermit to King Arthur s court Then Sir Launcelot beheld his son and had great joy of him And Sir Bohort told his fellows Upon my life this young knight shall come to great worship The noise was great in all the court so that it came to the queen And she said I would fain see him for he must needs be a noble knight for so is his father And the queen and her ladies all said that he resembled much unto his father and he was seemly and demure as a dove with all manner of good features that in the whole world men might not find his match And King Arthur said God make him a good man for beauty faileth him not as any that liveth Then the hermit led the young knight to the Siege Perilous and he lifted up the cloth and found there letters that said This is the seat of Sir Galahad the good knight and he made him sit in that seat And all the knights of the Round Table marvelled greatly at Sir Galahad seeing him sit securely in that seat and said This is he by whom the Sangreal shall be achieved for there never sat one before in that seat without being mischieved On the next day the king said Now at this quest of the Sangreal shall all ye of the Round Table depart and never shall I see you again altogether therefore I will that ye all repair to the meadow of Camelot for to just and tourney yet once more before ye depart But all the meaning of the king was to see Sir Galahad proved So then were they all assembled in the meadow Then Sir Galahad by request of the king and queen put on his harness and his helm but shield would he take none for any prayer of the king And the queen was in a tower with all her ladies to behold that tournament Then Sir Galahad rode into the midst of the meadow and there he began to break spears marvellously so that all men had wonder of him for he surmounted all knights that encountered with him except two Sir Launcelot and Sir Perceval So many knights that all the people cried And almost burst the barriers in their heat Shouting Sir Galahad and Sir Perceval Sir Galahad Then the king at the queen s request made him to alight and presented him to the queen and she said Never two men resembled one another more than he and Sir Launcelot and therefore it is no marvel that he is like him in prowess Then the king and the queen went to the minster and the knights followed them And after the service was done they put on their helms and departed and there was great sorrow They rode through the streets of Camelot and there was weeping of the rich and poor and the king turned away and might not speak for weeping And so they departed and every knight took the way that him best liked Sir Galahad rode forth without shield and rode four days and found no adventure And on the fourth day he came to a white abbey and there he was received with great reverence and led to a chamber He met there two knights King Bagdemagus and Sir Uwaine and they made of him great solace Sirs said Sir Galahad what adventure brought you hither Sir said they it is told us that within this place is a shield which no man may bear unless he be worthy and if one unworthy should attempt to bear it it shall surely do him a mischief Then King Bagdemagus said I fear not to bear it and that shall ye see to morrow So on the morrow they arose and heard mass then King Bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield was Anon a monk led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as snow but in the midst there was a red cross Then King Bagdemagus took the shield and bare it out of the minster and he said to Sir Galahad If it please you abide here till ye know how I shall speed Then King Bagdemagus and his squire rode forth and when they had ridden a mile or two they saw a goodly knight come towards them in white armor horse and all and he came as fast as his horse might run with his spear in the rest and King Bagdemagus directed his spear against him and broke it upon the white knight but the other struck him so hard that he broke the mails and thrust him through the right shoulder for the shield covered him not and so he bare him from his horse Then the white knight turned his horse and rode away Then the squire went to King Bagdemagus and asked him whether he were sore wounded or not I am sore wounded said he and full hardly shall I escape death Then the squire set him on his horse and brought him to an abbey and there he was taken down softly and unarmed and laid in a bed and his wound was looked to for he lay there long and hardly escaped with his life And the squire brought the shield back to the abbey The next day Sir Galahad took the shield and within a while he came to the hermitage where he met the white knight and each saluted the other courteously Sir said Sir Galahad can you tell me the marvel of the shield Sir said the white knight that shield belonged of old to the gentle knight Joseph of Arimathea and when he came to die he said Never shall man bear this shield about his neck but he shall repent it unto the time that Sir Galahad the good knight bear it the last of my lineage the which shall do many marvellous deeds And then the white knight vanished away SIR GAWAIN After Sir Gawain departed he rode many days both toward and forward and at last he came to the abbey where Sir Galahad took the white shield And they told Sir Gawain of the marvellous adventure that Sir Galahad had done Truly said Sir Gawain I am not happy that I took not the way that he went for if I may meet with him I will not part from him lightly that I may partake with him all the marvellous adventures which he shall achieve Sir said one of the monks he will not be of your fellowship Why said Sir Gawain Sir said he because ye be sinful and he is blissful Then said the monk Sir Gawain thou must do penance for thy sins Sir what penance shall I do Such as I will show said the good man Nay said Sir Gawain I will do no penance for we knights adventurous often suffer great woe and pain Well said the good man and he held his peace And Sir Gawain departed Now it happened not long after this that Sir Gawain and Sir Hector rode together and they came to a castle where was a great tournament And Sir Gawain and Sir Hector joined themselves to the party that seemed the weaker and they drove before them the other party Then suddenly came into the lists a knight bearing a white shield with a red cross and by adventure he came by Sir Gawain and he smote him so hard that he clave his helm and wounded his head so that Sir Gawain fell to the earth When Sir Hector saw that he knew that the knight with the white shield was Sir Galahad and he thought it no wisdom to abide him and also for natural love that he was his uncle Then Sir Galahad retired privily so that none knew where he had gone And Sir Hector raised up Sir Gawain and said Sir me seemeth your quest is done It is done said Sir Gawain I shall seek no further Then Gawain was borne into the castle and unarmed and laid in a rich bed and a leech found to search his wound And Sir Gawain and Sir Hector abode together for Sir Hector would not away till Sir Gawain were whole CHAPTER XX THE SANGREAL Continued SIR LAUNCELOT Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wide forest and held no path but as wild adventure lee him My golden spurs now bring to me And bring to me my richest mail For to morrow I go over land and sea In search of the Holy Holy Grail Shall never a bed for me be spread Nor shall a pillow be under my head Till I begin my vow to keep Here on the rushes will I sleep And perchance there may come a vision true Ere day create the world anew Lowell s Holy Grail And at last he came to a stone cross Then Sir Launcelot looked round him and saw an old chapel So he tied his horse to a tree and put off his shield and hung it upon a tree and then he went into the chapel and looked through a place where the wall was broken And within he saw a fair altar full richly arrayed with cloth of silk and there stood a fair candlestick which bare six great candles and the candlestick was of silver When Sir Launcelot saw this sight he had a great wish to enter the chapel but he could find no place where he might enter Then was he passing heavy and dismayed And he returned and came again to his horse and took off his saddle and his bridle and let him pasture and unlaced his helm and ungirded his sword and laid him down to sleep upon his shield before the cross And as he lay half waking and half sleeping he saw come by him two palfreys both fair and white which bare a litter on which lay a sick knight And when he was nigh the cross he there abode still And Sir Launcelot heard him say O sweet Lord when shall this sorrow leave me and when shall the holy vessel come by me whereby I shall be healed And thus a great while complained the knight and Sir Launcelot heard it Then Sir Launcelot saw the candlestick with the lighted tapers come before the cross but he could see nobody that brought it Also there came a salver of silver and the holy vessel of the Sangreal and therewithal the sick knight sat him upright and held up both his hands and said Fair sweet Lord which is here within the holy vessel take heed to me that I may be whole of this great malady And therewith upon his hands and upon his knees he went so nigh that he touched the holy vessel and kissed it And anon he was whole Then the holy vessel went into the chapel again with the candlestick and the light so that Sir Launcelot wist not what became of it Then the sick knight rose up and kissed the cross and anon his squire brought him his arms and asked his lord how he did I thank God right heartily said he for through the holy vessel I am healed But I have great marvel of this sleeping knight who hath had neither grace nor power to awake during the time that the holy vessel hath been here present I dare it right well say said the squire that this same knight is stained with some manner of deadly sin whereof he was never confessed So they departed Then anon Sir Launcelot waked and set himself upright and bethought him of what he had seen and whether it were dreams or not And he was passing heavy and wist not what to do And he said My sin and my wretchedness hath brought me into great dishonor For when I sought worldly adventures and worldly desires I ever achieved them and had the better in every place and never was I discomfited in any quarrel were it right or wrong And now I take upon me the adventure of holy things I see and understand that mine old sin hindereth me so that I had no power to stir nor to speak when the holy blood appeared before me So thus he sorrowed till it was day and heard the fowls of the air sing Then was he somewhat comforted Then he departed from the cross into the forest And there he found a hermitage and a hermit therein who was going to mass So when mass was done Sir Launcelot called the hermit to him and prayed him for charity to hear his confession With a good will said the good man And then he told that good man all his life and how he had loved a queen unmeasurably many years And all my great deeds of arms that I have done I did the most part for the queen s sake and for her sake would I do battle were it right or wrong and never did I battle all only for God s sake but for to win worship and to cause me to be better beloved and little or naught I thanked God for it I pray you counsel me I will counsel you said the hermit if ye will insure me that ye will never come in that queen s fellowship as much as ye may forbear And then Sir Launcelot promised the hermit by his faith that he would no more come in her company Look that your heart and your mouth accord said the good man and I shall insure you that ye shall have more worship than ever ye had Then the good man enjoined Sir Launcelot such penance as he might do and he assailed Sir Launcelot and made him abide with him all that day And Sir Launcelot repented him greatly SIR PERCEVAL Sir Perceval departed and rode till the hour of noon and he met in a valley about twenty men of arms And when they saw Sir Perceval they asked him whence he was and he answered Of the court of King Arthur Then they cried all at once Slay him But Sir Perceval smote the first to the earth and his horse upon him Then seven of the knights smote upon his shield all at once and the remnant slew his horse so that he fell to the earth So had they slain him or taken him had not the good knight Sir Galahad with the red cross come there by adventure And when he saw all the knights upon one he cried out Save me that knight s life Then he rode toward the twenty men of arms as fast as his horse might drive with his spear in the rest and smote the foremost horse and man to the earth And when his spear was broken he set his hand to his sword and smote on the right hand and on the left that it was marvel to see and at every stroke he smote down one or put him to rebuke so that they would fight no more but fled to a thick forest and Sir Galahad followed them And when Sir Perceval saw him chase them so he made great sorrow that his horse was slain And he wist well it was Sir Galahad Then he cried aloud Ah fair knight abide and suffer me to do thanks unto thee for right well have ye done for me But Sir Galahad rode so fast that at last he passed out of his sight When Sir Perceval saw that he would not turn he said Now am I a very wretch and most unhappy above all other knights So in his sorrow he abode all that day till it was night and then he was faint and laid him down and slept till midnight and then he awaked and saw before him a woman who said unto him Sir Perceval what dost thou here He answered I do neither good nor great ill If thou wilt promise me said she that thou wilt fulfil my will when I summon thee I will lend thee my own horse which shall bear thee whither thou wilt Sir Perceval was glad of her proffer and insured her to fulfil all her desire Then abide me here and I will go fetch you a horse And so she soon came again and brought a horse with her that was inky black When Perceval beheld that horse he marvelled it was so great and so well apparelled And he leapt upon him and took no heed of himself And he thrust him with his spurs and within an hour and less he bare him four days journey thence until he came to a rough water which roared and his horse would have borne him into it And when Sir Perceval came nigh the brim and saw the water so boisterous he doubted to overpass it And then he made the sign of the cross on his forehead When the fiend felt him so charged he shook off Sir Perceval and went into the water crying and roaring and it seemed unto him that the water burned Then Sir Perceval perceived it was a fiend that would have brought him unto his perdition Then he commended himself unto God and prayed our Lord to keep him from all such temptations and so he prayed all that night till it was day Then he saw that he was in a wild place that was closed with the sea nigh all about And Sir Perceval looked forth over the sea and saw a ship come sailing towards him and it came and stood still under the rock And when Sir Perceval saw this he hied him thither and found the ship covered with silk and therein was a lady of great beauty and clothed so richly that none might be better And when she saw Sir Perceval she saluted him and Sir Perceval returned her salutation Then he asked her of her country and her lineage And she said I am a gentlewoman that am disinherited and was once the richest woman of the world Damsel said Sir Perceval who hath disinherited you for I have great pity of you Sir said she my enemy is a great and powerful lord and aforetime he made much of me so that of his favor and of my beauty I had a little pride more than I ought to have had Also I said a word that pleased him not So he drove me from his company and from mine heritage Therefore I know no good knight nor good man but I get him on my side if I may And for that I know that thou art a good knight I beseech thee to help me Then Sir Perceval promised her all the help that he might and she thanked him And at that time the weather was hot and she called to her a gentlewoman and bade her bring forth a pavilion And she did so and pitched it upon the gravel Sir said she now may ye rest you in this heat of the day Then he thanked her and she put off his helm and his shield and there he slept a great while Then he awoke and asked her if she had any meat and she said yea and so there was set upon the table all manner of meats that he could think on Also he drank there the strongest wine that ever he drank and therewith he was a little chafed more than he ought to be With that he beheld the lady and he thought she was the fairest creature that ever he saw And then Sir Perceval proffered her love and prayed her that she would be his Then she refused him in a manner for the cause he should be the more ardent on her and ever he ceased not to pray her of love And when she saw him well enchafed then she said Sir Perceval wit you well I shall not give ye my love unless you swear from henceforth you will be my true servant and do no thing but that I shall command you Will you insure me this as ye be a true knight Yea said he fair lady by the faith of my body And as he said this by adventure and grace he saw his sword lie on the ground naked in whose pommel was a red cross and the sign of the crucifix thereon Then he made the sign of the cross on his forehead and therewith the pavilion shrivelled up and changed into a smoke and a black cloud And the damsel cried aloud and hasted into the ship and so she went with the wind roaring and yelling that it seemed all the water burned after her Then Sir Perceval made great sorrow and called himself a wretch saying How nigh was I lost Then he took his arms and departed thence CHAPTER XXI THE SANGREAL Continued SIR BOHORT When Sir Boliort departed from Camelot he met with a religious man riding upon an ass and Sir Bohort saluted him What are ye said the good man Sir said Sir Bohort I am a knight that fain would be counselled in the quest of the Sangreal So rode they both together till they came to a hermitage and there he prayed Sir Bohort to dwell that night with him So he alighted and put away his armor and prayed him that he might be confessed And they went both into the chapel and there he was clean confessed And they ate bread and drank water together Now said the good man I pray thee that thou eat none other till thou sit at the table where the Sangreal shall be Sir said Sir Bohort but how know ye that I shall sit there Yea said the good man that I know well but there shall be few of your fellows with you Then said Sir Bohort I agree me thereto And the good man when he had heard his confession found him in so pure a life and so stable that he marvelled thereof On the morrow as soon as the day appeared Sir Bohort departed thence and rode into a forest unto the hour of midday And there befell him a marvellous adventure For he met at the parting of two ways two knights that led Sir Lionel his brother all naked bound upon a strong hackney and his hands bound before his breast and each of them held in his hand thorns wherewith they went beating him so that he was all bloody before and behind but he said never a word but as he was great of heart he suffered all that they did to him as though he had felt none anguish Sir Bohort prepared to rescue his brother But he looked on the other side of him and saw a knight dragging along a fair gentlewoman who cried out Saint Mary succor your maid And when she saw Sir Bohort she called to him and said By the faith that ye owe to knighthood help me When Sir Bohort heard her say thus he had such sorrow that he wist not what to do For if I let my brother be he must be slain and that would I not for all the earth and if I help not the maid I am shamed for ever Then lift he up his eyes and said weeping Fair Lord whose liegeman I am keep Sir Lionel my brother that none of these knights slay him and for pity of you and our Lady s sake I shall succor this maid Then he cried out to the knight Sir knight lay your hand off that maid or else ye be but dead Then the knight set down the maid and took his shield and drew out his sword And Sir Bohort smote him so hard that it went through his shield and habergeon on the left shoulder and he fell down to the earth Then came Sir Bohort to the maid Ye be delivered of this knight this time Now said she I pray you lead me there where this knight took me I shall gladly do it said Sir Bohort So he took the horse of the wounded knight and set the gentlewoman upon it and brought her there where she desired to be And there he found twelve knights seeking after her and when she told them how Sir Bohort had delivered her they made great joy and besought him to come to her father a great lord and he should be right welcomed Truly said Sir Bohort that may not be for I have a great adventure to do So he commended them to God and departed Then Sir Bohort rode after Sir Lionel his brother by the trace of their horses Thus he rode seeking a great while Then he overtook a man clothed in a religious clothing who said Sir Knight what seek ye Sir said Sir Bohort I seek my brother that I saw within a little space beaten of two knights Ah Sir Bohort trouble not thyself to seek for him for truly he is dead Then he showed him a new slain body lying in a thick bush and it seemed him that it was the body of Sir Lionel And then he made such sorrow that he fell to the ground in a swoon and lay there long And when he came to himself again he said Fair brother since the fellowship of you and me is sundered shall I never have joy again and now He that I have taken for my Master He be my help And when he had said thus he took up the body in his arms and put it upon the horse And then he said to the man Canst thou tell me the way to some chapel where I may bury this body Come on said the man here is one fast by And so they rode till they saw a fair tower and beside it a chapel Then they alighted both and put the body into a tomb of marble Then Sir Bohort commended the good man unto God and departed And he rode all that day and harbored with an old lady And on the morrow he rode unto the castle in a valley and there he met with a yeoman Tell me said Sir Bohort knowest thou of any adventure Sir said he here shall be under this castle a great and marvellous tournament Then Sir Bohort thought to be there if he might meet with any of the fellowship that were in quest of the Sangreal so he turned to a hermitage that was on the border of the forest And when he was come hither he found there Sir Lionel his brother who sat all armed at the entry of the chapel door And when Sir Bohort saw him he had great joy and he alighted off his horse and said Fair brother when came ye hither As soon as Sir Lionel saw him he said Ah Sir Bohort make ye no false show for as for you I might have been slain for ye left me in peril of death to go succor a gentlewoman and for that misdeed I now assure you but death for ye have right well deserved it When Sir Bohort perceived his brother s wrath he kneeled down to the earth and cried him mercy holding up both his hands and prayed him to forgive him Nay said Sir Lionel thou shalt have but death for it if I have the upper hand therefore leap upon thy horse and keep thyself and if thou do not I will run upon thee there as thou standest on foot and so the shame shall be mine and the harm thine but of that I reck not When Sir Bohort saw that he must fight with his brother or else die he wist not what to do Then his heart counselled him not so to do inasmuch as Sir Lionel was his elder brother wherefore he ought to bear him reverence Yet kneeled he down before Sir Lionel s horse s feet and said Fair brother have mercy upon me and slay me not But Sir Lionel cared not for the fiend had brought him in such a will that he should slay him When he saw that Sir Bohort would not rise to give him battle he rushed over him so that he smote him with his horse s feet to the earth and hurt him sore that he swooned of distress When Sir Lionel saw this he alighted from his horse for to have smitten off his head and so he took him by the helm and would have rent it from his head But it happened that Sir Colgrevance a knight of the Round Table came at that time thither as it was our Lord s will and then he beheld how Sir Lionel would have slain his brother and he knew Sir Bohort whom he loved right well Then leapt he down from his horse and took Sir Lionel by the shoulders and drew him strongly back from Sir Bohort and said Sir Lionel will ye slay your brother Why said Sir Lionel will ye stay me If ye interfere in this I will slay you and him after Then he ran upon Sir Bohort and would have smitten him but Sir Colgrevance ran between them and said If ye persist to do so any more we two shall meddle together Then Sir Lionel defied him and gave him a great stroke through the helm Then he drew his sword for he was a passing good knight and defended himself right manfully So long endured the battle that Sir Bohort rose up all anguishly and beheld Sir Colgrevance the good knight fight with his brother for his quarrel Then was he full sorry and heavy and thought that if Sir Colgrevance slew him that was his brother he should never have joy and if his brother slew Sir Colgrevance the shame should ever be his Then would he have risen for to have parted them but he had not so much strength to stand on his feet so he staid so long that Sir Colgrevance had the worse for Sir Lionel was of great chivalry and right hardy Then cried Sir Colgrevance Ah Sir Bohort why come ye not to bring me out of peril of death wherein I have put me to succor you With that Sir Lionel smote off his helm and bore him to the earth And when he had slain Sir Colgrevance he ran upon his brother as a fiendly man and gave him such a stroke that he made him stoop And he that was full of humility prayed him for God s sake leave this battle for if it befell fair brother that I slew you or ye me we should be dead of that sin Pray ye not me for mercy said Sir Lionel Then Sir Bohort all weeping drew his sword and said Now God have mercy upon me though I defend my life against my brother With that Sir Bohort lifted up his sword and would have smitten his brother Then he heard a voice that said Flee Sir Bohort and touch him not Right so alighted a cloud between them in the likeness of a fire and a marvellous flame so that they both fell to the earth and lay there a great while in a swoon And when they came to themselves Sir Bohort saw that his brother had no harm and he was right glad for he dread sore that God had taken vengeance upon him Then Sir Lionel said to his brother Brother forgive me for God s sake all that I have trespassed against you And Sir Bohort answered God forgive it thee and I do With that Sir Bohort heard a voice say Sir Bohort take thy way anon right to the sea for Sir Perceval abideth thee there So Sir Bohort departed and rode the nearest way to the sea And at last he came to an abbey that was nigh the sea That night he rested him there and in his sleep there came a voice unto him and bade him go to the sea shore He started up and made a sign of the cross on his forehead and armed himself and made ready his horse and mounted him and at a broken wall he rode out and came to the sea shore And there he found a ship covered all with white samite And he entered into the ship but it was anon so dark that he might see no man and he laid him down and slept till it was day Then he awaked and saw in the middle of the ship a knight all armed save his helm And then he knew it was Sir Perceval de Galis and each made of other right great joy Then said Sir Perceval We lack nothing now but the good knight Sir Galahad SIR LAUNCELOT Resumed It befell upon a night Sir Launcelot arrived before a castle which was rich and fair And there was a postern that was opened toward the sea and was open without any keeping save two lions kept the entry and the moon shined clear Anon Sir Launcelot heard a voice that said Launcelot enter into the castle where thou shalt see a great part of thy desire So he went unto the gate and saw the two lions then he set hands to his sword and drew it Then there came suddenly as it were a stroke upon the arm so sore that the sword fell out of his hand and he heard a voice that said O man of evil faith wherefore believest thou more in thy armor than in thy Maker Then said Sir Launcelot Fair Lord I thank thee of thy great mercy that thou reprovest me of my misdeed now see I well that thou holdest me for thy servant Then he made a cross on his forehead and came to the lions and they made semblance to do him harm but he passed them without hurt and entered into the castle and he found no gate nor door but it was open But at the last he found a chamber whereof the door was shut and he set his hand thereto to have opened it but he might not Then he listened and heard a voice which sung so sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing and the voice said Joy and honor be to the Father of heaven Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down before the chamber for well he wist that there was the Sangreal in that chamber Then said he Fair sweet Lord if ever I did anything that pleased thee for thy pity show me something of that which I seek And with that he saw the chamber door open and there came out a great clearness that the house was as bright as though all the torches of the world had been there So he came to the chamber door and would have entered and anon a voice said unto him Stay Sir Launcelot and enter not And he withdrew him back and was right heavy in his mind Then looked he in the midst of the chamber and saw a table of silver and the holy vessel covered with red samite and many angels about it whereof one held a candle of wax burning and another held a cross and the ornaments of the altar O yet methought I saw the Holy Grail All pall d in crimson samite and around Great angels awful shapes and wings and eyes The Holy Grail Then for very wonder and thankfulness Sir Launcelot forgot himself and he stepped forward and entered the chamber And suddenly a breath that seemed intermixed with fire smote him so sore in the visage that therewith he fell to the ground and had no power to rise Then felt he many hands about him which took him up and bare him out of the chamber without any amending of his swoon and left him there seeming dead to all the people So on the morrow when it was fair daylight and they within were arisen they found Sir Launcelot lying before the chamber door And they looked upon him and felt his pulse to know if there were any life in him And they found life in him but he might neither stand nor stir any member that he had So they took him and bare him into a chamber and laid him upon a bed far from all folk and there he lay many days Then the one said he was alive and the others said nay But said an old man He is as full of life as the mightiest of you all and therefore I counsel you that he be well kept till God bring him back again And after twenty four days he opened his eyes and when he saw folk he made great sorrow and said Why have ye wakened me for I was better at ease than I am now What have ye seen said they about him I have seen said he great marvels that no tongue can tell and more than any heart can think Then they said Sir the quest of the Sangreal is achieved right now in you and never shall ye see more of it than ye have seen I thank God said Sir Launcelot of his great mercy for that I have seen for it sufficeth me Then he rose up and clothed himself and when he was so arrayed they marvelled all for they knew it was Sir Launcelot the good knight And after four days he took his leave of the lord of the castle and of all the fellowship that were there and thanked them for their great labor and care of him Then he departed and turned to Camelot where he found King Arthur and Queen Guenever but many of the knights of the Round Table were slain and destroyed more than half Then all the court was passing glad of Sir Launcelot and he told the king all his adventures that had befallen him since he departed SIR GALAHAD Now when Sir Galahad had rescued Perceval from the twenty knights he rode into a vast forest wherein he abode many days Then he took his way to the sea and it befell him that he was benighted in a hermitage And the good man was glad when he saw he was a knight errant And when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman knocking at the door and the good man came to the door to wit what she would Then she said I would speak with the knight which is with you Then Galahad went to her and asked her what she would Sir Galahad said she I will that ye arm you and mount upon your horse and follow me for I will show you the highest adventure that ever knight saw Then Galahad armed himself and commended himself to God and bade the damsel go before and he would follow where she led So she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her till she came to the sea and there they found the ship where Sir Bohort and Sir Perceval were who cried from the ship Sir Galahad you are welcome we have waited you long And when he heard them he asked the damsel who they were Sir said she leave your horse here and I shall leave mine and we will join ourselves to their company So they entered into the ship and the two knights received them both with great joy For they knew the damsel that she was Sir Perceval s sister Then the wind arose and drove them through the sea all that day and the next till the ship arrived between two rocks passing great and marvellous but there they might not land for there was a whirlpool but there was another ship and upon it they might go without danger Go we thither said the gentlewoman and there we shall see adventures for such is our Lord s will Then Sir Galahad blessed him and entered therein and then next the gentlewoman and then Sir Bohort and Sir Perceval And when they came on board they found there the table of silver and the Sangreal which was covered with red samite And they made great reverence thereto and Sir Galahad prayed a long time to our Lord that at what time he should ask to pass out of this world he should do so and a voice said to him Galahad thou shalt have thy request and when thou askest the death of thy body thou shalt have it and then shalt thou find the life of thy soul And anon the wind drove them across the sea till they came to the city of Sarras Then took they out of the ship the table of silver and Sir Perceval and Sir Bohort took it before and Sir Galahad came behind and right so they went to the city And at the gate of the city they saw an old man a cripple And Sir Launfal said I behold in thee An image of Him who died on the tree Thou also hast had thy crown of thorns Thou also hast had the world s buffets and scorns And to thy life were not denied The wounds in thy hands and feet and side Mild Mary s son acknowledge me Behold through Him I give to thee Lowell s Holy Grail Then Galahad called him and bade him help to bear this heavy thing Truly said the old man it is ten years since I could not go but with crutches Care thou not said Sir Galahad but arise up and show thy good will Then the old man rose up and assayed and found himself as whole as ever he was and he ran to the table and took one part with Sir Galahad When they came to the city it chanced that the king was just dead and all the city was dismayed and wist not who might be their king Right so as they were in counsel there came a voice among them and bade them choose the youngest knight of those three to be their king So they made Sir Galahad king by all the assent of the city And when he was made king he commanded to make a chest of gold and of precious stones to hold the holy vessel And every day the three companions would come before it and make their prayers Now at the year s end and the same day of the year that Sir Galahad received the crown he got up early and with his fellows came to where the holy vessel was and they saw one kneeling before it that had about him a great fellowship of angels and he called Sir Galahad and said Come thou servant of the Lord and thou shalt see what thou hast much desired to see And Sir Galahad s mortal flesh trembled right hard when he began to behold the spiritual things Then said the good man Now wottest thou who I am Nay said Sir Galahad I am Joseph of Arimathea whom our Lord hath sent here to thee to bear thee fellowship Then Sir Galahad held up his hands toward heaven and said Now blessed Lord would I not longer live if it might please thee And when he had said these words Sir Galahad went to Sir Perceval and to Sir Bohort and kissed them and commended them to God And then he kneeled down before the table and made his prayers and suddenly his soul departed and a great multitude of angels bare his soul up to heaven so as the two fellows could well behold it Also they saw come from heaven a hand but they saw not the body and the hand came right to the vessel and bare it up to heaven Since then was there never one so hardy as to say that he had seen the Sangreal on earth any more CHAPTER XXII SIR AGRIVAIN S TREASON When Sir Perceval and Sir Bohort saw Sir Galahad dead they made as much sorrow as ever did two men And if they had not been good men they might have fallen into despair 
3554-172175-0000	train-other-500	As soon as Sir Galahad was buried Sir Perceval retired to a hermitage out of the city and took a religious clothing and Sir Bohort was always with him but did not change his secular clothing because he purposed to return to the realm of Loegria
3554-172175-0001	train-other-500	Thus a year and two months lived Sir Perceval in the hermitage a full holy life and then passed out of this world and Sir Bohort buried him by his sister and Sir Galahad Then Sir Bohort armed himself and departed from Sarras and entered into a ship
3554-172175-0002	train-other-500	and sailed to the kingdom of Loegria and in due time arrived safe at Camelot where the king was Then was there great joy made of him in the whole court for they feared he had been dead Then the king made great clerks to come before him that they should chronicle of the high adventures of the good knights
3554-172175-0003	train-other-500	And Sir Bohort told him of the adventures that had befallen him and his two fellows Sir Perceval and Sir Galahad And Sir Launcelot told the adventures of the Sangreal that he had seen All this was made in great books and put up in the church at Salisbury
none	none	 So King Arthur and Queen Guenever made great joy of the remnant that were come home and chiefly of Sir Launcelot and Sir Bohort Then Sir Launcelot began to resort unto Queen Guenever again and forgot the promise that he made in the quest so that many in the court spoke of it 
3554-172175-0004	train-other-500	and in especial Sir Agrivain Sir Gawain s brother for he was ever open mouthed So it happened Sir Gawain and all his brothers were in King Arthur s chamber and then Sir Agrivain said thus openly
3554-172175-0005	train-other-500	I marvel that we all are not ashamed to see and to know so noble a knight as King Arthur so to be shamed by the conduct of Sir Launcelot and the queen Then spoke Sir Gawain and said Brother Sir Agrivain I pray you and charge you move not such matters any more before me
3554-172175-0006	train-other-500	for be ye assured I will not be of your counsel Neither will we said Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth Then will I said Sir Modred I doubt you not said Sir Gawain for to all mischief ever were ye prone yet I would that ye left all this for I know what will come of it
3554-172175-0007	train-other-500	Modred s narrow foxy face Heart hiding smile and gray persistent eye Henceforward too the Powers that tend the soul To help it from the death that cannot die And save it even in extremes began To vex and plague Guinevere
3554-172175-0008	train-other-500	Fall of it what fall may said Sir Agrivain I will disclose it to the king With that came to them King Arthur Now brothers hold your peace said Sir Gawain We will not said Sir Agrivain Then said Sir Gawain I will not hear your tales nor be of your counsel
3554-172175-0009	train-other-500	No more will I said Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris and therewith they departed making great sorrow Then Sir Agrivain told the king all that was said in the court of the conduct of Sir Launcelot and the queen
none	none	 and it grieved the king very much But he would not believe it to be true without proof So Sir Agrivain laid a plot to entrap Sir Launcelot and the queen intending to take them together unawares 
3554-172175-0010	train-other-500	Sir Agrivain and Sir Modred led a party for this purpose
none	none	 but Sir Launcelot escaped from them having slain Sir Agrivain and wounded Sir Modred 
3554-172175-0011	train-other-500	Then Sir Launcelot hastened to his friends and told them what had happened and withdrew with them to the forest but he left spies to bring him tidings of whatever might be done So Sir Launcelot escaped but the queen remained in the king s power
3554-172175-0012	train-other-500	and Arthur could no longer doubt of her guilt And the law was such in those days that they who committed such crimes of what estate or condition soever they were must be burned to death
none	none	 and so it was ordained for Queen Guenever 
3554-172175-0013	train-other-500	Then said King Arthur to Sir Gawain I pray you make you ready in your best armor with your brethren Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth to bring my queen to the fire there to receive her death Nay my most noble lord said Sir Gawain
3554-172175-0014	train-other-500	that will I never do for know thou well my heart will never serve me to see her die and it shall never be said that I was of your counsel in her death Then the king commanded Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth to be there and they said We will be there as ye command us sire
3554-172175-0015	train-other-500	but in peaceable wise and bear no armor upon us So the queen was led forth and her ghostly father was brought to her to shrive her and there was weeping and wailing of many lords and ladies And one went and told Sir Launcelot that the queen was led forth to her death
3554-172175-0016	train-other-500	Then Sir Launcelot and the knights that were with him fell upon the troop that guarded the queen and dispersed them and slew all who withstood them
none	none	 And in the confusion Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris were slain for they were unarmed and defenceless 
3554-172175-0017	train-other-500	And Sir Launcelot carried away the queen to his castle of La Joyeuse Garde Then there came one to Sir Gawain and told him how that Sir Launcelot had slain the knights and carried away the queen O Lord defend my brethren
3554-172175-0018	train-other-500	said Sir Gawain Truly said the man Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris are slain Alas said Sir Gawain now is my joy gone And then he fell down and swooned and long he lay there as he had been dead
3554-172175-0019	train-other-500	When he arose out of his swoon Sir Gawain ran to the king crying O King Arthur mine uncle my brothers are slain Then the king wept and he both My king my lord and mine uncle said Sir Gawain bear witness now that I make you a promise that I shall hold by my knighthood
3554-172175-0020	train-other-500	and from this day I will never fail Sir Launcelot until the one of us have slain the other I will seek Sir Launcelot throughout seven kings realms but I shall slay him or he shall slay me Ye shall not need to seek him said the king for as I hear Sir Launcelot will abide me and you in the Joyeuse Garde
3554-172175-0021	train-other-500	and much people draweth unto him as I hear say That may I believe said Sir Gawain but my lord summon your friends and I will summon mine It shall be done said the king So then the king sent letters and writs throughout all England
none	none	 both in the length and breadth to summon all his knights And unto Arthur drew many knights dukes and earls so that he had a great host 
3554-172175-0022	train-other-500	Thereof heard Sir Launcelot and collected all whom he could and many good knights held with him both for his sake and for the queen s sake But King Arthur s host was too great for Sir Launcelot to abide him in the field and he was full loath to do battle against the king
3554-172175-0023	train-other-500	So Sir Launcelot drew him to his strong castle with all manner of provisions Then came King Arthur with Sir Gawain and laid siege all about La Joyeuse Garde both the town and the castle but in no wise would Sir Launcelot ride out of his castle
3554-172175-0024	train-other-500	neither suffer any of his knights to issue out until many weeks were past Then it befell upon a day in harvest time Sir Launcelot looked over the wall and spoke aloud to King Arthur and Sir Gawain My lords both all is in vain that ye do at this siege
3554-172175-0025	train-other-500	for here ye shall win no worship but only dishonor for if I list to come out and my good knights I shall soon make an end of this war Come forth said Arthur if thou darest and I promise thee I shall meet thee in the midst of the field
none	none	 God forbid me said Sir Launcelot that I should encounter with the most noble king that made me knight Fie upon thy fair language said the king for know thou well I am thy mortal foe and ever will be to my dying day And Sir Gawain said What cause hadst thou to slay my brother Sir Gaheris who bore no arms against thee and Sir Gareth whom thou madest knight and who 
3554-172175-0026	train-other-500	loved thee more than all my kin Therefore know thou well I shall make war to thee all the while that I may live When Sir Bohort and Sir Hector de Marys and Sir Lionel heard this outcry they called to them Sir Palamedes and Sir Saffire his brother
none	none	 and Sir 
3554-172175-0027	train-other-500	Lawayn with many more and all went to Sir Launcelot And they said My lord Sir Launcelot we pray you if you will have our service keep us no longer within these walls for know well all your fair speech and forbearance will not avail you
3554-172175-0028	train-other-500	Alas said Sir Launcelot to ride forth and to do battle I am full loath Then he spake again unto the king and Sir Gawain and willed them to keep out of the battle but they despised his words So then Sir Launcelot s fellowship came out of the castle in full good array
3554-172175-0029	train-other-500	And always Sir Launcelot charged all his knights in any wise to save King Arthur and Sir Gawain Then came forth Sir Gawain from the king s host and offered combat and Sir Lionel encountered with him and there Sir Gawain smote Sir Lionel through the body that he fell to the earth as if dead
3554-172175-0030	train-other-500	Then there began a great conflict and much people were slain but ever Sir Launcelot did what he might to save the people on King Arthur s party and ever King Arthur followed Sir Launcelot to slay him but Sir Launcelot suffered him and would not strike again
3554-172175-0031	train-other-500	Then Sir Bohort encountered with King Arthur and smote him down and he alighted and drew his sword and said to Sir Launcelot Shall I make an end of this war
none	none	 for he meant to have slain King Arthur Not so said Sir Launcelot touch him no more for I will never see that most noble king that made me knight 
3554-172175-0032	train-other-500	either slain or shamed and therewith Sir Launcelot alighted off his horse and took up the king and horsed him again and said thus My lord Arthur for God s love cease this strife And King Arthur looked upon Sir Launcelot
3554-172175-0033	train-other-500	and the tears burst from his eyes thinking on the great courtesy that was in Sir Launcelot more than in any other man and therewith the king rode his way Then anon both parties withdrew to repose them and buried the dead
3554-172175-0034	train-other-500	But the war continued and it was noised abroad through all Christendom and at last it was told afore the pope and he considering the great goodness of King Arthur and of Sir Launcelot called unto him a noble clerk which was the Bishop of Rochester
none	none	 who was then in his dominions and sent him to King Arthur charging him that he take his queen dame Guenever unto him again and make peace with Sir Launcelot 
3554-172175-0035	train-other-500	So by means of this bishop peace was made for the space of one year and King Arthur received back the queen and Sir Launcelot departed from the kingdom with all his knights and went to his own country So they shipped at Cardiff and sailed unto Benwick which some men call Bayonne
3554-172175-0036	train-other-500	And all the people of those lands came to Sir Launcelot and received him home right joyfully
none	none	 And Sir Launcelot stablished and garnished all his towns and castles and he greatly advanced all his noble knights Sir Lionel and Sir Bohort and Sir Hector de Marys Sir Blamor Sir Lawayne 
3554-172175-0037	train-other-500	and many others and made them lords of lands and castles till he left himself no more than any one of them Then Arthur made vast banquets and strange knights From the four winds came in and each one sat Tho served with choice from air land stream and sea
3554-172175-0038	train-other-500	Oft in mid banquet measuring with his eyes His neighbor s make and might Pelleas and Ettarre But when the year was passed King Arthur and Sir Gawain came with a great host and landed upon Sir Launcelot s lands and burned and wasted all that they might overrun
3554-172175-0039	train-other-500	Then spake Sir Bohort and said My lord Sir Launcelot give us leave to meet them in the field and we shall make them rue the time that ever they came to this country Then said Sir Launcelot I am full loath to ride out with my knights for shedding of Christian blood so we will yet a while keep our walls
3554-172175-0040	train-other-500	and I will send a messenger unto my lord Arthur to propose a treaty for better is peace than always war So Sir Launcelot sent forth a damsel and a dwarf with her requiring King Arthur to leave his warring upon his lands and so she started on a palfrey and the dwarf ran by her side
none	none	 And when she came to the pavilion of King Arthur she alighted and there met her a gentle knight Sir Lucan 
3554-172175-0041	train-other-500	the butler and said Fair damsel come ye from Sir Launcelot du Lac Yea sir she said I come hither to speak with the king Alas said Sir Lucan my lord Arthur would be reconciled to Sir Launcelot but Sir Gawain will not suffer him
3554-172175-0042	train-other-500	And with this Sir Lucan led the damsel to the king where he sat with Sir Gawain to hear what she would say So when she had told her tale the tears ran out of the king s eyes and all the lords were forward to advise the king to be accorded with Sir Launcelot save only Sir Gawain and he said
3554-172175-0043	train-other-500	My lord mine uncle what will ye do Will you now turn back now you are so far advanced upon your journey If ye do all the world will speak shame of you Nay said King Arthur I will do as ye advise me but do thou give the damsel her answer for I may not speak to her for pity
3554-172175-0044	train-other-500	Then said Sir Gawain Damsel say ye to Sir Launcelot that it is waste labor to sue to mine uncle for peace and say that I Sir Gawain send him word that I promise him by the faith I owe unto God and to knighthood I shall never leave him till he have slain me or I him
3554-172175-0045	train-other-500	So the damsel returned and when Sir Launcelot had heard this answer the tears ran down his cheeks Then it befell on a day Sir Gawain came before the gates armed at all points and cried with a loud voice
3554-172175-0046	train-other-500	Where art thou now thou false traitor Sir Launcelot Why hidest thou thyself within holes and walls like a coward Look out now thou traitor knight and I will avenge upon thy body the death of my three brethren All this language heard Sir Launcelot and the knights which were about him
3554-172175-0047	train-other-500	and they said to him Sir Launcelot now must ye defend you like a knight or else be shamed for ever
none	none	 for you have slept overlong and suffered overmuch 
3554-172175-0048	train-other-500	Then Sir Launcelot spake on high unto King Arthur and said My lord Arthur now I have forborne long and suffered you and Sir Gawain to do what ye would and now must I needs defend myself inasmuch as Sir Gawain hath appealed me of treason
3554-172175-0049	train-other-500	Then Sir Launcelot armed him and mounted upon his horse and the noble knights came out of the city and the host without stood all apart and so the covenant was made that no man should come near the two knights nor deal with them till one were dead or yielded
none	none	 Then Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawain departed a great way asunder 
3554-172175-0050	train-other-500	and then they came together with all their horses might and each smote the other in the middle of their shields but neither of them was unhorsed but their horses fell to the earth And then they leapt from their horses and drew their swords and gave many sad strokes so that the blood burst out in many places
3554-172175-0051	train-other-500	Now Sir Gawain had this gift from a holy man that every day in the year from morning to noon his strength was increased threefold and then it fell again to its natural measure Sir Launcelot was aware of this and therefore during the three hours that Sir Gawain s strength was at the height
3554-172175-0052	train-other-500	Sir Launcelot covered himself with his shield and kept his might in reserve And during that time Sir Gawain gave him many sad brunts that all the knights that looked on marvelled how Sir Launcelot might endure them Then when it was past noon Sir Gawain had only his own might
3554-172175-0053	train-other-500	and when Sir Launcelot felt him so brought down he stretched himself up and doubled his strokes and gave Sir Gawain such a buffet that he fell down on his side
none	none	 and Sir Launcelot drew back and would strike no more 
3554-172175-0054	train-other-500	Why withdrawest thou false traitor then said Sir Gawain now turn again and slay me for if thou leave me thus when I am whole again I shall do battle with thee again I shall endure you sir by God s grace said Sir Launcelot
3554-172175-0055	train-other-500	but know thou well Sir Gawain I will never smite a felled knight
none	none	 And so Sir Launcelot went into the city and Sir Gawain was borne into King Arthur s pavilion and his wounds were looked to Thus the siege endured and Sir Gawain lay helpless near a month and when he was near recovered came tidings unto King Arthur that made him return with all his host to England CHAPTER XXIII MORTE D ARTHUR Sir Modred was left ruler of all England and he caused letters to be written as if from beyond sea that King Arthur was slain in battle So he called a Parliament and made himself be crowned king and he took the queen Guenever and said plainly that he would wed her but she escaped from him and took refuge in the Tower of London And Sir Modred went and laid siege about the Tower of London and made great assaults thereat but all might not avail him Then came word to Sir Modred that King Arthur had raised the siege of Sir Launcelot and was coming home Then Sir Modred summoned all the barony of the land and much people drew unto Sir Modred and said they would abide with him for better and for worse and he drew a great host to Dover for there he heard say that King Arthur would arrive I hear the steps of Modred in the west And with him many of thy people and knights Once thine whom thou hast loved but grosser grown Than heathen spitting at their vows and thee The Passing of Arthur And as Sir Modred was at Dover with his host came King Arthur with a great number of ships and galleys and there was Sir Modred awaiting upon the landing Then was there launching of great boats and small full of noble men of arms and there was much slaughter of gentle knights on both parts But King Arthur was so courageous there might no manner of knights prevent him to land and his knights fiercely followed him and so they landed and put Sir Modred aback so that he fled and all his people And when the battle was done King Arthur commanded to bury his people that were dead And then was noble Sir Gawain found in a great boat lying more than half dead And King Arthur went to him and made sorrow out of measure Mine uncle said Sir Gawain know thou well my death day is come and all is through mine own hastiness and wilfulness for I am smitten upon the old wound which Sir Launcelot gave me of which I feel I must die And had Sir Launcelot been with you as of old this war had never begun and of all this I am the cause Then Sir Gawain prayed the king to send for Sir Launcelot and to cherish him above all other knights And so at the hour of noon Sir Gawain yielded up his spirit and then the king bade inter him in a chapel within Dover Castle and there all men may see the skull of him and the same wound is seen that Sir Launcelot gave him in battle Then was it told the king that Sir Modred had pitched his camp upon Barrendown and the king rode thither and there was a great battle betwixt them and King Arthur s party stood best and Sir Modred and his party fled unto Canterbury And there was a day assigned betwixt King Arthur and Sir Modred that they should meet upon a down beside Salisbury and not far from the sea side to do battle yet again And at night as the king slept he dreamed a wonderful dream It seemed him verily that there came Sir Gawain unto him with a number of fair ladies with him And when King Arthur saw him he said Welcome my sister s son I weened thou hadst been dead and now I see thee alive great is my joy But O fair nephew what be these ladies that hither be come with you Sir said Sir Gawain all these be ladies for whom I have fought when I was a living man and because I did battle for them in righteous quarrel they have given me grace to bring me hither unto you to warn you of your death if ye fight to morrow with Sir Modred Therefore take ye treaty and proffer you largely for a month s delay for within a month shall come Sir Launcelot and all his noble knights and rescue you worshipfully and slay Sir Modred and all that hold with him And then Sir Gawain and all the ladies vanished And anon the king called to fetch his noble lords and wise bishops unto him And when they were come the king told them his vision and what Sir Gawain had told him Then the king sent Sir Lucan the butler and Sir Bedivere with two bishops and charged them in any wise to take a treaty for a month and a day with Sir Modred So they departed and came to Sir Modred and so at the last Sir Modred was agreed to have Cornwall and Kent during Arthur s life and all England after his death Sir Modred he the nearest to the king His nephew ever like a subtle beast Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne Ready to spring waiting a chance Guinevere Then was it agreed that King Arthur and Sir Modred should meet betwixt both their hosts and each of them should bring fourteen persons and then and there they should sign the treaty And when King Arthur and his knights were prepared to go forth he warned all his host If so be ye see any sword drawn look ye come on fiercely and slay whomsoever withstandeth for I in no wise trust that traitor Sir Modred In like wise Sir Modred warned his host So they met and were agreed and accorded thoroughly And wine was brought and they drank Right then came an adder out of a little heath bush and stung a knight on the foot And when the knight felt him sting he looked down and saw the adder and then he drew his sword to slay the adder and thought of no other harm And when the host on both sides saw that sword drawn they blew trumpets and horns and shouted greatly And King Arthur took his horse and rode to his party saying Alas this unhappy day And Sir Modred did in like wise And never was there a more doleful battle in Christian land And ever King Arthur rode throughout the battle and did full nobly as a worthy king should and Sir Modred that day did his devoir and put himself in great peril And thus they fought all the long day till the most of all the noble knights lay dead upon the ground Then the king looked about him and saw of all his host were left alive but two knights Sir Lucan the butler and Sir Bedivere his brother and they were full sore wounded Then King Arthur saw where Sir Modred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men Now give me my spear said Arthur unto Sir Lucan for yonder I espy the traitor that hast wrought all this woe Sir let him be said Sir Lucan for if ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged upon him Remember what the sprite of Sir Gawain told you and leave off now for ye have won the field and if ye leave off now this evil day of destiny is past Betide me life betide me death said King Arthur he shall not now escape my hands Then the king took his spear in both hands and ran toward Sir Modred crying Traitor now is thy death day come And there King Arthur smote Sir Modred under the shield with a thrust of his spear through the body And when Sir Modred felt that he had his death wound with the might that he had he smote King Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands on the side of the head that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain pan and then Sir Modred fell stark dead upon the earth And the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth And Sir Lucan the butler and Sir Bedivere raised him up and gently led him betwixt them both to a little chapel not far from the sea side And when the king was there he thought him well eased Then heard they people cry in the field And Sir Lucan went to see what that cry betokened and he saw by the moonlight that pillers and robbers were come to rob the dead And he returned and said to the king By my rede it is best that we bring you to some town I would it were so said the king And when the king tried to go he fainted Then Sir Lucan took up the king on the one part and Sir Bedivere on the other part and in the lifting Sir Lucan fell in a swoon to the earth for he was grievously wounded And then the noble knight s heart burst And when the king awoke he beheld Sir Lucan how he lay foaming at the mouth and speechless Alas said the king this is to me a full heavy sight to see this noble duke so die for my sake for he would have holpen me that had more need of help than I and he would not complain his heart was so set to help me Then Sir Bedivere wept for his brother Leave this mourning and weeping said the king for wilt thou well if I might live myself the death of Sir Lucan would grieve me evermore but my time hieth fast Therefore said Arthur unto Sir Bedivere take thou Excalibar my good sword and go with it to yonder water side and when thou comest there I charge thee throw my sword in that water and come again and tell me what thou there seest My lord said Sir Bedivere your commandment shall be done So Sir Bedivere departed and by the way he beheld that noble sword that the pommel and the haft were all of precious stones and then he said to himself If I throw this rich sword into the water no good shall come thereof but only harm and loss And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibar under a tree And so as soon as he might he came again to the king What sawest thou there said the king Sir he said I saw nothing Alas thou hast deceived me said the king Go thou lightly again and as thou love me spare not to throw it in Then Sir Bedivere went again and took the sword in his hand to throw it but again it beseemed him but sin and shame to throw away that noble sword and he hid it away again and returned and told the king he had done his commandment What sawest thou there said the king Sir he said I saw nothing but waters deep and waves wan Ah traitor untrue said King Arthur now hast thou betrayed me twice And yet thou art named a noble knight and hast been lief and dear to me But now go again and do as I bid thee for thy long tarrying putteth me in jeopardy of my life Then Sir Bedivere went to the sword and lightly took it up and went to the water side and he bound the girdle about the hilt and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might And there came an arm and a hand out of the water and met it and caught it and shook it thrice and brandished it and then vanished away the hand with the sword in the water Then Sir Bedivere came again to the king and told him what he saw Help me hence said the king for I fear I have tarried too long Then Sir Bedivere took the king on his back and so went with him to that water side and when they came there even fast by the bank there rode a little barge with many fair ladies in it and among them was a queen and all had black hoods and they wept and shrieked when they saw King Arthur Now put me in the barge said the king And there received him three queens with great mourning and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his head And the queen said Ah dear brother why have ye tarried so long Alas this wound on your head hath caught over much cold And then they rowed from the land and Sir Bedivere beheld them go from him Then he cried Ah my lord Arthur will ye leave me here alone among mine enemies Comfort thyself said the king for in me is no further help for I will to the Isle of Avalon to heal me of my grievous wound And as soon as Sir Bedivere had lost sight of the barge he wept and wailed then he took the forest and went all that night and in the morning he was ware of a chapel and a hermitage Then went Sir Bedivere thither and when he came into the chapel he saw where lay an hermit on the ground near a tomb that was newly graven Sir said Sir Bedivere what man is there buried that ye pray so near unto Fair son said the hermit I know not verily But this night there came a number of ladies and brought hither one dead and prayed me to bury him Alas said Sir Bedivere that was my lord King Arthur Then Sir Bedivere swooned and when he awoke he prayed the hermit he might abide with him to live with fasting and prayers Ye are welcome said the hermit So there bode Sir Bedivere with the hermit and he put on poor clothes and served the hermit full lowly in fasting and in prayers Thus of Arthur I find never more written in books that be authorized nor more of the very certainty of his death but thus was he led away in a ship wherein were three queens the one was King Arthur s sister Queen Morgane le Fay the other was Viviane the Lady of the Lake and the third was the queen of North Galis And this tale Sir Bedivere knight of the Table Round made to be written Yet some men say that King Arthur is not dead but hid away into another place and men say that he shall come again and reign over England But many say that there is written on his tomb this verse Hie facet Arthurus Rex quondam Rexque futurus Here Arthur lies King once and King to be And when Queen Guenever understood that King Arthur was slain and all the noble knights with him she stole away and five ladies with her and so she went to Almesbury and made herself a nun and ware white clothes and black and took great penance as ever did sinful lady and lived in fasting prayers and alms deeds And there she was abbess and ruler of the nuns And when she came to Almesbury she spake There to the nuns and said Mine enemies Pursue me but O peaceful Sisterhood Receive and yield me sanctuary nor ask Her name to whom ye yield it till her time To tell you and her beauty grace and power Wrought as a charm upon them and they spared To ask it Guinevere Now turn we from her and speak of Sir Launcelot of the Lake When Sir Launcelot heard in his country that Sir Modred was crowned king of England and made war against his own uncle King Arthur then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure and said to his kinsmen Alas that double traitor Sir Modred now it repenteth me that ever he escaped out of my hands Then Sir Launcelot and his fellows made ready in all haste with ships and galleys to pass into England and so he passed over till he came to Dover and there he landed with a great army Then Sir Launcelot was told that King Arthur was slain Alas said Sir Launcelot this is the heaviest tidings that ever came to me Then he called the kings dukes barons and knights and said thus My fair lords I thank you all for coming into this country with me but we came too late and that shall repent me while I live But since it is so said Sir Launcelot I will myself ride and seek my lady Queen Guenever for I have heard say she hath fled into the west therefore ye shall abide me here fifteen days and if I come not within that time then take your ships and your host and depart into your country So Sir Launcelot departed and rode westerly and there he sought many days and at last he came to a nunnery and was seen of Queen Guenever as he walked in the cloister and when she saw him she swooned away And when she might speak she bade him to be called to her And when Sir Launcelot was brought to her she said Sir Launcelot I require thee and beseech thee for all the love that ever was betwixt us that thou never see me more but return to thy kingdom and take thee a wife and live with her with joy and bliss and pray for me to my Lord that I may get my soul s health Nay madam said Sir Launcelot wit you well that I shall never do but the same destiny that ye have taken you to will I take me unto for to please and serve God And so they parted with tears and much lamentation and the ladies bare the queen to her chamber and Sir Launcelot took his horse and rode away weeping And at last Sir Launcelot was ware of a hermitage and a chapel and then he heard a little bell ring to mass and thither he rode and alighted and tied his horse to the gate and heard mass And he that sang the mass was the hermit with whom Sir Bedivere had taken up his abode and Sir Bedivere knew Sir Launcelot and they spake together after mass But when Sir Bedivere had told his tale Sir Launcelot s heart almost burst for sorrow Then he kneeled down and prayed the hermit to shrive him and besought that he might be his brother Then the hermit said I will gladly and then he put a habit upon Sir Launcelot and there he served God day and night with prayers and fastings And the great host abode at Dover till the end of the fifteen days set by Sir Launcelot and then Sir Bohort made them to go home again to their own country and Sir Bohort Sir Hector de Marys Sir Blamor and many others took on them to ride through all England to seek Sir Launcelot So Sir Bohort by fortune rode until he came to the same chapel where Sir Launcelot was and when he saw Sir Launcelot in that manner of clothing he prayed the hermit that he might be in that same And so there was an habit put upon him and there he lived in prayers and fasting And within half a year came others of the knights their fellows and took such a habit as Sir Launcelot and Sir Bohort had Thus they endured in great penance six years And upon a night there came a vision to Sir Launcelot and charged him to haste toward Almesbury and by the time thou come there thou shalt find Queen Guenever dead Then Sir Launcelot rose up early and told the hermit thereof Then said the hermit It were well that ye disobey not this vision And Sir Launcelot took his seven companions with him and on foot they went from Glastonbury to Almesbury which is more than thirty miles And when they were come to Almesbury they found that Queen Guenever died but half an hour before Then Sir Launcelot saw her visage but he wept not greatly but sighed And so he did all the observance of the service himself both the dirige at night and at morn he sang mass And there was prepared an horse bier and Sir Launcelot and his fellows followed the bier on foot from Almesbury until they came to Glastonbury and she was wrapped in cered clothes and laid in a coffin of marble And when she was put in the earth Sir Launcelot swooned and lay long as one dead And Sir Launcelot never after ate but little meat nor drank but continually mourned And within six weeks Sir Launcelot fell sick and he sent for the hermit and all his true fellows and said Sir hermit I pray you give me all my rights that a Christian man ought to have It shall not need said the hermit and all his fellows it is but heaviness of your blood and to morrow morn you shall be well My fair lords said Sir Launcelot my careful body will into the earth I have warning more than now I will say therefore give me my rights So when he was houseled and aneled and had all that a Christian man ought to have he prayed the hermit that his fellows might bear his body to Joyous Garde Some men say it was Alnwick and some say it was Bamborough It repenteth me sore said Sir Launcelot but I made a vow aforetime that in Joyous Garde I would be buried Then there was weeping and wringing of hands among his fellows And that night Sir Launcelot died and when Sir Bohort and his fellows came to his bedside the next morning they found him stark dead and he lay as if he had smiled and the sweetest savor all about him that ever they knew And they put Sir Launcelot into the same horse bier that Queen Guenever was laid in and the hermit and they altogether went with the body till they came to Joyous Garde And there they laid his corpse in the body of the quire and sang and read many psalms and prayers over him And ever his visage was laid open and naked that all folks might behold him And right thus as they were at their service there came Sir Hector de Maris that had seven years sought Sir Launcelot his brother through all England Scotland and Wales And when Sir Hector heard such sounds in the chapel of Joyous Garde he alighted and came into the quire And all they knew Sir Hector Then went Sir Bohort and told him how there lay Sir Launcelot his brother dead Then Sir Hector threw his shield his sword and helm from him And when he beheld Sir Launcelot s visage it were hard for any tongue to tell the doleful complaints he made for his brother Ah Sir Launcelot he said there thou liest And now I dare to say thou wert never matched of none earthly knight s hand And thou wert the courteousest knight that ever bare shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrode horse and thou wert the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved woman and thou wert the kindest man that ever struck with sword And thou wert the goodliest person that ever came among press of knights And thou wert the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies And thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put spear in the rest Then there was weeping and dolor out of measure Thus they kept Sir Launcelot s corpse fifteen days and then they buried it with great devotion Then they went back with the hermit to his hermitage And Sir Bedivere was there ever still hermit to his life s end And Sir Bohort Sir Hector Sir Blamor and Sir Bleoberis went into the Holy Land And these four knights did many battles upon the miscreants the Turks and there they died upon a Good Friday as it pleased God Thus endeth this noble and joyous book entitled La Morte d Arthur notwithstanding it treateth of the birth life and acts of the said King Arthur and of his noble Knights of the Round Table their marvellous enquests and adventures the achieving of the Sangreal and in the end le Morte d Arthur with the dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all Which book was reduced into English by Sir Thomas Mallory Knight and divided into twenty one books chaptered and imprinted and finished in the Abbey Westmestre the last day of July the year of our Lord MCCCCLXXXV Caxton me fieri fecit THE MABINOGEON INTRODUCTORY NOTE It has been well known to the literati and antiquarians of Europe that there exist in the great public libraries voluminous manuscripts of romances and tales once popular but which on the invention of printing had already become antiquated and fallen into neglect They were therefore never printed and seldom perused even by the learned until about half a century ago when attention was again directed to them and they were found very curious monuments of ancient manners habits and modes of thinking Several have since been edited some by individuals as Sir Walter Scott and the poet Southey others by antiquarian societies The class of readers which could be counted on for such publications was so small that no inducement of profit could be found to tempt editors and publishers to give them to the world It was therefore only a few and those the most accessible which were put in print There was a class of manuscripts of this kind which were known or rather suspected to be both curious and valuable but which it seemed almost hopeless to expect ever to see in fair printed English These were the Welsh popular tales called Mabinogeon a plural word the singular being Mabinogi a tale Manuscripts of these were contained in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and elsewhere but the difficulty was to find translators and editors The Welsh is a spoken language among the peasantry of Wales but is entirely neglected by the learned unless they are natives of the principality Of the few Welsh scholars none were found who took sufficient interest in this branch of learning to give these productions to the English public Southey and Scott and others who like them loved the old romantic legends of their country often urged upon the Welsh literati the duty of reproducing the Mabinogeon Southey in the preface of his edition of Moted Arthur says The specimens which I have seen are exceedingly curious nor is there a greater desideratum in British literature than an edition of these tales with a literal version and such comments as mister Davies of all men is best qualified to give Certain it is that many of the round table fictions originated in Wales or in Bretagne and probably might still be traced there Again in a letter to Sir Charles W W Wynn dated eighteen nineteen he says I begin almost to despair of ever seeing more of the Mabinogeon and yet if some competent Welshman could be found to edit it carefully with as literal a version as possible I am sure it might be made worth his while by a subscription printing a small edition at a high price perhaps two hundred at five guineas I myself would gladly subscribe at that price per volume for such an edition of the whole of your genuine remains in prose and verse Till some such collection is made the gentlemen of Wales ought to be prohibited from wearing a leek ay and interdicted from toasted cheese also Your bards would have met with better usage if they had been Scotchmen Sharon Turner and Sir Walter Scott also expressed a similar wish for the publication of the Welsh manuscripts The former took part in an attempt to effect it through the instrumentality of a mister Owen a Welshman but we judge by what Southey says of him imperfectly acquainted with English Southey s language is William Owen lent me three parts of the Mabinogeon delightfully translated into so Welsh an idiom and syntax that such a translation is as instructive as an original In another letter he adds Let Sharon make his language grammatical but not alter their idiom in the slightest point It is probable mister Owen did not proceed far in an undertaking which so executed could expect but little popular patronage It was not till an individual should appear possessed of the requisite knowledge of the two languages of enthusiasm sufficient for the task and of pecuniary resources sufficient to be independent of the booksellers and of the reading public that such a work could be confidently expected Such an individual has since Southey s day and Scott s appeared in the person of Lady Charlotte Guest an English lady united to a gentleman of property in Wales who having acquired the language of the principality and become enthusiastically fond of its literary treasures has given them to the English reader in a dress which the printer s and the engraver s arts have done their best to adorn In four royal octavo volumes containing the Welsh originals the translation and ample illustrations from French German and other contemporary and affiliated literature the Mabinogeon is spread before us To the antiquarian and the student of language and ethnology an invaluable treasure it yet can hardly in such a form win its way to popular acquaintance We claim no other merit than that of bringing it to the knowledge of our readers of abridging its details of selecting its most attractive portions and of faithfully preserving throughout the style in which Lady Guest has clothed her legends For this service we hope that our readers will confess we have laid them under no light obligation CHAPTER I THE BRITONS The earliest inhabitants of Britain are supposed to have been a branch of that great family known in history by the designation of Celts Cambria which is a frequent name for Wales is thought to be derived from Cymri the name which the Welsh traditions apply to an immigrant people who entered the island from the adjacent continent This name is thought to be identical with those of Cimmerians and Cimbri under which the Greek and Roman historians describe a barbarous people who spread themselves from the north of the Euxine over the whole of Northwestern Europe The origin of the names Wales and Welsh has been much canvassed Some writers make them a derivation from Gael or Gaul which names are said to signify woodlanders others observe that Walsh in the northern languages signifies a stranger and that the aboriginal Britons were so called by those who at a later era invaded the island and possessed the greater part of it the Saxons and Angles The Romans held Britain from the invasion of Julius Caesar till their voluntary withdrawal from the island A D four hundred twenty that is about five hundred years In that time there must have been a wide diffusion of their arts and institutions among the natives The remains of roads cities and fortifications show that they did much to develop and improve the country while those of their villas and castles prove that many of the settlers possessed wealth and taste for the ornamental arts Yet the Roman sway was sustained chiefly by force and never extended over the entire island The northern portion now Scotland remained independent and the western portion constituting Wales and Cornwall was only nominally subjected Neither did the later invading hordes succeed in subduing the remoter sections of the island For ages after the arrival of the Saxons under Hengist and Horsa A D four hundred forty nine the whole western coast of Britain was possessed by the aboriginal inhabitants engaged in constant warfare with the invaders It has therefore been a favorite boast of the people of Wales and Cornwall that the original British stock flourishes in its unmixed purity only among them We see this notion flashing out in poetry occasionally as when Gray in The Bard prophetically describing Queen Elizabeth who was of the Tudor a Welsh race says Her eye proclaims her of the Briton line and contrasting the princes of the Tudor with those of the Norman race he exclaims All hail ye genuine kings Britannia s issue hail THE WELSH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE The Welsh language is one of the oldest in Europe It possesses poems the origin of which is referred with probability to the sixth century The language of some of these is so antiquated that the best scholars differ about the interpretation of many passages but generally speaking the body of poetry which the Welsh possess from the year one thousand downwards is intelligible to those who are acquainted with the modern language Till within the last half century these compositions remained buried in the libraries of colleges or of individuals and so difficult of access that no successful attempt was made to give them to the world This reproach was removed after ineffectual appeals to the patriotism of the gentry of Wales by Owen Jones a furrier of London who at his own expense collected and published the chief productions of Welsh literature under the title of the Myvyrian Archaeology of Wales In this task he was assisted by doctor Owen and other Welsh scholars After the cessation of Jones exertions the old apathy returned and continued till within a few years doctor Owen exerted himself to obtain support for the publication of the Mabinogeon or Prose Tales of the Welsh but died without accomplishing his purpose which has since been carried into execution by Lady Charlotte Guest The legends which fill the remainder of this volume are taken from this work of which we have already spoken more fully in the introductory chapter to the First Part THE WELSH BARDS The authors to whom the oldest Welsh poems are attributed are Aneurin who is supposed to have lived A D five hundred to five hundred fifty and Taliesin Llywarch Hen Llywarch the Aged and Myrddin or Merlin who were a few years later The authenticity of the poems which bear their names has been assailed and it is still an open question how many and which of them are authentic though it is hardly to be doubted that some are so The poem of Aneurin entitled the Gododin bears very strong marks of authenticity Aneurin was one of the Northern Britons of Strath Clyde who have left to that part of the district they inhabited the name of Cumberland or Land of the Cymri In this poem he laments the defeat of his countrymen by the Saxons at the battle of Cattraeth in consequence of having partaken too freely of the mead before joining in combat The bard himself and two of his fellow warriors were all who escaped from the field A portion of this poem has been translated by Gray of which the following is an extract To Cattraeth s vale in glittering row Twice two hundred warriors go Every warrior s manly neck Chains of regal honor deck Wreathed in many a golden link From the golden cup they drink Nectar that the bees produce Or the grape s exalted juice Flushed with mirth and hope they burn But none to Cattraeth s vale return Save Aeron brave and Conan strong Bursting through the bloody throng And I the meanest of them all That live to weep and sing their fall The works of Taliesin are of much more questionable authenticity There is a story of the adventures of Taliesin so strongly marked with mythical traits as to cast suspicion on the writings attributed to him This story will be found in the subsequent pages THE TRIADS The Triads are a peculiar species of poetical composition of which the Welsh bards have left numerous examples They are enumerations of a triad of persons or events or observations strung together in one short sentence This form of composition originally invented in all likelihood to assist the memory has been raised by the Welsh to a degree of elegance of which it hardly at first sight appears susceptible The Triads are of all ages some of them probably as old as anything in the language Short as they are individually the collection in the Myvyrian Archaeology occupies more than one hundred and seventy pages of double columns We will give some specimens beginning with personal triads and giving the first place to one of King Arthur s own composition I have three heroes in battle Mael the tall and Llyr with his army And Caradoc the pillar of Wales The three principal bards of the island of Britain Merlin Ambrose Merlin the son of Mprfyn called also Merlin the Wild And Taliesin the chief of the bards The three golden tongued knights of the court of Arthur Gawain son of Gwyar Drydvas son of Tryphin And Ehwlod son of Madag ap Uther The three honorable feasts of the island of Britain The feast of Caswallaun after repelling Julius Caesar from this isle The feast of Aurelius Ambrosius after he had conquered the Saxons And the feast of King Arthur at Carleon upon Usk Guenever the daughter of Laodegan the giant Bad when little worse when great Next follow some moral triads Hast thou heard what Dremhidydd sung An ancient watchman on the castle walls A refusal is better than a promise unperformed Hast thou heard what Llenleawg sung The noble chief wearing the golden torques The grave is better than a life of want Hast thou heard what Garselit sung The Irishman whom it is safe to follow Sin is bad if long pursued Hast thou heard what Avaon sung The son of Taliesin of the recording verse The cheek will not conceal the anguish of the heart Didst thou hear what Llywarch sung The intrepid and brave old man Greet kindly though there be no acquaintance CHAPTER II THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN KYNON S ADVENTURE King Arthur was at Caerleon upon Usk and one day he sat in his chamber and with him were Owain the son of Urien and Kynon the son of Clydno and Kay the son of Kyner and Guenever and her handmaidens at needlework by the window In the centre of the chamher King Arthur sat upon a seat of green rushes Footnote The use of green rushes in apartments was by no means peculiar to the court of Carleon upon Usk Our ancestors had a great predilection for them and they seem to have constituted an essential article not only of comfort but of luxury The custom of strewing the floor with rushes is well known to have existed in England during the Middle Ages and also in France over which was spread a covering of flame covered satin and a cushion of red satin was under his elbow Then Arthur spoke If I thought you would not disparage me said he I would sleep while I wait for my repast and you can entertain one another with relating tales and can obtain a flagon of mead and some meat from Kay And the king went to sleep And Kynon the son of Clydno asked Kay for that which Arthur had promised them I too will have the good tale which he promised me said Kay Nay answered Kynon fairer will it be for thee to fulfil Arthur s behest in the first place and then we will tell thee the best tale that we know So Kay went to the kitchen and to the mead cellar and returned bearing a flagon of mead and a golden goblet and a handful of skewers upon which were broiled collops of meat Then they ate the collops and began to drink the mead Now said Kay it is time for you to give me my story Kynon said Owain do thou pay to Kay the tale that is his due I will do so answered Kynon I was the only son of my mother and father and I was exceedingly aspiring and my daring was very great I thought there was no enterprise in the world too mighty for me and after I had achieved all the adventures that were in my own country I equipped myself and set forth to journey through deserts and distant regions And at length it chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world wherein were trees all of equal growth and a river ran through the valley and a path was by the side of the river And I followed the path until midday and continued my journey along the remainder of the valley until the evening and at the extremity of the plain I came to a large and lustrous castle at the foot of which was a torrent And I approached the castle and there I beheld two youths with yellow curling hair each with a frontlet of gold upon his head and clad in a garment of yellow satin and they had gold clasps upon their insteps In the hand of each of them was an ivory bow strung with the sinews of the stag and their arrows and their shafts were of the bone of the whale and were winged with peacock s feathers The shafts also had golden heads And they had daggers with blades of gold and with hilts of the bone of the whale And they were shooting at a mark And a little away from them I saw a man in the prime of life with his beard newly shorn clad in a robe and mantle of yellow satin and round the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace On his feet were shoes of variegated leather Footnote Cordwal is the word in the original and from the manner in which it is used it is evidently intended for the French Cordouan or Cordovan leather which derived its name from Cordova where it was manufactured From this comes also our English word cordwainer fastened by two bosses of gold When I saw him I went towards him and saluted him and such was his courtesy that he no sooner received my greeting than he returned it And he went with me towards the castle Now there were no dwellers in the castle except those who were in one hall And there I saw four and twenty damsels embroidering satin at a window And this I tell thee Kay that the least fair of them was fairer than the fairest maid thou didst ever behold in the island of Britain and the least lovely of them was more lovely than Guenever the wife of Arthur when she appeared loveliest at the feast of Easter They rose up at my coming and six of them took my horse and divested me of my armor and six others took my arms and washed them in a vessel till they were perfectly bright And the third six spread cloths upon the tables and prepared meat And the fourth six took off my soiled garments and placed others upon me namely an under vest and a doublet of fine linen and a robe and a surcoat and a mantle of yellow satin with a broad gold band upon the mantle And they placed cushions both beneath and around me with coverings of red linen and I sat down Now the six maidens who had taken my horse unharnessed him as well as if they had been the best squires in the island of Britain Then behold they brought bowls of silver wherein was water to wash and towels of linen some green and some white and I washed And in a little while the man sat down at the table And I sat next to him and below me sat all the maidens except those who waited on us And the table was of silver and the cloths upon the table were of linen And no vessel was served upon the table that was not either of gold or of silver or of buffalo horn And our meat was brought to us And verily Kay I saw there every sort of meat and every sort of liquor that I ever saw elsewhere but the meat and the liquor were better served there than I ever saw them in any other place Until the repast was half over neither the man nor any one of the damsels spoke a single word to me but when the man perceived that it would be more agreeable for me to converse than to eat any more he began to inquire of me who I was Then I told the man who I was and what was the cause of my journey and said that I was seeking whether any one was superior to me or whether I could gain mastery over all The man looked upon me and he smiled and said If I did not fear to do thee a mischief I would show thee that which thou seekest Then I desired him to speak freely And he said Sleep here to night and in the morning arise early and take the road upwards through the valley until thou readiest the wood A little way within the wood thou wilt come to a large sheltered glade with a mound in the centre And thou wilt see a black man of great stature on the top of the mound He has but one foot and one eye in the middle of his forehead He is the wood ward of that wood And thou wilt see a thousand wild animals grazing around him Inquire of him the way out of the glade and he will reply to thee briefly and will point out the road by which thou shalt find that which thou art in quest of And long seemed that night to me And the next morning I arose and equipped myself and mounted my horse and proceeded straight through the valley to the wood and at length I arrived at the glade And the black man was there sitting upon the top of the mound and I was three times more astonished at the number of wild animals that I beheld than the man had said I should be Then I inquired of him the way and he asked me roughly whither I would go And when I had told him who I was and what I sought Take said he that path that leads toward the head of the glade and there thou wilt find an open space like to a large valley and in the midst of it a tall tree Under this tree is a fountain and by the side of the fountain a marble slab and on the marble slab a silver bowl attached by a chain of silver that it may not be carried away Take the bowl and throw a bowlful of water on the slab And if thou dost not find trouble in that adventure thou needest not seek it during the rest of thy life So I journeyed on until I reached the summit of the steep And there I found everything as the black man had described it to me And I went up to the tree and beneath it I saw the fountain and by its side the marble slab and the silver bowl fastened by the chain Then I took the bowl and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab and immediately I heard a mighty peal of thunder so that heaven and earth seemed to tremble with its fury And after the thunder came a shower and of a truth I tell thee Kay that it was such a shower as neither man nor beast could endure and live I turned my horse s flank toward the shower and placed the beak of my shield over his head and neck while I held the upper part of it over my own neck And thus I withstood the shower And presently the sky became clear and with that behold the birds lighted upon the tree and sang And truly Kay I never heard any melody equal to that either before or since And when I was most charmed with listening to the birds lo a chiding voice was heard of one approaching me and saying O knight what has brought thee hither What evil have I done to thee that thou shouldst act towards me and my possessions as thou hast this day Dost thou not know that the shower to day has left in my dominions neither man nor beast alive that was exposed to it And thereupon behold a knight on a black horse appeared clothed in jet black velvet and with a tabard of black linen about him And we charged each other and as the onset was furious it was not long before I was overthrown Then the knight passed the shaft of his lance through the bridle rein of my horse and rode off with the two horses leaving me where I was And he did not even bestow so much notice upon me as to imprison me nor did he despoil me of my arms So I returned along the road by which I had come And when I reached the glade where the black man was I confess to thee Kay it is a marvel that I did not melt down into a liquid pool through the shame that I felt at the black man s derision And that night I came to the same castle where I had spent the night preceding And I was more agreeably entertained that night than I had been the night before And I conversed freely with the inmates of the castle and none of them alluded to my expedition to the fountain neither did I mention it to any And I remained there that night When I arose on the morrow I found ready saddled a dark bay palfrey with nostrils as red as scarlet And after putting on my armor and leaving there my blessing I returned to my own court And that horse I still possess and he is in the stable yonder And I declare that I would not part with him for the best palfrey in the island of Britain Now of a truth Kay no man ever before confessed to an adventure so much to his own discredit and verily it seems strange to me that neither before nor since have I heard of any person who knew of this adventure and that the subject of it should exist within King Arthur s dominions without any other person lighting upon it CHAPTER III THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN Continued OWAIN S ADVENTURE Footnote Amongst all the characters of early British history none is the more interesting or occupies more conspicuous place than the hero of this tale Urien his father was prince of Rheged a district comprising the present Cumberland and part of the adjacent country His valor and the consideration in which he was held are a frequent theme of Bardic song and form the subject of several very spirited odes by Taliesin Among the Triads there is one relating to him it is thus translated Three Knights of Battle were in court of Arthur Cadwr the Earl of Cornwall Launcelot du Lac and Owain the son of Urien And this was their characteristic that they would not retreat from battle neither for spear nor for arrow nor for sword And Arthur never had shame in battle the day he saw their faces there And they were called the Knights of Battle Now quoth Owain would it not be well to go and endeavor to discover that place By the hand of my friend said Kay often dost thou utter that with thy tongue which thou wouldest not make good with thy deeds In very truth said Guenever it were better thou wert hanged Kay than to use such uncourteous speech towards a man like Owain By the hand of my friend good lady said Kay thy praise of Owain is not greater than mine With that Arthur awoke and asked if he had not been sleeping a little Yes lord answered Owain thou hast slept awhile Is it time for us to go to meat It is lord said Owain Then the horn for washing was sounded and the king and all his household sat down to eat And when the meal was ended Owain withdrew to his lodging and made ready his horse and his arms On the morrow with the dawn of day he put on his armor and mounted his charger and travelled through distant lands and over desert mountains And at length he arrived at the valley which Kynon had described to him and he was certain that it was the same that he sought And journeying along the valley by the side of the river he followed its course till he came to the plain and within sight of the castle When he approached the castle he saw the youths shooting with their bows in the place where Kynon had seen them and the yellow man to whom the castle belonged standing hard by And no sooner had Owain saluted the yellow man than he was saluted by him in return And he went forward towards the castle and there he saw the chamber and when he had entered the chamber he beheld the maidens working at satin embroidery in chains of gold And their beauty and their comeliness seemed to Owain far greater than Kynon had represented to him And they arose to wait upon Owain as they had done to Kynon And the meal which they set before him gave even more satisfaction to Owain than it had done to Kynon About the middle of the repast the yellow man asked Owain the object of his journey And Owain made it known to him and said I am in quest of the knight who guards the fountain Upon this the yellow man smiled and said that he was as loth to point out that adventure to him as he had been to Kynon However he described the whole to Owain and they retired to rest The next morning Owain found his horse made ready for him by the damsels and he set forward and came to the glade where the black man was And the stature of the black man seemed more wonderful to Owain than it had done to Kynon and Owain asked of him his road and he showed it to him And Owain followed the road till he came to the green tree and he beheld the fountain and the slab beside the fountain with the bowl upon it And Owain took the bowl and threw a bowlful of water upon the slab And lo the thunder was heard and after the thunder came the shower more violent than Kynon had described and after the shower the sky became bright And immediately the birds came and settled upon the tree and sang And when their song was most pleasing to Owain he beheld a knight coming towards him through the valley and he prepared to receive him and encountered him violently Having broken both their lances they drew their swords and fought blade to blade Then Owain struck the knight a blow through his helmet head piece and visor and through the skin and the flesh and the bone until it wounded the very brain Then the black knight felt that he had received a mortal wound upon which he turned his horse s head and fled And Owain pursued him and followed close upon him although he was not near enough to strike him with his sword Then Owain descried a vast and resplendent castle and they came to the castle gate And the black knight was allowed to enter and the portcullis was let fall upon Owain and it struck his horse behind the saddle and cut him in two and carried away the rowels of the spurs that were upon Owains heels And the portcullis descended to the floor And the rowels of the spurs and part of the horse were without and Owain with the other part of the horse remained between the two gates and the inner gate was closed so that Owain could not go thence and Owain was in a perplexing situation And while he was in this state he could see through an aperture in the gate a street facing him with a row of houses on each side And he beheld a maiden with yellow curling hair and a frontlet of gold upon her head and she was clad in a dress of yellow satin and on her feet were shoes of variegated leather And she approached the gate and desired that it should be opened Heaven knows lady said Owain it is no more possible for me to open to thee from hence than it is for thee to set me free And he told her his name and who he was Truly said the damsel it is very sad that thou canst not be released and every woman ought to succor thee for I know there is no one more faithful in the service of ladies than thou Therefore quoth she whatever is in my power to do for thy release I will do it Take this ring and put it on thy finger with the stone inside thy hand and close thy hand upon the stone And as long as thou concealest it it will conceal thee When they come forth to fetch thee they will be much grieved that they cannot find thee And I will await thee on the horseblock yonder and thou wilt be able to see me though I cannot see thee Therefore come and place thy hand upon my shoulder that I may know that thou art near me And by the way that I go hence do thou accompany me Then the maiden went away from Owain and he did all that she had told him And the people of the castle came to seek Owain to put him to death and when they found nothing but the half of his horse they were sorely grieved And Owain vanished from among them and went to the maiden and placed his hand upon her shoulder whereupon she set off and Owain followed her until they came to the door of a large and beautiful chamber and the maiden opened it and they went in And Owain looked around the chamber and behold there was not a single nail in it that was not painted with gorgeous colors and there was not a single panel that had not sundry images in gold portrayed upon it The maiden kindled a fire and took water in a silver bowl and gave Owain water to wash Then she placed before him a silver table inlaid with gold upon which was a cloth of yellow linen and she brought him food And of a truth Owain never saw any kind of meat that was not there in abundance but it was better cooked there than he had ever found it in any other place And there was not one vessel from which he was served that was not of gold or of silver And Owain eat and drank until late in the afternoon when lo they heard a mighty clamor in the castle and Owain asked the maiden what it was They are administering extreme unction said she to the nobleman who owns the castle And she prepared a couch for Owain which was meet for Arthur himself and Owain went to sleep And a little after daybreak he heard an exceeding loud clamor and wailing and he asked the maiden what was the cause of it They are bearing to the church the body of the nobleman who owned the castle And Owain rose up and clothed himself and opened a window of the chamber and looked towards the castle and he could see neither the bounds nor the extent of the hosts that filled the streets And they were fully armed and a vast number of women were with them both on horseback and on foot and all the ecclesiastics in the city singing In the midst of the throng he beheld the bier over which was a veil of white linen and wax tapers were burning beside and around it and none that supported the bier was lower in rank than a powerful baron Never did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with silk Footnote Before the sixth century all the silk used by Europeans had been brought to them by the Seres the ancestors of the present Boukharians whence it derived its Latin name of Serica In five hundred fifty one the silkworm was brought by two monks to Constantinople but the manufacture of silk was confined to the Greek empire till the year eleven thirty when Roger king of Sicily returning from a crusade collected some manufacturers from Athens and Corinth and established them at Palermo whence the trade was gradually disseminated over Italy The varieties of silk stuffs known at this time were velvet satin which was called samite and taffety called cendal or sendall all of which were occasionally stitched with gold and silver and satin And following the train he beheld a lady with yellow hair falling over her shoulders and stained with blood and about her a dress of yellow satin which was torn Upon her feet were shoes of variegated leather And it was a marvel that the ends of her fingers were not bruised from the violence with which she smote her hands together Truly she would have been the fairest lady Owain ever saw had she been in her usual guise And her cry was louder than the shout of the men or the clamor of the trumpets No sooner had he beheld the lady than he became inflamed with her love so that it took entire possession of him Then he inquired of the maiden who the lady was Heaven knows replied the maiden she is the fairest and the most chaste and the most liberal and the most noble of women She is my mistress and she is called the Countess of the Fountain the wife of him whom thou didst slay yesterday Verily said Owain she is the woman that I love best Verily said the maiden she shall also love thee not a little Then the maiden prepared a repast for Owain and truly he thought he had never before so good a meal nor was he ever so well served Then she left him and went towards the castle When she came there she found nothing but mourning and sorrow and the Countess in her chamber could not bear the sight of any one through grief Luned for that was the name of the maiden saluted her but the Countess answered her not And the maiden bent down towards her and said What aileth thee that thou answereth no one to day Luned said the Countess what change hath befallen thee that thou hast not come to visit me in my grief It was wrong in thee and I so sorely afflicted Truly said Luned I thought thy good sense was greater than I find it to be Is it well for thee to mourn after that good man or for anything else that thou canst not have I declare to Heaven said the Countess that in the whole world there is not a man equal to him Not so said Luned for an ugly man would be as good as or better than he I declare to Heaven said the Countess that were it not repugnant to me to put to death one whom I have brought up I would have thee executed for making such a comparison to me As it is I will banish thee I am glad said Luned that thou hast no other cause to do so than that I would have been of service to thee where thou didst not know what was to thine advantage Henceforth evil betide whichever of us shall make the first advance towards reconciliation to the other whether I should seek an invitation from thee or thou of thine own accord should send to invite With that Luned went forth and the Countess arose and followed her to the door of the chamber and began coughing loudly And when Luned looked back the Countess beckoned to her and she returned to the Countess In truth said the Countess evil is thy disposition but if thou knowest what is to my advantage declare it to me I will do so said she Thou knowest that except by warfare and arms it is impossible for thee to preserve thy possessions delay not therefore to seek some one who can defend them And how can I do that said the Countess I will tell thee said Luned unless thou canst defend the fountain thou canst not maintain thy dominions and no one can defend the fountain except it be a knight of Arthur s household I will go to Arthur s court and ill betide me if I return not thence with a warrior who can guard the fountain as well as or even better than he who defended it formerly That will be hard to perform said the Countess Go however and make proof of that which thou hast promised Luned set out under the pretence of going to Arthur s court but she went back to the mansion where she had left Owain and she tarried there as long as it might have taken her to travel to the court of King Arthur and back And at the end of that time she apparelled herself and went to visit the Countess And the Countess was much rejoiced when she saw her and inquired what news she brought from the court I bring thee the best of news said Luned for I have compassed the object of my mission When wilt thou that I should present to thee the chieftain who has come with me hither Bring him here to visit me to morrow said the Countess and I will cause the town to be assembled by that time And Luned returned home And the next day at noon Owain arrayed himself in a coat and a surcoat and a mantle of yellow satin upon which was a broad band of gold lace and on his feet were high shoes of variegated leather which were fastened by golden clasps in the form of lions And they proceeded to the chamber of the Countess Right glad was the Countess of their coming And she gazed steadfastly upon Owain and said Luned this knight has not the look of a traveller What harm is there in that lady said Luned I am certain said the Countess that no other man than this chased the soul from the body of my lord So much the better for thee lady said Luned for had he not been stronger than thy lord he could not have deprived him of life There is no remedy for that which is past be it as it may Go back to thine abode said the Countess and I will take counsel The next day the Countess caused all her subjects to assemble and showed them that her earldom was left defenceless and that it could not be protected but with horse and arms and military skill Therefore said she this is what I offer for your choice either let one of you take me or give your consent for me to take a husband from elsewhere to defend my dominions So they came to the determination that it was better that she should have permission to marry some one from elsewhere and thereupon she sent for the bishops and archbishops to celebrate her nuptials with Owain And the men of the earldom did Owain homage And Owain defended the fountain with lance and sword And this is the manner in which he defended it Whensoever a knight came there he overthrew him and sold him for his full worth And what he thus gained he divided among his barons and his knights and no man in the whole world could be more beloved than he was by his subjects And it was thus for the space of three years Footnote There exists an ancient poem printed among those of Taliesin called the Elegy of Owain ap Urien and containing several very beautiful and spirited passages It commences The soul of Owain ap Urien May its Lord consider its exigencies Reged s chief the green turf covers In the course of this Elegy the bard alluding to the incessant warfare with which this chieftain harassed his Saxon foes exclaims Could England sleep with the light upon her eyes CHAPTER IV THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN Continued GAWAIN S ADVENTURE It befell that as Gawain went forth one day with King Arthur he perceived him to be very sad and sorrowful And Gawain was much grieved to see Arthur in his state and he questioned him saying O my lord what has befallen thee In sooth Gawain said Arthur I am grieved concerning Owain whom I have lost these three years and I shall certainly die if the fourth year pass without my seeing him Now I am sure that it is through the tale which Kynon the son of Clydno related that I have lost Owain There is no need for thee said Gawain to summon to arms thy whole dominions on this account for thou thyself and the men of thy household will be able to avenge Owain if he be slain or to set him free if he be in prison and if alive to bring him back with thee And it was settled according to what Gawain had said Then Arthur and the men of his household prepared to go and seek Owain And Kynon the son of Clydno acted as their guide And Arthur came to the castle where Kynon had been before And when he came there the youths were shooting in the same place and the yellow man was standing hard by When the yellow man saw Arthur he greeted him and invited him to the castle And Arthur accepted his invitation and they entered the castle together And great as was the number of his retinue their presence was scarcely observed in the castle so vast was its extent And the maidens rose up to wait on them And the service of the maidens appeared to them all to excel any attendance they had ever met with and even the pages who had charge of the horses were no worse served that night than Arthur himself would have been in his own palace The next morning Arthur set out thence with Kynon for his guide and came to the place where the black man was And the stature of the black man was more surprising to Arthur than it had been represented to him And they came to the top of the wooded steep and traversed the valley till they reached the green tree where they saw the fountain and the bowl and the slab And upon that Kay came to Arthur and spoke to him My lord said he I know the meaning of all this and my request is that thou wilt permit me to throw the water on the slab and to receive the first adventure that may befall And Arthur gave him leave Then Kay threw a bowlful of water upon the slab and immediately there came the thunder and after the thunder the shower And such a thunder storm they had never known before After the shower had ceased the sky became clear and on looking at the tree they beheld it completely leafless Then the birds descended upon the tree And the song of the birds was far sweeter than any strain they had ever heard before Then they beheld a knight on a coal black horse clothed in black satin coming rapidly towards them And Kay met him and encountered him and it was not long before Kay was overthrown And the knight withdrew And Arthur and his host encamped for the night And when they arose in the morning they perceived the signal of combat upon the lance of the knight Then one by one all the household of Arthur went forth to combat the knight until there was not one that was not overthrown by him except Arthur and Gawain And Arthur armed himself to encounter the knight O my lord said Gawain permit me to fight with him first And Arthur permitted him And he went forth to meet the knight having over himself and his horse a satin robe of honor which had been sent him by the daughter of the Earl of Rhangyr and in this dress he was not known by any of the host And they charged each other and fought all that day until the evening And neither of them was able to unhorse the other And so it was the next day they broke their lances in the shock but neither of them could obtain the mastery And the third day they fought with exceeding strong lances And they were incensed with rage and fought furiously even until noon And they gave each other such a shock that the girths of their horses were broken so that they fell over their horses cruppers to the ground And they rose up speedily and drew their swords and resumed the combat And all they that witnessed their encounter felt assured that they had never before seen two men so valiant or so powerful And had it been midnight it would have been light from the fire that flashed from their weapons And the knight gave Gawain a blow that turned his helmet from off his face so that the knight saw that it was Gawain Then Owain said My lord Gawain I did not know thee for my cousin owing to the robe of honor that enveloped thee take my sword and my arms Said Gawain Thou Owain art the victor take thou my sword And with that Arthur saw that they were conversing and advanced toward them My lord Arthur said Gawain here is Owain who has vanquished me and will not take my arms My lord said Owain it is he that has vanquished me and he will not take my sword Give me your swords said Arthur and then neither of you has vanquished the other Then Owain put his arms around Arthur s neck and they embraced And all the host hurried forward to see Owain and to embrace him And there was nigh being a loss of life so great was the press And they retired that night and the next day Arthur prepared to depart My lord said Owain this is not well of thee For I have been absent from thee these three years and during all that time up to this very day I have been preparing a banquet for thee knowing that thou wouldst come to seek me Tarry with me therefore until thou and thy attendants have recovered the fatigues of the journey and have been anointed And they all proceeded to the castle of the Countess of the Fountain and the banquet which had been three years preparing was consumed in three months Never had they a more delicious or agreeable banquet And Arthur prepared to depart Then he sent an embassy to the Countess to beseech her to permit Owain to go with him for the space of three months that he might show him to the nobles and the fair dames of the island of Britain And the Countess gave her consent although it was very painful to her So Owain came with Arthur to the island of Britain And when he was once more amongst his kindred and friends he remained three years instead of three months with them THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION And as Owain one day sat at meat in the city of Caerleon upon Usk behold a damsel entered the hall upon a bay horse with a curling mane and covered with foam and the bridle and as much as was seen of the saddle were of gold And the damsel was arrayed in a dress of yellow satin And she came up to Owain and took the ring from off his hand Thus said she shall be treated the deceiver the traitor the faithless the disgraced and the beardless And she turned her horse s head and departed Footnote The custom of riding into a hall while the lord and his guests sat at meat might be illustrated by numerous passages of ancient romance and history But a quotation from Chaucer s beautiful and half told tale of Cambuscan is sufficient And so befell that after the thridde cours While that this king sat thus in his nobley Herking his minstralles thir thinges play Beforne him at his bord deliciously In at the halle door all sodenly Ther came a knight upon a stede of bras And in his hond a brod mirrour of glas Upon his thombe he had of gold a ring And by his side a naked sword hanging And up he rideth to the highe bord In all the halle ne was ther spoke a word For meryaille of this knight him to behold Full besily they waiten young and old Then his adventure came to Owain s remembrance and he was sorrowful And having finished eating he went to his own abode and made preparations that night And the next day he arose but did not go to the court nor did he return to the Countess of the Fountain but wandered to the distant parts of the earth and to uncultivated mountains And he remained there until all his apparel was worn out and his body was wasted away and his hair was grown long And he went about with the wild beasts and fed with them until they became familiar with him But at length he became so weak that he could no longer bear them company Then he descended from the mountains to the valley and came to a park that was the fairest in the world and belonged to a charitable lady One day the lady and her attendants went forth to walk by a lake that was in the middle of the park And they saw the form of a man lying as if dead And they were terrified Nevertheless they went near him and touched him and they saw that there was life in him And the lady returned to the castle and took a flask full of precious ointment and gave it to one of her maidens Go with this said she and take with thee yonder horse and clothing and place them near the man we saw just now and anoint him with this balsam near his heart and if there is life in him he will revive through the efficiency of this balsam Then watch what he will do And the maiden departed from her and went and poured of the balsam upon Owain and left the horse and the garments hard by and went a little way off and hid herself to watch him In a short time she saw him begin to move and he rose up and looked at his person and became ashamed of the unseemliness of his appearance Then he perceived the horse and the garments that were near him And he clothed himself and with difficulty mounted the horse Then the damsel discovered herself to him and saluted him And he and the maiden proceeded to the castle and the maiden conducted him to a pleasant chamber and kindled a fire and left him And he stayed at the castle three months till he was restored to his former guise and became even more comely than he had ever been before And Owain rendered signal service to the lady in a controversy with a powerful neighbor so that he made ample requital to her for her hospitality and he took his departure And as he journeyed he heard a loud yelling in a wood And it was repeated a second and a third time And Owain went towards the spot and beheld a huge craggy mound in the middle of the wood on the side of which was a gray rock And there was a cleft in the rock and a serpent was within the cleft And near the rock stood a black lion and every time the lion sought to go thence the serpent darted towards him to attack him And Owain unsheathed his sword and drew near to the rock and as the serpent sprung out he struck him with his sword and cut him in two And he dried his sword and went on his way as before But behold the lion followed him and played about him as though it had been a greyhound that he had reared They proceeded thus throughout the day until the evening And when it was time for Owain to take his rest he dismounted and turned his horse loose in a flat and wooded meadow And he struck fire and when the fire was kindled the lion brought him fuel enough to last for three nights And the lion disappeared And presently the lion returned bearing a fine large roebuck And he threw it down before Owain who went towards the fire with it And Owain took the roebuck and skinned it and placed collops of its flesh upon skewers round the fire The rest of the buck he gave to the lion to devour While he was so employed he heard a deep groan near him and a second and a third And the place whence the groans proceeded was a cave in the rock and Owain went near and called out to know who it was that groaned so piteously And a voice answered I am Luned the hand maiden of the Countess of the Fountain And what dost thou here said he I am imprisoned said she on account of the knight who came from Arthur s court and married the Countess And he staid a short time with her but he afterwards departed for the court of Arthur and has not returned since And two of the Countess s pages traduced him and called him a deceiver And because I said I would vouch for it he would come before long and maintain his cause against both of them they imprisoned me in this cave and said that I should be put to death unless he came to deliver me by a certain day and that is no further off than to morrow and I have no one to send to seek him for me His name is Owain the son of Urien And art thou certain that if that knight knew all this he would come to thy rescue I am most certain of it said she When the collops were cooked Owain divided them into two parts between himself and the maiden and then Owain laid himself down to sleep and never did sentinel keep stricter watch over his lord than the lion that night over Owain And the next day there came the two pages with a great troop of attendants to take Luned from her cell and put her to death And Owain asked them what charge they had against her And they told him of the compact that was between them as the maiden had done the night before And said they Owain has failed her therefore we are taking her to be burnt Truly said Owain he is a good knight and if he knew that the maiden was in such peril I marvel that he came not to her rescue But if you will accept me in his stead I will do battle with you We will said the youth And they attacked Owain and he was hard beset by them And with that the lion came to Owain s assistance and they two got the better of the young men And they said to him Chieftain it was not agreed that we should fight save with thyself alone and it is harder for us to contend with yonder animal than with thee And Owain put the lion in the place where Luned had been imprisoned and blocked up the door with stones And he went to fight with the young men as before But Owain had not his usual strength and the two youths pressed hard upon him And the lion roared incessantly at seeing Owain in trouble And he brust through the wall until he found a way out and rushed upon the young men and instantly slew them So Luned was saved from being burned Then Owain returned with Luned to the castle of the Lady of the Fountain And when he went thence he took the Countess with him to Arthur s court and she was his wife as long as she lived CHAPTER V GERAINT THE SON OF ERBIN Arthur was accustomed to hold his court at Caerleon upon Usk And there he held it seven Easters and five Christmases And once upon a time he held his court there at Whitsuntide For Caerleon was the place most easy of access in his dominions both by sea and by land And there were assembled nine crowned kings who were his tributaries and likewise earls and barons For they were his invited guests at all the high festivals unless they were prevented by any great hinderatice And when he was at Caerleon holding his court thirteen churches were set apart for mass And thus they were appointed one church for Arthur and his kings and his guests and the second for Guenever and her ladies and the third for the steward of the household and the suitors and the fourth for the Franks and the other officers and the other nine churches were for the nine masters of the household and chiefly for Gawain for he from the eminence of his warlike fame and from the nobleness of his birth was the most exalted of the nine And there was no other arrangement respecting the churches than that which we have here mentioned And on Whit Tuesday as the king sat at the banquet lo there entered a tall fair headed youth clad in a coat and surcoat of satin and a golden hilted sword about his neck and low shoes of leather upon his feet And he came and stood before Arthur Hail to thee lord said he Heaven prosper thee he answered and be thou welcome Dost thou bring any new tidings I do lord he said I am one of thy foresters lord in the forest of Dean and my name is Madoc son of Turgadarn In the forest I saw a stag the like of which beheld I never yet What is there about him asked Arthur that thou never yet didst see his like He is of pure white lord and he does not herd with any other animal through stateliness and pride so royal is his bearing And I come to seek thy counsel lord and to know thy will concerning him It seems best to me said Arthur to go and hunt him to morrow at break of day and to cause general notice thereof to be given to night in all quarters of the court For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk There on a day he sitting high in hall Before him came a forester of Dean Wet from the woods with notice of a hart Taller than all his fellows milky white First seen that day these things he told the king Then the good king gave order to let blow His horns for hunting on the morrow morn Enid And Arryfuerys was Arthur s chief huntsman and Arelivri his chief page And all received notice and thus it was arranged Then Guenever said to Arthur Wilt thou permit me lord to go to morrow to see and hear the hunt of the stag of which the young man spoke I will gladly said Arthur And Gawain said to Arthur Lord if it seem well to thee permit that into whose hunt soever the stag shall come that one be he a knight or one on foot may cut off his head and give it to whom he pleases whether to his own lady love or to the lady of his friend I grant it gladly said Arthur and let the steward of the household be chastised if all things are not ready to morrow for the chase And they passed the night with songs and diversions and discourse and ample entertainment And when it was time for them all to go to sleep they went And when the next day came they arose And Arthur called the attendants who guarded his couch And there were four pages whose names were Cadyrnerth the son of Gandwy and Ambreu the son of Bedwor and Amhar the son of Arthur and Goreu the son of Custennin And these men came to Arthur and saluted him and arrayed him in his garments And Arthur wondered that Guenever did not awake and the attendants wished to awaken her Disturb her not said Arthur for she had rather sleep than go to see the hunting Then Arthur went forth and he heard two horns sounding one from near the lodging of the chief huntsman and the other from near that of the chief page And the whole assembly of the multitudes came to Arthur and they took the road to the forest And after Arthur had gone forth from the palace Guenever awoke and called to her maidens and apparalled herself Maidens said she I had leave last night to go and see the hunt Go one of you to the stable and order hither a horse such as a woman may ride And one of them went and she found but two horses in the stable and Guenever and one of her maidens mounted them and went through the Usk and followed the track of the men and the horses And as they rode thus they heard a loud and rushing sound and they looked behind them and beheld a knight upon a hunter foal of mighty size And the rider was a fairhaired youth bare legged and of princely mien and a golden hilted sword was at his side and a robe and a surcoat of satin were upon him and two low shoes of leather upon his feet and around him was a scarf of blue purple at each corner of which was a golden apple For Prince Geraint Late also wearing neither hunting dress Nor weapon save a golden hilted brand Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford Enid And his horse stepped stately and swift and proud and he overtook Guenever and saluted her Heaven prosper thee Geraint said she and why didst thou not go with thy lord to hunt Because I knew not when he went said he I marvel too said she how he could go unknown to me But thou O young man art the most agreeable companion I could have in the whole kingdom and it may be I shall be more amused with the hunting than they for we shall hear the horns when they sound and we shall hear the dogs when they are let loose and begin to cry So they went to the edge of the forest and there they stood From this place said she we shall hear when the dogs are let loose And thereupon they heard a loud noise and they looked towards the spot whence it came and they beheld a dwarf riding upon a horse stately and foaming and prancing and strong and spirited And in the hand of the dwarf was a whip And near the dwarf they saw a lady upon a beautiful white horse of steady and stately pace and she was clothed in a garment of gold brocade And near her was a knight upon a war horse of large size with heavy and bright armor both upon himself and upon his horse And truly they never before saw a knight or a horse or armor of such remarkable size Geraint said Guenever knowest thou the name of that tall knight yonder I know him not said he and the strange armor that he wears prevents my either seeing his face or his features Go maiden said Guenever and ask the dwarf who that knight is Then the maiden went up to the dwarf and she inquired of the dwarf who the knight was I will not tell thee he answered Since thou art so churlish said she I will ask him himself Thou shalt not ask him by my faith said he Wherefore not said she Because thou art not of honor sufficient to befit thee to speak to my lord Then the maiden turned her horse s head towards the knight upon which the dwarf struck her with the whip that was in his hand across the face and the eyes so that the blood flowed forth And the maiden returned to Guenever complaining of the hurt she had received Very rudely has the dwarf treated thee said Geraint and he put his hand upon the hilt of his sword But he took counsel with himself and considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf and to be attacked unarmed by the armed knight so he refrained Lady said he I will follow him with thy permission and at last he will come to some inhabited place where I may have arms either as a loan or for a pledge so that I may encounter the knight Go said she and do not attack him until thou hast good arms and I shall be very anxious concerning thee until I hear tidings of thee If I am alive said he thou shalt hear tidings of me by to morrow afternoon and with that he departed And the road they took was below the palace of Caerleon and across the ford of the Usk and they went along a fair and even and lofty ridge of ground until they came to a town and at the extremity of the town they saw a fortress and a castle And as the knight passed through the town all the people arose and saluted him and bade him welcome And when Geraint came into the town he looked at every house to see if he knew any of those whom he saw But he knew none and none knew him to do him the kindness to let him have arms either as a loan or for a pledge And every house he saw was full of men and arms and horses And they were polishing shields and burnishing swords and washing armor and shoeing horses And the knight and the lady and the dwarf rode up to the castle that was in the town and every one was glad in the castle And from the battlements and the gates they risked their necks through their eagerness to greet them and to show their joy Geraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the castle and when he was certain that he would do so he looked around him And at a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in ruins wherein was a hall that was falling to decay And high above a piece of turret stair Worn by the feet that now were silent wound Bare to the sun Enid And as he knew not any one in the town he went towards the old palace And when he came near to the palace he saw a hoary headed man standing by it in tattered garments And Geraint gazed steadfastly upon him Then the hoary headed man said to him Young man wherefore art thou thoughtful I am thoughtful said he because I know not where to pass the night Wilt thou come forward this way chieftain said he and thou shalt have of the best that can be procured for thee So Geraint went forward And the hoary headed man led the way into the hall And in the hall he dismounted and he left there his horse Then he went on to the upper chamber with the hoary headed man And in the chamber he beheld an old woman sitting on a cushion with old worn out garments upon her yet it seemed to him that she must have been comely when in the bloom of youth And beside her was a maiden upon whom were a vest and a veil that were old and beginning to be worn out And truly he never saw a maiden more full of comeliness and grace and beauty than she And the hoary headed man said to the maiden There is no attendant for the horse of this youth but thyself I will render the best service I am able said she both to him and to his horse And the maiden disarrayed the youth and then she furnished his horse with straw and corn and then she returned to the chamber And the hoary headed man said to the maiden Go to the town and bring hither the best that thou canst find both of food and of liquor I will gladly lord said she And to the town went the maiden And they conversed together while the maiden was at the town And behold the maiden came back and a youth with her bearing on his back a costrel full of good purchased mead and a quarter of a young bullock And in the hands of the maiden was a quantity of white bread and she had some manchet bread in her veil and she came into the chamber I would not obtain better than this said she nor with better should I have been trusted It is good enough said Geraint And they caused the meat to be boiled and when their food was ready they sat down And it was in this wise Geraint sat between the hoary headed man and his wife and the maiden served them And they ate and drank And when they had finished eating Geraint talked with the hoary headed man and he asked him in the first place to whom belonged the palace that he was in Truly said he it was I that built it and to me also belonged the city and the castle which thou sawest Alas said Geraint how is it that thou hast lost them now I lost a great earldom as well as these said he and this is how I lost them I had a nephew the son of my brother and I took care of his possessions but he was impatient to enter upon them so he made war upon me and wrested from me not only his own but also my estates except this castle Good sir said Geraint wilt thou tell me wherefore came the knight and the lady and the dwarf just now into the town and what is the preparation which I saw and the putting of arms in order I will do so said he The preparations are for the game that is to be held to morrow by the young earl which will be on this wise In the midst of a meadow which is here two forks will be set up and upon the two forks a silver rod and upon the silver rod a sparrow hawk and for the sparrow hawk there will be a tournament And to the tournament will go all the array thou didst see in the city of men and of horses and of arms And with each man will go the lady he loves best and no man can joust for the sparrow hawk except the lady he loves best be with him And the knight that thou sawest has gained the sparrow hawk these two years and if he gains it the third year he will be called the Knight of the Sparrow hawk from that time forth Sir said Geraint what is thy counsel to me concerning this knight on account of the insult which the maiden of Guenever received from the dwarf And Geraint told the hoary headed man what the insult was that the maiden had received It is not easy to counsel thee inasmuch as thou hast neither dame nor maiden belonging to thee for whom thou canst joust Yet I have arms here which thou couldst have and there is my horse also if he seem to thee better than thine own Ah sir said he Heaven reward thee But my own horse to which I am accustomed together with thine arms will suffice me And if when the appointed time shall come to morrow thou wilt permit me sir to challenge for yonder maiden that is thy daughter I will engage if I escape from the tournament to love the maiden as long as I live Gladly will I permit thee said the hoary headed man and since thou dost thus resolve it is necessary that thy horse and arms should be ready to morrow at break of day For then the Knight of the Sparrow hawk will make proclamation and ask the lady he loves best to take the sparrow hawk and if any deny it to her by force will he defend her claim And therefore said the hoary headed man it is needful for thee to be there at daybreak and we three will be with thee And thus was it settled And at night they went to sleep And before the dawn they arose and arrayed themselves and by the time that it was day they were all four in the meadow And there was the Knight of the Sparrow hawk making the proclamation and asking his lady love to take the sparrow hawk Take it not said Geraint for here is a maiden who is fairer and more noble and more comely and who has a better claim to it than thou Then said the knight If thou maintainest the sparrow hawk to be due to her come forward and do battle with me And Geraint went forward to the top of the meadow having upon himself and upon his horse armor which was heavy and rusty and of uncouth shape Then they encountered each other and they broke a set of lances and they broke a second set and a third And when the earl and his company saw the Knight of the Sparrow hawk gaining the mastery there was shouting and joy and mirth amongst them and the hoary headed man and his wife and his daughter were sorrowful And the hoary headed man served Geraint with lances as often as he broke them and the dwarf served the Knight of the Sparrow hawk Then the hoary headed man said to Geraint O chieftain since no other will hold with thee behold here is the lance which was in my hand on the day when I received the honor of knighthood and from that time to this I never broke it and it has an excellent point Then Geraint took the lance thanking the hoary headed man And thereupon the dwarf also brought a lance to his lord Behold here is a lance for thee not less good than his said the dwarf And bethink thee that no knight ever withstood thee so long as this one has done I declare to Heaven said Geraint that unless death takes me quickly hence he shall fare never the better for thy service And Geraint pricked his horse towards him from afar and warning him he rushed upon him and gave him a blow so severe and furious and fierce upon the face of his shield that he cleft it in two and broke his armor and burst his girths so that both he and his saddle were borne to the ground over the horse s crupper And Geraint dismounted quickly And he was wroth and he drew his sword and rushed fiercely upon him Then the knight also arose and drew his sword against Geraint And they fought on foot with their swords until their arms struck sparks of fire like stars from one another and thus they continued fighting until the blood and sweat obscured the light from their eyes At length Geraint called to him all his strength and struck the knight upon the crown of his head so that he broke all his head armor and cut through all the flesh and the skin even to the skull until he wounded the bone Then the knight fell upon his knees and cast his sword from his hand and besought mercy from Geraint Of a truth said he I relinquish my overdaring and my pride and crave thy mercy and unless I have time to commit myself to Heaven for my sins and to talk with a priest thy mercy will avail me little I will grant thee grace upon this condition said Geraint that thou go to Guenever the wife of Arthur to do her satisfaction for the insult which her maiden received from thy dwarf Dismount not from the time thou goest hence until thou comest into the presence of Guenever to make her what atonement shall be adjudged at the court of Arthur This will I do gladly and who art thou I am Geraint the son of Erbin and declare thou also who thou art I am Edeym the son of Nudd Then he threw himself upon his horse and went forward to Arthur s court and the lady he loved best went before him and the dwarf with much lamentation Then came the young earl and his hosts to Geraint and saluted him and bade him to his castle I may not go said Geraint but where I was last night there will I be to night also Since thou wilt none of my inviting thou shalt have abundance of all that I can command for thee and I will order ointment for thee to recover thee from thy fatigues and from the weariness that is upon thee Heaven reward thee said Geraint and I will go to my lodging And thus went Geraint and Earl Ynywl and his wife and his daughter And when they reached the old mansion the household servants and attendants of the young earl had arrived and had arranged all the apartments dressing them with straw and with fire and in a short time the ointment was ready and Geraint came there and they washed his head Then came the young earl with forty honorable knights from among his attendants and those who were bidden to the tournament And Geraint came from the anointing And the earl asked him to go to the hall to eat Where is the Earl Ynywl said Geraint and his wife and his daughter They are in the chamber yonder said the earl s chamberlain arraying themselves in garments which the earl has caused to be brought for them Let not the damsel array herself said he except in her vest and her veil until she come to the court of Arthur to be clad by Guenever in such garments as she may choose So the maiden did not array herself Then they all entered the hall and they washed and sat down to meat And thus were they seated On one side of Geraint sat the young earl and Earl Ynywl beyond him and on the other side of Geraint was the maiden and her mother And after these all sat according to their precedence in honor And they ate And they were served abundantly and they received a profusion of divers kinds of gifts Then they conversed together And the young earl invited Geraint to visit him next day I will not by Heaven said Geraint To the court of Arthur will I go with this maiden to morrow And it is enough for me as long as Earl Ynywl is in poverty and trouble and I go chiefly to seek to add to his maintenance Ah chieftain said the young earl it is not by my fault that Earl Ynywl is without his possessions By my faith said Geraint he shall not remain without them unless death quickly takes me hence O chieftain said he with regard to the disagreement between me and Ynywl I will gladly abide by thy counsel and agree to what thou mayest judge right between us I but ask thee said Geraint to restore to him what is his and what he should have received from the time he lost his possessions even until this day That will I do gladly for thee answered he Then said Geraint whosoever is here who owes homage to Ynywl let him come forward and perform it on the spot And all the men did so and by that treaty they abided And his castle and his town and all his possessions were restored to Ynywl And he received back all that he had lost even to the smallest jewel Then spoke Earl Ynywl to Geraint Chieftain said he behold the maiden for whom thou didst challenge at the tournament I bestow her upon thee She shall go with me said Geraint to the court of Arthur and Arthur and Guenever they shall dispose of her as they will And the next day they proceeded to Arthur s court So far concerning Geraint CHAPTER VI GERAINT THE SON OF ERBIN Continued Now this is how Arthur hunted the stag The men and the dogs were divided into hunting parties and the dogs were let loose upon the stag And the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of Arthur Cavall was his name And he left all the other dogs behind him and turned the stag And at the second turn the stag came toward the hunting party of Arthur And Arthur set upon him and before he could be slain by any other Arthur cut off his head Then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered round They came Kadyriath to Arthur and spoke to him Lord said he behold yonder is Guenever and none with her save only one maiden Command Gildas the son of Caw and all the scholars of the court said Arthur to attend Guenever to the palace And they did so Then they all set forth holding converse together concerning the head of the stag to whom it should be given One wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him and another to the lady whom he loved best And so they came to the palace And when Arthur and Guenever heard them disputing about the head of the stag Guenever said to Arthur My lord this is my counsel concerning the stag s head let it not be given away until Geraint the son of Erbin shall return from the errand he is upon And Guenever told Arthur what that errand was Right gladly shall it be so said Arthur And Guenever caused a watch to be set upon the ramparts for Geraint s coming And after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse and after him a dame or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armor And before they came near to the gate one of the watch went to Guenever and told her what kind of people they saw and what aspect they bore I know not who they are said he But I know said Guenever this is the knight whom Geraint pursued and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will But Geraint has overtaken him and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost And thereupon behold a porter came to the spot where Guenever was Lady said he at the gate there is a knight and I saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he Miserable and broken is the armor that he wears and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own color Knowest thou his name said she I do said he he tells me that he is Edeyrn the son of Nudd Then she replied I know him not So Guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered And Guenever was sorry when she saw the condition he was in even though he was accompanied by the churlish dwarf Then Edeyrn saluted Guenever Heaven protect thee said she Lady said he Geraint the son of Erbin thy best and most valiant servant greets thee Did he meet with thee she asked Yes said he and it was not to my advantage and that was not his fault but mine lady And Geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf Now where did he overtake thee At the place where we were jousting and contending for the sparrow hawk in the town which is now called Cardiff And it was for the avouchment of the love of the maiden the daughter of Earl Ynywl that Geraint jousted at the tournament And thereupon we encountered each other and he left me lady as thou seest Sir said she when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here To morrow lady I think he will be here with the maiden Then Arthur came to them And he saluted Arthur and Arthur gazed a long time upon him and was amazed to see him thus And thinking that he knew him he inquired of him Art thou Edeyrn the son of Nudd I am lord said he and I have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable Then he told Arthur all his adventure Well said Arthur from what I hear it behooves Guenever to be merciful towards thee The mercy which thou desirest lord said she will I grant to him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself Thus will it be best to do said Arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live And if he live he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of the court And if he die too much will be the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an insult to a maiden This pleases me said Guenever And Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him He was the chief physician Take with thee Edeyrn the son of Nudd and cause a chamber to be prepared for him and let him have the aid of medicine as thou wouldst do unto myself if I were wounded and let none into his chamber to molest him but thyself and thy disciples to administer to him remedies I will do so gladly lord said Morgan Tud Then said the steward of the household Whither is it right lord to order the maiden To Guenever and her handmaidens said he And the steward of the household so ordered her And rising up he rode to Arthur s court And there the queen forgave him easily And being young he changed himself and grew To hate the sin that seem d so like his own Of Modred Arthur s nephew and fell at last In the great battle fighting for the king Enid The next day came Geraint towards the court and there was a watch set on the ramparts by Guenever lest he should arrive unawares And one of the watch came to Guenever Lady said he methinks that I see Geraint and a maiden with him He is on horseback but he has his walking gear upon him and the maiden appears to be in white seeming to be clad in a garment of linen Assemble all the women said Guenever and come to meet Geraint to welcome him and wish him joy And Guenever went to meet Geraint and the maiden And when Geraint came to the place where Guenever was he saluted her Heaven prosper thee said she and welcome to thee Lady said he I earnestly desired to obtain thee satisfaction according to thy will and behold here is the maiden through whom thou hadst thy revenge Verily said Guenever the welcome of Heaven be unto her and it is fitting that we should receive her joyfully Then they went in and dismounted And Geraint came to where Arthur was and saluted him Heaven protect thee said Arthur and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee And inasmuch as thou hast vanquished Edeyrn the son of Nudd thou hast had a prosperous career Not upon me be the blame said Geraint it was through the arrogance of Edeyrn the son of Nudd himself that we were not friends Now said Arthur where is the maiden for whom I heard thou didst give challenge She is gone with Guenever to her chamber Then went Arthur to see the maiden And Arthur and all his companions and his whole court were glad concerning the maiden And certain were they all that had her array been suitable to her beauty they had never seen a maid fairer than she And Arthur gave away the maiden to Geraint And the usual bond made between two persons was made between Geraint and the maiden and the choicest of all Guenever s apparel was given to the maiden and thus arrayed she appeared comely and graceful to all who beheld her And that day and the night were spent in abundance of minstrelsy and ample gifts of liquor and a multiude of games And when it was time for them to go to sleep they went And in the chamber where the couch of Arthur and Guenever was the couch of Geraint and Enid was prepared And from that time she became his wife And the next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful gifts And the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of Britain Then spake Guenever Rightly did I judge said she concerning the head of the stag that it should not be given to any until Geraint s return and behold here is a fit occasion for bestowing it Let it be given to Enid the daughter of Ynywl the most illustrious maiden And I do not believe that any will begrudge it her for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love and friendship Much applauded was this by them all and by Arthur also And the head of the stag was given to Enid And thereupon her fame increased and her friends became more in number than before And Geraint from that time forth loved the hunt and the tournament and hard encounters and he came victorious from them all And a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom And once upon a time Arthur was holding his court at Caerleon upon Usk and behold there came to him ambassadors wise and prudent full of knowledge and eloquent of speech and they saluted Arthur Heaven prosper you said Arthur and whence do you come We come lord said they from Cornwall and we are ambassadors from Erbin the son of Custennin thy uncle and our mission is unto thee And he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord And he represents unto thee that he waxes heavy and feeble and is advancing in years And the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions And he earnestly beseeches thee lord to permit Geraint his son to return to him to protect his possessions and to become acquainted with his boundaries And unto him he represents that it were better for him to spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his own boundaries than in tournaments which are productive of no profit although he obtains glory in them Well said Arthur go and divest yourselves of your accoutrements and take food and refresh yourselves after your fatigues and before you go from hence you shall have an answer And they went to eat And Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let Geraint depart from him and from his court neither did he think it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his boundaries seeing that his father was unable to do so No less was the grief and regret of Guenever and all her women and all her damsels through fear that the maiden would leave them And that day and that night were spent in abundance of feasting And Arthur told Geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of Cornwall Truly said Geraint be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord I will do according to thy will concerning this embassy Behold said Arthur though it grieves me to part with thee it is my counsel that thou go to dwell in thine own dominions and to defend thy boundaries and take with thee to accompany thee as many as thou wilt of those thou lovest best among my faithful ones and among thy friends and among thy companions in arms Heaven reward thee and this will I do said Geraint What discourse said Guenever do I hear between you Is it of those who are to conduct Geraint to his country It is said Arthur Then is it needful for me to consider said she concerning companions and a provision for the lady that is with me Thou wilt do well said Arthur And that night they went to sleep And the next day the ambassadors were permitted to depart and they were told that Geraint should follow them And on the third day Geraint set forth and many went with him Gawain the son of Gwyar and Riogoned the son of the king of Ireland and Ondyaw the son of the Duke of Burgundy Gwilim the son of the ruler of the Franks Howel the son of the Earl of Brittany Perceval the son of Evrawk Gwyr a judge in the court of Arthur Bedwyr the son of Bedrawd Kai the son of Kyner Odyar the Frank and Ederyn the son of Nudd Said Geraint I think I shall have enough of knighthood with me And they set forth And never was there seen a fairer host journeying towards the Severn And on the other side of the Severn were the nobles of Erbin the son of Custennin and his foster father at their head to welcome Geraint with gladness and many of the women of the court with his mother came to receive Enid the daughter of Ynywl his wife And there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the whole court and through all the country concerning Geraint because of the greatness of their love to him and of the greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst them and because he was come to take possession of his dominions and to preserve his boundaries And they came to the court And in the court they had ample entertainment and a multitude of gifts and abundance of liquor and a sufficiency of service and a variety of games And to do honor to Geraint all the chief men of the country were invited that night to visit him And they passed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment And at dawn next day Erbin arose and summoned to him Geraint and the noble persons who had borne him company And he said to Geraint I am a feeble and an aged man and whilst I was able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself I did so But thou art young and in the flower of thy vigor and of thy youth Henceforth do thou preserve thy possessions Truly said Geraint with my consent thou shalt not give the power over thy dominions at this time into my hands and thou shalt not take me from Arthur s court Into thy hands will I give them said Erbin and this day also shalt thou receive the homage of thy subjects Then said Gawain It were better for thee to satisfy those who have boons to ask to day and to morrow thou canst receive the homage of thy dominions So all that had boons to ask were summoned into one place And Kadyriath came to them to know what were their requests And every one asked that which he desired And the followers of Arthur began to make gifts and immediately the men of Cornwall came and gave also And they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied And that day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment And the next day at dawn Erbin desired Geraint to send messengers to the men to ask them whether it was displeasing to them that he should come to receive their homage and whether they had anything to object to him Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall to ask them this And they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage So he received the homage of such as were there And the day after the followers of Arthur intended to go away It is too soon for you to go away yet said he stay with me until I have finished receiving the homage of my chief men who have agreed to come to me And they remained with him until he had done so Then they set forth towards the court of Arthur And Geraint went to bear them company and Enid also as far as Diganwy there they parted And Ondyaw the son of the Duke of Burgundy said to Geraint Go now and visit the uttermost parts of thy dominions and see well to the boundaries of thy territories and if thou hast any trouble respecting them send unto thy companions Heaven reward thee said Geraint and this will I do And Geraint journeyed to the uttermost parts of his dominions And experienced guides and the chief men of his country went with him And the furthermost point that they showed him he kept possession of CHAPTER VII GERAINT THE SON OF ERBIN Continued Geraint as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur s court frequented tournaments And he became acquainted with valiant and mighty men until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly done elsewhere And he enriched his court and his companions and his nobles with the best horses and the best arms and with the best and most valuable jewels and he ceased not until his fame had flown over the face of the whole kingdom Before Geraint the scourge of the enemy I saw steeds white with foam And after the shout of battle a fearful torrent Hen When he knew that it was thus he began to love ease and pleasure for there was no one who was worth his opposing And he loved his wife and liked to continue in the palace with minstrelsy and diversions So he began to shut himself up in the chamber of his wife and he took no delight in anything besides insomuch that he gave up the friendship of his nobles together with his hunting and his amusements and lost the hearts of all the host in his court And there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants of the palace on account of his relinquishing so completely their companionship for the love of his wife They Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him As of a prince whose manhood was all gone And molten down in mere uxoriousness These tidings came to Erbin And when Erbin had heard these things he spoke unto Enid and inquired of her whether it was she that had caused Geraint to act thus and to forsake his people and his hosts Not I by my confession unto Heaven said she there is nothing more hateful unto me than this And she knew not what she should do for although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint yet was it not more easy for her to listen to what she heard without warning Geraint concerning it And she was very sorrowful One morning in the summer time they were upon their couch and Geraint lay upon the edge of it And Enid was without sleep in the apartment which had windows of glass Footnote The terms of admiration in which the older writers invariably speak of GLASS WINDOWS would be sufficient proof if other evidence were wanting how rare an article of luxury they were in the houses of our ancestors They were first introduced in ecclesiastical architecture to which they were for a long time confined Glass is said not to have been employed in domestic architecture before the fourteenth century and the sun shone upon the couch And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast and he was asleep Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his appearance and she said Alas and am I the cause that these arms and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike fame which they once so richly enjoyed As she said this the tears dropped from her eyes and they fell upon his breast And the tears she shed and the words she had spoken awoke him And another thing contributed to awaken him and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him that she spoke thus but that it was because she loved some other man more than him and that she wished for other society Thereupon Geraint was troubled in his mind and he called his squire and when he came to him Go quickly said he and prepare my horse and my arms and make them ready And do thou rise said he to Enid and apparel thyself and cause thy horse to be accoutred and clothe thee in the worst riding dress that thou hast in thy possession And evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say And if it be so it will then be easy for thee to seek the society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast thinking So she arose and clothed herself in her meanest garments I know nothing lord said she of thy meaning Neither wilt thou know at this time said he Then Geraint went to see Erbin Sir said he I am going upon a quest and I am not certain when I may come back Take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return I will do so said he but it is strange to me that thou shouldst go so suddenly And who will proceed with thee since thou art not strong enough to traverse the land of Loegyr alone But one person only will go with me Heaven counsel thee my son said Erbin and may many attach themselves to thee in Loegyr Then went Geraint to the place where his horse was and it was equipped with foreign armor heavy and shining And he desired Enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him And whatever thou mayst see and whatever thou mayst hear concerning me said he do thou not turn back And unless I speak unto thee say not thou one word either So they set forward And he did not choose the pleasantest and most frequented road but that which was the wildest and most beset by thieves and robbers and venomous animals And they came to a high road which they followed till they saw a vast forest and they saw four armed horsemen come forth from the forest When the armed men saw them they said one to another Here is a good occasion for us to capture two horses and armor and a lady likewise for this we shall have no difficulty in doing against yonder single knight who hangs his head so pensively and heavily Enid heard this discourse and she knew not what she should do through fear of Geraint who had told her to be silent The vengeance of Heaven be upon me said she if I would not rather receive my death from his hand than from the hand of any other and though he should slay me yet will I speak to him lest I should have the misery to witness his death So she waited for Geraint until he came near to her Lord said she didst thou hear the words of those men concerning thee Then he lifted up his eyes and looked at her angrily Thou hadst only said he to hold thy peace as I bade thee I wish but for silence and not for warning And though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men yet do I feel no dread Then the foremost of them couched his lance and rushed upon Geraint And he received him and that not feebly But he let the thrust go by him while he struck the horseman upon the centre of his shield in such a manner that his shield was split and his armor broken so that a cubit s length of the shaft of Geraint s lance passed through his body and sent him to the earth the length of the lance over his horse s crupper Then the second horseman attacked him furiously being wroth at the death of his companion But with one thrust Geraint overthrew him also and killed him as he had done the other Then the third set upon him and he killed him in like manner And thus also he slew the fourth Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this Geraint dismounted his horse and took the arms of the men he had slain and placed them upon their saddles and tied together the reins of their horses and he mounted his horse again Behold what thou must do said he take the four horses and drive them before thee and proceed forward as I bade thee just now And say not one word unto me unless I speak first unto thee And I declare unto Heaven said he if thou doest not thus it will be to thy cost I will do as far as I can lord said she according to thy desire So the maiden went forward keeping in advance of Geraint as he had desired her and it grieved him as much as his wrath would permit to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so much trouble with the care of the horses Then they reached a wood and it was both deep and vast and in the wood night overtook them Ah maiden said he it is vain to attempt proceeding forward Well lord said she whatever thou wishest we will do It will be best for us he answered to rest and wait for the day in order to pursue our journey That we will gladly said she And they did so Having dismounted himself he took her down from her horse I cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watch the horses and sleep not I will lord said she Then he went to sleep in his armor and thus passed the night which was not long at that season And when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke Then he arose and said unto her Take the horses and ride on and keep straight on as thou didst yesterday And they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mowers mowing the meadows And there was a river before them and the horses bent down and drank of the water And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep and there they met a slender stripling with a satchel about his neck and they saw that there was something in the satchel but they knew not what it was And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher And the youth saluted Geraint Heaven prosper thee said Geraint and whence dost thou come I come said he from the city that lies before thee My lord he added will it be displeasing to thee if I ask whence thou comest also By no means through yonder wood did I come Thou camest not through the wood to day No he replied we were in the wood last night I warrant said the youth that thy condition there last night was not the most pleasant and that thou hadst neither meat nor drink No by my faith said he Wilt thou follow my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me What sort of meal he inquired The breakfast which is sent for yonder mowers nothing less than bread and meat and wine and if thou wilt sir they shall have none of it I will said he and Heaven reward thee for it So Geraint alighted and the youth took the maiden from off her horse Then they washed and took their repast And the youth cut the bread in slices and gave them drink and served them withal And when they had finished the youth arose and said to Geraint My lord with thy permission I will now go and fetch some food for the mowers Go first to the town said Geraint and take a lodging for me in the best place that thou knowest and the most commodious one for the horses and take thou whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment for thy service and thy gift Heaven reward thee lord said the youth and this would be ample to repay services much greater than those I have rendered unto thee And to the town went the youth and he took the best and the most pleasant lodgings that he knew and after that he went to the palace having the horse and armor with him and proceeded to the place where the earl was and told him all his adventure I go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging Go gladly said the earl and right joyfully shall he be received here if he so come And the youth went to meet Geraint and told him that he would be received gladly by the earl in his own palace but he would go only to his lodgings And he had a goodly chamber in which was plenty of straw and drapery and a spacious and commodious place he had for the horses and the youth prepared for them plenty of provender After they had disarrayed themselves Geraint spoke thus to Enid Go said he to the other side of the chamber and come not to this side of the house and thou mayst call to thee the woman of the house if thou wilt I will do lord said she as thou sayest Thereupon the man of the house came to Geraint and welcomed him And after they had eaten and drank Geraint went to sleep and so did Enid also In the evening behold the earl came to visit Geraint and his twelve honorable knights with him And Geraint rose up and welcomed him Then they all sat down according to their precedence in honor And the earl conversed with Geraint and inquired of him the object of his journey I have none he replied but to seek adventures and to follow mine own inclination Then the earl cast his eye upon Enid and he looked at her steadfastly And he thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more comely than she And he set all his thoughts and his affections upon her Then he asked of Geraint Have I thy permission to go and converse with yonder maiden for I see that she is apart from thee Thou hast it gladly said he So the earl went to the place where the maiden was and spake with her Ah maiden said he it cannot be pleasant to thee to journey with yonder man It is not unpleasant to me said she Thou hast neither youths nor maidens to serve thee said he Truly she replied it is more pleasant for me to follow yonder man than to be served by youths and maidens I will give thee good counsel said he all my earldom will I place in thy possession if thou wilt dwell with me Enid the pilot star of my lone life Enid my early and my only love Enid That will I not by Heaven she said yonder man was the first to whom my faith was ever pledged and shall I prove inconstant to him Thou art in the wrong said the earl if I slay the man yonder I can keep thee with me as long as I choose and when thou no longer pleasest me I can turn thee away But if thou goest with me by thy own good will I protest that our union shall continue as long as I remain alive Then she pondered those words of his and she considered that it was advisable to encourage him in his request Behold then chieftain this is most expedient for thee to do to save me from all reproach come here to morrow and take me away as though I knew nothing thereof I will do so said he So he arose and took his leave and went forth with his attendants And she told not then to Geraint any of the conversation which she had had with the earl lest it should rouse his anger and cause him uneasiness and care And at the usual hour they went to sleep And at the beginning of the night Enid slept a little and at midnight she arose and placed all Geraint s armor together so that it might be ready to put on And although fearful of her errand she came to the side of Geraint s bed and she spoke to him softly and gently saying My lord arise and clothe thyself for these were the words of the earl to me and his intention concerning me So she told Geraint all that had passed And although he was wroth with her he took warning and clothed himself And she lighted a candle that he might have light to do so Leave there the candle said he and desire the man of the house to come here Then she went and the man of the house came to him Dost thou know how much I owe thee asked Geraint I think thou owest but little Take the three horses and the three suits of armor Heaven reward thee lord said he but I spent not the value of one suit of armor upon thee For that reason said he thou wilt be the richer And now wilt thou come to guide me out of the town I will gladly said he and in which direction dost thou intend to go I wish to leave the town by a different way from that by which I entered it So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as far as he desired Then he bade the maiden to go on before him and she did so and went straight forward and his host returned home And Geraint and the maiden went forward along the high road And as they journeyed thus they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them Stay thou here said he and I will go and see what is the cause of this wailing I will said she Then he went forward into an open glade that was near the road And in the glade he saw two horses one having a man s saddle and the other a woman s saddle upon it And behold there was a knight lying dead in his armor and a young damsel in a riding dress standing over him lamenting Ah lady said Geraint what hath befallen thee Behold she answered I journeyed here with my beloved husband when lo three giants came upon us and without any cause in the world they slew him Which way went they hence said Geraint Yonder by the high road she replied So he returned to Enid Go said he to the lady that is below yonder and await me there till I come She was sad when he ordered her to do thus but nevertheless she went to the damsel whom it was ruth to hear and she felt certain that Geraint would never return Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants and overtook them And each of them was greater in stature than three other men and a huge club was on the shoulder of each Then he rushed upon one of them and thrust his lance through his body And having drawn it forth again he pierced another of them through likewise But the third turned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his shield and crushed his shoulder But Geraint drew his sword and gave the giant a blow on the crown of his head so severe and fierce and violent that his head and his neck were split down to his shoulders and he fell dead So Geraint left him thus and returned to Enid And when he reached the place where she was he fell down lifeless from his horse Piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered And she came and stood over him where he had fallen And at the sound of her cries came the Earl of Limours and they who journeyed with him whom her lamentations brought out of their road And the earl said to Enid Alas lady what hath befallen thee Ah good sir said she the only man I have loved or ever shall love is slain Then he said to the other And what is the cause of thy grief They have slain my beloved husband also said she And who was it that slew them Some giants she answered slew my best beloved and the other knight went in pursuit of them and came back in the state thou seest The earl caused the knight that was dead to be buried but he thought that there still remained some life in Geraint and to see if he yet would live he had him carried with him in the hollow of his shield and upon a bier And the two damsels went to the court and when they arrived there Geraint was placed upon a little couch in front of the table that was in the hall Then they all took off their traveling gear and the earl besought Enid to do the same and to clothe herself in other garments I will not by Heaven said she Ah lady said he be not so sorrowful for this matter It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise said she I will act towards thee in such wise that thou needest not be sorrowful whether yonder knight live or die Behold a good earldom together with myself will I bestow upon thee be therefore happy and joyful I declare to Heaven said she that henceforth I shall never be joyful while I live Come said he and eat No by Heaven I will not But by Heaven thou shalt said he So he took her with him to the table against her will and many times desired her to eat I call Heaven to witness said she that I will not until the man that is upon yonder bier shall eat likewise Thou canst not fulfil that said the earl yonder man is dead already I will prove that I can said she Then he offered her a goblet of liquor Drink this goblet he said and it will cause thee to change thy mind Evil betide me she answered if I drink aught until he drink also Truly said the earl it is of no more avail for me to be gentle with thee than ungentle And he gave her a box in the ear Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek and her lamentations were much greater than they had been before for she considered in her mind that had Geraint been alive he durst not have struck her thus But behold at the sound of her cry Geraint revived from his swoon and he sat upon the bier and finding his sword in the hollow of his shield he rushed to the place where the earl was and struck him a fiercely wounding severely venomous and sternly smiting blow upon the crown of his head so that he clove him in twain until his sword was staid by the table Then all left the board and fled away And this was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread they felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them And Geraint looked upon Enid and he was grieved for two causes one was to see that Enid had lost her color and her wonted aspect and the other to know that she was in the right Lady said he knowest thou where our horses are I know lord where thy horse is she replied but I know not where is the other Thy horse is in the house yonder So he went to the house and brought forth his horse and mounted him and took up Enid and placed her upon the horse with him And he rode forward And their road lay between two hedges and the night was gaining on the day And lo they saw behind them the shafts of spears betwixt them and the sky and they heard the tramping of horses and the noise of a host approaching I hear something following us said he and I will put thee on the other side of the hedge And thus he did And thereupon behold a knight pricked towards him and couched his lance When Enid saw this she cried out saying O chieftain whoever thou art what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man O Heaven said he is it Geraint Yes in truth said she and who art thou I am Gwiffert Petit said he thy husband s ally coming to thy assistance for I heard that thou wast in trouble Come with me to the court of a son in law of my sister which is near here and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom I will do so gladly said Geraint And Enid was placed upon the horse of one of Gwiffert s squires and they went forward to the baron s palace And they were received there with gladness and they met with hospitality and attention The next morning they went to seek physicians and it was not long before they came and they attended Geraint until he was perfectly well And while Geraint was under medical care Gwiffert caused his armor to be repaired until it was as good as it had ever been And they remained there a month and a fortnight Then they separated and Geraint went towards his own dominions and thenceforth he reigned prosperously and his warlike fame and splendor lasted with renown and honor both to him and to Enid from that time forward Footnote Throughout the broad and varied region of romance it would be difficult to find a character of greater simplicity and truth than that of Enid the daughter of Earl Ynywl Conspicuous for her beauty and noble bearing we are at a loss whether more to admire the patience with which she bore all the hardships she was destined to undergo or the constancy and affection which finally achieved the truimph she so richly deserved The character of Enid is admirably sustained through the whole tale and as it is more natural because less overstrained so perhaps it is even more touching than that of Griselda over which however Chaucer has thrown a charm that leads us to forget the improbability of her story CHAPTER VIII PWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED Once upon a time Pwyll was at Narberth his chief palace where a feast had been prepared for him and with him was a great host of men And after the first meal Pwyll arose to walk and he went to the top of a mound that was above the palace and was called Gorsedd Arberth Lord said one of the court it is peculiar to the mound that whosoever sits upon it cannot go thence without either receiving wounds or blows or else seeing a wonder I fear not to receive wounds or blows said Pwyll but as to the wonder gladly would I see it I will therefore go and sit upon the mound And upon the mound he sat And while he sat there they saw a lady on a pure white horse of large size with a garment of shining gold around her coming along the highway that led from the mound My men said Pwyll is there any among you who knows yonder lady There is not lord said they Go one of you and meet her that we may know who she is And one of them arose and as he came upon the road to meet her she passed by and he followed as fast as he could being on foot and the greater was his speed the further was she from him And when he saw that it profited him nothing to follow her he returned to Pwyll and said unto him Lord it is idle for any one in the world to follow her on foot Verily said Pwyll go unto the palace and take the fleetest horse that thou seest and go after her And he took a horse and went forward And he came to an open level plain and put spurs to his horse and the more he urged his horse the further was she from him And he returned to the place where Pwyll was and said Lord it will avail nothing for any one to follow yonder lady I know of no horse in these realms swifter than this and it availed me not to pursue her Of a truth said Pwyll there must be some illusion here let us go towards the palace So to the palace they went and spent the day And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to meat And when meat was ended Pwyll said Where are the hosts that went yesterday to the top of the mound Behold lord we are here said they Let us go said he to the mound and sit there And do thou said he to the page who tended his horse saddle my horse well and hasten with him to the road and bring also my spurs with thee And the youth did thus And they went and sat upon the mound and ere they had been there but a short time they beheld the lady coming by the same road and in the same manner and at the same pace Young man said Pwyll I see the lady coming give me my horse And before he had mounted his horse she passed him And he turned after her and followed her And he let his horse go bounding playfully and thought that he should soon come up with her But he came no nearer to her than at first Then he urged his horse to his utmost speed yet he found that it availed not Then said Pwyll O maiden for the sake of him whom thou best lovest stay for me I will stay gladly said she and it were better for thy horse hadst thou asked it long since So the maiden stopped and she threw back that part of her head dress which covered her face Then he thought that the beauty of all the maidens and all the ladies that he had ever seen was as nothing compared to her beauty Lady he said wilt thou tell me aught concerning thy purpose I will tell thee said she my chief quest was to see thee Truly said Pwyll this is to me the most pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come and wilt thou tell me who thou art I will tell thee lord said she I am Rhiannon the daughter of Heveydd and they sought to give me a husband against my will But no husband would I have and that because of my love for thee neither will I yet have one unless thou reject me and hither have I come to hear thy answer By Heaven said Pwyll behold this is my answer If I might choose among all the ladies and damsels in the world thee would I choose Verily said she if thou art thus minded make a pledge to meet me ere I am given to another The sooner I may do so the more pleasing will it be to me said Pwyll and wheresoever thou wilt there will I meet with thee I will that thou meet me this day twelvemonth at the palace of Heveydd Gladly said he will I keep this tryst So they parted and he went back to his hosts and to them of his household And whatsoever questions they asked him respecting the damsel he always turned the discourse upon other matters And when a year from that time was gone he caused a hundred knights to equip themselves and to go with him to the palace of Heveydd And he came to the palace and there was great joy concerning him with much concourse of people and great rejoicing and vast preparations for his coming And the whole court was placed under his orders And the hall was garnished and they went to meat and thus did they sit Heveydd was on one side of Pwyll and Rhiannon on the other and all the rest according to their rank And they ate and feasted and talked one with another And at the beginning of the carousal after the meat there entered a tall auburn haired youth of royal bearing clothed in a garment of satin And when he came into the hall he saluted Pwyll and his companions The greeting of Heaven be unto thee said Pwyll come thou and sit down Nay said he a suitor am I and I will do my errand Do so willingly said Pwyll Lord said he my errand is unto thee and it is to crave a boon of thee that I come What boon soever thou mayest ask of me so far as I am able thou shalt have Ah said Rhiannon wherefore didst thou give that answer Has he not given it before the presence of these nobles asked the youth My soul said Pwyll what is the boon thou askest The lady whom best I love is to be thy bride this night I come to ask her of thee with the feast and the banquet that are in this place And Pwyll was silent because of the promise which he had given Be silent as long as thou wilt said Rhiannon never did man make worse use of his wits than thou hast done Lady said he I knew not who he was Behold this is the man to whom they would have given me against my will said she and he is Gawl the son of Clud a man of great power and wealth and because of the word thou hast spoken bestow me upon him lest shame befall thee Lady said he I understand not thy answer never can I do as thou sayest Bestow me upon him said she and I will cause that I shall never be his By what means will that be asked Pwyll Then she told him the thought that was in her mind And they talked long together Then Gawl said Lord it is meet that I have an answer to my request As much of that thou hast asked as it is in my power to give thou shalt have replied Pwyll My soul said Rhiannon unto Gawl as for the feast and the banquet that are here I have bestowed them upon the men of Dyved and the household and the warriors that are with us These can I not suffer to be given to any In a year from to night a banquet shall be prepared for thee in this palace that I may become thy bride So Gawl went forth to his possessions and Pwyll went also back to Dyved And they both spent that year until it was the time for the feast at the palace of Heveydd Then Gawl the son of Clud set out to the feast that was prepared for him and he came to the palace and was received there with rejoicing Pwyll also the chief of Dyved came to the orchard with a hundred knights as Rhiannon had commanded him And Pwyll was clad in coarse and ragged garments and wore large clumsy old shoes upon his feet And when he knew that the carousal after the meat had begun he went toward the hall and when he came into the hall he saluted Gawl the son of Clud and his company both men and women Heaven prosper thee said Gawl and friendly greeting be unto thee Lord said he may Heaven reward thee I have an errand unto thee Welcome be thine errand and if thou ask of me that which is right thou shalt have it gladly It is fitting answered he I crave but from want and the boon I ask is to have this small bag that thou seest filled with meat A request within reason is this said he and gladly shalt thou have it Bring him food A great number of attendants arose and began to fill the bag but for all they put into it it was no fuller than at first My soul said Gawl will thy bag ever be full It will not I declare to Heaven said he for all that may be put into it unless one possessed of lands and domains and treasure shall arise and tread down with both his feet the food that is within the bag and shall say Enough has been put therein Then said Rhiannon unto Gawl the son of Clud Rise up quickly I will willingly arise said he So he rose up and put his two feet into the bag And Pwyll turned up the sides of the bag so that Gawl was over his head in it And he shut it up quickly and slipped a knot upon the thongs and blew his horn And thereupon behold his knights came down upon the palace And they seized all the host that had come with Gawl and cast them into his own prison And Pwyll threw off his rags and his old shoes and his tattered array And as they came in every one of Pwyll s knights struck a blow upon the bag and asked What is here A badger said they And in this manner they played each of them striking the bag either with his foot or with a staff And thus played they with the bag And then was the game of Badger in the Bag first played Lord said the man in the bag if thou wouldst but hear me I merit not to be slain in a bag Said Heveydd Lord he speaks truth it were fitting that thou listen to him for he deserves not this Verily said Pwyll I will do thy counsel concerning him Behold this is my counsel then said Rhiannon Thou art now in a position in which it behooves thee to satisfy suitors and minstrels Let him give unto them in thy stead and take a pledge from him that he will never seek to revenge that which has been done to him And this will be punishment enough I will do this gladly said the man in the bag And gladly will I accept it said Pwyll since it is the counsel of Heveydd and Rhiannon Seek thyself sureties We will be for him said Heveydd until his men be free to answer for him And upon this he was let out of the bag and his liegemen were liberated Verily lord said Gawl I am greatly hurt and I have many bruises With thy leave I will go forth I will leave nobles in my stead to answer for me in all that thou shalt require Willingly said Pwyll mayest thou do this So Gawl went to his own possessions And the hall was set in order for Pwyll and the men of his host and for them also of the palace and they went to the tables and sat down And as they had sat that time twelvemonth so sat they that night And they ate and feasted and spent the night in mirth and tranquility And the time came that they should sleep and Pwyll and Rhiannon went to their chamber And next morning at break of day My lord said Rhiannon arise and begin to give thy gifts unto the minstrels Refuse no one to day that may claim thy bounty Thus shall it be gladly said Pwyll both to day and every day while the feast shall last So Pwyll arose and he caused silence to be proclaimed and desired all the suitors and minstrels to show and to point out what gifts they desired And this being done the feast went on and he denied no one while it lasted And when the feast was ended Pwyll said unto Heveydd My lord with thy permission I will set out for Dyved to morrow Certainly said Heveydd may Heaven prosper thee Fix also a time when Rhiannon shall follow thee By Heaven said Pwyll we will go hence together Willest thou this lord said Heveydd Yes lord answered Pwyll And the next day they set forward towards Dyved and journeyed to the palace of Narberth where a feast was made ready for them And there came to them great numbers of the chief men and the most noble ladies of the land and of these there were none to whom Rhiannon did not give some rich gift either a bracelet or a ring or a precious stone And they ruled the land prosperously that year and the next CHAPTER IX BRANWEN THE DAUGHTER OF LLYR Bendigeid Vran the son of Llyr was the crowned king of this island and he was exalted from the crown of London And one afternoon he was at Harlech in Ardudwy at his court and he sat upon the rock of Harlech looking over the sea And with him were his brother Manawyddan the son of Llyr and his brothers by the mother s side Nissyen and Evnissyen and many nobles likewise as was fitting to see around a king His two brothers by the mother s side were the sons of Euroswydd and one of these youths was a good youth and of gentle nature and would make peace between his kindred and cause his family to be friends when their wrath was at the highest and this one was Nissyen but the other would cause strife between his two brothers when they were most at peace And as they sat thus they beheld thirteen ships coming from the south of Ireland and making towards them and they came with a swift motion the wind being behind them and they neared them rapidly I see ships afar said the king coming swiftly towards the land Command the men of the court that they equip themselves and go and learn their intent So the men equipped themselves and went down towards them And when they saw the ships near certain were they that they had never seen ships better furnished Beautiful flags of satin were upon them And behold one of the ships outstripped the others and they saw a shield lifted up above the side of the ship and the point of the shield was upwards in token of peace And the men drew near that they might hold converse Then they put out boats and came toward the land And they saluted the king Now the king could hear them from the place where he was upon the rock above their heads Heaven prosper you said he and be ye welcome To whom do these ships belong and who is the chief amongst you Lord said they Matholch king of Ireland is here and these ships belong to him Wherefore comes he asked the king and will he come to the land He is a suitor unto thee lord said they and he will not land unless he have his boon And what may that be inquired the king He desires to ally himself lord with thee said they and he comes to ask Branwen the daughter of Llyr that if it seem well to thee the Island of the Mighty Footnote The Island of the Mighty is one of the many names bestowed upon Britain by the Welsh may be leagued with Ireland and both become more powerful Verily said he let him come to land and we will take counsel thereupon And this answer was brought to Matholch I will go willingly said he So he landed and they received him joyfully and great was the throng in the palace that night between his hosts and those of the court and next day they took counsel and they resolved to bestow Branwen upon Matholch Now she was one of the three chief ladies of this island and she was the fairest damsel in the world And they fixed upon Aberfraw as the place where she should become his bride And they went thence and towards Aberfraw the hosts proceeded Matholch and his host in their ships Bendigeid Vran and his host by land until they came to Aberfraw And at Aberfraw they began the feast and sat down And thus sat they the king of the Island of the Mighty and Manawyddan the son of Llyr on one side and Matholch on the other side and Branwen the daughter of Llyr beside him And they were not within a house but under tents No house could ever contain Bendigeid Vran And they began the banquet and caroused and discoursed And when it was more pleasing to them to sleep than to carouse they went to rest and Branwen became Matholch s bride And next day they arose and all they of the court and the officers began to equip and to range the horses and the attendants and they ranged them in order as far as the sea And behold one day Evnissyen the quarrelsome man of whom it is spoken above came by chance into the place where the horses of Matholch were and asked whose horses they might be They are the horses of Matholch king of Ireland who is married to Branwen thy sister his horses are they And is it thus they have done with a maiden such as she and moreover my sister bestowing her without my consent They could have offered no greater insult to me than this said he And thereupon he rushed under the horses and cut off their lips at the teeth and their ears close to their heads and their tails close to their backs and he disfigured the horses and rendered them useless And they came with these tidings unto Matholch saying that the horses were disfigured and injured so that not one of them could ever be of any use again Verily lord said one it was an insult unto thee and as such was it meant Of a truth it is a marvel to me that if they desire to insult me they should have given me a maiden of such high rank and so much beloved of her kindred as they have done Lord said another thou seest that thus it is and there is nothing for thee to do but to go to thy ships And thereupon towards his ships he set out And tidings came to Bendigeid Vran that Matholch was quitting the court without asking leave and messengers were sent to inquire of him wherefore he did so And the messengers that went were Iddic the son of Anarawd and Heveyd Hir And these overtook him and asked of him what he designed to do and wherefore he went forth Of a truth said he if I had known I had not come hither I have been altogether insulted no one had ever worse treatment than I have had here Truly lord it was not the will of any that are of the court said they nor of any that are of the council that thou shouldst have received this insult and as thou hast been insulted the dishonor is greater unto Bendigeid Vran than unto thee Verily said he I think so Nevertheless he cannot recall the insult These men returned with that answer to the place where Bendigeid Vran was and they told him what reply Matholch had given them Truly said he there are no means by which we may prevent his going away at enmity with us that we will not take Well lord said they send after him another embassy I will do so said he Arise Manawyddan son of Llyr and Heveyd Hir and go after him and tell him that he shall have a sound horse for every one that has been injured And beside that as an atonement for the insult he shall have a staff of silver as large and as tall as himself and a plate of gold of the breadth of his face And show unto him who it was that did this and that it was done against my will but that he who did it is my brother and therefore it would be hard for me to put him to death And let him come and meet me said he and we will make peace in any way he may desire The embassy went after Matholch and told him all these sayings in a friendly manner and he listened thereunto Men said he I will take counsel So to the council he went And in the council they considered that if they should refuse this they were likely to have more shame rather than to obtain so great an atonement They resolved therefore to accept it and they returned to the court in peace Then the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the fashion of a hall and they went to meat and as they had sat at the beginning of the feast so sat they there And Matholch and Bendigeid Vran began to discourse and behold it seemed to Bendigeid Vran while they talked that Matholch was not so cheerful as he had been before And he thought that the chieftain might be sad because of the smallness of the atonement which he had for the wrong that had been done him O man said Bendigeid Vran thou dost not discourse to night so cheerfully as thou wast wont And if it be because of the smallness of the atonement thou shalt add thereunto whatsoever thou mayest choose and to morrow I will pay thee for the horses Lord said he Heaven reward thee And I will enhance the atonement said Bendigeid Vran for I will give unto thee a caldron the property of which is that if one of thy men be slain to day and be cast therein to morrow he will be as well as ever he was at the best except that he will not regain his speech And thereupon he gave him great thanks and very joyful was he for that cause That night they continued to discourse as much as they would and had minstrelsy and carousing and when it was more pleasant to them to sleep than to sit longer they went to rest And thus was the banquet carried on with joyousness and when it was finished Matholch journeyed towards Ireland and Branwen with him and they went from Aber Menei with thirteen ships and came to Ireland And in Ireland was there great joy because of their coming And not one great man nor noble lady visited Branwen unto whom she gave not either a clasp or a ring or a royal jewel to keep such as it was honorable to be seen departing with And in these things she spent that year in much renown and she passed her time pleasantly enjoying honor and friendship And in due time a son was born unto her and the name that they gave him was Gwern the son of Matholch and they put the boy out to be nursed in a place where were the best men of Ireland And behold in the second year a tumult arose in Ireland on account of the insult which Matholch had received in Wales and the payment made him for his horses And his foster brothers and such as were nearest to him blamed him openly for that matter And he might have no peace by reason of the tumult until they should revenge upon him this disgrace And the vengeance which they took was to drive away Branwen from the same chamber with him and to make her cook for the court and they caused the butcher after he had cut up the meat to come to her and give her every day a blow on the ear and such they made her punishment Verily lord said his men to Matholch forbid now the ships and the ferry boats and the coracles that they go not into Wales and such as come over from Wales hither imprison them that they go not back for this thing to be known there And he did so and it was thus for no less than three years And Branwen reared a starling in the cover of the kneading trough and she taught it to speak and she taught the bird what manner of man her brother was And she wrote a letter of her woes and the despite with which she was treated and she bound the letter to the root of the bird s wing and sent it toward Wales And the bird came to that island and one day it found Bendigeid Vran at Caer Seiont in Arvon conferring there and it alighted upon his shoulder and ruffled its feathers so that the letter was seen and they knew that the bird had been reared in a domestic manner Then Bendigeid Vran took the letter and looked upon it And when he had read the letter he grieved exceedingly at the tidings of Branwen s woes And immediately he began sending messengers to summon the island together And he caused seven score and four of his chief men to come unto him and he complained to them of the grief that his sister endured So they took counsel And in the counsel they resolved to go to Ireland and to leave seven men as princes at home and Caradoc Footnote Caractacus the son of Bran as the chief of them Bendigeid Vran with the host of which we spoke sailed towards Ireland and it was not far across the sea and he came to shoal water Now the swine herds of Matholch were upon the sea shore and they came to Matholch Lord said they greeting be unto thee Heaven protect you said he have you any news Lord said they we have marvellous news A wood have we seen upon the sea in a place where we never yet saw a single tree This is indeed a marvel said he saw you aught else We saw lord said they a vast mountain beside the wood which moved and there was a lofty ridge on the top of the mountain and a lake on each side of the ridge And the wood and the mountain and all these things moved Verily said he there is none who can know aught concerning this unless it be Branwen Messengers then went unto Branwen Lady said they what thinkest thou that this is The men of the Island of the Mighty who have come hither on hearing of my ill treatment and of my woes What is the forest that is seen upon the sea asked they The yards and the masts of ships she answered Alas said they what is the mountain that is seen by the side of the ships Bendigeid Vran my brother she replied coming to shoal water and he is wading to the land What is the lofty ridge with the lake on each side thereof On looking towards this island he is wroth and his two eyes on each side of his nose are the two lakes on each side of the ridge The warriors and chief men of Ireland were brought together in haste and they took counsel Lord said the neighbors unto Matholch there is no other counsel than this alone Thou shalt give the kingdom to Gwern the son of Branwen his sister as a compensation for the wrong and despite that have been done unto Branwen And he will make peace with thee And in the council it was resolved that this message should be sent to Bendigeid Vran lest the country should be destroyed And this peace was made And Matholch caused a great house to be built for Bendigeid Vran and his host Thereupon came the hosts into the house The men of the island of Ireland entered the house on the one side and the men of the Island of the Mighty on the other And as soon as they had sat down there was concord between them and the sovereignty was conferred upon the boy When the peace was concluded Bendigeid Vran called the boy unto him and from Bendigeid Vran the boy went unto Manawyddan and he was beloved by all that beheld him And from Manawyddan the boy was called by Nissyen the son of Euroswydd and the boy went unto him lovingly Wherefore said Evnissyen comes not my nephew the son of my sister unto me Though he were not king of Ireland yet willingly would I fondle the boy Cheerfully let him go to thee said Bendigeid Vran and the boy went unto him cheerfully By my confession to Heaven said Evnissyen in his heart unthought of is the slaughter that I will this instant commit Then he arose and took up the boy and before any one in the house could seize hold of him he thrust the boy headlong into the blazing fire And when Branwen saw her son burning in the fire she strove to leap into the fire also from the place where she sat between her two brothers But Bendigeid Vran grasped her with one hand and his shield with the other Then they all hurried about the house and never was there made so great a tumult by any host in one house as was made by them as each man armed himself And while they all sought their arms Bendigeid Vran supported Branwen between his shield and his shoulder And they fought Then the Irish kindled a fire under the caldron of renovation and they cast the dead bodies into the caldron until it was full and the next day they came forth fighting men as good as before except that they were not able to speak Then when Evnissyen saw the dead bodies of the men of the Island of the Mighty nowhere resuscitated he said in his heart Alas woe is me that I should have been the cause of bringing the men of the Island of the Mighty into so great a strait Evil betide me if I find not a deliverance therefrom And he cast himself among the dead bodies of the Irish and two unshod Irishmen came to him and taking him to be one of the Irish flung him into the caldron And he stretched himself out in the caldron so that he rent the caldron into four pieces and burst his own heart also In consequence of this the men of the Island of the Mighty obtained such success as they had but they were not victorious for only seven men of them all escaped and Bendigeid Vran himself was wounded in the foot with a poisoned dart Now the men that escaped were Pryderi Manawyddan Taliesin and four others And Bendigeid Vran commanded them that they should cut off his head And take you my head said he and bear it even unto the White Mount in London and bury it there with the face towards France And so long as it lies there no enemy shall ever land on the island So they cut off his head and these seven went forward therewith And Branwen was the eighth with them And they came to land on Aber Alaw and they sat down to rest And Branwen looked towards Ireland and towards the Island of the Mighty to see if she could descry them Alas said she woe is me that I was ever born two islands have been destroyed because of me Then she uttered a groan and there broke her heart And they made her a four sided grave and buried her upon the banks of the Alaw Then the seven men journeyed forward bearing the head with them and as they went behold there met them a multitude of men and women Have you any tidings said Manawyddan We have none said they save that Caswallawn Footnote Cassivellaunus the son of Beli has conquered the Island of the Mighty and is crowned king in London What has become said they of Caradoc the son of Bran and the seven men who were left with him in this island Caswallawn came upon them and slew six of the men and Caradoc s heart broke for grief thereof And the seven men journeyed on towards London and they buried the head in the White Mount as Bendigeid Vran had directed them Footnote There is a Triad upon the story of the head buried under the White Tower of London as a charm against invasion Arthur it seems proudly disinterred the head preferring to hold the island by his own strength alone CHAPTER X MANAWYDDAN Pwyll and Rhiannon had a son whom they named Pryderi And when he was grown up Pwyll his father died And Pryderi married Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloy Now Manawyddan returned from the war in Ireland and he found that his cousin had seized all his possessions and much grief and heaviness came upon him Alas woe is me he exclaimed there is none save myself without a home and a resting place Lord said Pryderi be not so sorrowful Thy cousin is king of the Island of the Mighty and though he has done thee wrong thou hast never been a claimant of land or possessions Yea answered he but although this man is my cousin it grieveth me to see any one in the place of my brother Bendigeid Vran neither can I be happy in the same dwelling with him Wilt thou follow the counsel of another said Pryderi I stand in need of counsel he answered and what may that counsel be Seven cantrevs belong unto me said Pryderi wherein Rhiannon my mother dwells I will bestow her upon thee and the seven cantrevs with her and though thou hadst no possessions but those cantrevs only thou couldst not have any fairer than they Do thou and Rhiannon enjoy them and if thou desire any possessions thou wilt not despise these I do not chieftain said he Heaven reward thee for the friendship I will go with thee to seek Rhiannon and to look at thy possessions Thou wilt do well he answered and I believe that thou didst never hear a lady discourse better than she and when she was in her prime none was ever fairer Even now her aspect is not uncomely They set forth and however long the journey they came at last to Dyved and a feast was prepared for them by Rhiannon and Kicva Then began Manawyddan and Rhiannon to sit and to talk together and his mind and his thoughts became warmed towards her and he thought in his heart he had never beheld any lady more fulfilled of grace and beauty than she Pryderi said he I will that it be as thou didst say What saying was that asked Rhiannon Lady said Pryderi I did offer thee as a wife to Manawyddan the son of Llyr By that will I gladly abide said Rhiannon Right glad am I also said Manawyddan may Heaven reward him who hath shown unto me friendship so perfect as this And before the feast was over she became his bride Said Pryderi Tarry ye here the rest of the feast and I will go into England to tender my homage unto Caswallawn the son of Beli Lord said Rhiannon Caswallawn is in Kent thou mayest therefore tarry at the feast and wait until he shall be nearer We will wait he answered So they finished the feast And they began to make the circuit of Dyved and to hunt and to take their pleasure And as they went through the country they had never seen lands more pleasant to live in nor better hunting grounds nor greater plenty of honey and fish And such was the friendship between these four that they would not be parted from each other by night nor by day And in the midst of all this he went to Caswallawn at Oxford and tendered his homage and honorable was his reception there and highly was he praised for offering his homage And after his return Pryderi and Manawyddan feasted and took their ease and pleasure And they began a feast at Narberth for it was the chief palace And when they had ended the first meal while those who served them ate they arose and went forth and proceeded to the Gorsedd that is the Mount of Narberth and their retinue with them And as they sat thus behold a peal of thunder and with the violence of the thunder storm lo there came a fall of mist so thick that not one of them could see the other And after the mist it became light all around And when they looked towards the place where they were wont to see the cattle and herds and dwellings they saw nothing now neither house nor beast nor smoke nor fire nor man nor dwelling but the buildings of the court empty and desert and uninhabited without either man or beast within them And truly all their companions were lost to them without their knowing aught of what had befallen them save those four only In the name of Heaven said Manawyddan where are they of the court and all my host beside Let us go and see So they came to the castle and saw no man and into the hall and to the sleeping place and there was none and in the mead cellar and in the kitchen there was naught but desolation Then they began to go through the land and all the possessions that they had and they visited the houses and dwellings and found nothing but wild beasts And when they had consumed their feast and all their provisions they fed upon the prey they killed in hunting and the honey of the wild swans And one morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt and they ranged their dogs and went forth And some of the dogs ran before them and came to a bush which was near at hand but as soon as they were come to the bush they hastily drew back and returned to the men their hair bristling up greatly Let us go near to the bush said Pryderi and see what is in it And as they came near behold a wild boar of a pure white color rose up from the bush Then the dogs being set on by the men rushed towards him but he left the bush and fell back a little way from the men and made a stand against the dogs without retreating from them until the men had come near And when the men came up he fell back a second time and betook him to flight Then they pursued the boar until they beheld a vast and lofty castle all newly built in a place where they had never before seen either stone or building And the boar ran swiftly into the castle and the dogs after him Now when the boar and the dogs had gone into the castle the men began to wonder at finding a castle in a place where they had never before seen any building whatsoever And from the top of the Gorsedd they looked and listened for the dogs But so long as they were there they heard not one of the dogs nor aught concerning them Lord said Pryderi I will go into the castle to get tidings of the dogs Truly he replied thou wouldst be unwise to go into this castle which thou hast never seen till now If thou wouldst follow my counsel thou wouldst not enter therein Whosoever has cast a spell over this land has caused this castle to be here Of a truth answered Pryderi I cannot thus give up my dogs And for all the counsel that Manawyddan gave him yet to the castle he went When he came within the castle neither man nor beast nor boar nor dogs nor house nor dwelling saw he within it But in the centre of the castle floor he beheld a fountain with marble work around it and on the margin of the fountain a golden bowl upon a marble slab and chains hanging from the air to which he saw no end And he was greatly pleased with the beauty of the gold and with the rich workmanship of the bowl and he went up to the bowl and laid hold of it And when he had taken hold of its his hands stuck to the bowl and his feet to the slab on which the bowl was placed and all his joyousness forsook him so that he could not utter a word And thus he stood And Manawyddan waited for him till near the close of the day And late in the evening being certain that he should have no tidings of Pryderi or the dogs he went back to the palace And as he entered Rhiannon looked at him Where said she are thy companion and thy dogs Behold he answered the adventure that has befallen me And he related it all unto her An evil companion hast thou been said Rhiannon and a good companion hast thou lost And with that word she went out and proceeded towards the castle according to the direction which he gave her The gate of the castle she found open She was nothing daunted and she went in And as she went in she perceived Pryderi laying hold of the bowl and she went towards him O my lord said she what dost thou here And she took hold of the bowl with him and as she did so her hands also became fast to the bowl and her feet to the slab and she was not able to utter a word And with that as it became night lo there came thunder upon them and a fall of mist and thereupon the castle vanished and they with it When Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloy saw that there was no one in the palace but herself and Manawyddan she sorrowed so that she cared not whether she lived or died And Manawyddan saw this Thou art in the wrong said he if through fear of me thou grievest thus I call Heaven to witness that thou hast never seen friendship more pure than that which I will bear thee as long as Heaven will that thou shouldst be thus I declare to thee that were I in the dawn of youth I would keep my faith unto Pryderi and unto thee also will I keep it Be there no fear upon thee therefore Heaven reward thee she said and that is what I deemed of thee And the damsel thereupon took courage and was glad Truly lady said Manawyddan it is not fitting for us to stay here we have lost our dogs and cannot get food Let us go into England it is easiest for us to find support there Gladly lord said she we will do so And they set forth together to England Lord said she what craft wilt thou follow Take up one that is seemly None other will I take answered he but that of making shoes Lord said she such a craft becomes not a man so nobly born as thou By that however will I abide said he I know nothing thereof said Kicva But I know answered Manawyddan and I will teach thee to stitch We will not attempt to dress the leather but we will buy it ready dressed and will make the shoes from it So they went into England and went as far as Hereford and they betook themselves to making shoes And he began by buying the best cordwain that could be had in the town and none other would buy And he associated himself with the best goldsmith in the town and caused him to make clasps for the shoes and to gild the clasps and he marked how it was done until he learned the method And therefore is he called one of the three makers of gold shoes And when they could be had from him not a shoe nor hose was bought of any of the cordwainers in the town But when the cordwainers perceived that their gains were failing for as Manawyddan shaped the work so Kicva stitched it they came together and took counsel and agreed that they would slay them And he had warning thereof and it was told him how the cordwainers had agreed together to slay him Lord said Kicva wherefore should this be borne from these boors Nay said he we will go back unto Dyved So towards Dyved they set forth Now Manawyddan when he set out to return to Dyved took with him a burden of wheat And he proceeded towards Narberth and there he dwelt And never was he better pleased than when he saw Narberth again and the lands where he had been wont to hunt with Pryderi and with Rhiannon And he accustomed himself to fish and to hunt the deer in their covert And then he began to prepare some ground and he sowed a croft and a second and a third And no wheat in the world ever sprung up better And the three crofts prospered with perfect growth and no man ever saw fairer wheat than it And thus passed the seasons of the year until the harvest came And he went to look at one of his crofts and behold it was ripe I will reap this to morrow said he And that night he went back to Narberth and on the morrow in the gray dawn he went to reap the croft and when he came there he found nothing but the bare straw Every one of the ears of the wheat was cut off from the stalk and all the ears carried entirely away and nothing but the straw left And at this he marvelled greatly Then he went to look at another croft and behold that also was ripe Verily said he this will I reap to morrow And on the morrow he came with the intent to reap it and when he came there he found nothing but the bare straw O gracious Heaven he exclaimed I know that whosoever has begun my ruin is completing it and has also destroyed the country with me Then he went to look at the third croft and when he came there finer wheat had there never been seen and this also was ripe Evil betide me said he if I watch not here to night Whoever carried off the other corn will come in like manner to take this and I will know who it is And he told Kicva all that had befallen Verily said she what thinkest thou to do I will watch the croft to night said he And he went to watch the croft And at midnight he heard something stirring among the wheat and he looked and behold the mightiest host of mice in the world which could neither be numbered nor measured And he knew not what it was until the mice had made their way into the croft and each of them climbing up the straw and bending it down with its weight had cut off one of the ears of wheat and had carried it away leaving there the stalk and he saw not a single straw there that had not a mouse to it And they all took their way carrying the ears with them In wrath and anger did he rush upon the mice but he could no more come up with them than if they had been gnats or birds of the air except one only which though it was but sluggish went so fast that a man on foot could scarce overtake it And after this one he went and he caught it and put it in his glove and tied up the opening of the glove with a string and kept it with him and returned to the palace Then he came to the hall where Kicva was and he lighted a fire and hung the glove by the string upon a peg What hast thou there lord said Kicva A thief said he that I found robbing me What kind of a thief may it be lord that thou couldst put into thy glove said she Then he told her how the mice came to the last of the fields in his sight And one of them was less nimble than the rest and is now in my glove to morrow I will hang it My lord said she this is marvellous but yet it would be unseemly for a man of dignity like thee to be hanging such a reptile as this Woe betide me said he if I would not hang them all could I catch them and such as I have I will hang Verily lord said she there is no reason that I should succor this reptile except to prevent discredit unto thee Do therefore lord as thou wilt Then he went to the Mound of Narberth taking the mouse with him And he set up two forks on the highest part of the mound And while he was doing this behold he saw a scholar coming towards him in old and poor and tattered garments And it was now seven years since he had seen in that place either man or beast except those four persons who had remained together until two of them were lost My lord said the scholar good day to thee Heaven prosper thee and my greeting be unto thee And whence dost thou come scholar asked he I come lord from singing in England and wherefore dost thou inquire Because for the last seven years answered he I have seen no man here save four secluded persons and thyself this moment Truly lord said he I go through this land unto mine own And what work art thou upon lord I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me said he What manner of thief is that asked the scholar I see a creature in thy hand like unto a mouse and ill does it become a man of rank equal to thine to touch a reptile such as this Let it go forth free I will not let it go free by Heaven said he I caught it robbing me and the doom of a thief will I inflict upon it and I will hang it Lord said he rather than see a man of rank equal to thine at such a work as this I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let the reptile go forth free I will not let it go free said he neither will I sell it As thou wilt lord he answered I care naught And the scholar went his way And as he was placing the cross beam upon the two forks behold a priest came towards him upon a horse covered with trappings Good day to thee lord said he Heaven prosper thee said Manawyddan thy blessing The blessing of Heaven be upon thee And what lord art thou doing I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me said he What manner of thief lord asked he A creature he answered in form of a mouse It has been robbing me and I am inflicting upon it the doom of a thief Lord said he rather than see thee touch this reptile I would purchase its freedom By my confession to Heaven neither will I sell it nor set it free It is true lord that it is worth nothing to buy but rather than see thee defile thyself by touching such a reptile as this I will give thee three pounds to let it go I will not by Heaven said he take any price for it As it ought so shall it be hanged And the priest went his way Then he noosed the string around the mouse s neck and as he was about to draw it up behold he saw a bishop s retinue with his sumpter horses and his attendants And the bishop himself came towards him And he stayed his work Lord Bishop said he thy blessing Heaven s blessing be unto thee said he What work art thou upon Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me said he Is not that a mouse that I see in thy hand Yes answered he and she has robbed me Ay said he since I have come at the doom of this reptile I will ransom it of thee I will give thee seven pounds for it and that rather than see a man of rank equal to thine destroying so vile a reptile as this Let it loose and thou shalt have the money I declare to Heaven that I will not let it loose If thou wilt not loose it for this I will give thee four and twenty pounds of ready money to set it free I will not set it free by Heaven for as much again said he If thou wilt not set it free for this I will give thee all the horses that thou seest in this plain and the seven loads of baggage and the seven horses that they are upon By Heaven I will not he replied Since for this thou wilt not set it free do so at what price soever thou wilt I will that Rhiannon and Pryderi be free said he That thou shalt have he answered Not yet will I loose the mouse by Heaven What then wouldst thou That the charm and the illusion be removed from the seven cantrevs of Dyved This shalt thou have also set therefore the mouse free I will not set it free by Heaven said he till I know who the mouse may be She is my wife Wherefore came she to me To despoil thee he answered I am Lloyd the son of Kilwed and I cast the charm over the seven cantrevs of Dyved And it was to avenge Gawl the son of Clud from the friendship I had towards him that I cast the charm And upon Pryderi did I avenge Gawl the son of Clud for the game of Badger in the Bag that Pwyll the son of Auwyn played upon him And when it was known that thou wast come to dwell in the land my household came and besought me to transform them into mice that they might destroy thy corn And they went the first and the second night and destroyed thy two crops And the third night came unto me my wife and the ladies of the court and besought me to transform them And I transformed them Now she is not in her usual health And had she been in her usual health thou wouldst not have been able to overtake her but since this has taken place and she has been caught I will restore to thee Pryderi and Rhiannon and I will take the charm and illusion from off Dyved Set her therefore free I will not set her free yet What wilt thou more he asked I will that there be no more charm upon the seven cantrevs of Dyved and that none shall be put upon it henceforth moreover that vengeance be never taken for this either upon Pryderi or Rhiannon or upon me All this shalt thou have And truly thou hast done wisely in asking this Upon thy head would have lit all this trouble Yea said he for fear thereof was it that I required this Set now my wife at liberty I will not said he until I see Pryderi and Rhiannon with me free Behold here they come he answered And thereupon behold Pryderi and Rhiannon And he rose up to meet them and greeted them and sat down beside them Ah chieftain set now my wife at liberty said the bishop Hast thou not received all thou didst ask I will release her gladly said he And thereupon he set her free Then he struck her with a magic wand and she was changed back into a young woman the fairest ever seen Look round upon thy land said he and thou wilt see it all tilled and peopled as it was in its best estate And he rose up and looked forth And when he looked he saw all the lands tilled and full of herds and dwellings And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi The following allusions to the preceding story are found in a letter of the poet Southey to John Rickman esquire dated June sixth eighteen oh two You will read the Mabinogeon concerning which I ought to have talked to you In the last that most odd and Arabian like story of the mouse mention is made of a begging scholar that helps to the date but where did the Cymri get the imagination that could produce such a tale That enchantment of the basin hanging by the chain from heaven is in the wildest spirit of the Arabian Nights I am perfectly astonished that such fictions should exist in Welsh They throw no light on the origin of romance everything being utterly dissimilar to what we mean by that term but they do open a new world of fiction and if the date of their language be fixed about the twelfth or thirteenth century I cannot but think the mythological substance is of far earlier date very probably brought from the East by some of the first settlers or conquerors CHAPTER XI KILWICH AND OLWEN Kilydd a son of Prince Kelyddon desired a wife as a helpmate and the wife that he chose was Goleudid the daughter of Prince Anlawd And after their union the people put up prayers that they might have an heir And they had a son through the prayers of the people and called his name Kilwich After this the boy s mother Goleudid the daughter of Prince Anlawd fell sick Then she called her husband to her and said to him Of this sickness I shall die and thou wilt take another wife Now wives are the gift of the Lord but it would be wrong for thee to harm thy son Therefore I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar with two blossoms upon my grave And this he promised her Then she besought him to dress her grave every year that no weeds might grow thereon So the queen died Now the king sent an attendant every morning to see if anything were growing upon the grave And at the end of the seventh year they neglected that which they had promised to the queen One day the king went to hunt and he rode to the place of burial to see the grave and to know if it were time that he should take a wife and the King saw the briar And when he saw it the king took counsel where he should find a wife Said one of his counsellors I know a wife that will suit thee well and she is the wife of King Doged And they resolved to go to seek her and they slew the king and brought away his wife And they conquered the kings lands And he married the widow of King Doged the sister of Yspadaden Penkawr And one day his stepmother said to Kilwich It were well for thee to have a wife I am not yet of an age to wed answered the youth Then said she unto him I declare to thee that it is thy destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou obtain Olwen the daughter of Yspadaden Penkawr And the youth blushed and the love of the maiden diffused itself through all his frame although he had never seen her And his father inquired of him What has come over thee my son and what aileth thee My stepmother has declared to me that I shall never have a wife until I obtain Olwen the daughter of Yspadaden Penkawr That will be easy for thee answered his father Arthur is thy cousin Go therefore unto Arthur to cut thy hair and ask this of him as a boon And the youth pricked forth upon a steed with head dappled gray four winters old firm of limb with shell formed hoofs having a bridle of linked gold on his head and upon him a saddle of costly gold And in the youth s hand were two spears of silver sharp well tempered headed with steel three ells in length of an edge to wound the wind and cause blood to flow and swifter than the fall of the dew drop from the blade of reed grass when the dew of June is at the heaviest A gold hilted sword was upon his thigh the blade of which was gilded bearing a cross of inlaid gold of the hue of the lightning of heaven His war horn was of ivory Before him were two brindled white breasted greyhounds having strong collars of rubies about their necks reaching from the shoulder to the ear And the one that was upon the left side bounded across to the right side and the one on the right to the left and like two sea swallows sported around him And his courser cast up four sods with his four hoofs like four swallows in the air about his head now above now below About him was a four cornered cloth of purple and an apple of gold was at each corner and every one of the apples was of the value of an hundred kine And there was precious gold of the value of three hundred kine upon his shoes and upon his stirrups from his knee to the tip of his toe And the blade of grass bent not beneath him so light was his courser s tread as he journeyed toward the gate of Arthur s palace Spoke the youth Is there a porter There is and if thou holdest not thy peace small will be thy welcome I am Arthur s porter every first day of January Open the portal I will not open it Wherefore not The knife is in the meat and the drink is in the horn and there is revelry in Arthur s hall and none may enter therein but the son of a king of a privileged country or a craftsman bringing his craft But there will be refreshment for thy dogs and for thy horse and for thee there will be collops cooked and peppered and luscious wine and mirthful songs and food for fifty men shall be brought unto thee in the guest chamber where the stranger and the sons of other countries eat who come not into the precincts of the palace of Arthur Thou wilt fare no worse there than thou wouldst with Arthur in the court A lady shall smooth thy couch and shall lull thee with songs and early to morrow morning when the gate is open for the multitude that came hither to day for thee shall it be opened first and thou mayest sit in the place that thou shalt choose in Arthur s hall from the upper end to the lower Said the youth That will I not do If thou openest the gate it is well If thou dost not open it I will bring disgrace upon thy lord and evil report upon thee And I will set up three shouts at this very gate than which none were ever heard more deadly What clamor soever thou mayest make said Glewlwyd the porter against the laws of Arthur s palace shalt thou not enter therein until I first go and speak with Arthur Then Glewlwyd went into the hall And Arthur said to him Hast thou news from the gate Half of my life is passed said Glewlwyd and half of thine I was heretofore in Kaer Se and Asse in Sach and Salach in Lotor and Fotor and I have been in India the Great and India the Lesser and I have also been in Europe and Africa and in the islands of Corsica and I was present when thou didst conquer Greece in the East Nine supreme sovereigns handsome men saw we there but never did I behold a man of equal dignity with him who is now at the door of the portal Then said Arthur If walking thou didst enter here return thou running It is unbecoming to keep such a man as thou sayest he is in the wind and the rain Said Kay By the hand of my friend if thou wouldst follow my counsel thou wouldst not break through the laws of the court because of him Not so blessed Kay said Arthur it is an honor to us to be resorted to and the greater our courtesy the greater will be our renown and our fame and our glory And Glewlwyd came to the gate and opened the gate before Kilwich and although all dismounted upon the horse block at the gate yet did he not dismount but he rode in upon his charger Then said he Greeting be unto thee sovereign ruler of this island and be this greeting no less unto the lowest than unto the highest and be it equally unto thy guests and thy warriors and thy chieftains let all partake of it as completely as thyself And complete be thy favor and thy fame and thy glory throughout all this island Greeting unto thee also said Arthur sit thou between two of my warriors and thou shalt have minstrels before thee and thou shalt enjoy the privileges of a king born to a throne as long as thou remainest here And when I disperse my presents to the visitors and strangers in this court they shall be in thy hand at my commencing Said the youth I came not here to consume meat and drink but if I obtain the boon that I seek I will requite it thee and extol thee but if I have it not I will bear forth thy dispraise to the four quarters of the world as far as thy renown has extended Then said Arthur Since thou wilt not remain here chieftain thou shalt receive the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name as far as the wind dries and the rain moistens and the sun revolves and the sea encircles and the earth extends save only my ship Prydwen and my mantle and Caliburn my sword and Rhongomyant my lance and Guenever my wife By the truth of Heaven thou shalt have it cheerfuly name what thou wilt I would that thou bless my hair said he That shall be granted thee And Arthur took a golden comb and scissors whereof the loops were of silver and he combed his hair And Arthur inquired of him who he was for my heart warms unto thee and I know that thou art come of my blood Tell me therefore who thou art I will tell thee said the youth I am Kilwich the son of Kilydd the son of Prince Kelyddon by Goleudyd my mother the daughter of Prince Anlawd That is true said Arthur thou art my cousin Whatsoever boon thou mayest ask thou shalt receive be it what it may that thy tongue shall name Pledge the truth of Heaven and the faith of thy kingdom thereof I pledge it thee gladly I crave of thee then that thou obtain for me Olwen the daughter of Yspadaden Penkawr to wife and this boon I likewise seek at the hands of thy warriors I seek it from Kay and from Bedwyr and from Gwynn the son of Nudd and Gadwy the son of Geraint and Prince Flewddur Flam and Iona king of France and Sel the son of Selgi and Taliesin the chief of the bards and Geraint the son of Erbin Garanwyn the son of Kay and Amren the son of Bedwyr Ol the son of Olwyd Bedwin the bishop Guenever the chief lady and Guenhywach her sister Morved the daughter of Urien and Gwenlian Deg the majestic maiden Creiddylad Footnote Creiddylad is no other than Shakspeare s Cordelia whose father King Lear is by the Welsh authorities called indiscriminately Llyr or Lludd All the old chronicles give the story of her devotion to her aged parent but none of them seem to have been aware that she is destined to remain with him till the day of doom whilst Gwyn ap Nudd the king of the fairies and Gwythyr op Greidiol fight for her every first of May and whichever of them may be fortunate enough to be the conqueror at that time will obtain her as a bride the daughter of Lludd the constant maiden and Ewaedah the daughter of Kynvelyn Footnote The Welsh have a fable on the subject of the half man taken to be illustrative of the force of habit In this allegory Arthur is supposed to be met by a sprite who appears at first in a small and indistinct form but who on approaching nearer increases in size and assuming the semblance of half a man endeavors to provoke the king to wrestle Despising his weakness and considering that he should gain no credit by the encounter Arthur refuses to do so and delays the contest until at length the half man Habit becomes so strong that it requires his utmost efforts to overcome him the half man All these did Kilwich the son of Kilydd adjure to obtain his boon Then said Arthur O chieftain I have never heard of the maiden of whom thou speakest nor of her kindred but I will gladly send messengers in search of her Give me time to seek her And the youth said I will willingly grant from this night to that at the end of the year to do so Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to seek for the maiden and at the end of the year Arthur s messengers returned without having gained any knowledge or intelligence concerning Olwen more than on the first day Then said Kilwich Every one has received his boon and I yet lack mine I will depart and bear away thy honor with me Then said Kay Rash chieftain dost thou reproach Arthur Go with us and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the maiden exists not in the world or until we obtain her Thereupon Kay rose up And Arthur called Bedwyr who never shrank from any enterprise upon which Kay was bound None were equal to him in swiftness throughout this island except Arthur alone and although he was one handed three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the field of battle And Arthur called to Kyndelig the guide Go thou upon this expedition with the chieftain For as good a guide was he in a land which he had never seen as he was in his own He called Gurhyr Gwalstat because he knew all tongues He called Gawain the son of Gwyar because he never returned home without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest And Arthur called Meneu the son of Teirgwed in order that if they went into a savage country he might cast a charm and an illusion over them so that none might see them whilst they could see every one They journeyed until they came to a vast open plain wherein they saw a great castle which was the fairest of the castles of the world And when they came before the castle they beheld a vast flock of sheep And upon the top of a mound there was a herdsman keeping the sheep And a rug made of skins was upon him and by his side was a shaggy mastiff larger than a steed nine winters old Then said Kay Gurhyr Gwalstat go thou and salute yonder man Kay said he I engaged not to go further than thou thyself Let us go then together answered Kay Said Meneu Fear not to go thither for I will cast a spell upon the dog so that he shall injure no one And they went up to the mound whereon the herdsman was and they said to him How dost thou fare herdsman Not less fair be it to you than to me Whose are the sheep that thou dost keep and to whom does yonder castle belong Stupid are ye truly not to know that this is the castle of Yspadaden Penkawr And ye also who are ye We are an embassy from Arthur come to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspadaden Penkawr O men the mercy of Heaven be upon you do not that for all the world None who ever came hither on this quest has returned alive And the herdsman rose up And as he rose Kilwich gave unto him a ring of gold And he went home and gave the ring to his spouse to keep And she took the ring when it was given her and she said Whence came this ring for thou art not wont to have good fortune O wife him to whom this ring belonged thou shalt see here this evening And who is he asked the woman Kilwich the son of Kilydd by Goleudid the daughter of Prince Anlawd who is come to seek Olwen as his wife And when she heard that she had joy that her nephew the son of her sister was coming to her and sorrow because she had never known any one depart alive who had come on that quest And the men went forward to the gate of the herdsman s dwelling And when she heard their footsteps approaching she ran out with joy to meet them And Kay snatched a billet out of the pile And when she met them she sought to throw her arms about their necks And Kay placed the log between her two hands and she squeezed it so that it became a twisted coil O woman said Kay if thou hadst squeezed me thus none could ever again have set their affections on me Evil love were this They entered into the house and were served and soon after they all went forth to amuse themselves Then the woman opened a stone chest that was before the chimney corner and out of it arose a youth with yellow curling hair Said Gurhyr It is a pity to hide this youth I know that it is not his own crime that is thus visited upon him This is but a remnant said the woman Three and twenty of my sons has Yspadaden Penkawr slain and I have no more hope of this one than of the others Then said Kay Let him come and be a companion with me and he shall not be slain unless I also am slain with him And they ate And the woman asked them Upon what errand come you here We come to seek Olwen for this youth Then said the woman In the name of Heaven since no one from the castle hath yet seen you return again whence you came Heaven is our witness that we will not return until we have seen the maiden Does she ever come hither so that she may be seen She comes here every Saturday to wash her head and in the vessel where she washes she leaves all her rings and she never either comes herself or sends any messengers to fetch them Will she come here if she is sent to Heaven knows that I will not destroy my soul nor will I betray those that trust me unless you will pledge me your faith that you will not harm her I will not send to her We pledge it said they So a message was sent and she came The maiden was clothed in a robe of flame colored silk and about her neck was a collar of ruddy gold on which were precious emeralds and rubies More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom Footnote The romancers dwell with great complacency on the fair hair and delicate complexion of their heroines This taste continued for a long time and to render the hair light was an object of education Even when wigs came into fashion they were all flaxen Such was the color of the hair of the Gauls and of their German conquerors It required some centuries to reconcile their eyes to the swarthy beauties of their Spanish and Italian neighbors and her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave and fairer were her hands and her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the meadow fountain The eye of the trained hawk was not brighter than hers Her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the white swan her cheek was redder than the reddest roses Whoso beheld her was filled with her love Four white trefoils sprung up wherever she trod And therefore was she called Olwen She entered the house and sat beside Kilwich upon the foremost bench and as soon as he saw her he knew her And Kilwich said unto her Ah maiden thou art she whom I have loved come away with me lest they speak evil of thee and of me Many a day have I loved thee I cannot do this for I have pledged my faith to my father not to go without his counsel for his life will last only until the time of my espousals Whatever is to be must be But I will give thee advice if thou wilt take it Go ask me of my father and that which he shall require of thee grant it and thou wilt obtain me but if thou deny him anything thou wilt not obtain me and it will be well for thee if thou escape with thy life I promise all this if occasion offer said he She returned to her chamber and they all rose up and followed her to the castle And they slew the nine porters that were at the nine gates in silence And they slew the nine watch dogs without one of them barking And they went forward to the hall The greeting of Heaven and of man be unto thee Yspadaden Penkawr said they And you wherefore come you We come to ask thy daughter Olwen for Kilwich the son of Kilydd the son of Prince Kelyddon Where are my pages and my servants Raise up the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes that I may see the fashion of my son in law And they did so Come hither to morrow and you shall have an answer They rose to go forth and Yspadaden Penkawr seized one of the three poisoned darts that lay beside him and threw it after them And Bedwyr caught it and flung it and pierced Yspadaden Penkawr grievously with it through the knee Then he said A cursed ungentle son in law truly I shall ever walk the worse for his rudeness and shall ever be without a cure This poisoned iron pains me like the bite of a gad fly Cursed be the smith who forged it and the anvil on which it was wrought So sharp is it That night also they took up their abode in the house of the herdsman The next day with the dawn they arrayed themselves and proceeded to the castle and entered the hall and they said Yspadaden Penkawr give us thy daughter in consideration of her dower and her maiden fee which we will pay to thee and to her two kinswomen likewise Then he said Her four great grandmothers and her four great grandsires are yet alive it is needful that I take counsel of them Be it so they answered we will go to meat As they rose up he took the second dart that was beside him and cast it after them And Meneu the son of Gawedd caught it and flung it back at him and wounded him in the centre of the breast A cursed ungentle son in law truly said he the hard iron pains me like the bite of a horse leech Cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated and the smith who formed it So sharp is it Henceforth whenever I go up hill I shall have a scant in my breath and a pain in my chest and I shall often loathe my food And they went to meat And the third day they returned to the palace And Yspadaden Penkawr said to them Shoot not at me again unless you desire death Where are my attendants Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs that I may see the fashion of my son in law Then they arose and as they did so Yspadaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them And Kilwich caught it and threw it vigorously and wounded him through the eyeball A cursed ungentle son in law truly As long as I remain alive my eyesight will be the worse Whenever I go against the wind my eyes will water and peradventure my head will burn and I shall have a giddiness every new moon Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron Cursed be the fire in which it was forged And they went to meat And the next day they came again to the palace and they said Shoot not at us any more unless thou desirest such hurt and harm and torture as thou now hast and even more Said Kilwich Give me thy daughter and if thou wilt not give her thou shalt receive thy death because of her Where is he that seeks my daughter Come hither where I may see thee And they placed him a chair face to face with him Said Yspadaden Penkawr Is it thou that seekest my daughter It is I answered Kilwich I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do toward me otherwise than is just and when I have gotten that which I shall name my daughter thou shalt have I promise thee that willingly said Kilwich name what thou wilt I will do so said he Seest thou yonder red tilled ground I see it When first I met the mother of this maiden nine bushels of flax were sown therein and none has yet sprung up white nor black I require to have the flax to sow in the new land yonder that when it grows up it may make a white wimple for my daughter s head on the day of thy wedding It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get the harp of Teirtu to play to us that night When a man desires that it should play it does so of itself and when he desires that it should cease it ceases And this he will not give of his own free will and thou wilt not be able to compel him It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get I require thee to get me for my huntsman Mabon the son of Modron He was taken from his mother when three nights old and it is not known where he now is nor whether he is living or dead It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get the two cubs of the wolf Gast Rhymhi no leash in the world will hold them but a leash made from the beard of Dillus Varwawc the robber And the leash will be of no avail unless it be plucked from his beard while he is alive While he lives he will not suffer this to be done to him and the leash will be of no use should he be dead because it will be brittle It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get the sword of Gwernach the Giant of his own free will he will not give it and thou wilt never be able to compel him It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get Difficulties shalt thou meet with and nights without sleep in seeking this and if thou obtain it not neither shalt thou obtain my daughter Horses shall I have and chivalry and my lord and kinsman Arthur will obtain for me all these things And I shall gain thy daughter and thou shalt lose thy life Go forward And thou shalt not be chargeable for food or raiment for my daughter while thou art seeking these things and when thou hast compassed all these marvels thou shalt have my daughter for thy wife CHAPTER XII KILWICH AND OLWEN Continued All that day they journeyed until the evening and then they beheld a vast castle which was the largest in the world And lo a black man larger than three of the men of this world came out from the castle And they spoke unto him and said O man whose castle is that Stupid are ye truly O men There is no one in the world that does not know that this is the castle of Gwernach the Giant What treatment is there for guests and strangers that alight in that castle O chieftain Heaven protect thee No guests ever returned thence alive and no one may enter therein unless he brings with him his craft Then they proceeded towards the gate Said Gurhyr Gwalstat Is there a porter There is wherefore dost thou call Open the gate I will not open it Wherefore wilt thou not The knife is in the meat and the drink is in the horn and there is revelry in the hall of Gwernach the Giant and except for a craftsman who brings his craft the gate will not be opened to night Verily porter then said Kay my craft bring I with me What is thy craft The best burnisher of swords am I in the world I will go and tell this unto Gwernach the Giant and I will bring thee an answer So the porter went in and Gwernach said to him Hast thou news from the gate I have There is a party at the door of the gate who desire to come in Didst thou inquire of them if they possessed any art I did inquire said he and one told me that he was well skilled in the burnishing of swords We have need of him then For some time have I sought for some one to polish my sword and could find no one Let this man enter since he brings with him his craft The porter thereupon returned and opened the gate And Kay went in by himself and he saluted Gwernach the Giant And a chair was placed for him opposite to Gwernach And Gwernach said to him O man is it true that is reported of thee that thou knowest how to burnish swords I know full well how to do so answered Kay Then was the sword of Gwernach brought to him And Kay took a blue whetstone from under his arm and asked whether he would have it burnished white or blue Do with it as it seems good to thee or as thou wouldst if it were thine own Then Kay polished one half of the blade and put it in his hand Will this please thee asked he I would rather than all that is in my dominions that the whole of it were like this It is a marvel to me that such a man as thou should be without a companion O noble sir I have a companion albeit he is not skilled in this art Who may he be Let the porter go forth and I will tell him whereby he may know him The head of his lance will leave its shaft and draw blood from the wind and will descend upon its shaft again Then the gate was opened and Bedwyr entered And Kay said Bedwyr is very skilful though he knows not this art And there was much discourse among those who were without because that Kay and Bedwyr had gone in And a young man who was with them the only son of the herdsman got in also and he contrived to admit all the rest but they kept themselves concealed The sword was now polished and Kay gave it unto the hand of Gwernach the Giant to see if he were pleased with his work And the giant said The work is good I am content therewith Said Kay It is thy scabbard that hath rusted thy sword give it to me that I may take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones And he took the scabbard from him and the sword in the other hand And he came and stood over against the giant as if he would have put the sword into the scabbard and with it he struck at the head of the giant and cut off his head at one blow Then they despoiled the castle and took from it what goods and jewels they would And they returned to Arthur s court bearing with them the sword of Gwernach the Giant And when they told Arthur how they had sped Arthur said It is a good beginning Then they took counsel and said Which of these marvels will it be best for us to seek next It will be best said one to seek Mabon the son of Modron and he will not be found unless we first find Eidoel the son of Aer his kinsman Then Arthur rose up and the warriors of the island of Britain with him to seek for Eidoel and they proceeded until they came to the castle of Glivi where Eidoel was imprisoned Glivi stood on the summit of his castle and he said Arthur what requirest thou of me since nothing remains to me in this fortress and I have neither joy nor pleasure in it neither wheat nor oats Seek not therefore to do me harm Said Arthur Not to injure thee came I hither but to seek for the prisoner that is with thee I will give thee my prisoner though I had not thought to give him up to any one and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid His followers said unto Arthur Lord go thou home thou canst not proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these Then said Arthur It were well for thee Gurhyr Gwalstat to go upon this quest for thou knowest all languages and art familiar with those of the birds and the beasts Thou Eidoel oughtest likewise to go with thy men in search of thy cousin And as for you Kay and Bedwyr I have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of that ye will achieve it Achieve ye this adventure for me They went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri And Gurhyr adjured her saying Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall And the Ousel answered When I first came here there was a smith s anvil in this place and I was then a young bird and from that time no work has been done upon it save the pecking of my beak every evening and now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof yet during all that time I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire Nevertheless I will do that which it is fitting that I should for an embassy from Arthur There is a race of animals who were formed before me and I will be your guide to them So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre Stag of Redynvre behold we are come to thee an embassy from Arthur for we have not heard of any animal older than thou Say knowest thou aught of Mabon the son of Modron who was taken from his mother when three nights old The Stag said When first I came hither there was a plain all around me without any trees save one oak sapling which grew up to be an oak with an hundred branches and that oak has since perished so that now nothing remains of it but the withered stump and from that day to this I have been here yet have I never heard of the man for whom you inquire Nevertheless being an embassy from Arthur I will be your guide to the place where there is an animal which was formed before I was and the oldest animal in the world and the one that has travelled most the Eagle of Gwern Abwy Gurhyr said Eagle of Gwern Abwy we have come to thee an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron who was taken from his mother when he was three nights old The Eagle said I have been here for a great space of time and when I first came hither there was a rock here from the top of which I pecked at the stars every evening and it has crumbled away and now it is not so much as a span high All that time I have been here and I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire except once when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw And when I came there I struck my talons into a salmon thinking he would serve me as food for a long time But he drew me into the water and I was scarcely able to escape from him After that I made peace with him And I drew fifty fish spears out of his back and relieved him Unless he know something of him whom you seek I cannot tell who may However I will guide you to the place where he is So they went thither and the Eagle said Salmon of Llyn Llyw I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron who was taken away at three nights old from his mother As much as I know I will tell thee With every tide I go along the river upward until I come near to the walls of Gloucester and there have I found such wrong as I never found elsewhere and to the end that ye may give credence thereto let one of you go thither upon each of my two shoulders So Kay and Gurhyr Gwalstat went upon the two shoulders of the Salmon and they proceeded until they came unto the wall of the prison and they heard a great wailing and lamenting from the dungeon Said Gurhyr Who is it that laments in this house of stone Alas it is Mabon the son of Modron who is here imprisoned and no imprisonment was ever so grievous as mine Hast thou hope of being released for gold or for silver or for any gifts of wealth or through battle and fighting By fighting will what ever I may gain be obtained Then they went thence and returned to Arthur and they told him where Mabon the son of Modron was imprisoned And Arthur summoned the warriors of the island and they journeyed as far as Gloucester to the place where Mabon was in prison Kay and Bedwyr went upon the shoulders of the fish whilst the warriors of Arthur attacked the castle And Kay broke through the wall into the dungeon and brought away the prisoner upon his back whilst the fight was going on between the warriors And Arthur returned home and Mabon with him at liberty On a certain day as Gurhyr Gwalstat was walking over a mountain he heard a wailing and a grievous cry And when he heard it he sprang forward and went towards it And when he came there he saw a fire burning among the turf and an ant hill nearly surrounded with the fire And he drew his sword and smote off the ant hill close to the earth so that it escaped being burned in the fire And the ants said to him Receive from us the blessing of Heaven and that which no man can give we give thee Then they fetched the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspadaden Penkawr had required of Kilwich and they brought the full measure without lacking any except one flax seed and that the lame pismire brought in before night Then said Arthur Which of the marvels will it be best for us to seek next It will be best to seek for the two cubs of the wolf Gast Rhymhi Is it known said Arthur where she is She is in Aber Cleddyf said one Then Arthur went to the house of Tringad in Aber Cleddyf and he inquired of him whether he had heard of her there She has often slain my herds and she is there below in a cave in Aber Cleddyf Ther Arthur went in his ship Prydwen by sea and the others went by land to hunt her And they surrounded her and her two cubs and took them and carried them away As Kay and Bedwyr sat on a beacon cairn on the summit of Plinlimmon in the highest wind that ever was they looked around them and saw a great smoke afar off Then said Kay By the hand of my friend yonder is the fire of a robber Then they hastened towards the smoke and they came so near to it that they could see Dillus Varwawc scorching a wild boar Behold yonder is the greatest robber that ever fled from Arthur said Bedwyr to Kay Dost thou know him I do know him answered Kay he is Dillus Varwarc and no leash in the world will be able to hold the cubs of Gast Rhymi save a leash made from the beard of him thou seest yonder And even that will be useless unless his beard be plucked out alive with wooden tweezers for if dead it will be brittle What thinkest thou that we should do concerning this said Bedwyr Let us suffer him said Kay to eat as much as he will of the meat and after that he will fall asleep And during that time they employed themselves in making the wooden tweezers And when Kay knew certainly that he was asleep he made a pit under his feet and he struck him a violent blow and squeezed him into the pit And there they twitched out his beard completely with the wooden tweezers and after that they slew him altogether And from thence they went and took the leash made of Dillus Varwawc s beard and they gave it into Arthur s hand Thus they got all the marvels that Yspadaden Penkawr had required of Kilwich and they set forward and took the marvels to his court And Kilwich said to Yspadaden Penkawr Is thy daughter mine now She is thine said he but therefore needest thou not thank me but Arthur who hath accomplished this for thee Then Goreu the son of Custennin the herdsman whose brothers Yspadaden Penkawr had slain seized him by the hair of his head and dragged him after him to the keep and cut off his head and placed it on a stake on the citadel Then they took possession of his castle and of his treasures And that night Olwen became Kilwich s bride and she continued to be his wife as long as she lived CHAPTER XIII TALIESIN Gwyddno Garanhir was sovereign of Gwaelod a territory bordering on the sea 
976-172189-0000	train-other-500	And he possessed a weir upon the strand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth near to his own castle and the value of an hundred pounds was taken in that weir every May eve And Gwyddno
976-172189-0001	train-other-500	had an only son named Elphin the most hapless of youths and the most needy And it grieved his father sore for he thought that he was born in an evil hour By the advice of his council
none	none	 his father had granted him the drawing of the weir that year 
976-172189-0002	train-other-500	to see if good luck would ever befall him and to give him something wherewith to begin the world And this was on the twenty ninth of April The next day when Elphin went to look there was nothing in the weir
976-172189-0003	train-other-500	but a leathern bag upon a pole of the weir Then said the weir ward unto Elphin All thy ill luck aforetime was nothing to this and now thou hast destroyed the virtues of the weir
976-172189-0004	train-other-500	which always yielded the value of an hundred pounds every May eve and to night there is nothing but this leathern skin within it How now said Elphin there may be therein the value of a hundred pounds Well
none	none	 they took up the leathern bag and he who opened it saw the forehead of an infant the fairest that ever was seen and he said Behold a radiant brow In the Welsh language taliesin 
976-172189-0005	train-other-500	Taliesin be he called said Elphin And he lifted the bag in his arms and lamenting his bad luck placed the boy sorrowfully behind him And he made his horse amble gently that before had been trotting
976-172189-0006	train-other-500	and he carried him as softly as if he had been sitting in the easiest chair in the world And presently the boy made a Consolation and praise to Elphin and the Consolation was as you may here see Fair Elphin
976-172189-0007	train-other-500	cease to lament Never in Gwyddno s weir Was there such good luck as this night Being sad will not avail Better to trust in God than to forbode ill Weak and small as I am On the foaming beach of the ocean
none	none	 In the day of trouble I shall be 
976-172189-0008	train-other-500	Of more service to thee than three hundred salmon This was the first poem that Taliesin ever sung being to console Elphin in his grief for that the produce of the weir was lost
976-172189-0009	train-other-500	and what was worse that all the world would consider that it was through his fault and ill luck Then Elphin asked him what he was whether man or spirit And he sung thus
976-172189-0010	train-other-500	I have been formed a comely person Although I am but little I am highly gifted Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown And on a boundless sea I was sent adrift From seas and from mountains
976-172189-0011	train-other-500	God brings wealth to the fortunate man Then came Elphin to the house of Gwyddno his father and Taliesin with him Gwyddno asked him
none	none	 if he had had a good haul at the weir 
976-172189-0012	train-other-500	and he told him that he had got that which was better than fish What was that said Gwyddno A bard said Elphin Then said Gwyddno Alas what will he profit thee And Taliesin himself replied and said
976-172189-0013	train-other-500	He will profit him more than the weir ever profited thee Asked Gwyddno Art thou able to speak and thou so little And Taliesin answered him I am better able to speak than thou to question me
976-172189-0014	train-other-500	Let me hear what thou canst say quoth Gwyddno Then Taliesin sang Three times have I been born I know by meditation All the sciences of the world are collected in my breast For I know what has been
976-172189-0015	train-other-500	and what hereafter will occur Elphin gave his haul to his wife and she nursed him tenderly and lovingly Thenceforward Elphin increased in riches more and more day after day and in love and favor with the king
976-172189-0016	train-other-500	and there abode Taliesin until he was thirteen years old when Elphin son of Gwyddno went by a Christmas invitation to his uncle Maelgan Gwynedd who held open court at Christmas tide in the castle of Dyganwy
976-172189-0017	train-other-500	for all the number of his lords of both degrees both spiritual and temporal with a vast and thronged host of knights and squires And one arose and said Is there in the whole world a king so great as Maelgan
976-172189-0018	train-other-500	or one on whom Heaven has bestowed so many gifts as upon him form and beauty and meekness and strength besides all the powers of the soul And together with these they said that Heaven had given one gift that exceeded all the others
none	none	 which was the beauty and grace and wisdom 
976-172189-0019	train-other-500	and modesty of his queen whose virtues surpassed those of all the ladies and noble maidens throughout the whole kingdom
none	none	 And with this they put questions one to another 
976-172189-0020	train-other-500	Who had braver men Who had fairer or swifter horses or greyhounds Who had more skilful or wiser bards than Maelgan
none	none	 When they had all made an end of their praising the king and his gifts it befell that Elphin spoke on this wise Of a truth none but a king may vie with a king but were he not a king I would say that my wife was as virtuous as any lady in the kingdom and also that I have a bard who is more skilful than all the king s bards In a short space some of his fellows told the king all the boastings of Elphin and the king ordered him to be thrown into a strong prison 
976-172189-0021	train-other-500	until he might show the truth as to the virtues of his wife and the wisdom of his bard Now when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle with a thick chain about his feet
976-172189-0022	train-other-500	it is said that it was a silver chain because he was of royal blood the king as the story relates
none	none	 sent his son Rhun 
976-172189-0023	train-other-500	to inquire into the demeanor of Elphin s wife
none	none	 Now Rhun was the most graceless man in the world and there was neither wife nor maiden with whom he held converse but was evil spoken of While Rhun went in haste towards Elphin s dwelling 
976-172189-0024	train-other-500	being fully minded to bring disgrace upon his wife Taliesin told his mistress how that the king had placed his master in durance in prison and how that Rhun was coming in haste to strive to bring disgrace upon her
976-172189-0025	train-other-500	Wherefore he caused his mistress
none	none	 to array one of the maids of her kitchen 
976-172189-0026	train-other-500	in her apparel which the noble lady gladly did and she loaded her hands with the best rings that she and her husband possessed In this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the maiden to sit at the board in her room at supper
976-172189-0027	train-other-500	and he made her to seem as her mistress and the mistress to seem as the maid And when they were in due time seated at their supper in the manner that has been said
none	none	 Rhun suddenly arrived at Elphin s dwelling 
976-172189-0028	train-other-500	and was received with joy for the servants knew him and they brought him to the room of their mistress in the semblance of whom the maid rose up from supper and welcomed him gladly And afterwards she sat down to supper again and Rhun with her
none	none	 Then Rhun began jesting with the maid 
976-172189-0029	train-other-500	who still kept the semblance of her mistress And verily this story shows that the maiden became so intoxicated that she fell asleep and the story relates that it was a powder that Rhun put into the drink that made her sleep so soundly
976-172189-0030	train-other-500	that she never felt it when he cut off from her hand her little finger whereon was the signet ring of Elphin which he had sent to his wife as a token a short time before
none	none	 And Rhun returned to the king with the finger 
976-172189-0031	train-other-500	and the ring as a proof
none	none	 to show that he had cut it off from her hand 
976-172189-0032	train-other-500	without her awaking from her sleep of intemperance The king rejoiced greatly at these tidings and he sent for his councillors to whom he told the whole story from the beginning And he caused Elphin to be brought out of prison
976-172189-0033	train-other-500	and he chided him because of his boast And he spake on this wise Elphin be it known to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in the virtues of his wife further than he can see her
976-172189-0034	train-other-500	and that thou mayest be certain of thy wife s vileness behold her finger with thy signet ring upon it which was cut from her hand last night while she slept the sleep of intoxication Then thus spake Elphin
976-172189-0035	train-other-500	With thy leave mighty king I cannot deny my ring for it is known of many but verily I assert that the finger around which it is was never attached to the hand of my wife for in truth and certainty
none	none	 there are three notable things pertaining to it none of which ever belonged to any of my wife s fingers The first of the three is that it is certainly known to me that this ring would never remain upon her thumb whereas you can plainly see that it is hard to draw it over the joint of the little finger of the hand 
976-172189-0036	train-other-500	whence this was cut The second thing is that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I have known her without paring her nails before going to bed and you can see fully that the nail of this little finger has not been pared for a month
976-172189-0037	train-other-500	The third is truly that the hand whence this finger came was kneading rye dough within three days before the finger was cut therefrom and I can assure your highness that my wife has never kneaded rye dough since my wife she has been
none	none	 The king was mightily wroth with Elphin for so stoutly withstanding him respecting the goodness of his wife wherefore he ordered him to his prison a second time saying that he should not be loosed thence until he had proved the truth of his boast as well concerning the wisdom of his bard as the virtues of his wife In the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at Elphin s dwelling And Taliesin showed his mistress how that Elphin was in prison because of them 
976-172189-0038	train-other-500	but he bade her be glad for that he would go to Maelgan s court to free his master So he took leave of his mistress and came to the court of Maelgan
none	none	 who was going to sit in his hall and dine in his royal state as it was the custom in those days for kings and princes to do at every chief feast As soon as Taliesin entered the hall he placed himself in a quiet corner near the place where the bards and the minstrels were wont to come in doing their service and duty to the king as is the custom at the high festivals when the bounty is proclaimed So when the bards and the heralds came to cry largess and to proclaim the power of the king and his strength 
976-172189-0039	train-other-500	at the moment when they passed by the corner wherein he was crouching Taliesin pouted out his lips after them and played Blerwm blerwm with his finger upon his lips Neither took they much notice of him as they went by
none	none	 but proceeded forward till they came before the king unto whom they made their obeisance with their bodies as they were wont without speaking a single word but pouting out their lips and making mouths at the king playing Blerwm blerwm upon their lips with their fingers 
976-172189-0040	train-other-500	as they had seen the boy do This sight caused the king to wonder and to deem within himself that they were drunk with many liquors Wherefore he commanded one of his lords who served at the board to go to them
976-172189-0041	train-other-500	and desire them to collect their wits and to consider where they stood and what it was fitting for them to do And this lord did so gladly But they ceased not from their folly any more than before
976-172189-0042	train-other-500	Whereupon he sent to them a second time and a third desiring them to go forth from the hall At the last the king ordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief of them named Heinin Vardd and the squire took a broom
976-172189-0043	train-other-500	and struck him on the head so that he fell back in his seat Then he arose and went on his knees and besought leave of the king s grace to show that this their fault was not through want of knowledge neither through drunkenness
976-172189-0044	train-other-500	but by the influence of some spirit that was in the hall And he spoke on this wise O honorable king
none	none	 be it known to your grace 
976-172189-0045	train-other-500	that not from the strength of drink or of too much liquor are we dumb
none	none	 but through the influence of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder 
976-172189-0046	train-other-500	in the form of a child Forthwith the king commanded the squire to fetch him and he went to the nook where Taliesin sat and brought him before the king who asked him what he was and whence he came And he answered the king in verse
976-172189-0047	train-other-500	Primary chief bard am I to Elphin And my native country is the region of the summer stars I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
976-172189-0048	train-other-500	I was in India when Rome was built I have now come here to the remnant of Troia When the king and his nobles had heard the song they wondered much for they had never heard the like from a boy so young as he
976-172189-0049	train-other-500	And when the king knew that he was the bard of Elphin
none	none	 he bade Heinin 
976-172189-0050	train-other-500	his first and wisest bard to answer Taliesin and to strive with him But when he came he could do no other than play Blerwm on his lips and when he sent for the others of the four and twenty bards they all did likewise and could do no other
976-172189-0051	train-other-500	And Maelgan asked the boy Taliesin what was his errand and he answered him in song Elphin the son of Gwyddno Is in the land of Artro Secured by thirteen locks For praising his instructor
976-172189-0052	train-other-500	Therefore I Taliesin Chief of the bards of the west Will loosen Elphin Out of a golden fetter Then he sang to them a riddle Discover thou what is The strong creature from before the flood
976-172189-0053	train-other-500	Without flesh without bone Without vein without blood Without head without feet It will neither be older nor younger Than at the beginning Behold how the sea whitens When first it comes When it comes from the south

976-172189-0055	train-other-500	While he was thus singing his verse there arose a mighty storm of wind so that the king and all his nobles thought that the castle would fall upon their heads And the king caused them to fetch Elphin in haste from his dungeon and placed him before Taliesin
976-172189-0056	train-other-500	And it is said that immediately he sung a verse so that the chains opened from about his feet After that Taliesin brought Elphin s wife before them and showed that she had not one finger wanting And in this manner
none	none	 did he set his master free from prison and protect the innocence of his mistress and silence the bards so that not one of them dared to say a word Right glad was Elphin right glad was Taliesin HERO MYTHS OF THE BRITISH RACE BEOWULF Notable among the names of heroes of the British race is that of Beowulf which appeals to all English speaking people in a very special way since he is the one hero in whose story we may see the ideals of our English forefathers before they left their Continental home to cross to the islands of Britain Although this hero had distinguished himself by numerous feats of strength during his boyhood and early youth it was as the deliverer of Hrothgar king of Denmark from the monster Grendel that he first gained wide renown Grendel was half monster and half man and had his abode in the fen fastnesses in the vicinity of Hrothgar s residence Night after night he would steal into the king s great palace called Heorot and slay sometimes as many as thirty at one time of the knights sleeping there Beowulf put himself at the head of a selected band of warriors went against the monster and after a terrible fight slew it The following night Grendel s mother a fiend scarcely less terrible than her son carried off one of Hrothgar s boldest thanes Once more Beowulf went to the help of the Danish king followed the she monster to her lair at the bottom of a muddy lake in the midst of the swamp and with his good sword Hrunting and his own muscular arms broke the sea woman s neck Upon his return to his own country of the Geats loaded with honors bestowed upon him by Hrothgar Beowulf served the king of Geatland as the latter s most trusted counsellor and champion When after many years the king fell before an enemy the Geats unanimously chose Beowulf for their new king His fame as a warrior kept his country free from invasion and his wisdom as a statesman increased its prosperity and happiness In the fiftieth year of Beowulf s reign however a great terror fell upon the land in the way of a monstrous fire dragon which flew forth by night from its den in the rocks lighting up the blackness with its blazing breath and burning houses and homesteads men and cattle with the flames from its mouth When the news came to Beowulf that his people were suffering and dying and that no warrior dared to risk his life in an effort to deliver the country from this deadly devastation the aged king took up his shield and sword and went forth to his last fight At the entrance of the dragon s cave Beowulf raised his voice and shouted a furious defiance to the awesome guardian of the den Roaring hideously and napping his glowing wings together the dragon rushed forth and half flew half sprang on Beowulf Then began a fearful combat which ended in Beowulf s piercing the dragon s scaly armor and inflicting a mortal wound but alas in himself being given a gash in the neck by his opponent s poisoned fangs which resulted in his death As he lay stretched on the ground his head supported by Wiglaf an honored warrior who had helped in the fight with the dragon Beowulf roused himself to say as he grasped Wiglaf s hand Thou must now look to the needs of the nation Here dwell I no longer for Destiny calleth me Bid thou my warriors after my funeral pyre Build me a burial cairn high on the sea cliff s head So that the seafarers Beowulf s Barrow Henceforth shall name it they who drive far and wide Over the mighty flood their foamy keels Thou art the last of all the kindred of Wagmund Wyrd has swept all my kin all the brave chiefs away Now must I follow them These last words spoken the king of the Geats brave to seek danger and brave to look on death and Fate undaunted fell back dead According to his last desires his followers gathered wood and piled it on the cliff head Upon this funeral pyre was laid Beowulf s body and consumed to ashes Then upon the same cliff of Hronesness was erected a huge burial cairn wide spread and lofty to be known thereafter as Beowulf s Barrow CUCHULAIN CHAMPION OF IRELAND Among all the early literatures of Europe there are two which at exactly opposite corners of the continent display most strikingly similar characteristics These are the Greek and the Irish and the legend of the Irish champion Cuchulain which well illustrates the similarity of the literatures bears so close a resemblance to the story of Achilles as to win for this hero the title of the Irish Achilles Certainly in reckless courage power of inspiring dread sense of personal merit and frankness of speech the Irish hero is fully equal to the mighty Greek Cuchulain was the nephew of King Conor of Ulster son of his sister Dechtire and it is said that his father was no mortal man but the great god Lugh of the Long Hand Cuchulain was brought up by King Conor himself and even while he was still a boy his fame spread all over Ireland His warlike deeds were those of a proved warrior not of a child of nursery age and by the time Cuchulain was seventeen he was without peer among the champions of Ulster Upon Cuchulain s marriage to Emer daughter of Forgall the Wily a Druid of great power the couple took up their residence at Armagh the capital of Ulster under the protection of King Conor Here there was one chief Bricriu of the Bitter Tongue who like Thersites among the Grecian leaders delighted in making mischief Soon he had on foot plans for stirring up strife among the heroes of Ulster leaders among whom were the mighty Laegaire Conall Cearnach cousin of Cuchulain and Cuchulain himself Inviting the members of King Conor s court to dinner Bricriu arranged that a contest should arise over who should have the champion s portion and so successful was he that to avoid a bloody fight the three heroes mentioned decided to submit their claims to the championship of Ireland to King Ailill of Connaught Ailill put the heroes to an unexpected test Their dinner was served them in a separate room into which three magic beasts in the shape of monstrous cats were sent by the king When they saw them Laegire and Conall rose from their meal climbed among the rafters and stayed there all night Cuchulain waited until one cat attacked him and then drawing his sword struck the monster It showed no further sign of fight and at daybreak the magic beasts disappeared As Laegire and Conall claimed that this test was an unfair one Ailill sent the three rivals to Curoi of Kerry a just and wise man who set out to discover by wizardry and enchantments the best among the heroes In turn they stood watch outside Curoi s castle where Laegire and Conall were overcome by a huge giant who hurled spears of mighty oak trees and ended by throwing them over the wall into the courtyard Cuchulain alone withstood the giant whereupon he was attacked by other magic foes Among these was a dragon which flew on horrible wings from a neighboring lake and seemed ready to devour everything in its way Cuchulain sprang up giving his wonderful hero leap thrust his arm into the dragon s mouth and down its throat and tore out its heart After the monster fell dead he cut off its scaly head As even yet Cuchulain s opponents would not admit his championship they were all three directed to return to Armagh to await Curoi s judgment Here it happened that all the Ulster heroes were in the great hall one night except Cuchulain and his cousin Conall As they sat in order of rank a terrible stranger gigantic in stature hideous of aspect with ravening yellow eyes entered In his hand he bore an enormous axe with keen and shining edge Upon King Conor s inquiring his business there the stranger replied Behold my axe The man who will grasp it to day may cut my head off with it provided that I may in like manner cut off his head to morrow If you have no champion who dare face me I will say that Ulster has lost her courage and is dishonored At once Laegire accepted the challenge The giant laid his head on a block and at a blow the hero severed it from the body Thereupon the giant arose took the head and the axe and thus headless strode from the hall But the following night when he returned sound as ever to claim the fulfilment of Laegire s promise the latter s heart failed him and he did not come forward The stranger then jeered at the men of Ulster because their great champion durst not keep his agreement nor face the blow he should receive in return for the one he gave The men of Ulster were utterly ashamed but Conall Cearnach who was present that night made a new agreement with the stranger He gave a blow which beheaded the giant but again when the latter returned whole and sound on the following evening the champion was not to be found Now it was the turn of Cuchulain who as the others had done cut off the giant s head at one stroke The next day the members of Conor s court watched Cuchulain to see what he would do They would not have been surprised if he had failed like the others who now were present The champion however showed no signs of failing or retreat He sat sorrowfully in his place and with a sigh said to King Conor as they waited Do not leave this place till all is over Death is coming to me very surely but I must fulfil my agreement for I would rather die than break my word Towards the close of day the stranger strode into the hall exultant Where is Cuchulain he cried Here I am was the reply Ah poor boy your speech is sad to night and the fear of death lies heavy on you but at least you have redeemed your word and have not failed me The youth rose from his seat and went towards him as he stood with the great axe ready and knelt to receive the blow The hero of Ulster laid his head on the block but the giant was not satisfied Stretch out your neck better said he You are playing with me to torment me said Cuchulain Slay me now speedily for I did not keep you waiting last night However he stretched out his neck as ordered and the stranger raised his axe till it crashed upwards through the rafters of the hall like the crash of trees falling in a storm When the axe came down with a terrific sound all men looked fearfully at Cuchulain The descending axe had not even touched him it had come down with the blunt side on the ground and the youth knelt there unharmed Smiling at him and leaning on his axe stood no terrible and hideous stranger but Curoi of Kerry come to give his decision at last Rise up Cuchulain said Curoi There is none among all the heroes of Ulster to equal you in courage and loyalty and truth The Championship of the Heroes of Ireland is yours from this day forth and the Champion s Portion at all feasts and to your wife I adjudge the first place among all the women of Ulster Woe to him who dares to dispute this decision Thereupon Curoi vanished and the warriors gathered around Cuchulain and all with one voice acclaimed him the Champion of the Heroes of all Ireland a title which has clung to him until this day This is one of many stories told of the Irish champion whose deeds of bravery would fill many pages Cuchulain finally came to his end on the field of battle after a fight in which he displayed all his usual gallantry but in which unfair means were used to overcome him For Wales and for England during centuries Arthur has been the representative very gentle perfect knight In a similar way in England s sister isle Cuchulain stands ever for the highest ideals of the Irish Gaels HEREWARD THE WAKE In Hereward the Wake or Watchful is found one of those heroes whose date can be ascertained with a fair amount of exactness and yet in whose story occur mythological elements which seem to belong to all ages The folklore of primitive races is a great storehouse whence a people can choose tales and heroic deeds to glorify its own national hero careless that the same tales and deeds have done duty for other peoples and other heroes Hence it happens that Hereward the Saxon a patriot hero as real and actual as Nelson or George Washington whose deeds were recorded in prose and verse within forty years of his death was even then surrounded by a cloud of romance and mystery which hid in vagueness his family his marriage and even his death Briefly it may be stated that Hereward was a native of Lincolnshire and was in his prime about ten seventy In that year he joined a party of Danes who appeared in England attacked Peterborough and sacked the abbey there and afterward took refuge in the Isle of Ely Here he was besieged by William the Conqueror and was finally forced to yield to the Norman He thus came to stand for the defeated Saxon race and his name has been passed down as that of the darling hero of the Saxons For his splendid defence of Ely they forgave his final surrender to Duke William they attributed to him all the virtues supposed to be inherent in the free born and all the glorious valor on which the English prided themselves and lastly they surrounded his death with a halo of desperate fighting and made his last conflict as wonderful as that of Roland at Roncesvalles If Roland is the ideal of Norman feudal chivalry Hereward is equally the ideal of Anglo Saxon sturdy manliness and knighthood An account of one of Hereward s adventures as a youth will serve as illustration of the stories told of his prowess On an enforced visit to Cornwall he found that King Alef a petty British chief had betrothed his fair daughter to a terrible Pictish giant breaking off in order to do it her troth plight with Prince Sigtryg of Waterford son of a Danish king in Ireland Hereward ever chivalrous picked a quarrel with the giant and killed him in fair fight whereupon the king threw him into prison In the following night however the released princess arranged that the gallant Saxon should be freed and sent hot foot for her lover Prince Sigtryg After many adventures Hereward reached the prince who hastened to return to Cornwall with the young hero But to the grief of both they learned upon their arrival that the princess had just been betrothed to a wild Cornish hero Haco and the wedding feast was to be held that very day Sigtryg at once sent a troop of forty Danes to King Alef demanding the fulfilment of the troth plight between himself and his daughter and threatening vengeance if it were broken To this threat the king returned no answer and no Dane came back to tell of their reception Sigtryg would have waited till morning trusting in the honor of the king but Hereward disguised himself as a minstrel and obtained admission to the bridal feast where he soon won applause by his beautiful singing The bridegroom Haco in a rapture offered him any boon he liked to ask but he demanded only a cup of wine from the hands of the bride When she brought it to him he flung into the empty cup the betrothal ring the token she had sent to Sigtryg and said I thank thee lady and would reward thee for thy gentleness to a wandering minstrel I give back the cup richer than before by the kind thoughts of which it bears the token The princess looked at him gazed into the goblet and saw her ring then looking again she recognized her deliverer and knew that rescue was at hand While men feasted Hereward listened and talked and found out that the forty Danes were prisoners to be released on the morrow when Haco was sure of his bride but released useless and miserable since they would be turned adrift blinded Haco was taking his lovely bride back to his own land and Hereward saw that any rescue to be successful must be attempted on the march Returning to Sigtryg the young Saxon told all that he had learned and the Danes planned an ambush in the ravine where Haco had decided to blind and set free his captives The whole was carried out exactly as Hereward arranged it The Cornishmen with the Danish captives passed first without attack next came Haco riding grim and ferocious beside his silent bride he exulting in his success she looking eagerly for any signs of rescue As they passed Hereward sprang from his shelter crying Upon them Danes and set your brethren free and himself struck down Haco and smote off his head There was a short struggle but soon the rescued Danes were able to aid their deliverers and the Cornish guards were all slain the men of King Alef never very zealous for the cause of Haco fled and the Danes were left masters of the field Sigtryg had in the meantime seen to the safety of the princess and now placing her between himself and Hereward he escorted her to the ship which soon brought them to Waterford and a happy bridal The Prince and Princess of Waterford always recognized in Hereward their deliverer and best friend and in their gratitude wished him to dwell with them always but the hero s roving and daring temper forbade his settling down but rather urged him on to deeds of arms in other lands where he quickly won a renown second to none ROBIN HOOD Among the earliest heirlooms of the Anglo Saxon tongue are the songs and legends of Robin Hood and his merry outlaws which have charmed readers young and old for more than six hundred years These entertaining stories date back to the time when Chaucer wrote his Canterbury Tales when the minstrel and scribe stood in the place of the more prim and precise modern printed book The question of whether or not Robin Hood was a real person has been asked for many years just as a similar question has been asked about William Tell and others whom everyone would much rather accept on faith It cannot be answered by a brief yes or no even though learned men have pored over ancient records and have written books on the subject According to the general belief Robin was an outlaw in the reign of Richard I when in the depths of Sherwood Forest he entertained one hundred tall men all good archers with the spoil he took but he suffered no woman to be oppressed or otherwise molested poore men s goods he spared abundantlie relieving them with that which by theft he got from abbeys and houses of rich carles Consequently Robin was an immense favorite with the common people This popularity extended from the leader to all the members of his hardy band God save Robin Hood and all his good yeomanry is the ending of many old ballads The clever archer who could outshoot his fellows the brave yeoman inured to blows and the man who could be true to his friends through thick and thin were favorites for all time and they have been idealized in the persons of Robin Hood and his merry outlaws One of the best known stories of this picturesque figure of early English times is that given by Sir Walter Scott in Ivanhoe concerning the archery contest during the rule or misrule of Prince John in the absence of Richard from the kingdom Robin Hood under the assumed name of Locksley boldly presents himself at a royal tournament at Ashby as competitor for the prize in shooting with the long bow From the eight or ten archers who enter the contest the number finally narrows down to two Hubert a forester in the service of one of the king s nobles and Locksley or Robin Hood Hubert takes the first shot in the final trial of skill and lands his arrow within the inner ring of the target but not exactly in the centre You have not allowed for the wind Hubert said Locksley or that had been a better shot So saying and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim Locksley stepped to the appointed station and shot his arrow as carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark He was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bow string yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre than that of Hubert By the light of Heaven said Prince John to Hubert an thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee thou art worthy of the gallows Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions An your highness were to hang me he said a man can but do his best Nevertheless my grandsire drew a good bow The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation interrupted John shoot knave and shoot thy best or it shall be worse for thee Thus exhorted Hubert resumed his place and not neglecting the caution which he had received from his adversary he made the necessary allowance for a very light air of wind which had just risen and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target A Hubert a Hubert shouted the populace more interested in a known person than in a stranger In the clout in the clout a Hubert forever Thou canst not mend that shot Locksley said the Prince with an insulting smile I will notch his shaft for him however replied Locksley And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before it lighted right upon that of his competitor which it split to shivers The people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their usual clamor This must be the devil and no man of flesh and blood whispered the yeomen to each other such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in Britain And now said Locksley I will crave your Grace s permission to plant such a mark as is used in the North Country and welcome every brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he loves best Locksley thereupon sets up a willow wand six feet long and as thick as a man s thumb Hubert is forced to decline the honor of taking part in such a trial of archery skill but his rival easily splits the wand at a distance of three hundred feet and carries off the prize Even Prince John in admiration of Locksley s skill lost for an instant his dislike to his person These twenty nobles he said which with the bugle thou hast fairly won are thine own we will make them fifty if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our bodyguard and be near to our person For never did so strong a hand bend a bow or so true an eye direct a shaft Footnote Ivanhoe Vol one chap XIII Locksley however declares that it is impossible for him to enter the Prince s service generously shares his prize with the worthy Hubert and retires once more to his beloved haunts among the lights and shadows of the good greenwood GLOSSARY Abdalrahman
