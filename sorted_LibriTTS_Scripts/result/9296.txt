2526-156061-0000	train-other-500	The following History is given in a series of letters written Principally in a double yet separate correspondence Between two young ladies of virtue and honor bearing an inviolable friendship for each other
none	none	 and writing not merely for amusement but upon the most interesting subjects in which every private family more or less may find itself concerned 
2526-156061-0001	train-other-500	and Between two gentlemen of free lives one of them glorying in his talents for stratagem and invention and communicating to the other in confidence all the secret purposes of an intriguing head and resolute heart
2526-156061-0002	train-other-500	But here it will be proper to observe
none	none	 for the sake of such as may apprehend hurt to the morals of youth from the more freely written letters that the gentlemen though professed libertines as to the female sex 
2526-156061-0003	train-other-500	and making it one of their wicked maxims to keep no faith with any of the individuals of it who are thrown into their power are not however either infidels or scoffers nor yet such as think themselves
2526-156061-0004	train-other-500	freed from the observance of those other moral duties which bind man to man On the contrary
none	none	 it will be found in the progress of the work 
2526-156061-0005	train-other-500	that they very often make such reflections upon each other and each upon himself and his own actions as reasonable beings must make who disbelieve not a future state of rewards and punishments and who one day propose to reform
none	none	 one of them actually reforming and by that means giving an opportunity to censure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other And yet that other although in unbosoming himself to a select friend he discover wickedness enough to entitle him to general detestation 
2526-156061-0006	train-other-500	preserves a decency as well in his images as in his language
none	none	 which is not always to be found in the works of some of the most celebrated modern 
2526-156061-0007	train-other-500	writers whose subjects and characters have less warranted the liberties they have taken In the letters of the two young ladies it is presumed
2526-156061-0008	train-other-500	will be found not only the highest exercise of a reasonable and practicable friendship between minds endowed with the noblest principles of virtue and religion but occasionally interspersed such delicacy of sentiments particularly with regard to the other sex
2526-156061-0009	train-other-500	such instances of impartiality each freely as a fundamental principle of their friendship blaming praising
none	none	 and setting right the other as are strongly to be recommended to the observation of the younger part more specially of female readers The principle of these two young ladies is proposed as an exemplar to her sex Nor is it any objection to her being so 
2526-156061-0010	train-other-500	that she is not in all respects a perfect character It was not only natural but it was necessary that she should have some faults were it only to show the reader how laudably she could mistrust and blame herself
2526-156061-0011	train-other-500	and carry to her own heart divested of self partiality the censure which arose from her own convictions and that even to the acquittal of those because revered characters whom no one else would acquit
none	none	 and to whose much greater faults 
2526-156061-0012	train-other-500	her errors were owing and not to a weak or reproachable heart As far as it is consistent with human frailty and as far as she could be perfect
none	none	 considering the people she had to deal with 
2526-156061-0013	train-other-500	and those with whom she was inseparably connected she is perfect To have been impeccable must have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a purified state to do
none	none	 and carried our idea of her 
2526-156061-0014	train-other-500	from woman to angel As such is she often esteemed by the man whose heart was so corrupt that he could hardly believe human nature capable of the purity which on every trial or temptation
none	none	 shone out in her s sic Besides the four principal person several others are introduced whose letters are characteristic and it is presumed that there will be found in some of them but more especially in those of the chief character among the men and the second character among the women 
2526-156061-0015	train-other-500	such strokes of gayety fancy and humour as will entertain and divert and at the same time both warn and instruct All the letters are written while the hearts of the writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in their subjects
2526-156061-0016	train-other-500	the events at the time generally dubious so that they abound not only in critical situations but with what may be called instantaneous descriptions and reflections
2526-156061-0017	train-other-500	proper to be brought home to the breast of the youthful reader as also with affecting conversations many of them written in the dialogue or dramatic way Much more lively and affecting
none	none	 says one of the principal character 
2526-156061-0018	train-other-500	must be the style of those who write in the height of a present distress the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty the events then hidden in the womb of fate than the dry narrative
none	none	 unanimated style of a person 
2526-156061-0019	train-other-500	relating difficulties and danger surmounted can be the relater perfectly at ease and if himself unmoved by his own story not likely greatly to affect the reader
2526-156061-0020	train-other-500	What will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following work is to warn the inconsiderate and thoughtless of the one sex
none	none	 against the base arts and designs of specious contrivers of the other to caution parents against the undue exercise of their natural authority over their children in the great article of marriage to warn children 
2526-156061-0021	train-other-500	against preferring a man of pleasure to a man of probity upon that dangerous but too commonly received notion
none	none	 that a reformed rake makes the best husband 
2526-156061-0022	train-other-500	but above all to investigate the highest and most important doctrines not only of morality but of christianity by showing them thrown into action in the conduct of the worthy characters while the unworthy
none	none	 who set those doctrines at defiance 
2526-156061-0023	train-other-500	are condignly and as may be said consequentially punished From what has been said considerate readers will not enter upon the perusal of the piece before them
none	none	 as if it were designed only to divert and amuse It will probably be thought tedious to all such as dip into it 
2526-156061-0024	train-other-500	expecting a light novel or transitory romance and look upon story in it interesting as that is generally allowed to be as its sole end rather than as a vehicle to the instruction
2526-156061-0025	train-other-500	Different persons as might be expected have been of different opinions
none	none	 in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular situations 
2526-156061-0026	train-other-500	and several worthy persons
none	none	 have objected to the general catastrophe and other parts of the history 
2526-156061-0027	train-other-500	Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of Postscript at the conclusion of the History
none	none	 for this work being addressed to the public as a history of life and manners 
2526-156061-0028	train-other-500	those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of an example ought to be as unobjectionable as is consistent with the design of the whole and with human nature

Farther insults from her sister Her aunt s fruitless pleas in Solmes s favour THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE LETTER I MISS ANNA HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE JAN ten I am extremely concerned my dearest friend for the disturbance that have happened in your family I know how it must hurt you to become the subject of the public talk and yet upon an occasion so generally known it is impossible but that whatever relates to a young lady whose distinguished merits have made her the public care should engage every body s attention I long to have the particulars from yourself and of the usage I am told you receive upon an accident you could not help and in which as far as I can learn the sufferer was the aggressor mister Diggs the surgeon whom I sent for at the first hearing of the rencounter to inquire for your sake how your brother was told me that there was no danger from the wound if there were none from the fever which it seems has been increased by the perturbation of his spirits mister Wyerley drank tea with us yesterday and though he is far from being partial to mister Lovelace as it may well be supposed yet both he and mister Symmes blame your family for the treatment they gave him when he went in person to inquire after your brother s health and to express his concern for what had happened They say that mister Lovelace could not avoid drawing his sword and that either your brother s unskilfulness or passion left him from the very first pass entirely in his power This I am told was what mister Lovelace said upon it retreating as he spoke Have a care mister Harlowe your violence puts you out of your defence You give me too much advantage For your sister s sake I will pass by every thing if But this the more provoked his rashness to lay himself open to the advantage of his adversary who after a slight wound given him in the arm took away his sword There are people who love not your brother because of his natural imperiousness and fierce and uncontroulable temper these say that the young gentleman s passion was abated on seeing his blood gush plentifully down his arm and that he received the generous offices of his adversary who helped him off with his coat and waistcoat and bound up his arm till the surgeon could come with such patience as was far from making a visit afterwards from that adversary to inquire after his health appear either insulting or improper Be this as it may every body pities you So steady so uniform in your conduct so desirous as you always said of sliding through life to the end of it unnoted and as I may add not wishing to be observed even for your silent benevolence sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness which attends it Rather useful than glaring your deserved motto though now to your regret pushed into blaze as I may say and yet blamed at home for the faults of others how must such a virtue suffer on every hand yet it must be allowed that your present trial is but proportioned to your prudence As all your friends without doors are apprehensive that some other unhappy event may result from so violent a contention in which it seems the families on both sides are now engaged I must desire you to enable me on the authority of your own information to do you occasional justice My mother and all of us like the rest of the world talk of nobody but you on this occasion and of the consequences which may follow from the resentments of a man of mister Lovelace s spirit who as he gives out has been treated with high indignity by your uncles My mother will have it that you cannot now with any decency either see him or correspond with him She is a good deal prepossessed by your uncle Antony who occasionally calls upon us as you know and on this rencounter has represented to her the crime which it would be in a sister to encourage a man who is to wade into her favour this was his expression through the blood of her brother Write to me therefore my dear the whole of your story from the time that mister Lovelace was first introduced into your family and particularly an account of all that passed between him and your sister about which there are different reports some people scrupling not to insinuate that the younger sister has stolen a lover from the elder and pray write in so full a manner as may satisfy those who know not so much of your affairs as I do If anything unhappy should fall out from the violence of such spirits as you have to deal with your account of all things previous to it will be your best justification You see what you draw upon yourself by excelling all your sex Every individual of it who knows you or has heard of you seems to think you answerable to her for your conduct in points so very delicate and concerning Every eye in short is upon you with the expectation of an example I wish to heaven you were at liberty to pursue your own methods all would then I dare say be easy and honourably ended But I dread your directors and directresses for your mother admirably well qualified as she is to lead must submit to be led Your sister and brother will certainly put you out of your course But this is a point you will not permit me to expatiate upon pardon me therefore and I have done Yet why should I say pardon me when your concerns are my concerns when your honour is my honour when I love you as never woman loved another and when you have allowed of that concern and of that love and have for years which in persons so young may be called many ranked in the first class of your friends Your ever grateful and affectionate ANNA HOWE Will you oblige me with a copy of the preamble to the clauses in your grandfather s will in your favour and allow me to send it to my aunt Harman She is very desirous to see it Yet your character has so charmed her that though a stranger to you personally she assents to the preference given you in that will before she knows the testator s reasons for giving you that preference LETTER

none	none	 JAN thirteen How you oppress me my dearest friend with your politeness I cannot doubt your sincerity but you should take care that you give me not reason from your kind partiality to call in question your judgment You do not distinguish that I take many admirable hints from you and have the art to pass them upon you for my own for in all you do in all you say nay in your very looks so animated you give lessons to one who loves you and observes you as I love you and observe you without knowing that you do So pray my dear be more sparing of your praise for the future lest after this confession we should suspect that you secretly intend to praise yourself while you would be thought only to commend another Our family has indeed been strangely discomposed Discomposed It has been in tumults ever since the unhappy transaction and I have borne all the blame yet should have had too much concern from myself had I been more justly spared by every one else For whether it be owing to a faulty impatience having been too indulgently treated to be inured to blame or to the regret I have to hear those censured on my account whom it is my duty to vindicate I have sometimes wished that it had pleased God to have taken me in my last fever when I had every body s love and good opinion but oftener that I had never been distinguished by my grandfather as I was since that distinction has estranged from me my brother s and sister s affections at least has raised a jealousy with regard to the apprehended favour of my two uncles that now and then overshadows their love My brother being happily recovered of his fever and his wound in a hopeful way although he has not yet ventured abroad I will be as particular as you desire in the little history you demand of me But heaven forbid that any thing should ever happen which may require it to be produced for the purpose you mention I will begin as you command with mister Lovelace s address to my sister and be as brief as possible I will recite facts only and leave you to judge of the truth of the report raised that the younger sister has robbed the elder It was in pursuance of a conference between Lord M and my uncle Antony that mister Lovelace my father and mother not forbidding paid his respect to my sister Arabella My brother was then in Scotland busying himself in viewing the condition of the considerable estate which was left him there by his generous godmother together with one as considerable in Yorkshire I was also absent at my Dairy house as it is called busied in the accounts relating to the estate which my grandfather had the goodness to devise to me and which once a year was left to my inspection although I have given the whole into my father s power Her grandfather in order to invite her to him as often as her other friends would spare her indulged her in erecting and fitting up a diary house in her own taste When finished it was so much admired for its elegant simplicity and convenience that the whole seat before of old time from its situation called The Grove was generally known by the name of The Dairy house Her grandfather in particular was fond of having it so called My sister made me a visit there the day after mister Lovelace had been introduced and seemed highly pleased with the gentleman His birth his fortune in possession a clear two thousandL a year as Lord M had assured my uncle presumptive heir to that nobleman s large estate his great expectations from Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrence who with his uncle interested themselves very warmly he being the last of his line to see him married So handsome a man O her beloved Clary for then she was ready to love me dearly from the overflowings of her good humour on his account He was but too handsome a man for her Were she but as amiable as somebody there would be a probability of holding his affections For he was wild she heard very wild very gay loved intrigue but he was young a man of sense would see his error could she but have patience with his faults if his faults were not cured by marriage Thus she ran on and then wanted me to see the charming man as she called him Again concerned that she was not handsome enough for him with a sad thing that the man should have the advantage of the woman in that particular But then stepping to the glass she complimented herself That she was very well that there were many women deemed passable who were inferior to herself that she was always thought comely and comeliness let her tell me having not so much to lose as beauty had would hold when that would evaporate or fly off nay for that matter and again she turned to the glass her features were not irregular her eyes not at all amiss And I remember they were more than usually brilliant at that time Nothing in short to be found fault with though nothing very engaging she doubted was there Clary Excuse me my dear I never was thus particular before no not to you Nor would I now have written thus freely of a sister but that she makes a merit to my brother of disowning that she ever liked him as I shall mention hereafter and then you will always have me give you minute descriptions nor suffer me to pass by the air and manner in which things are spoken that are to be taken notice of rightly observing that air and manner often express more than the accompanying words I congratulated her upon her prospects She received my compliments with a great deal of self complacency She liked the gentleman still more at his next visit and yet he made no particular address to her although an opportunity was given him for it This was wondered at as my uncle has introduced him into our family declaredly as a visitor to my sister But as we are ever ready to make excuses when in good humour with ourselves for the perhaps not unwilful slights of those whose approbation we wish to engage so my sister found out a reason much to mister Lovelace s advantage for his not improving the opportunity that was given him It was bashfulness truly in him Bashfulness in mister Lovelace my dear Indeed gay and lively as he is he has not the look of an impudent man But I fancy it is many many years ago since he was bashful Thus however could my sister make it out Upon her word she believed mister Lovelace deserved not the bad character he had as to women He was really to her thinking a modest man He would have spoken out she believed but once or twice as he seemed to intend to do so he was under so agreeable a confusion Such a profound respect he seemed to shew her A perfect reverence she thought she loved dearly that a man in courtship should shew a reverence to his mistress So indeed we all do I believe and with reason since if I may judge from what I have seen in many families there is little enough of it shewn afterwards And she told my aunt Hervey that she would be a little less upon the reserve next time he came She was not one of those flirts not she who would give pain to a person that deserved to be well treated and the more pain for the greatness of his value for her I wish she had not somebody whom I love in her eye In his third visit Bella governed herself by this kind and considerate principle so that according to her own account of the matter the man might have spoken out But he was still bashful he was not able to overcome this unseasonable reverence So this visit went off as the former But now she began to be dissatisfied with him She compared his general character with this his particular behaviour to her and having never been courted before owned herself puzzled how to deal with so odd a lover What did the man mean she wondered Had not her uncle brought him declaredly as a suitor to her It could not be bashfulness now she thought of it since he might have opened his mind to her uncle if he wanted courage to speak directly to her Not that she cared much for the man neither but it was right surely that a woman should be put out of doubt early as to a man s intentions in such a case as this from his own mouth But truly she had begun to think that he was more solicitous to cultivate her mamma s good opinion than hers Every body she owned admired her mother s conversation but he was mistaken if he thought respect to her mother only would do with her And then for his own sake surely he should put it into her power to be complaisant to him if he gave her reason to approve of him This distant behaviour she must take upon herself to say was the more extraordinary as he continued his visits and declared himself extremely desirous to cultivate a friendship with the whole family and as he could have no doubt about her sense if she might take upon her to join her own with the general opinion he having taken great notice of and admired many of her good things as they fell from her lips Reserves were painful she must needs say to open and free spirits like hers and yet she must tell my aunt to whom all this was directed that she should never forget what she owed to her sex and to herself were mister Lovelace as unexceptionable in his morals as in his figure and were he to urge his suit ever so warmly I was not of her council I was still absent And it was agreed upon between my aunt Hervey and her that she was to be quite solemn and shy in his next visit if there were not a peculiarity in his address to her But my sister it seems had not considered the matter well This was not the way as it proved to be taken for matters of mere omission with a man of mister Lovelace s penetration Nor with any man since if love has not taken root deep enough to cause it to shoot out into declaration if an opportunity be fairly given for it there is little room to expect that the blighting winds of anger or resentment will bring it forward Then my poor sister is not naturally good humoured This is too well known a truth for me to endeavor to conceal it especially from you She must therefore I doubt have appeared to great disadvantages when she aimed to be worse tempered than ordinary How they managed it in their next conversation I know not One would be tempted to think by the issue that mister Lovelace was ungenerous enough to seek the occasion given and to improve it Yet he thought fit to put the question too But she says it was not till by some means or other she knew not how he had wrought her up to such a pitch of displeasure with him that it was impossible for her to recover herself at the instant Nevertheless he re urged his question as expecting a definitive answer without waiting for the return of her temper or endeavouring to mollify her so that she was under a necessity of persisting in her denial yet gave him reason to think she did not dislike his address only the manner of it his court being rather made to her mother than to herself as if he was sure of her consent at any time See mister Lovelace s Letter No XXXI in which he briefly accounts for his conduct in this affair A good encouraging denial I must own as was the rest of her plea to wit A disinclination to change her state Exceedingly happy as she was she never could be happier And such like consenting negatives as I may call them and yet not intend a reflection upon my sister for what can any young creature in the like circumstances say when she is not sure but a too ready consent may subject her to the slights of a sex that generally values a blessing either more or less as it is obtained with difficulty or ease Miss Biddulph s answer to a copy of verse from a gentleman reproaching our sex as acting in disguise is not a bad one although you may perhaps think it too acknowledging for the female character Ungen rous Sex To scorn us if we re kind And yet upbraid us if we seem severe Do you t encourage us to tell our mind Yourselves put off disguise and be sincere You talk of coquetry Your own false hearts Compel our sex to act dissembling parts Here I am obliged to lay down my pen I will soon resume it LETTER III MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE JAN thirteen fourteen And thus as mister Lovelace thought fit to take it had he his answer from my sister It was with very great regret as he pretended I doubt the man is an hypocrite my dear that he acquiesced in it So much determinedness such a noble firmness in my sister that there was no hope of prevailing upon her to alter sentiments she had adopted on full consideration He sighed as Bella told us when he took his leave of her Profoundly sighed grasped her hand and kissed it with such an ardour Withdrew with such an air of solemn respect She could almost find it in her heart although he had vexed her to pity him A good intentional preparative to love this pity since at the time she little thought that he would not renew his offer He waited on my mother after he had taken leave of Bella and reported his ill success in so respectful a manner as well with regard to my sister as to the whole family and with so much concern that he was not accepted as a relation to it that it left upon them all my brother being then as I have said in Scotland impressions in his favour and a belief that this matter would certainly be brought on again But mister Lovelace going up directly to town where he staid a whole fortnight and meeting there with my uncle Antony to whom he regretted his niece s cruel resolution not to change her state it was seen that there was a total end of the affair My sister was not wanting to herself on this occasion She made a virtue of necessity and the man was quite another man with her A vain creature Too well knowing his advantages yet those not what she had conceived them to be Cool and warm by fits and starts an ague like lover A steady man a man of virtue a man of morals was worth a thousand of such gay flutterers Her sister Clary might think it worth her while perhaps to try to engage such a man she had patience she was mistress of persuasion and indeed to do the girl justice had something of a person But as for her she would not have a man of whose heart she could not be sure for one moment no not for the world and most sincerely glad was she that she had rejected him But when mister Lovelace returned into the country he thought fit to visit my father and mother hoping as he told them that however unhappy he had been in the rejection of the wished for alliance he might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friendship with a family which he should always respect And then unhappily as I may say was I at home and present It was immediately observed that his attention was fixed on me My sister as soon as he was gone in a spirit of bravery seemed desirous to promote his address should it be tendered My aunt Hervey was there and was pleased to say we should make the finest couple in England if my sister had no objection No indeed with a haughty toss was my sister s reply it would be strange if she had after the denial she had given him upon full deliberation My mother declared that her only dislike of his alliance with either daughter was on account of his reputed faulty morals My uncle Harlowe that his daughter Clary as he delighted to call me from childhood would reform him if any woman in the world could My uncle Antony gave his approbation in high terms but referred as my aunt had done to my sister She repeated her contempt of him and declared that were there not another man in England she would not have him She was ready on the contrary she could assure them to resign her pretensions under hand and seal if Miss Clary were taken with his tinsel and if every one else approved of his address to the girl My father indeed after a long silence being urged by my uncle Antony to speak his mind said that he had a letter from his son on his hearing of mister Lovelace s visits to his daughter Arabella which he had not shewn to any body but my mother that treaty being at an end when he received it that in this letter he expressed great dislike to an alliance with mister Lovelace on the score of his immoralities that he knew indeed there was an old grudge between them but that being desirous to prevent all occasions of disunion and animosity in his family he would suspend the declaration of his own mind till his son arrived and till he had heard his further objections that he was the more inclined to make his son this compliment as mister Lovelace s general character gave but too much ground for his son s dislike of him adding that he had hear so he supposed had every one that he was a very extravagant man that he had contracted debts in his travels and indeed he was pleased to say he had the air of a spendthrift These particulars I had partly from my aunt Hervey and partly from my sister for I was called out as soon as the subject was entered upon When I returned my uncle Antony asked me how I should like mister Lovelace Every body saw he was pleased to say that I had made a conquest I immediately answered that I did not like him at all he seemed to have too good an opinion both on his person and parts to have any regard to his wife let him marry whom he would My sister particularly was pleased with this answer and confirmed it to be just with a compliment to my judgment For it was hers But the very next day Lord M came to Harlowe Place I was then absent and in his nephew s name made a proposal in form declaring that it was the ambition of all his family to be related to ours and he hoped his kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister as he had on that of the elder In short mister Lovelace s visits were admitted as those of a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family but as to his address to me with a reservation as above on my father s part that he would determine nothing without his son My discretion as to the rest was confided in for still I had the same objections as to the man nor would I when we were better acquainted hear any thing but general talk from him giving him no opportunity of conversing with me in private He bore this with a resignation little expected from his natural temper which is generally reported to be quick and hasty unused it seems from childhood to check or controul A case too common in considerable families where there is an only son and his mother never had any other child But as I have heretofore told you I could perceive notwithstanding this resignation that he had so good an opinion of himself as not to doubt that his person and accomplishments would insensibly engage me And could that be once done he told my aunt Hervey he should hope from so steady a temper that his hold in my affections would be durable While my sister accounted for his patience in another manner which would perhaps have had more force if it had come from a person less prejudiced That the man was not fond of marrying at all that he might perhaps have half a score mistresses and that delay might be as convenient for his roving as for my well acted indifference That was her kind expression Whatever was his motive for a patience so generally believed to be out of his usual character and where the object of his address was supposed to be of fortune considerable enough to engage his warmest attention he certainly escaped many mortifications by it for while my father suspended his approbation till my brother s arrival mister Lovelace received from every one those civilities which were due to his birth and although we heard from time to time reports to his disadvantage with regard to morals yet could we not question him upon them without giving him greater advantages in his own opinion than the situation he was in with us would justify to prudence since it was much more likely that his address would not be allowed of than that it would And thus was he admitted to converse with our family almost upon his own terms for while my friends saw nothing in his behaviour but what was extremely respectful and observed in him no violent importunity they seemed to have taken a great liking to his conversation While I considered him only as a common guest when he came and thought myself no more concerned in his visits not at his entrance and departure than any other of the family But this indifference on my side was the means of procuring him one very great advantage since upon it was grounded that correspondence by letters which succeeded and which had it been to be begun when the family animosity broke out would never have been entered into on my part The occasion was this My uncle Hervey has a young gentleman intrusted to his care whom he has thoughts of sending abroad a year or two hence to make the Grand Tour as it is called and finding mister Lovelace could give a good account of every thing necessary for a young traveller to observe upon such an occasion he desired him to write down a description of the courts and countries he had visited and what was most worthy of curiosity in them He consented on condition that I would direct his subjects as he called it and as every one had heard his manner of writing commended and thought his narratives might be agreeable amusements in winter evenings and that he could have no opportunity particularly to address me directly in them since they were to be read in full assembly before they were given to the young gentleman I made the less scruple to write and to make observations and put questions for our further information Still the less perhaps as I love writing and those who do are fond you know of occasions to use the pen And then having ever one s consent and my uncle Hervey s desire that I would write I thought that if I had been the only scrupulous person it would have shewn a particularity that a vain man might construe to his advantage and which my sister would not fail to animadvert upon You have seen some of these letters and have been pleased with this account of persons places and things and we have both agreed that he was no common observer upon what he had seen My sister allowed that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and describing And my father who had been abroad in his youth said that his remarks were curious and shewed him to be a person of reading judgment and taste Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between him and me with general approbation while every one wondered at and was pleased with his patient veneration of me for so they called it However it was not doubted but he would soon be more importunate since his visits were more frequent and he acknowledged to my aunt Hervey a passion for me accompanied with an awe that he had never known before to which he attributed what he called his but seeming acquiescence with my father s pleasure and the distance I kept him at And yet my dear this may be his usual manner of behaviour to our sex for had not my sister at first all his reverence Mean time my father expecting his importunity kept in readiness the reports he had heard in his disfavour to charge them upon him then as so many objections to address And it was highly agreeable to me that he did so it would have been strange if it were not since the person who could reject mister Wyerley s address for the sake of his free opinions must have been inexcusable had she not rejected another s for his freer practices But I should own that in the letters he sent me upon the general subject he more than once inclosed a particular one declaring his passionate regards for me and complaining with fervour enough of my reserves But of these I took not the least notice for as I had not written to him at all but upon a subject so general I thought it was but right to let what he wrote upon one so particular pass off as if I had never seen it and the rather as I was not then at liberty from the approbation his letters met with to break off the correspondence unless I had assigned the true reason for doing so Besides with all his respectful assiduities it was easy to observe if it had not been his general character that his temper is naturally haughty and violent and I had seen too much of that untractable spirit in my brother to like it in one who hoped to be still more nearly related to me I had a little specimen of this temper of his upon the very occasion I have mentioned For after he had sent me a third particular letter with the general one he asked me the next time he came to Harlowe Place if I had not received such a one from him I told him I should never answer one so sent and that I had waited for such an occasion as he had now given me to tell him so I desired him therefore not to write again on the subject assuring him that if he did I would return both and never write another line to him You can t imagine how saucily the man looked as if in short he was disappointed that he had not made a more sensible impression upon me nor when he recollected himself as he did immediately what a visible struggle it cost him to change his haughty airs for more placid ones But I took no notice of either for I thought it best to convince him by the coolness and indifference with which I repulsed his forward hopes at the same time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or vanity that he was not considerable enough in my eyes to make me take over ready offence at what he said or at his haughty looks in other words that I had not value enough for him to treat him with peculiarity either by smiles or frowns Indeed he had cunning enough to give me undesignedly a piece of instruction which taught me this caution for he had said in conversation once That if a man could not make a woman in courtship own herself pleased with him it was as much and oftentimes more to his purpose to make her angry with him I must break off here but will continue the subject the very first opportunity Mean time I am Your most affectionate friend and servant CL HARLOWE LETTER IV MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE JAN fifteen Such my dear was the situation mister Lovelace and I were in when my brother arrived from Scotland The moment mister Lovelace s visits were mentioned to him he without either hesitation or apology expressed his disapprobation of them He found great flaws in his character and took the liberty to say in so many words that he wondered how it came into the heads of his uncles to encourage such a man for either of his sisters At the same time returning his thanks to my father for declining his consent till he arrived in such a manner I thought as a superior would do when he commended an inferior for having well performed his duty in his absence He justified his avowed inveteracy by common fame and by what he had known of him at college declaring that he had ever hated him ever should hate him and would never own him for a brother or me for a sister if I married him That early antipathy I have heard accounted for in this manner mister Lovelace was always noted for his vivacity and courage and no less it seems for the swift and surprising progress he made in all parts of literature for diligence in his studies in the hours of study he had hardly his equal This it seems was his general character at the university and it gained him many friends among the more learned while those who did not love him feared him by reason of the offence his vivacity made him too ready to give and of the courage he shewed in supporting the offence when given which procured him as many followers as he pleased among the mischievous sort No very amiable character you ll say upon the whole But my brother s temper was not more happy His native haughtiness could not bear a superiority so visible and whom we fear more than love we are not far from hating and having less command of his passions than the other he was evermore the subject of his perhaps indecent ridicule so that every body either from love or fear siding with his antagonist he had a most uneasy time of it while both continued in the same college It was the less wonder therefore that a young man who is not noted for the gentleness of his temper should resume an antipathy early begun and so deeply rooted He found my sister who waited but for the occasion ready to join him in his resentments against the man he hated She utterly disclaimed all manner of regard for him Never liked him at all His estate was certainly much incumbered it was impossible it should be otherwise so entirely devoted as he was to his pleasures He kept no house had no equipage Nobody pretended that he wanted pride the reason therefore was easy to be guessed at And then did she boast of and my brother praised her for refusing him and both joined on all occasions to depreciate him and not seldom made the occasions their displeasure against him causing every subject to run into this if it began not with it I was not solicitous to vindicate him when I was not joined in their reflection I told them I did not value him enough to make a difference in the family on his account and as he was supposed to have given much cause for their ill opinion of him I thought he ought to take the consequence of his own faults Now and then indeed when I observed that their vehemence carried them beyond all bounds of probability in their charges against him I thought it but justice to put in a word for him But this only subjected me to reproach as having a prepossession in his favour which I would not own So that when I could not change the subject I used to retire either to my music or to my closet Their behaviour to him when they could not help seeing him was very cold and disobliging but as yet not directly affrontive For they were in hopes of prevailing upon my father to forbid his visits But as there was nothing in his behaviour that might warrant such a treatment of a man of his birth and fortune they succeeded not And then they were very earnest with me to forbid them I asked what authority I had to take such a step in my father s house and when my behaviour to him was so distant that he seemed to be as much the guest of any other person of the family themselves excepted as mine In revenge they told me that it was cunning management between us and that we both understood one another better than we pretended to do And at last they gave such a loose to their passions all of a sudden as I may say that instead of withdrawing as they used to do when he came they threw themselves in his way purposely to affront him The reason of this their more openly shown animosity is given in Letter XIII mister Lovelace you may believe very ill brooked this but nevertheless contented himself to complain of it to me in high terms however telling me that but for my sake my brother s treatment of him was not to be borne I was sorry for the merit this gave him in his own opinion with me and the more as some of the affronts he received were too flagrant to be excused But I told him that I was determined not to fall out with my brother if I could help it whatever faults he had and since they could not see one another with temper should be glad that he would not throw himself in my brother s way and I was sure my brother would not seek him He was very much nettled at this answer But said he must bear his affronts if I would have it so He had been accused himself of violence in his temper but he hoped to shew on this occasion that he had a command of his passions which few young men so highly provoked would be able to shew and doubted not but it would be attributed to a proper motive by a person of my generosity and penetration My brother had just before with the approbation of my uncles employed a person related to a discharged bailiff or steward of Lord M who had had the management of some part of mister Lovelace s affairs from which he was also dismissed by him to inquire into his debts after his companions into his amours and the like My aunt Hervey in confidence gave me the following particulars of what the man had said of him That he was a generous landlord that he spared nothing for solid and lasting improvements upon his estate and that he looked into his own affairs and understood them that he had been very expensive when abroad and contracted a large debt for he made no secret of his affairs yet chose to limit himself to an annual sum and to decline equipage in order to avoid being obliged to his uncle and aunts from whom he might have what money he pleased but that he was very jealous of their controul had often quarrels with them and treated them so freely that they were all afraid of him However that his estate was never mortgaged as my brother had heard it was his credit was always high and the man believed he was by this time near upon if not quite clear of the world He was a sad gentleman he said as to women If his tenants had pretty daughters they chose to keep them out of his sight He believed he kept no particular mistress for he had heard newelty that was the man s word was every thing with him But for his uncle s and aunt s teazings the man fancied he would not think of marriage he was never known to be disguised with liquor but was a great plotter and a great writer That he lived a wild life in town by what he had heard had six or seven companions as bad as himself whom now and then he brought down with him and the country was always glad when they went up again He would have it that although passionate he was good humoured loved as well to take a jest as to give one and would rally himself upon occasion the freest of any man he ever knew This was his character from an enemy for as my aunt observed every thing the man said commendably of him came grudgingly with a must needs say to do him justice c while the contrary was delivered with a free good will And this character as a worse was expected though this was bad enough not answering the end of inquiring after it my brother and sister were more apprehensive than before that his address would be encouraged since the worst part of it was known or supposed when he was first introduced to my sister But with regard to myself I must observe in his disfavour that notwithstanding the merit he wanted to make with me for his patience upon my brother s ill treatment of him I owed him no compliments for trying to conciliate with him Not that I believe it would have signified any thing if he had made ever such court either to him or to my sister yet one might have expected from a man of his politeness and from his pretensions you know that he would have been willing to try Instead of which he shewed such a contempt both of my brother and my sister especially my brother as was construed into a defiance of them And for me to have hinted at an alteration in his behaviour to my brother was an advantage I knew he would have been proud of and which therefore I had no mind to give him But I doubted not that having so very little encouragement from any body his pride would soon take fire and he would of himself discontinue his visits or go to town where till he came acquainted with our family he used chiefly to reside And in this latter case he had no reason to expect that I would receive much less answer his Letters the occasions which had led me to receive any of his being by this time over But my brother s antipathy would not permit him to wait for such an event and after several excesses which mister Lovelace still returned with contempt and a haughtiness too much like that of the aggressor my brother took upon himself to fill up the door way once when he came as if to oppose his entrance And upon his asking for me demanded what his business was with his sister The other with a challenging air as my brother says told him he would answer a gentleman any question but he wished that mister James Harlowe who had of late given himself high airs would remember that he was not now at college Just then the good doctor Lewen who frequently honours me with a visit of conversation as he is pleased to call it and had parted with me in my own parlour came to the door and hearing the words interposed both having their hands upon their swords and telling mister Lovelace where I was he burst by my brother to come to me leaving him chafing he said like a hunted boar at bay This alarmed us all My father was pleased to hint to mister Lovelace that he wished he would discontinue his visits for the peace sake of the family And I by his command spoke a great deal plainer But mister Lovelace is a man not easily brought to give up his purpose especially in a point wherein he pretends his heart is so much engaged and no absolute prohibition having been given things went on for a little while as before for I saw plainly that to have denied myself to his visits which however I declined receiving as often as I could was to bring forward some desperate issue between the two since the offence so readily given on one side was brooked by the other only out of consideration to me And thus did my brother s rashness lay me under an obligation where I would least have owed it The intermediate proposals of mister Symmes and mister Mullins both in turn encouraged by my brother induced him to be more patient for a while as nobody thought me over forward in mister Lovelace s favour for he hoped that he should engage my father and uncles to approve of the one or the other in opposition to the man he hated But when he found that I had interest enough to disengage myself from the addresses of those gentlemen as I had before he went to Scotland and before mister Lovelace visited here of mister Wyerley s he then kept no measures and first set himself to upbraid me for supposed prepossession which he treated as if it were criminal and then to insult mister Lovelace in person at mister Edward Symmes s the brother of the other Symmes two miles off and no good doctor Lewen being there to interpose the unhappy rencounter followed My brother was disarmed as you have heard and on being brought home and giving us ground to suppose he was much worse hurt than he really was and a fever ensuing every one flamed out and all was laid at my door mister Lovelace for three days together sent twice each day to inquire after my brother s health and although he received rude and even shocking returns he thought fit on the fourth day to make in person the same inquiries and received still greater incivilities from my two uncles who happened to be both there My father also was held by force from going to him with his sword in his hand although he had the gout upon him I fainted away with terror seeing every one so violent and hearing mister Lovelace swear that he would not depart till he had made my uncles ask his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands a door being held fast locked between him and them My mother all the time was praying and struggling to with hold my father in the great parlour Meanwhile my sister who had treated mister Lovelace with virulence came in to me and insulted me as fast as I recovered But when mister Lovelace was told how ill I was he departed nevertheless vowing revenge He was ever a favourite with our domestics His bounty to them and having always something facetious to say to each had made them all of his party and on this occasion they privately blamed every body else and reported his calm and gentlemanly behaviour till the provocations given him ran very high in such favourable terms that those reports and my apprehensions of the consequence of this treatment induced me to read a letter he sent me that night and it being written in the most respectful terms offering to submit the whole to my decision and to govern himself entirely by my will to answer it some days after To this unhappy necessity was owing our renewed correspondence as I may call it yet I did not write till I had informed myself from mister Symmes s brother that he was really insulted into the act of drawing his sword by my brother s repeatedly threatening upon his excusing himself out of regard to me to brand me ir he did not and by all the inquiry I could make that he was again the sufferer from my uncles in a more violent manner than I have related The same circumstances were related to my father and other relations by mister Symmes but they had gone too far in making themselves parties to the quarrel either to retract or forgive and I was forbidden to correspond with him or to be seen a moment in his company One thing however I can say but that in confidence because my mother commanded me not to mention it That expressing her apprehension of the consequences of the indignities offered to mister Lovelace she told me she would leave it to my prudence to do all I could to prevent the impending mischief on one side I am obliged to break off But I believe I have written enough to answer very fully all that you have required of me It is not for a child to seek to clear her own character or to justify her actions at the expense of the most revered ones yet as I know that the account of all those further proceedings by which I may be affected will be interesting to so dear a friend who will communicate to others no more than what is fitting I will continue to write as I have opportunity as minutely as we are used to write to each other Indeed I have no delight as I have often told you equal to that which I take in conversing with you by letter when I cannot in person Mean time I cannot help saying that I am exceedingly concerned to find that I am become so much the public talk as you tell me I am Your kind your precautionary regard for my fame and the opportunity you have given me to tell my own story previous to any new accident which heaven avert is so like the warm friend I have ever found in my dear Miss Howe that with redoubled obligation you bind me to be Your ever grateful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE Copy of the requested Preamble to the clauses in her Grandfather s Will inclosed in the preceding Letter As the particular estate I have mentioned and described above is principally of my own raising as my three sons have been uncommonly prosperous and are very rich the eldest by means of the unexpected benefits he reaps from his new found mines the second by what has as unexpectedly fallen in to him on the deaths of several relations of his present wife the worthy daughter by both sides of very honourable families over and above the very large portion which he received with her in marriage my son Antony by his East India traffic and successful voyages as furthermore my grandson James will be sufficiently provided for by his grandmother Lovell s kindness to him who having no near relations hath assured me that she hath as well by deed of gift as by will left him both her Scottish and English estates for never was there a family more prosperous in all its branches blessed be God therefore and as my said son James will very probably make it up to my grand daughter Arabella to whom I intend no disrespect nor have reason for she is a very hopeful and dutiful child and as my sons John and Antony seem not inclined to a married life so that my son James is the only one who has children or is likely to have any For all these reasons and because my dearest and beloved grand daughter Clarissa hath been from her infancy a matchless young creature in her duty to me and admired by all who knew her as a very extraordinary child I must therefore take the pleasure of considering her as my own peculiar child and this without intending offence and I hope it will not be taken as any since my son James can bestow his favours accordingly and in greater proportion upon his son James and upon his daughter Arabella These I say are the reasons which move me to dispose of the above described estate in the precious child s favour who is the delight of my old age and I verily think has contributed by her amiable duty and kind and tender regards to prolong my life Wherefore it is my express will and commandment and I enjoin my said three sons John James and Antony and my grandson James and my grand daughter Arabella as they value my blessing and will regard my memory and would wish their own last wills and desires to be fulfilled by their survivors that they will not impugn or contest the following bequests and devises in favour of my said grand daughter Clarissa although they should not be strictly conformable to law or to the forms thereof nor suffer them to be controverted or disputed on any pretence whatsoever And in this confidence c c c LETTER V MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE JAN twenty I have been hindered from prosecuting my intention Neither nights nor mornings have been my own My mother has been very ill and would have no other nurse but me I have not stirred from her bedside for she kept her bed and two nights I had the honour of sharing it with her Her disorder was a very violet colic The contentions of these fierce these masculine spirits and the apprehension of mischiefs that may arise from the increasing animosity which all here have against mister Lovelace and his too well known resenting and intrepid character she cannot bear Then the foundations laid as she dreads for jealousy and heart burnings in her own family late so happy and so united afflict exceedingly a gentle and sensible mind which has from the beginning on all occasions sacrificed its own inward satisfaction to outward peace My brother and sister who used very often to jar are now so entirely one and are so much together caballing was the word that dropt from my mother s lips as if at unawares that she is very fearful of the consequences that may follow to my prejudice perhaps is her kind concern since she sees that they behave to me every hour with more and more shyness and reserve yet would she but exert that authority which the superiority of her fine talents gives her all these family feuds might perhaps be extinguished in their but yet beginnings especially as she may be assured that all fitting concessions shall be made by me not only as my brother and sister are my elders but for the sake of so excellent and so indulgent a mother For if I may say to you my dear what I would not to any other person living it is my opinion that had she been of a temper that would have borne less she would have had ten times less to bear than she has had No commendation you ll say of the generosity of those spirits which can turn to its own disquiet so much condescending goodness Upon my word I am sometimes tempted to think that we may make the world allow for and respect us as we please if we can but be sturdy in our wills and set out accordingly It is but being the less beloved for it that s all and if we have power to oblige those we have to do with it will not appear to us that we are Our flatterers will tell us any thing sooner than our faults or what they know we do not like to hear Were there not truth in this observation is it possible that my brother and sister could make their very failings their vehemences of such importance to all the family How will my son how will my nephew take this or that measure What will he say to it Let us consult him about it are references always previous to every resolution taken by his superiors whose will ought to be his Well may he expect to be treated with this deference by every other person when my father himself generally so absolute constantly pays it to him and the more since his godmother s bounty has given independence to a spirit that was before under too little restraint But whither may these reflections lead me I know you do not love any of us but my mother and me and being above all disguises make me sensible that you do not oftener than I wish Ought I then to add force to your dislikes of those whom I wish you to like of my father especially for he alas has some excuse for his impatience of contradiction He is not naturally an ill tempered man and in his person and air and in his conversation too when not under the torture of a gouty paroxysm every body distinguishes the gentleman born and educated Our sex perhaps must expect to bear a little uncourtliness shall I call it from the husband whom as the lover they let know the preference their hearts gave him to all other men Say what they will of generosity being a manly virtue but upon my word my dear I have ever yet observed that it is not to be met with in that sex one time in ten that it is to be found in ours But my father was soured by the cruel distemper I have named which seized him all at once in the very prime of life in so violent a manner as to take from the most active of minds as his was all power of activity and that in all appearance for life It imprisoned as I may say his lively spirits in himself and turned the edge of them against his own peace his extraordinary prosperity adding to his impatiency Those I believe who want the fewest earthly blessings most regret that they want any But my brother What excuse can be made for his haughty and morose temper He is really my dear I am sorry to have occasion to say it an ill temper d young man and treats my mother sometimes Indeed he is not dutiful But possessing every thing he has the vice of age mingled with the ambition of youth and enjoys nothing but his own haughtiness and ill temper I was going to say Yet again am I adding force to your dislikes of some of us Once my dear it was perhaps in your power to have moulded him as you pleased Could you have been my sister Then had I friend in a sister But no wonder that he does not love you now who could nip in the bud and that with a disdain let me say too much of kin to his haughtiness a passion that would not have wanted a fervour worthy of the object and which possibly would have made him worthy But no more of this I will prosecute my former intention in my next which I will sit down to as soon as breakfast is over dispatching this by the messenger whom you have so kindly sent to inquire after us on my silence Mean time I am Your most affectionate and obliged friend and servant CL HARLOWE LETTER VI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE PLACE JAN twenty 
2496-156067-0001	train-other-500	I will now resume my narrative of proceedings here My brother being in a good way although you may be sure that his resentments are rather heightened
2496-156067-0002	train-other-500	than abated by the galling disgrace he has received my friends my father and uncles however if not my brother and sister begin to think that I have been treated unkindly
2496-156067-0003	train-other-500	My mother been so good as to tell me this since I sent away my last Nevertheless I believe they all think that I receive letters from mister Lovelace
2496-156067-0004	train-other-500	But Lord M being inclined rather to support than to blame his nephew
none	none	 they seem to be so much afraid of mister Lovelace 
2496-156067-0005	train-other-500	that they do not put it to me
none	none	 whether I do or not 
2496-156067-0006	train-other-500	conniving on the contrary
none	none	 as it should seem 
2496-156067-0007	train-other-500	at the only method left to allay the vehemence of a spirit which they have so much provoked For he still insists upon satisfaction from my uncles and this possibly
2496-156067-0008	train-other-500	for he wants not art as the best way to be introduced again with some advantage into our family
none	none	 And indeed my aunt Hervey 
2496-156067-0009	train-other-500	has put it to my mother whether it were not best to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to his Yorkshire estate which he was intending to do before
none	none	 and to stay there till all is blown over 
2496-156067-0010	train-other-500	But this is very far from being his intention For he has already began to hint again that he shall never be easy or satisfied till I am married
2496-156067-0011	train-other-500	and finding neither mister Symmes nor mister Mullins will be accepted has proposed mister Wyerley once more
none	none	 on the score of his great passion for me This I have again rejected 
2496-156067-0012	train-other-500	and but yesterday he mentioned one who has applied to him by letter making high offers This is mister Solmes Rich Solmes you know they call him
2496-156067-0013	train-other-500	But this application has not met with the attention of one single soul
none	none	 If none of his schemes of getting me married take effect 
2496-156067-0014	train-other-500	he has thoughts I am told of proposing to me to go to Scotland that as the compliment is I may put his house there in such order as our own is in But this my mother intends to oppose for her own sake
2496-156067-0015	train-other-500	because having relieved her as she is pleased to say of the household cares for which my sister you know has no turn they must again devolve upon her if I go And if she did not oppose it
2496-156067-0016	train-other-500	I should for believe me I have no mind to be his housekeeper and I am sure were I to go with him I should be treated rather as a servant than a sister perhaps not the better because I am his sister
2496-156067-0017	train-other-500	And if mister Lovelace should follow me things might be worse than they are now But I have besought my mother who is apprehensive of mister Lovelace s visits
none	none	 and for fear of whom my uncles never stir out without arms 
2496-156067-0018	train-other-500	and armed servants my brother also being near well enough to go abroad to procure me permission to be your guest for a fortnight or so Will your mother think you my dear give me leave
2496-156067-0019	train-other-500	I dare not ask to go to my dairy house as my good grandfather would call it for I am now afraid of being thought to have a wish to enjoy that independence to which his will has entitled me and as matter are situated
none	none	 such a wish would be imputed to my regard to the man 
2496-156067-0020	train-other-500	to whom they have now so great an antipathy And indeed could I be as easy and happy here as I used to be I would defy that man and all his sex and never repent that I have given the power of my fortune
2496-156067-0021	train-other-500	into my father s hands Just now my mother has rejoiced me with the news that my requested permission is granted Every one thinks it best that I should go to you except my brother
none	none	 But he was told that he must not expect to rule in every thing I am to be sent for into the great parlour where are my two uncles and my aunt Hervey 
2496-156067-0022	train-other-500	and to be acquainted with this concession in form You know my dear that there is a
none	none	 good deal of solemnity among us But never was there a family more united in its different branches than ours Our uncles consider us as their own children and declare that it is for our sakes that they live single 
2496-156067-0023	train-other-500	So that they are advised with upon every article relating to us or that may affect us It is therefore the less wonder at a time when they understand that mister Lovelace is determined to pay
2496-156067-0024	train-other-500	us an amicable visit as he calls it but which I am sure cannot end amicably that they should both be consulted upon the permission I had desired to attend you
none	none	 I will acquaint you with what passed at the general leave given me to be your guest And yet I know that you will not love my brother the better for my communication But I am angry with him myself and cannot help it And besides it is proper to let you know the terms I go upon 
2496-156067-0025	train-other-500	and their motives for permitting me to go Clary said my mother as soon as I entered the great parlour your request to go to Miss Howe s for a few days has been taken into consideration and granted
2496-156067-0026	train-other-500	Much against my liking I assure you said my brother rudely interrupting her Son James said my father and knit his brows
none	none	 He was not daunted 
2496-156067-0027	train-other-500	His arm was in a sling He often has the mean art to look upon that when any thing is hinted that may be supposed to lead toward the least favour to
none	none	 or reconciliation 
2496-156067-0028	train-other-500	with mister Lovelace Let the girl then I am often the girl with him be prohibited seeing that vile libertine Nobody spoke
2496-156067-0029	train-other-500	Do you hear sister Clary taking their silence for approbation of what he had dictated you are not to receive visits
none	none	 from Lord M s nephew 
2496-156067-0030	train-other-500	Every one still remained silent Do you so understand the license you have Miss interrogated he I would be glad Sir said I
2496-156067-0031	train-other-500	to understand that you are my brother
none	none	 and that you would understand that you are only my brother 
2496-156067-0032	train-other-500	O the fond fond heart with a sneer of insult lifting up his hands Sir said I to my father to your justice I appeal
2496-156067-0033	train-other-500	If I have deserved reflection
none	none	 let me be not spared 
2496-156067-0034	train-other-500	But if I am to be answerable for the rashness No more No more of either side said my father You are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace though Nor are you son James
2496-156067-0035	train-other-500	to reflect upon your sister She is a worthy child Sir I have done replied he and yet I have her honour at heart as much as the honour of the rest of the family
2496-156067-0036	train-other-500	And hence Sir retorted I your unbrotherly reflections upon me Well but you observe Miss said he
none	none	 that it is not I 
2496-156067-0037	train-other-500	but your father that tells you that you are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace Cousin Harlowe
none	none	 said my aunt Hervey 
2496-156067-0038	train-other-500	allow me to say that my cousin Clary s prudence may be confided in I am convinced it may joined my mother But aunt but madam put in my sister
2496-156067-0039	train-other-500	there is no hurt I presume in letting my sister know the condition she goes to Miss Howe upon since if he gets a nack of visiting her there You may be sure interrupted my uncle Harlowe
2496-156067-0040	train-other-500	he will endeavour to see her there So would such an impudent man here said my uncle Antony and tis better done there than here Better no where said my father
2496-156067-0041	train-other-500	I command you turning to me on pain of displeasure that you see him not at all I will not Sir in any way of encouragement I do assure you not at all
2496-156067-0042	train-other-500	if I can properly avoid it You know with what indifference said my mother she has hitherto seen him Her prudence may be trusted to as my sister Hervey says With what appa
none	none	 rent indifference 
2496-156067-0043	train-other-500	drawled my brother Son James said my father sternly I have done Sir said he But again in a provoking manner he reminded me of the prohibition
2496-156067-0044	train-other-500	Thus ended the conference Will you engage my dear that the hated man shall not come near your house But what an inconsistence is this when they consent to my going
none	none	 thinking his visits here no otherwise to be avoided But if he does come I charge you never to leave us alone together As I have no reason to doubt a welcome from your good mother I will put every thing in order here and be with you in two or three days Mean time I am Your most affectionate and obliged CLARISSA HARLOWE LETTER VII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE AFTER HER RETURN FROM HER HARLOWE PLACE FEB twenty I beg your excuse for not writing sooner Alas my dear I have sad prospects before me My brother and sister have succeeded in all their views They have found out another lover for me an hideous one Yet he is encouraged by every body No wonder that I was ordered home so suddenly At an hour s warning No other notice you know than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me back It was for fear as I have been informed an unworthy fear that I should have entered into any concert with mister Lovelace had I known their motive for commanding me home apprehending tis evident that I should dislike the man they had to propose to me And well might they apprehend so For who do you think he is No other than that Solmes Could you have believed it And they are all determined too my mother with the rest Dear dear excellence how could she be thus brought over when I am assured that on his first being proposed she was pleased to say That had mister Solmes the Indies in possession and would endow me with them she should not think him deserving of her Clarissa The reception I met with at my return so different from what I used to meet with on every little absence and now I had been from them three weeks convinced me that I was to suffer for the happiness I had had in your company and conversation for that most agreeable period I will give you an account of it My brother met me at the door and gave me his hand when I stepped out of the chariot He bowed very low pray Miss favour me I thought it in good humour but found it afterwards mock respect and so he led me in great form I prattling all the way inquiring of every body s health although I was so soon to see them and there was hardly time for answers into the great parlour where were my father mother my two uncles and sister I was struck all of a heap as soon as I entered to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions in the countenance of every dear relation They all kept their seats I ran to my father and kneeled then to my mother and met from both a cold salute From my father a blessing but half pronounced My mother indeed called me child but embraced me not with her usual indulgent ardour After I had paid my duty to my uncles and my compliments to my sister which she received with solemn and stiff form I was bid to sit down But my heart was full and I said it became me to stand if I could stand upon a reception so awful and unusual I was forced to turn my face from them and pull out my handkerchief My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth and charged me with having received no less than five or six visits at Miss Howe s from the man they had all so much reason to hate that was the expression notwithstanding the commands I had had to the contrary And he bid me deny it if I could I had never been used I said to deny the truth nor would I now I owned I had in the three weeks passed seen the person I presumed he meant oftener than five or six times Pray hear me brother said I for he was going to flame out but he always asked for missus or Miss Howe when he came I proceeded that I had reason to believe that both missus Howe and Miss as matters stood would much rather have excused his visits but they had more than once apologized that having not the same reason my papa had to forbid him their house his rank and fortune entitled him to civility You see my dear I made not the pleas I might have made My brother seemed ready to give a loose to his passion My father put on the countenance which always portends a gathering storm My uncles mutteringly whispered And my sister aggravatingly held up her hands While I begged to be heard out And my mother said let the child that was her kind word be heard I hoped I said there was no harm done that it became not me to prescribe to missus or Miss Howe who should be their visitors that missus Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between Miss and him that I had no reason to challenge her guest for my visitor as I should seem to have done had I refused to go into their company when he was with them that I had never seen him out of the presence of one or both of those ladies and had signified to him once on his urging a few moments private conversation with me that unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and his he must not expect that I would countenance his visits much less give him an opportunity of that sort I told him further that Miss Howe so well understood my mind that she never left me a moment while mister Lovelace was there that when he came if I was not below in the parlour I would not suffer myself to be called to him although I thought it would be an affectation which would give him an advantage rather than the contrary if I had left company when he came in or refused to enter into it when I found he would stay any time My brother heard me out with such a kind of impatience as shewed he was resolved to be dissatisfied with me say what I would The rest as the event has proved behaved as if they would have been satisfied had they not further points to carry by intimidating me All this made it evident as I mentioned above that they themselves expected not my voluntary compliance and was a tacit confession of the disagreeableness of the person they had to propose I was no sooner silent than my brother swore although in my father s presence swore unchecked either by eye or countenance That for his part he would never be reconciled to that libertine and that he would renounce me for a sister if I encouraged the addresses of a man so obnoxious to them all A man who had like to have been my brother s murderer my sister said with a face even bursting with restraint of passion The poor Bella has you know a plump high fed face if I may be allowed the expression You I know will forgive me for this liberty of speech sooner than I can forgive myself Yet how can one be such a reptile as not to turn when trampled upon My father with vehemence both of action and voice my father has you know a terrible voice when he is angry told me that I had met with too much indulgence in being allowed to refuse this gentleman and the other gentleman and it was now his turn to be obeyed Very true my mother said and hoped his will would not now be disputed by a child so favoured To shew they were all of a sentiment my uncle Harlowe said he hoped his beloved niece only wanted to know her father s will to obey it And my uncle Antony in his rougher manner added that surely I would not give them reason to apprehend that I thought my grandfather s favour to me had made me independent of them all If I did he would tell me the will could be set aside and should I was astonished you must needs think Whose addresses now thought I is this treatment preparative to mister Wyerley s again or whose And then as high comparisons where self is concerned sooner than low come into young people s heads be it for whom it will this is wooing as the English did for the heiress of Scotland in the time of Edward the Sixth But that it could be for Solmes how should it enter into my head I did not know I said that I had given occasion for this harshness I hoped I should always have a just sense of every one s favour to me superadded to the duty I owed as a daughter and a niece but that I was so much surprised at a reception so unusual and unexpected that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire in order to recollect myself No one gainsaying I made my silent compliments and withdrew leaving my brother and sister as I thought pleased and as if they wanted to congratulate each other on having occasioned so severe a beginning to be made with me I went up to my chamber and there with my faithful Hannah deplored the determined face which the new proposal it was plain they had to make me wore I had not recovered myself when I was sent for down to tea I begged my maid to be excused attending but on the repeated command went down with as much cheerfulness as I could assume and had a new fault to clear myself of for my brother so pregnant a thing is determined ill will by intimations equally rude and intelligible charged my desire of being excused coming down to sullens because a certain person had been spoken against upon whom as he supposed my fancy ran I could easily answer you Sir said I as such a reflection deserves but I forbear If I do not find a brother in you you shall have a sister in me Pretty meekness Bella whisperingly said looking at my brother and lifting up her lip in contempt He with an imperious air bid me deserve his love and I should be sure to have it As we sat my mother in her admirable manner expatiated upon brotherly and sisterly love indulgently blamed my brother and sister for having taken up displeasure too lightly against me and politically if I may say so answered for my obedience to my father s will The it would be all well my father was pleased to say Then they should dote upon me was my brother s expression Love me as well as ever was my sister s And my uncles That I then should be the pride of their hearts But alas what a forfeiture of all these must I make This was the reception I had on my return from you mister Solmes came in before we had done tea My uncle Antony presented him to me as a gentleman he had a particular friendship for My uncle Harlowe in terms equally favourable for him My father said mister Solmes is my friend Clarissa Harlowe My mother looked at him and looked at me now and then as he sat near me I thought with concern I at her with eyes appealing for pity At him when I could glance at him with disgust little short of affrightment While my brother and sister mister Solmes d him and Sirr d yet such a wretch But I will at present only add My humble thanks and duty to your honoured mother to whom I will particularly write to express the grateful sense I have of her goodness to me and that I am Your ever obliged CL HARLOWE LETTER VIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE FEB twenty four They drive on here at a furious rate The man lives here I think He courts them and is more and more a favourite Such terms such settlements That s the cry O my dear that I had not reason to deplore the family fault immensely rich as they all are But this I may the more unreservedly say to you as we have often joined in the same concern I for a father and uncles you for a mother in every other respect faultless Hitherto I seem to be delivered over to my brother who pretends as great a love to me as ever You may believe I have been very sincere with him But he affects to rally me and not to believe it possible that one so dutiful and discreet as his sister Clary can resolve to disoblige all her friends Indeed I tremble at the prospect before me for it is evident that they are strangely determined My father and mother industriously avoid giving me opportunity of speaking to them alone They ask not for my approbation intended as it should seem to suppose me into their will And with them I shall hope to prevail or with nobody They have not the interest in compelling me as my brother and sister have I say less therefore to them reserving my whole force for an audience of my father if he will permit me a patient ear How difficult is it my dear to give a negative where both duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige I have already stood the shock of three of this man s particular visits besides my share in his more general ones and find it is impossible I should ever endure him He has but a very ordinary share of understanding is very illiterate knows nothing but the value of estates and how to improve them and what belongs to land jobbing and husbandry Yet I am as one stupid I think They have begun so cruelly with me that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative They had endeavoured it seems to influence my good missus Norton before I came home so intent are they to carry their point And her opinion not being to their liking she has been told that she would do well to decline visiting here for the present yet she is the person of all the world next to my mother the most likely to prevail upon me were the measures they are engaged in reasonable measures or such as she could think so My aunt likewise having said that she did not think her niece could ever be brought to like mister Solmes has been obliged to learn another lesson I am to have a visit from her to morrow And since I have refused so much as to hear from my brother and sister what the noble settlements are to be she is to acquaint me with the particulars and to receive from me my determination for my father I am told will not have patience but to suppose that I shall stand in opposition to his will Mean time it has been signified to me that it will be acceptable if I do not think of going to church next Sunday The same signification was made for me last Sunday and I obeyed They are apprehensive that mister Lovelace will be there with design to come home with me Help me dear Miss Howe to a little of your charming spirit I never more wanted it The man this Solmes you may suppose has no reason to boast of his progress with me He has not the sense to say any thing to the purpose His courtship indeed is to them and my brother pretends to court me as his proxy truly I utterly to my brother reject his address but thinking a person so well received and recommended by all my family entitled to good manners all I say against him is affectedly attributed to coyness and he not being sensible of his own imperfections believes that my avoiding him when I can and the reserves I express are owing to nothing else for as I said all his courtship is to them and I have no opportunity of saying no to one who asks me not the question And so with an air of mannish superiority he seems rather to pity the bashful girl than to apprehend that he shall not succeed FEBRUARY twenty five I have had the expected conference with my aunt I have been obliged to hear the man s proposals from her and have been told also what their motives are for espousing his interest with so much warmth I am even loth to mention how equally unjust it is for him to make such offers or for those I am bound to reverence to accept of them I hate him more than before One great estate is already obtained at the expense of the relations to it though distant relations my brother s I mean by his godmother and this has given the hope however chimerical that hope of procuring others and that my own at least may revert to the family And yet in my opinion the world is but one great family Originally it was so What then is this narrow selfishness that reigns in us but relationship remembered against relationship forgot But here upon my absolute refusal of him upon any terms have I had a signification made me that wounds me to the heart How can I tell it you Yet I must It is my dear that I must not for a month to come or till license obtained correspond with any body out of the house My brother upon my aunt s report made however as I am informed in the gentlest manner and even giving remote hopes which she had no commission from me to give brought me in authoritative terms the prohibition Not to Miss Howe said I No not to Miss Howe Madam tauntingly for have you not acknowledged that Lovelace is a favourite there See my dear Miss Howe And do you think Brother this is the way Do you look to that But your letters will be stopt I can tell you And away he flung My sister came to me soon after Sister Clary you are going on in a fine way I understand But as there are people who are supposed to harden you against your duty I am to tell you that it will be taken well if you avoid visits or visitings for a week or two till further order Can this be from those who have authority Ask them ask them child with a twirl of her finger I have delivered my message Your father will be obeyed He is willing to hope you to be all obedience and would prevent all incitements to refractoriness I know my duty said I and hope I shall not find impossible condition annexed to it A pert young creature vain and conceited she called me I was the only judge in my own wise opinion of what was right and fit She for her part had long seen into my specious ways and now I should shew every body what I was at bottom Dear Bella said I hands and eyes lifted up why all this Dear dear Bella why None of your dear dear Bella s to me I tell you I see through your witchcrafts that was her strange word And away she flung adding as she went and so will every body else very quickly I dare say Bless me said I to myself what a sister have I How have I deserved this Then I again regretted my grandfather s too distinguishing goodness to me FEB twenty five IN THE EVENING What my brother and sister have said against me I cannot tell but I am in heavy disgrace with my father I was sent for down to tea I went with a very cheerful aspect but had occasion soon to change it Such a solemnity in every body s countenance My mother s eyes were fixed upon the tea cups and when she looked up it was heavily as if her eye lids had weights upon them and then not to me My father sat half aside in his elbow chair that his head might be turned from me his hands clasped and waving as it were up and down his fingers poor dear gentleman in motion as if angry to the very ends of them My sister was swelling My brother looked at me with scorn having measured me as I may say with his eyes as I entered from head to foot My aunt was there and looked upon me as if with kindness restrained bending coldly to my compliment to her as she sat and then cast an eye first on my brother then on my sister as if to give the reason so I am willing to construe it of her unusual stiffness Bless me my dear that they should choose to intimidate rather than invite a mind till now not thought either unpersuadable or ungenerous I took my seat Shall I make tea Madam to my mother I always used you know my dear to make tea No a very short sentence in one very short word was the expressive answer And she was pleased to take the canister in her own hand My brother bid the footman who attended leave the room I he said will pour out the water My heart was up in my mouth I did not know what to do with myself What is to follow thought I Just after the second dish out stept my mother A word with you sister Hervey taking her in her hand Presently my sister dropt away Then my brother So I was left alone with my father He looked so very sternly that my heart failed me as twice or thrice I would have addressed myself to him nothing but solemn silence on all hands having passed before At last I asked if it were his pleasure that I should pour him out another dish He answered me with the same angry monosyllable which I had received from my mother before and then arose and walked about the room I arose too with intent to throw myself at his feet but was too much overawed by his sternness even to make such an expression of my duty to him as my heart overflowed with At last as he supported himself because of his gout on the back of a chair I took a little more courage and approaching him besought him to acquaint me in what I had offended him He turned from me and in a strong voice Clarissa Harlowe said he know that I will be obeyed God forbid Sir that you should not I have never yet opposed your will Nor I your whimsies Clarissa Harlowe interrupted he Don t let me run the fate of all who shew indulgence to your sex to be the more contradicted for mine to you My father you know my dear has not any more than my brother a kind opinion of our sex although there is not a more condescending wife in the world than my mother I was going to make protestations of duty No protestations girl No words I will not be prated to I will be obeyed I have no child I will have no child but an obedient one Sir you never had reason I hope Tell me not what I never had but what I have and what I shall have Good Sir be pleased to hear me My brother and sister I fear Your brother and sister shall not be spoken against girl They have a just concern for the honour of my family And I hope Sir Hope nothing Tell me not of hopes but of facts I ask nothing of you but what is in your power to comply with and what it is your duty to comply with Then Sir I will comply with it But yet I hope from your goodness No expostulations No but s girl No qualifyings I will be obeyed I tell you and cheerfully too or you are no child of mine I wept Let me beseech you my dear and ever honoured Papa and I dropt down on my knees that I may have only yours and my mamma s will and not my brother s to obey I was going on but he was pleased to withdraw leaving me on the floor saying That he would not hear me thus by subtilty and cunning aiming to distinguish away my duty repeating that he would be obeyed My heart is too full so full that it may endanger my duty were I to try to unburden it to you on this occasion so I will lay down my pen But can Yet positively I will lay down my pen LETTER IX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE FEB twenty six IN THE MORNING My aunt who staid here last night made me a visit this morning as soon as it was light She tells me that I was left alone with my father yesterday on purpose that he might talk with me on my expected obedience but that he owned he was put beside his purpose by reflecting on something my brother had told him in my disfavour and by his impatience but to suppose that such a gentle spirit as mine had hitherto seemed to be should presume to dispute his will in a point where the advantage of the whole family was to be so greatly promoted by my compliance I find by a few words which dropt unawares from my aunt that they have all an absolute dependence upon what they suppose to be meekness in my temper But in this they may be mistaken for I verily think upon a strict examination of myself that I have almost as much in me of my father s as of my mother s family My uncle Harlowe it seems is against driving me upon extremities But my brother has engaged that the regard I have for my reputation and my principles will bring me round to my duty that s the expression Perhaps I shall have reason to wish I had not known this My aunt advises me to submit for the present to the interdicts they have laid me under and indeed to encourage mister Solmes s address I have absolutely refused the latter let what will as I have told her be the consequence The visiting prohibition I will conform to But as to that of not corresponding with you nothing but the menace that our letters shall be intercepted can engage my observation of it She believes that this order is from my father and that my mother has not been consulted upon it She says that it is given as she has reason think purely in consideration to me lest I should mortally offend him and this from the incitements of other people meaning you and Miss Lloyd I make no doubt rather than by my own will For still as she tells me he speaks kind and praiseful things of me Here is clemency Here is indulgence And so it is to prevent a headstrong child as a good prince would wish to deter disaffected subjects from running into rebellion and so forfeiting every thing But this is allowing to the young man s wisdom of my brother a plotter without a head and a brother without a heart How happy might I have been with any other brother in the world but James Harlowe and with any other sister but his sister Wonder not my dear that I who used to chide you for these sort of liberties with my relations now am more undutiful than you ever was unkind I cannot bear the thought of being deprived of the principal pleasure of my life for such is your conversation by person and by letter And who besides can bear to be made the dupe of such low cunning operating with such high and arrogant passions But can you my dear Miss Howe condescend to carry on a private correspondence with me If you can there is one way I have thought of by which it may be done You must remember the Green Lane as we call it that runs by the side of the wood house and poultry yard where I keep my bantams pheasants and pea hens which generally engage my notice twice a day the more my favourites because they were my grandfather s and recommended to my care by him and therefore brought hither from my Dairy house since his death The lane is lower than the floor of the wood house and in the side of the wood house the boards are rotted away down to the floor for half an ell together in several places Hannah can step into the lane and make a mark with chalk where a letter or parcel may be pushed in under some sticks which may be so managed as to be an unsuspected cover for the written deposits from either I have been just now to look at the place and find it will answer So your faithful Robert may without coming near the house and as only passing through the Green Lame which leads to two or three farm houses out of livery if you please very easily take from thence my letters and deposit yours This place is the more convenient because it is seldom resorted to but by myself or Hannah on the above mentioned account for it is the general store house for firing the wood for constant use being nearer the house One corner of this being separated off for the roosting place of my little poultry either she or I shall never want a pretence to go thither Try my dear the success of a letter this way and give me your opinion and advice what to do in this disgraceful situation as I cannot but call it and what you think of my prospects and what you would do in my case But before hand I will tell you that your advice must not run in favour of this Solmes and yet it is very likely they will endeavour to engage your mother in order to induce you who have such an influence over me to favour him Yet on second thoughts if you incline to that side of the question I would have you write your whole mind Determined as I think I am and cannot help it I would at least give a patient hearing to what may be said on the other side For my regards are not so much engaged upon my word they are not I know not myself if they be to another person as some of my friends suppose and as you giving way to your lively vein upon his last visits affected to suppose What preferable favour I may have for him to any other person is owing more to the usage he has received and for my sake borne than to any personal consideration I write a few lines of grateful acknowledgement to your good mother for her favours to me in the late happy period I fear I shall never know such another I hope she will forgive me that I did not write sooner The bearer if suspected and examined is to produce that as the only one he carries How do needless watchfulness and undue restraint produce artifice and contrivance I should abhor these clandestine correspondences were they not forced upon me They have so mean so low an appearance to myself that I think I ought not to expect that you should take part in them But why as I have also expostulated with my aunt must I be pushed into a state which I have no wish to enter into although I reverence it Why should not my brother so many years older and so earnest to see me engaged be first engaged And why should not my sister be first provided for But here I conclude these unavailing expostulations with the assurance that I am and ever will be Your affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE LETTER X MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FEB twenty seven What odd heads some people have Miss Clarissa Harlowe to be sacrificed in marriage to mister Roger Solmes Astonishing I must not you say give my advice in favour of this man You now convince me my dear that you are nearer of kin than I thought you to the family that could think of so preposterous a match or you would never have had the least notion of my advising in his favour Ask for his picture You know I have a good hand at drawing an ugly likeness But I ll see a little further first for who knows what may happen since matters are in such a train and since you have not the courage to oppose so overwhelming a torrent You ask me to help you to a little of my spirit Are you in earnest But it will not now I doubt do you service It will not sit naturally upon you You are your mother s girl think what you will and have violent spirits to contend with Alas my dear you should have borrowed some of mine a little sooner that is to say before you had given the management of your estate into the hands of those who think they have a prior claim to it What though a father s Has not the father two elder children And do they not both bear more of his stamp and image than you do Pray my dear call me not to account for this free question lest your application of my meaning on examination prove to be as severe as that Now I have launched out a little indulge me one word more in the same strain I will be decent I promise you I think you might have know that Avarice and Envy are two passions that are not to be satisfied the one by giving the other by the envied person s continuing to deserve and excel Fuel fuel both all the world over to flames insatiate and devouring But since you ask for my opinion you must tell me all you know or surmise of their inducements And if you will not forbid me to make extracts from your letters for the entertainment of my aunt and cousin in the little island who long to hear more of your affairs it will be very obliging But you are so tender of some people who have no tenderness for any body but themselves that I must conjure you to speak out Remember that a friendship like ours admits of no reserves You may trust my impartiality It would be an affront to your own judgment if you did not For do you not ask my advice And have you not taught me that friendship should never give a bias against justice Justify them therefore if you can Let us see if there be any sense whether sufficient reason or not in their choice At present I cannot and yet I know a good deal of your family have any conception how all of them your mother and your aunt Hervey in particular can join with the rest against judgments given As to some of the others I cannot wonder at any thing they do or attempt to do where self is concerned You ask Why may not your brother be first engaged in wedlock I ll tell you why His temper and his arrogance are too well known to induce women he would aspire to to receive his addresses notwithstanding his great independent acquisitions and still greater prospects Let me tell you my dear those acquisitions have given him more pride than reputation To me he is the most intolerable creature that I ever conversed with The treatment you blame he merited from one whom he addressed with the air of a person who presumes that he is about to confer a favour rather than to receive one I ever loved to mortify proud and insolent spirits What think you makes me bear Hickman near me but that the man is humble and knows and keeps his distance As to your question Why your elder sister may not be first provided for I answer Because she must have no man but one who has a great and clear estate that s one thing Another is Because she has a younger sister Pray my dear be so good as to tell me What man of a great and clear estate would think of that eldest sister while the younger were single You are all too rich to be happy child For must not each of you by the constitutions of your family marry to be still richer People who know in what their main excellence consists are not to be blamed are they for cultivating and improving what they think most valuable Is true happiness any part of your family view So far from it that none of your family but yourself could be happy were they not rich So let them fret on grumble and grudge and accumulate and wondering what ails them that they have not happiness when they have riches think the cause is want of more and so go on heaping up till Death as greedy an accumulator as themselves gathers them into his garner Well then once more I say do you my dear tell me what you know of their avowed and general motives and I will tell you more than you will tell me of their failings Your aunt Hervey you say has told you Why must I ask you to let me know them when you condescend to ask my advice on the occasion See Letter VIII That they prohibit your corresponding with me is a wisdom I neither wonder at nor blame them for since it is an evidence to me that they know their own folly And if they do is it strange that they should be afraid to trust one another s judgment upon it I am glad you have found out a way to correspond with me I approve it much I shall more if this first trial of it prove successful But should it not and should it fall into their hands it would not concern me but for your sake We have heard before you wrote that all was not right between your relations and you at your coming home that mister Solmes visited you and that with a prospect of success But I concluded the mistake lay in the person and that his address was to Miss Arabella And indeed had she been as good natured as your plump ones generally are I should have thought her too good for him by half This must certainly be the thing thought I and my beloved friend is sent for to advise and assist in her nuptial preparations Who knows said I to my mother but that when the man has thrown aside his yellow full buckled peruke and his broad brimmed beaver both of which I suppose were Sir Oliver s best of long standing he may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss Bell The woman as she observes should excel the man in features and where can she match so well for a foil I indulged this surmise against rumour because I could not believe that the absurdest people in England could be so very absurd as to think of this man for you We heard moreover that you received no visiters I could assign no reason for this except that the preparations for your sister were to be private and the ceremony sudden for fear this man should as another man did change his mind Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph were with me to inquire what I knew of this and of your not being in church either morning or afternoon the Sunday after your return from us to the disappointment of a little hundred of your admirers to use their words It was easy for me to guess the reason to be what you confirm their apprehensions that Lovelace would be there and attempt to wait on you home My mother takes very kindly your compliments in your letter to her Her words upon reading it were Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an admirable young lady wherever she goes she confers a favour whomever she leaves she fills with regret And then a little comparative reflection O my Nancy that you had a little of her sweet obligingness No matter The praise was yours You are me and I enjoyed it The more enjoyed it because Shall I tell you the truth Because I think myself as well as I am were it but for this reason that had I twenty brother James s and twenty sister Bell s not one of them nor all of them joined together would dare to treat me as yours presume to treat you The person who will bear much shall have much to bear all the world through it is your own sentiment grounded upon the strongest instance that can be given in your own family though you have so little improved by it Letter V The result is this that I am fitter for this world than you you for the next than me that is the difference But long long for my sake and for hundreds of sakes may it be before you quit us for company more congenial to you and more worthy of you I communicated to my mother the account you give of your strange reception also what a horrid wretch they have found out for you and the compulsory treatment they give you It only set her on magnifying her lenity to me on my tyrannical behaviour as she will call it mothers must have their way you know my dear to the man whom she so warmly recommends against whom it seems there can be no just exception and expatiating upon the complaisance I owe her for her indulgence So I believe I must communicate to her nothing farther especially as I know she would condemn the correspondence between us and that between you and Lovelace as clandestine and undutiful proceedings and divulge our secret besides for duty implicit is her cry And moreover she lends a pretty open ear to the preachments of that starch old bachelor your uncle Antony and for an example to her daughter would be more careful how she takes your part be the cause ever so just Yet is this not the right policy neither For people who allow nothing will be granted nothing in other words those who aim at carrying too many points will not be able to carry any But can you divine my dear what the old preachment making plump hearted soul your uncle Antony means by his frequent amblings hither There is such smirking and smiling between my mother and him Such mutual praises of economy and that is my way and this I do and I am glad it has your approbation Sir and you look into every thing Madam Nothing would be done if I did not Such exclamations against servants Such exaltings of self And dear heart and good lack and las a day And now and then their conversation sinking into a whispering accent if I come across them I ll tell you my dear I don t above half like it Only that these old bachelors usually take as many years to resolve upon matrimony as they can reasonably expect to live or I should be ready to fire upon his visits and to recommend mister Hickman to my mother s acceptance as a much more eligible man for what he wants in years he makes up in gravity and if you will not chide me I will say that there is a primness in both especially when the man has presumed too much with me upon my mother s favour for him and is under discipline on that account as make them seem near of kin and then in contemplation of my sauciness and what they both fear from it they sigh away and seem so mightily to compassionate each other that if pity be but one remove from love I am in no danger while they are both in a great deal and don t know it Now my dear I know you will be upon me with your grave airs so in for the lamb as the saying is in for the sheep and do you yourself look about you for I ll have a pull with you by way of being aforehand Hannibal we read always advised to attack the Romans upon their own territories You are pleased to say and upon your word too that your regards a mighty quaint word for affections are not so much engaged as some of your friends suppose to another person What need you give one to imagine my dear that the last month or two has been a period extremely favourable to that other person whom it has made an obliger of the niece for his patience with the uncles But to pass that by so much engaged How much my dear Shall I infer Some of your friends suppose a great deal You seem to own a little Don t be angry It is all fair because you have not acknowledged to me that little People I have heard you say who affect secrets always excite curiosity But you proceed with a kind of drawback upon your averment as if recollection had given you a doubt you know not yourself if they be so much engaged Was it necessary to say this to me and to say it upon your word too But you know best Yet you don t neither I believe For a beginning love is acted by a subtle spirit and oftentimes discovers itself to a by stander when the person possessed why should I not call it possessed knows not it has such a demon But further you say what preferable favour you may have for him to any other person is owing more to the usage he has received and for your sake borne than to any personal consideration This is generously said It is in character But O my friend depend upon it you are in danger Depend upon it whether you know it or not you are a little in for t Your native generosity and greatness of mind endanger you all your friends by fighting against him with impolitic violence fight for him And Lovelace my life for yours notwithstanding all his veneration and assiduities has seen further than that veneration and those assiduities so well calculated to your meridian will let him own he has seen has seen in short that his work is doing for him more effectually than he could do it for himself And have you not before now said that nothing is so penetrating as the eye of a lover who has vanity And who says Lovelace wants vanity In short my dear it is my opinion and that from the easiness of his heart and behaviour that he has seen more than I have seen more than you think could be seen more than I believe you yourself know or else you would let me know it Already in order to restrain him from resenting the indignities he has received and which are daily offered him he has prevailed upon you to correspond with him privately I know he has nothing to boast of from what you have written but is not his inducing you to receive his letters and to answer them a great point gained By your insisting that he should keep the correspondence private it appears there is one secret which you do not wish the world should know and he is master of that secret He is indeed himself as I may say that secret What an intimacy does this beget for the lover How is it distancing the parent Yet who as things are situated can blame you Your condescension has no doubt hitherto prevented great mischiefs It must be continued for the same reasons while the cause remains You are drawn in by a perverse fate against inclination but custom with such laudable purposes will reconcile the inconveniency and make an inclination And I would advise you as you would wish to manage on an occasion so critical with that prudence which governs all your actions not to be afraid of entering upon a close examination into the true springs and grounds of this your generosity to that happy man It is my humble opinion I tell you frankly that on inquiry it will come out to be LOVE don t start my dear Has not your man himself had natural philosophy enough to observe already to your aunt Hervey that love takes the deepest root in the steadiest minds The deuce take his sly penetration I was going to say for this was six or seven weeks ago I have been tinctured you know Nor on the coolest reflection could I account how and when the jaundice began but had been over head and ears as the saying is but for some of that advice from you which I now return you Yet my man was not half so so what my dear to be sure Lovelace is a charming fellow And were he only but I will not make you glow as you read upon my word I will not Yet my dear don t you find at your heart somewhat unusual make it go throb throb throb as you read just here If you do don t be ashamed to own it it is your generosity my love that s all But as the Roman augur said Caesar beware of the Ides of March Adieu my dearest friend Forgive and very speedily by the new found expedient tell me that you forgive Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE LETTER XI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY MARCH one You both nettled and alarmed me my dearest Miss Howe by the concluding part of your last At first reading it I did not think it necessary said I to myself to guard against a critic when I was writing to so dear a friend But then recollecting myself is there not more in it said I than the result of a vein so naturally lively Surely I must have been guilty of an inadvertence Let me enter into the close examination of myself which my beloved friend advises I do so and cannot own any of the glow any of the throbs you mention Upon my word I will repeat I cannot And yet the passages in my letter upon which you are so humourously severe lay me fairly open to your agreeable raillery I own they do And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken to dictate so oddly to my pen But pray now is it saying so much when one who has no very particular regard to any man says there are some who are preferable to others And is it blamable to say they are the preferable who are not well used by one s relations yet dispense with that usage out of regard to one s self which they would otherwise resent mister Lovelace for instance I may be allowed to say is a man to be preferred to mister Solmes and that I do prefer him to that man but surely this may be said without its being a necessary consequence that I must be in love with him Indeed I would not be in love with him as it is called for the world First because I have no opinion of his morals and think it a fault in which our whole family my brother excepted has had a share that he was permitted to visit us with a hope which however being distant did not as I have observed heretofore entitle any of us to call him to account for such of his immoralities as came to our ears Next because I think him to be a vain man capable of triumphing secretly at least over a person whose heart he thinks he has engaged And thirdly because the assiduities and veneration which you impute to him seem to carry an haughtiness in them as if he thought his address had a merit in it that would be more than an equivalent to a woman s love In short his very politeness notwithstanding the advantages he must have had from his birth and education appear to be constrained and with the most remarkable easy and genteel person something at times seems to be behind in his manner that is too studiously kept in Then good humoured as he is thought to be in the main to other people s servants and this even to familiarity although as you have observed a familiarity that has dignity in it not unbecoming to a man of quality he is apt sometimes to break out into a passion with his own An oath or a curse follows and such looks from those servants as plainly shew terror and that they should have fared worse had they not been in my hearing with a confirmation in the master s looks of a surmise too well justified Letter III Indeed my dear THIS man is not THE man I have great objections to him My heart throbs not after him I glow not but with indignation against myself for having given room for such an imputation But you must not my dearest friend construe common gratitude into love I cannot bear that you should But if ever I should have the misfortune to think it love I promise you upon my word which is the same as upon my honour that I will acquaint you with it You bid me to tell you very speedily and by the new found expedient that I am not displeased with you for your agreeable raillery I dispatch this therefore immediately postponing to my next the account of the inducements which my friends have to promote with so much earnestness the address of mister Solmes Be satisfied my dear mean time that I am not displeased with you indeed I am not On the contrary I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly premonitions and I charge you as I have often done that if you observe any thing in me so very faulty as would require from you to others in my behalf the palliation of friendly and partial love you acquaint me with it for methinks I would so conduct myself as not to give reason even for an adversary to censure me and how shall so weak and so young a creature avoid the censure of such if my friend will not hold a looking glass before me to let me see my imperfections Judge me then my dear as any indifferent person knowing what you know of me would do I may be at first be a little pained may glow a little perhaps to be found less worthy of your friendship than I wish to be but assure yourself that your kind correction will give me reflection that shall amend me If it do not you will have a fault to accuse me of that will be utterly inexcusable a fault let me add that should you not accuse me of it if in your opinion I am guilty you will not be so much so warmly my friend as I am yours since I have never spared you on the like occasions Here I break off to begin another letter to you with the assurance mean time that I am and ever will be Your equally affectionate and grateful CL HARLOWE LETTER XII MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING MARCH two Indeed you would not be in love with him for the world Your servant my dear Nor would I have you 
2526-156073-0001	train-other-500	For I think with all the advantages of person fortune and family he is not by any means worthy of you And this opinion I give as well from the reasons you mention which I cannot but confirm
2526-156073-0002	train-other-500	as from what I have heard of him but a few hours ago
none	none	 from missus Fortescue 
2526-156073-0003	train-other-500	a favourite of Lady Betty Lawrance who knows him well but let me congratulate you however
none	none	 on your being the first of our sex that ever I heard of who has been able to turn that lion Love at her own pleasure 
2526-156073-0004	train-other-500	into a lap dog Well but if you have not the throbs and the glows you have not and are not in love good reason why because you would not be in love
2526-156073-0005	train-other-500	and there s no more to be said Only my dear I shall keep a good look out upon you
none	none	 and so I hope you will be upon yourself for it is no manner of argument that because you would not be in love 
2526-156073-0006	train-other-500	you therefore are not But before I part entirely with this subject a word in your ear my charming friend
none	none	 tis only by way of caution and in pursuance of the general observation that a stander by is often a better judge of the game than those that play May it not be that you have had and have such cross creatures and such odd heads to deal with 
2526-156073-0007	train-other-500	as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs Or if you had them a little now and then whether having had two accounts to place them to
none	none	 you have not by mistake put them to the wrong one But whether you have a value for Lovelace or not I know you will be impatient to hear what missus Fortescue has said of him 
2526-156073-0008	train-other-500	Nor will I keep you longer in suspense An hundred wild stories she tells of him from childhood to manhood for as she observed having never been subject to contradiction he was always as mischievous as a monkey
none	none	 But I shall pass over these whole hundred of his puerile rogueries 
2526-156073-0009	train-other-500	although indicative ones as I may say to take notice as well of some things you are not quite ignorant of as of others you know not and to make a few observations upon him and his ways
none	none	 missus Fortescue owns what every body knows 
2526-156073-0010	train-other-500	that he is notoriously nay avowedly a man of pleasure yet says that in any thing he sets his heart upon or undertakes he is the most industrious and persevering mortal under the sun
2526-156073-0011	train-other-500	He rests it seems not above six hours in the twenty four any more than you He delights in writing
none	none	 Whether at Lord M s or at Lady Betty s or Lady Sarah s he has always a pen in his fingers when he retires 
2526-156073-0012	train-other-500	One of his companions confirming his love of writing has told her that his thoughts flow rapidly to his pen And you and I my dear have observed on more occasions than one
none	none	 that though he writes even a fine hand 
2526-156073-0013	train-other-500	he is one of the readiest and quickest of writers He must indeed have had early a very docile genius since a person of his pleasurable turn and active spirit
2526-156073-0014	train-other-500	could never have submitted to take long or great pains in attaining the qualifications he is master of qualifications so seldom attained by youth of quality and fortune by such especially
none	none	 of those of either 
2526-156073-0015	train-other-500	who like him have never known what it was to be controuled He had once it seems the vanity upon being complimented on these talents and on his surprising diligence for a man of pleasure to compare himself to Julius Caesar
2526-156073-0016	train-other-500	who performed great actions by day and wrote them down at night and valued himself that he only wanted Caesar s out setting to make a figure among his contemporaries
2526-156073-0017	train-other-500	He spoke of this indeed she says with an air of pleasantry for she observed and so have we that he has the art of acknowledging his vanity
none	none	 with so much humour that it sets him above the contempt 
2526-156073-0018	train-other-500	which is due to vanity and self opinion and at the same time half persuades those who hear him that he really deserves the exultation he gives himself But supposing it to be true that all his vacant nightly hours are employed in writing
2526-156073-0019	train-other-500	what can be his subjects If like Caesar his own actions he must undoubtedly be a very enterprising and very wicked man since nobody suspects him to have a serious turn and decent
2526-156073-0020	train-other-500	as he is in his conversation with us his writings are not probably such as would redound either to his own honour or to the benefit of others were they to be read He must be conscious of this
none	none	 since missus Fortescue says 
2526-156073-0021	train-other-500	that in the great correspondence by letters which he holds he is as secret and as careful as if it were of a treasonable nature yet troubles not his head with politics though nobody knows the interests of princes and courts better than he is said to do
2526-156073-0022	train-other-500	That you and I my dear should love to write is no wonder We have always from the time each could hold a pen delighted in epistolary correspondencies Our employments are domestic and sedentary
2526-156073-0023	train-other-500	and we can scribble upon twenty innocent subjects and take delight in them because they are innocent though were they to be seen
none	none	 they might not much profit or please 
2526-156073-0024	train-other-500	others But that such a gay lively young fellow as this who rides hunts travels
none	none	 frequents the public entertainments and has means to pursue his pleasures should be able to set himself down to write for hours together 
2526-156073-0025	train-other-500	as you and I have heard him say he frequently does that is the strange thing
none	none	 missus Fortescue says 
2526-156073-0026	train-other-500	that he is a complete master of short hand writing By the way what inducements could a swift writer as he have to learn short hand She says and we know it as well as she
none	none	 that he has a surprising memory 
2526-156073-0027	train-other-500	and a very lively imagination Whatever his other vices are
none	none	 all the world as well as missus Fortescue says 
2526-156073-0028	train-other-500	he is a sober man And among all his bad qualities gaming that great waster of time as well as fortune is not his vice So that he must have his head as cool and his reason as clear
2526-156073-0029	train-other-500	as the prime of youth and his natural gaiety will permit and by his early morning hours
none	none	 a great portion of time upon his hands to employ in writing or worse missus Fortescue says he has one gentleman who is more his intimate and correspondent than any of the rest You remember what his dismissed bailiff said of him and of his associates I don t find but that missus Fortescue confirms this part of it 
2526-156073-0030	train-other-500	that all his relations are afraid of him

none	none	 ANNA HOWE LETTER XIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY MARCH one I now take up my pen to lay before you the inducements and motive which my friends have to espouse so earnestly the address of this mister Solmes In order to set this matter in a clear light it is necessary to go a little back and even perhaps to mention some things which you already know and so you may look upon what I am going to relate as a kind of supplement to my letters of the fifteenth and twentieth of January last Letters IV and V In those letters of which I have kept memorandums I gave you an account of my brother s and sister s antipathy to mister Lovelace and the methods they took so far as they had then come to my knowledge to ruin him in the opinion of my other friends And I told you that after a very cold yet not a directly affrontive behaviour to him they all of a sudden became more violent and proceeded to personal insults which brought on at last the unhappy rencounter between my brother and him See Letter IV Now you must know that from the last conversation that passed between my aunt and me it comes out that this sudden vehemence on my brother s and sister s parts was owing to stronger reasons than to the college begun antipathy on his side or to slighted love on hers to wit to an apprehension that my uncles intended to follow my grandfather s example in my favour at least in a higher degree than they wish they should An apprehension founded it seems on a conversation between my two uncles and my brother and sister which my aunt communicated to me in confidence as an argument to prevail upon me to accept of mister Solmes s noble settlements urging that such a seasonable compliance would frustrate my brother s and sister s views and establish me for ever in the love of my father and uncles I will give you the substance of this communicated conversation after I have made a brief introductory observation or two which however I hardly need to make to you who are so well acquainted with us all did not the series or thread of the story require it I have more than once mentioned to you the darling view some of us have long had of raising a family as it is called A reflection as I have often thought upon our own which is no considerable or upstart one on either side on my mother s especially A view too frequently it seems entertained by families which having great substance cannot be satisfied without rank and title My uncles had once extended this view to each of us three children urging that as they themselves intended not to marry we each of us might be so portioned and so advantageously matched as that our posterity if not ourselves might make a first figure in our country While my brother as the only son thought the two girls might be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thousand pounds a piece and that all the real estates in the family to wit my grandfather s father s and two uncles and the remainder of their respective personal estates together with what he had an expectation of from his godmother would make such a noble fortune and give him such an interest as might entitle him to hope for a peerage Nothing less would satisfy his ambition With this view he gave himself airs very early That his grandfather and uncles were his stewards that no man ever had better that daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family and this low and familiar expression was often in his mouth and uttered always with the self complaisance which an imagined happy thought can be supposed to give the speaker to wit That a man who has sons brings up chickens for his own table though once I made his comparison stagger with him by asking him If the sons to make it hold were to have their necks wrung off whereas daughters are chickens brought up for tables of other men This accompanied with the equally polite reflection That to induce people to take them off their hands the family stock must be impaired into the bargain used to put my sister out of all patience and although she now seems to think a younger sister only can be an incumbrance she was then often proposing to me to make a party in our own favour against my brother s rapacious views as she used to call them while I was for considering the liberties he took of this sort as the effect of a temporary pleasantry which in a young man not naturally good humoured I was glad to see or as a foible that deserved raillery but no other notice But when my grandfather s will of the purport of which in my particular favour until it was opened I was as ignorant as they had lopped off one branch of my brother s expectation he was extremely dissatisfied with me Nobody indeed was pleased for although every one loved me yet being the youngest child father uncles brother sister all thought themselves postponed as to matter of right and power Who loves not power And my father himself could not bear that I should be made sole as I may call it and independent for such the will as to that estate and the powers it gave unaccountably as they all said made me To obviate therefore every one s jealousy I gave up to my father s management as you know not only the estate but the money bequeathed me which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by him at his death the other moiety being bequeathed to my sister contenting myself to take as from his bounty what he was pleased to allow me without desiring the least addition to my annual stipend And then I hoped I had laid all envy asleep but still my brother and sister jealous as now is evident of my two uncles favour of me and of the pleasure I had given my father and them by this act of duty were every now and then occasionally doing me covert ill offices of which however I took the less notice when I was told of them as I thought I had removed the cause of their envy and I imputed every thing of that sort to the petulance they are both pretty much noted for My brother s acquisition then took place This made us all very happy and he went down to take possession of it and his absence on so good an account too made us still happier Then followed Lord M s proposal for my sister and this was an additional felicity for the time I have told you how exceedingly good humoured it made my sister You know how that went off you know what came on in its place My brother then returned and we were all wrong again and Bella as I observed in my letters abovementioned had an opportunity to give herself the credit of having refused mister Lovelace on the score of his reputed faulty morals This united my brother and sister in one cause They set themselves on all occasions to depreciate mister Lovelace and his family too a family which deserves nothing but respect and this gave rise to the conversation I am leading to between my uncles and them of which I now come to give the particulars after I have observed that it happened before the rencounter and soon after the inquiry made into mister Lovelace s affairs had come out better than my brother and sister hoped it would See Letter IV They were bitterly inveighing against him in their usual way strengthening their invectives with some new stories in his disfavour when my uncle Antony having given them a patient hearing declared That he thought the gentleman behaved like a gentleman his niece Clary with prudence and that a more honourable alliance for the family as he had often told them could not be wished for since mister Lovelace had a very good paternal estate and that by the evidence of an enemy all clear Nor did it appear that he was so bad a man as he had been represented to be wild indeed but it was a gay time of life he was a man of sense and he was sure that his niece would not have him if she had not good reason to think him reformed or that there was a likelihood that she could reform him by her example My uncle then gave one instance my aunt told me as a proof of a generosity in mister Lovelace s spirit which convinced him that he was not a bad man in nature and that he was of a temper he was pleased to say like my own which was That when he my uncle had represented to him that he might if he pleased make three or four hundred pounds a year of his paternal estate more than he did he answered That his tenants paid their rents well that it was a maxim with his family from which he would by no means depart Never to rack rent old tenants or their descendants and that it was a pleasure to him to see all his tenants look fat sleek and contented I indeed had once occasionally heard him say something like this and thought he never looked so well as at that time except once and that was in an instance given by him on the following incident An unhappy tenant of my uncle Antony came petitioning to my uncle for forbearance in mister Lovelace s presence When he had fruitlessly withdrawn mister Lovelace pleaded his cause so well that the man was called in again and had his suit granted And mister Lovelace privately followed him out and gave him two guineas for present relief the man having declared that at the time he had not five shilling in the world On this occasion he told my uncle but without any airs of ostentation that he had once observed an old tenant and his wife in a very mean habit at church and questioning them about it the next day as he knew they had no hard bargain in their farm the man said he had done some very foolish things with a good intention which had put him behind hand and he could not have paid his rent and appear better He asked him how long it would take him to retrieve the foolish step he acknowledged he had made He said Perhaps two or three years Well then said he I will abate you five pounds a year for seven years provided you will lay it upon your wife and self that you may make a Sunday appearance like MY tenants Mean time take this putting his hand in his pocket and giving him five guineas to put yourselves in present plight and let me see you next Sunday at church hand in hand like an honest and loving couple and I bespeak you to dine with me afterwards Although this pleased me when I heard it as giving an instance of generosity and prudence at the same time not lessening as my uncle took notice the yearly value of the farm yet my dear I had no throbs no glows upon it Upon my word I had not Nevertheless I own to you that I could not help saying to myself on the occasion Were it ever to be my lot to have this man he would not hinder me from pursuing the methods I so much delight to take With A pity that such a man were not uniformly good Forgive me this digression My uncle went on as my aunt told me That besides his paternal estate he was the immediate heir to very splendid fortunes that when he was in treaty for his niece Arabella Lord M told him my uncle what great things he and his two half sisters intended to do for him in order to qualify him for the title which would be extinct at his Lordship s death and which they hoped to procure for him or a still higher that of those ladies father which had been for some time extinct on failure of heirs male that it was with this view that his relations were all so earnest for his marrying that as he saw not where mister Lovelace could better himself so truly he thought there was wealth enough in their own family to build up three considerable ones that therefore he must needs say he was the more desirous of this alliance as there was a great probability not only from mister Lovelace s descent but from his fortunes that his niece Clarissa might one day be a peeress of Great Britain and upon that prospect here was the mortifying stroke he should for his own part think it not wrong to make such dispositions as should contribute to the better support of the dignity My uncle Harlowe it seems far from disapproving of what his brother had said declared That there was but one objection to an alliance with mister Lovelace to wit his faulty morals especially as so much could be done for Miss Bella and for my brother too by my father and as my brother was actually possessed of a considerable estate by virtue of the deed of gift and will of his godmother Lovell Had I known this before I should the less have wondered at many things I have been unable to account for in my brother s and sister s behaviour to me and been more on my guard than I imagined there was a necessity to be You may easily guess how much this conversation affected my brother at the time He could not you know but be very uneasy to hear two of his stewards talk at this rate to his face He had from early days by his violent temper made himself both feared and courted by the whole family My father himself as I have lately mentioned very often long before my brother s acquisition had made him still more assuming gave way to him as to an only son who was to build up the name and augment the honour of it Little inducement therefore had my brother to correct a temper which gave him so much consideration with every body See Sister Bella said he in an indecent passion before my uncles on this occasion I have mentioned See how it is You and I ought to look about us This little syren is in a fair way to out uncle as she has already out grandfather d us both From this time as I now find it plain upon recollection did my brother and sister behave to me as to one who stood in their way and to each other as having but one interest and were resolved therefore to bend all their force to hinder an alliance from taking effect which they believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views And how was this to be done after such a declaration from both my uncles My brother found out the way My sister as I have said went hand in hand with him Between them the family union was broke and every one was made uneasy mister Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all but not being to be put out of his course by slights only personal affronts succeeded defiances next then the rencounter that as you have heard did the business And now if I do not oblige them my grandfather s estate is to be litigated with me and I who never designed to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me am to be as dependent upon my father s will as a daughter ought to be who knows not what is good for herself This is the language of the family now But if I will suffer myself to be prevailed upon how happy as they lay it out shall we all be Such presents am I to have such jewels and I cannot tell what from every one in the family Then mister Solmes s fortunes are so great and his proposals so very advantageous no relation whom he values that there will be abundant room to raise mine upon them were the high intended favours of my own relations to be quite out of the question Moreover it is now with this view found out that I have qualifications which of themselves will be a full equivalent to mister Solmes for the settlements he is to make and still leave him under an obligation to me for my compliance He himself thinks so I am told so very poor a creature is he even in his own eyes as well as in theirs These desirable views answered how rich how splendid shall we all three be And I what obligations shall I lay upon them all And that only by doing an act of duty so suitable to my character and manner of thinking if indeed I am the generous as well as dutiful creature I have hitherto made them believe I am This is the bright side that is turned to my father and uncles to captivate them but I am afraid that my brother s and sister s design is to ruin me with them at any rate Were it otherwise would they not on my return from you have rather sought to court than frighten me into measures which their hearts are so much bent to carry A method they have followed ever since Mean time orders are given to all the servants to shew the highest respect to mister Solmes the generous mister Solmes is now his character with some of our family But are not these orders a tacit confession that they think his own merit will not procure him respect He is accordingly in every visit he makes not only highly caressed by the principals of our family but obsequiously attended and cringed to by the menials And the noble settlements are echoed from every mouth Noble is the word used to enforce the offers of a man who is mean enough avowedly to hate and wicked enough to propose to rob of their just expectations his own family every one of which at the same time stands in too much need of his favour in order to settle all he is worth upon me and if I die without children and he has none by any other marriage upon a family which already abounds Such are his proposals But were there no other motive to induce me to despise the upstart man is not this unjust one to his family enough The upstart man I repeat for he was not born to the immense riches he is possessed of riches left by one niggard to another in injury to the next heir because that other is a niggard And should I not be as culpable do you think in my acceptance of such unjust settlements as he is in the offer of them if I could persuade myself to be a sharer in them or suffer a reversionary expectation of possessing them to influence my choice Indeed it concerns me not a little that my friends could be brought to encourage such offers on such motives as I think a person of conscience should not presume to begin the world with But this it seems is the only method that can be taken to disappoint mister Lovelace and at the same time to answer all my relations have wish for each of us And surely I will not stand against such an accession to the family as may happen from marrying mister Solmes since now a possibility is discovered which such a grasping mind as my brother s can easily turn into a probability that my grandfather s estate will revert to it with a much more considerable one of the man s own Instances of estates falling in in cases far more unlikely than this are insisted upon and my sister says in the words of an old saw It is good to be related to an estate While Solmes smiling no doubt to himself at a hope so remote by offers only obtains all their interests and doubts not to join to his own the estate I am envied for which for the conveniency of its situation between two of his will it seems be of twice the value to him that it would be of to any other person and is therefore I doubt not a stronger motive with him than the wife These my dear seem to me the principal inducements of my relations to espouse so vehemently as they do this man s suit And here once more must I deplore the family fault which gives those inducements such a force as it will be difficult to resist And thus far let matters with regard to mister Solmes and me come out as they will my brother has succeeded in his views that is to say he has in the first place got my FATHER to make the cause his own and to insist upon my compliance as an act of duty My MOTHER has never thought fit to oppose my father s will when once he has declared himself determined My UNCLES stiff unbroken highly prosperous bachelors give me leave to say though very worthy persons in the main have as high notions of a child s duty as of a wife s obedience in the last of which my mother s meekness has confirmed them and given them greater reason to expect the first My aunt HERVEY not extremely happy in her own nuptials and perhaps under some little obligation is got over and chuses sic not to open her lips in my favour against the wills of a father and uncles so determined This passiveness in my mother and in my aunt in a point so contrary to their own first judgments is too strong a proof that my father is absolutely resolved Their treatment of my worthy missus NORTON is a sad confirmation of it a woman deserving of all consideration for her wisdom and every body thinking so but who not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a point against which she has given her opinion and which they seem bent upon carrying is restrained from visiting here and even from corresponding with me as I am this very day informed Hatred to Lovelace family aggrandizement and this great motive paternal authority What a force united must they be supposed to have when singly each consideration is sufficient to carry all before it This is the formidable appearance which the address of this disagreeable man wears at present My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph They have got me down as Hannah overheard them exult And so they have yet I never knew that I was insolently up for now my brother will either lay me under an obligation to comply to my own unhappiness and so make me an instrument of his revenge upon Lovelace or if I refuse will throw me into disgrace with my whole family Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining courtiers against one another when a private family but three of which can possibly have clashing interests and one of them as she presumes to think above such low motives cannot be free from them What at present most concerns me is the peace of my mother s mind How can the husband of such a wife a good man too But oh this prerogative of manhood be so positive so unpersuadable to one who has brought into the family means which they know so well the value of that methinks they should value her the more for their sake They do indeed value her but I am sorry to say she has purchased that value by her compliances yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated prudence which ought of itself to be conformed to in every thing But whither roves my pen How dare a perverse girl take these liberties with relations so very respectable and whom she highly respects What an unhappy situation is that which obliges her in her own defence as it were to expose their failings But you who know how much I love and reverence my mother will judge what a difficulty I am under to be obliged to oppose a scheme which she has engaged in Yet I must oppose it to comply is impossible and must without delay declare my opposition or my difficulties will increase since as I am just now informed a lawyer has been this very day consulted Would you have believed it in relation to settlements Were ours a Roman Catholic family how much happier for me that they thought a nunnery would answer all their views How happy had not a certain person slighted somebody All then would have been probably concluded between them before my brother had arrived to thwart the match then had I a sister which now I have not and two brothers both aspiring possibly both titled while I should only have valued that in either which is above title that which is truly noble in both But by what a long reaching selfishness is my brother governed By what remote exceedingly remote views Views which it is in the power of the slightest accident of a fever for instance the seeds of which are always vegetating as I may say and ready to burst forth in his own impetuous temper or of the provoked weapon of an adversary to blow up and destroy I will break off here Let me write ever so freely of my friends I am sure of your kind construction and I confide in your discretion that you will avoid reading to or transcribing for others such passages as may have the appearance of treating too freely the parental or even the fraternal character or induce others to censure for a supposed failure in duty to the one or decency to the other Your truly affectionate CL HARLOWE LETTER XIV MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY EVENING MARCH two On Hannah s depositing my long letter begun yesterday but by reason of several interruptions not finished till within this hour she found and brought me yours of this day I thank you my dear for this kind expedition These few lines will perhaps be time enough deposited to be taken away by your servant with the other letter yet they are only to thank you and to tell you my increasing apprehensions I must take or seek the occasion to apply to my mother for her mediation for I am in danger of having a day fixed and antipathy taken for bashfulness Should not sisters be sisters to each other Should not they make a common cause of it as I may say a cause of sex on such occasions as the present Yet mine in support of my brother s selfishness and no doubt in concert with him has been urging in full assembly it seems and that with an earnestness peculiar to herself when she sets upon any thing that an absolute day be given me and if I comply not to be told that it shall be to the forfeiture of all my fortunes and of all their love She need not be so officious my brother s interest without hers is strong enough for he has found means to confederate all the family against me Upon some fresh provocation or new intelligence concerning mister Lovelace I know not what it is they have bound themselves or are to bind themselves by a signed paper to one another The Lord bless me my dear what shall I do to carry their point in favour of mister Solmes in support of my father s authority as it is called and against mister Lovelace as a libertine and an enemy to the family and if so I am sure I may say against me How impolitic in them all to join two people in one interest whom they wish for ever to keep asunder What the discharged steward reported of him is surely bad enough what missus Fortescue said not only confirms that bad but gives room to think him still worse And yet the something further which my friends have come at is of so heinous a nature as Betty Barnes tells Hannah that it proves him almost to be the worst of men But hang the man I had almost said What is he to me What would he be were not this mister Sol O my dear how I hate the man in the light he is proposed to me All of them at the same time are afraid of mister Lovelace yet not afraid to provoke him How am I entangled to be obliged to go on corresponding with him for their sakes Heaven forbid that their persisted in violence should so drive me as to make it necessary for my own But surely they will yield Indeed I cannot I believe the gentlest spirits when provoked causelessly and cruelly provoked are the most determined The reason may be that not taking up resolutions lightly their very deliberation makes them the more immovable And then when a point is clear and self evident how can one with patience think of entering into an argument or contention upon it An interruption obliges me to conclude myself in some hurry as well as fright what I must ever be Yours more than my own CLARISSA HARLOWE LETTER XV MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY MARCH three

2526-156076-0028	train-other-500	to keep in your own hands the estate bequeathed to you by your grandfather Had you done so it would have procured you at least an outward respect from your brother and sister which would have made them conceal the envy and ill will

HER PRECEDING NOT AT THAT TIME RECEIVED FRIDAY MARCH three O my dear friend I have had a sad conflict Trial upon trial conference upon conference But what law what ceremony can give a man a right to a heart which abhors him more than it does any living creature I hope my mother will be able to prevail for me But I will recount it all though I sit up the whole night to do it for I have a vast deal to write and will be as minute as you wish me to be I concluded my last in a fright It was occasioned by a conversation that passed between my mother and my aunt part of which Hannah overheard I need not give you the particulars since what I have to relate to you from different conversations that have passed between my mother and me in the space of a very few hours will include them all I will begin then I went down this morning when breakfast was ready with a very uneasy heart from what Hannah had informed me of yesterday afternoon wishing for an opportunity however to appeal to my mother in hopes to engage her interest in my behalf and purposing to try to find one when she retired to her own apartment after breakfast but unluckily there was the odious Solmes sitting asquat between my mother and sister with so much assurance in his looks But you know my dear that those we love not cannot do any thing to please us Had the wretch kept his seat it might have been well enough but the bend and broad shouldered creature must needs rise and stalk towards a chair which was just by that which was set for me I removed it to a distance as if to make way to my own and down I sat abruptly I believe what I had heard all in my head But this was not enough to daunt him The man is a very confident he is a very bold staring man Indeed my dear the man is very confident He took the removed chair and drew it so near mine squatting in it with his ugly weight that he pressed upon my hoop I was so offended all I had heard as I said in my head that I removed to another chair I own I had too little command of myself It gave my brother and sister too much advantage I day say they took it But I did it involuntarily I think I could not help it I knew not what I did I saw that my father was excessively displeased When angry no man s countenance ever shews it so much as my father s Clarissa Harlowe said he with a big voice and there he stopped Sir said I trembling and courtesying for I had not then sat down again and put my chair nearer the wretch and sat down my face as I could feel all in a glow Make tea child said my kind mamma sit by me love and make tea I removed with pleasure to the seat the man had quitted and being thus indulgently put into employment soon recovered myself and in the course of the breakfasting officiously asked two or three questions of mister Solmes which I would not have done but to make up with my father Proud spirits may be brought to Whisperingly spoke my sister to me over her shoulder with an air of triumph and scorn but I did not mind her My mother was all kindness and condescension I asked her once if she were pleased with the tea She said softly and again called me dear she was pleased with all I did I was very proud of this encouraging goodness and all blew over as I hoped between my father and me for he also spoke kindly to me two or three times Small accidents these my dear to trouble you with only as they lead to greater as you shall hear Before the usual breakfast time was over my father withdrew with my mother telling her he wanted to speak with her Then my sister and next my aunt who was with us dropt away My brother gave himself some airs of insult which I understood well enough but which mister Solmes could make nothing of and at last he arose from his seat Sister said he I have a curiosity to shew you I will fetch it And away he went shutting the door close after him I saw what all this was for I arose the man hemming up for a speech rising and beginning to set his splay feet indeed my dear the man in all his ways is hateful to me in an approaching posture I will save my brother the trouble of bringing to me his curiosity said I I courtesied Your servant sir The man cried Madam Madam twice and looked like a fool But away I went to find my brother to save my word But my brother indifferent as the weather was was gone to walk in the garden with my sister A plain case that he had left his curiosity with me and designed to shew me no other I had but just got into my own apartment and began to think of sending Hannah to beg an audience of my mother the more encouraged by her condescending goodness at breakfast when Shorey her woman brought me her commands to attend me in her closet My father Hannah told me was just gone out of it with a positive angry countenance Then I as much dreaded the audience as I had wished for it before I went down however but apprehending the subject she intended to talk to me upon approached her trembling and my heart in visible palpitations She saw my concern Holding out her kind arms as she sat Come kiss me my dear said she with a smile like a sun beam breaking through the cloud that overshadowed her naturally benign aspect Why flutters my jewel so This preparative sweetness with her goodness just before confirmed my apprehensions My mother saw the bitter pill wanted gilding O my Mamma was all I could say and I clasped my arms round her neck and my face sunk into her bosom My child my child restrain said she your powers of moving I dare not else trust myself with you And my tears trickled down her bosom as hers bedewed my neck O the words of kindness all to be expressed in vain that flowed from her lips Lift up your sweet face my best child my own Clarissa Harlowe O my daughter best beloved of my heart lift up a face so ever amiable to me Why these sobs Is an apprehended duty so affecting a thing that before I can speak But I am glad my love you can guess at what I have to say to you I am spared the pains of breaking to you what was a task upon me reluctantly enough undertaken to break to you Then rising she drew a chair near her own and made me sit down by her overwhelmed as I was with tears of apprehension of what she had to say and of gratitude for her truly maternal goodness to me sobs still my only language And drawing her chair still nearer to mine she put her arms round my neck and my glowing cheek wet with my tears close to her own Let me talk to you my child Since silence is your choice hearken to me and be silent You know my dear what I every day forego and undergo for the sake of peace Your papa is a very good man and means well but he will not be controuled nor yet persuaded You have sometimes seemed to pity me that I am obliged to give up every point Poor man his reputation the less for it mine the greater yet would I not have this credit if I could help it at so dear a rate to him and to myself You are a dutiful a prudent and a wise child she was pleased to say in hope no doubt to make me so you would not add I am sure to my trouble you would not wilfully break that peace which costs your mother so much to preserve Obedience is better than sacrifice O my Clary Harlowe rejoice my heart by telling me that I have apprehended too much I see your concern I see your perplexity I see your conflict loosing her arm and rising not willing I should see how much she herself was affected I will leave you a moment Answer me not for I was essaying to speak and had as soon as she took her dear cheek from mine dropt down on my knees my hands clasped and lifted up in a supplicating manner I am not prepared for your irresistible expostulation she was pleased to say I will leave you to recollection and I charge you on my blessing that all this my truly maternal tenderness be not thrown away upon you And then she withdrew into the next apartment wiping her eyes as she went from me as mine overflowed my heart taking in the whole compass of her meaning She soon returned having recovered more steadiness Still on my knees I had thrown my face across the chair she had sat in Look up to me my Clary Harlowe No sullenness I hope No indeed my ever to be revered Mamma And I arose I bent my knee She raised me No kneeling to me but with knees of duty and compliance Your heart not your knees must bend It is absolutely determined Prepare yourself therefore to receive your father when he visits you by and by as he would wish to receive you But on this one quarter of an hour depends the peace of my future life the satisfaction of all the family and your own security from a man of violence and I charge you besides on my blessing that you think of being missus Solmes There went the dagger to my heart and down I sunk and when I recovered found myself in the arms of my Hannah my sister s Betty holding open my reluctantly opened palm my laces cut my linen scented with hartshorn and my mother gone Had I been less kindly treated the hated name still forborne to be mentioned or mentioned with a little more preparation and reserve I had stood the horrid sound with less visible emotion But to be bid on the blessing of a mother so dearly beloved so truly reverenced to think of being missus SOLMES what a denunciation was that Shorey came in with a message delivered in her solemn way Your mamma Miss is concerned for your disorder she expects you down again in an hour and bid me say that she then hopes every thing from your duty I made no reply for what could I say And leaning upon my Hannah s arm withdrew to my own apartment There you will guess how the greatest part of the hour was employed Within that time my mother came up to me I love she was pleased to say to come into this apartment No emotions child No flutters Am I not your mother Do not discompose me by discomposing yourself Do not occasion me uneasiness when I would give you nothing but pleasure Come my dear we will go into your closet She took my hand led the way and made me sit down by her and after she had inquired how I did she began in a strain as if she supposed I had made use of the intervening space to overcome all my objections She was pleased to tell me that my father and she in order to spare my natural modesty had taken the whole affair upon themselves Hear me out and then speak He is not indeed every thing I wish him to be but he is a man of probity and has no vices No vices Madam Hear me out child You have not behaved much amiss to him we have seen with pleasure that you have not O Madam must I not now speak I shall have done presently A young creature of your virtuous and pious turn she was pleased to say cannot surely love a profligate you love your brother too well to wish to marry one who had like to have killed him and who threatened your uncles and defies us all You have had your own way six or seven times we want to secure you against a man so vile Tell me I have a right to know whether you prefer this man to all others Yet God forbid that I should know you do for such a declaration would make us all miserable Yet tell me are your affections engaged to this man I knew not what the inference would be if I said they were not You hesitate You answer me not You cannot answer me Rising Never more will I look upon you with an eye of favour O Madam Madam Kill me not with your displeasure I would not I need not hesitate one moment did I not dread the inference if I answer you as you wish Yet be that inference what it will your threatened displeasure will make me speak And I declare to you that I know not my own heart if it not be absolutely free And pray let me ask my dearest Mamma in what has my conduct been faulty that like a giddy creature I must be forced to marry to save me from From what Let me beseech you Madam to be the guardian of my reputation Let not your Clarissa be precipitated into a state she wishes not to enter into with any man And this upon a supposition that otherwise she shall marry herself and disgrace her whole family Well then Clary passing over the force of my plea if your heart be free O my beloved Mamma let the usual generosity of your dear heart operate in my favour Urge not upon me the inference that made me hesitate I won t be interrupted Clary You have seen in my behaviour to you on this occasion a truly maternal tenderness you have observed that I have undertaken the task with some reluctance because the man is not every thing and because I know you carry your notions of perfection in a man too high Dearest Madam this one time excuse me Is there then any danger that I should be guilty of an imprudent thing for the man s sake you hint at Again interrupted Am I to be questioned and argued with You know this won t do somewhere else You know it won t What reason then ungenerous girl can you have for arguing with me thus but because you think from my indulgence to you you may What can I say What can I do What must that cause be that will not bear being argued upon Again Clary Harlowe Dearest Madam forgive me it was always my pride and my pleasure to obey you But look upon that man see but the disagreeableness of his person Now Clary do I see whose person you have in your eye Now is mister Solmes I see but comparatively disagreeable disagreeable only as another man has a much more specious person But Madam are not his manners equally so Is not his person the true representative of his mind That other man is not shall not be any thing to me release me but from this one man whom my heart unbidden resists Condition thus with your father Will he bear do you think to be thus dialogued with Have I not conjured you as you value my peace What is it that I do not give up This very task because I apprehended you would not be easily persuaded is a task indeed upon me And will you give up nothing Have you not refused as many as have been offered to you If you would not have us guess for whom comply for comply you must or be looked upon as in a state of defiance with your whole family And saying this she arose and went from me But at the chamber door stopt and turned back I will not say below in what a disposition I leave you Consider of every thing The matter is resolved upon As you value your father s blessing and mine and the satisfaction of all the family resolve to comply I will leave you for a few moments I will come up to you again See that I find you as I wish to find you and since your heart is free let your duty govern it In about half an hour my mother returned She found me in tears She took my hand It is my part evermore said she to be of the acknowledging side I believe I have needlessly exposed myself to your opposition by the method I have taken with you I first began as if I expected a denial and by my indulgence brought it upon myself Do not my dearest Mamma do not say so Were the occasion for this debate proceeded she to have risen from myself were it in my power to dispense with your compliance you too well know what you can do with me Would any body my dear Miss Howe wish to marry who sees a wife of such a temper and blessed with such an understanding as my mother is noted for not only deprived of all power but obliged to be even active in bringing to bear a point of high importance which she thinks ought not to be insisted upon When I came to you a second time proceeded she knowing that your opposition would avail you nothing I refused to hear your reasons and in this I was wrong too because a young creature who loves to reason and used to love to be convinced by reason ought to have all her objections heard I now therefore this third time see you and am come resolved to hear all you have to say and let me my dear by my patience engage your gratitude your generosity I will call it because it is to you I speak who used to have a mind wholly generous Let me if your heart be really free let me see what it will induce you to do to oblige me and so as you permit your usual discretion to govern you I will hear all you have to say but with this intimation that say what you will it will be of no avail elsewhere What a dreadful saying is that But could I engage your pity Madam it would be somewhat You have as much of my pity as of my love But what is person Clary with one of your prudence and your heart disengaged Should the eye be disgusted when the heart is to be engaged O Madam who can think of marrying when the heart is shocked at the first appearance and where the disgust must be confirmed by every conversation afterwards This Clary is owing to your prepossession Let me not have cause to regret that noble firmness of mind in so young a creature which I thought your glory and which was my boast in your character In this instance it would be obstinacy and want of duty Have you not made objections to several That was to their minds to their principles Madam But this man Is an honest man Clary Harlowe He has a good mind He is a virtuous man He an honest man His a good mind Madam He a virtuous man Nobody denies these qualities Can he be an honest man who offers terms that will rob all his own relations of their just expectations Can his mind be good You Clary Harlowe for whose sake he offers so much are the last person who should make this observation Give me leave to say Madam that a person preferring happiness to fortune as I do that want not even what I have and can give up the use of that as an instance of duty No more no more of your merits You know you will be a gainer by that cheerful instance of your duty not a loser You know you have but cast your bread upon the waters so no more of that For it is not understood as a merit by every body I assure you though I think it a high one and so did your father and uncles at the time At the time Madam How unworthily do my brother and sister who are afraid that the favour I was so lately in I hear nothing against your brother and sister What family feuds have I in prospect at a time when I hoped to have most comfort from you all God bless my brother and sister in all their worthy views You shall have no family feuds if I can prevent them You yourself Madam shall tell me what I shall bear from them and I will bear it but let my actions not their misrepresentations as I am sure by the disgraceful prohibitions I have met with has been the case speak for me Just then up came my father with a sternness in his looks that made me tremble He took two or three turns about my chamber though pained by his gout and then said to my mother who was silent as soon as she saw him My dear you are long absent Dinner is near ready What you had to say lay in a very little compass Surely you have nothing to do but to declare your will and my will But perhaps you may be talking of the preparations Let us have you soon down Your daughter in your hand if worthy of the name And down he went casting his eye upon me with a look so stern that I was unable to say one word to him or even for a few minutes to my mother Was not this very intimidating my dear My mother seeing my concern seemed to pity me She called me her good child and kissed me and told me that my father should not know I had made such opposition He has kindly furnished us with an excuse for being so long together said she Come my dear dinner will be upon table presently Shall we go down And took my hand This made me start What Madam go down to let it be supposed we were talking of preparations O my beloved Mamma command me not down upon such a supposition You see child that to stay longer together will be owning that you are debating about an absolute duty and that will not be borne Did not your father himself some days ago tell you he would be obeyed I will a third time leave you I must say something by way of excuse for you and that you desire not to go down to dinner that your modesty on the occasion O Madam say not my modesty on such an occasion for that will be to give hope And design you not to give hope Perverse girl Rising and flinging from me take more time for consideration Since it is necessary take more time and when I see you next let me know what blame I have to cast upon myself or to bear from your father for my indulgence to you She made however a little stop at the chamber door and seemed to expect that I would have besought her to make the gentlest construction for me for hesitating she was pleased to say I suppose you would not have me make a report O Madam interrupted I whose favour can I hope for if I lose my mamma s To have desired a favourable report you know my dear would have been qualifying upon a point that I was too much determined upon to give room for any of my friends to think I have the least hesitation about it And so my mother went down stairs I will deposit thus far and as I know you will not think me too minute in the relation of particulars so very interesting to one you honour with your love proceed in the same way As matters stand I don t care to have papers so freely written about me Pray let Robert call every day if you can spare him whether I have any thing ready or not I should be glad you would not send him empty handed What a generosity will it be in you to write as frequently from friendship as I am forced to do from misfortune The letters being taken away will be an assurance that you have them As I shall write and deposit as I have opportunity the formality of super and sub scription will be excused For I need not say how much I am Your sincere and ever affectionate CL HARLOWE LETTER XVII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE My mother on her return which was as soon as she had dined was pleased to inform me that she told my father on his questioning her about my cheerul compliance for it seems the cheerful was all that was doubted that she was willing on so material a point to give a child whom she had so much reason to love as she condescended to acknowledge were her words liberty to say all that was in her heart to say that her compliance might be the freer letting him know that when he came up she was attending to my pleas for that she found I had rather not marry at all She told me that to this my father angrily said let her take care let her take care that she give me not ground to suspect her of a preference somewhere else But if it be to ease her heart and not to dispute my will you may hear her out So Clary said my mother I am returned in a temper accordingly and I hope you will not again by your peremptoriness shew me how I ought to treat you Indeed Madam you did me justice to say I have no inclination to marry at all I have not I hope made myself so very unuseful in my papa s family as No more of your merits Clary You have been a good child You have eased me of all the family cares but do not now give more than ever you relieved me from You have been amply repaid in the reputation your skill and management have given you but now there is soon to be a period to all those assistances from you If you marry there will be a natural and if to please us a desirable period because your own family will employ all your talents in that way if you do not there will be a period likewise but not a natural one you understand me child I wept I have made inquiry already after a housekeeper I would have had your good Norton but I suppose you will yourself wish to have the worthy woman with you If you desire it that shall be agreed upon for you But why dearest Madam why am I the youngest to be precipitated into a state that I am very far from wishing to enter into with any body You are going to question me I suppose why your sister is not thought of for mister Solmes I hope Madam it will not displease you if I were I might refer you for an answer to your father mister Solmes has reasons for preferring you And I have reasons Madam for disliking him And why I am This quickness upon me interrupted my mother is not to be borne I am gone and your father comes if I can do no good with you O Madam I would rather die than She put her hand to my mouth No peremptoriness Clary Harlowe once you declare yourself inflexible I have done I wept for vexation This is all all my brother s doings his grasping views No reflections upon your brother he has entirely the honour of the family at heart I would no more dishonour my family Madam than my brother would I believe it but I hope you will allow your father and me and your uncles to judge what will do it honour what dishonour I then offered to live single never to marry at all or never but with their full approbation If you mean to shew your duty and your obedience Clary you must shew it in our way not in your own I hope Madam that I have not so behaved hitherto as to render such a trial of my obedience necessary Yes Clary I cannot but say that you have hitherto behaved extremely well but you have had no trials till now and I hope that now you are called to one you will not fail in it Parents proceeded she when children are young are pleased with every thing they do You have been a good child upon the whole but we have hitherto rather complied with you than you with us Now that you are grown up to marriageable years is the test especially as your grandfather has made you independent as we may say in preference to those who had prior expectations upon that estate Madam my grandfather knew and expressly mentioned in his will his desire that my father will more than make it up to my sister I did nothing but what I thought my duty to procure his favour It was rather a mark of his affection than any advantage to me For do I either seek or wish to be independent Were I to be queen of the universe that dignity should not absolve me from my duty to you and to my father I would kneel for your blessings were it in the presence of millions so that I am loth to interrupt you Clary though you could more than once break in upon me You are young and unbroken but with all this ostentation of your duty I desire you to shew a little more deference to me when I am speaking I beg your pardon dear Madam and your patience with me on such an occasion as this If I did not speak with earnestness upon it I should be supposed to have only maidenly objections against a man I never can endure Clary Harlowe Dearest dearest Madam permit me to speak what I have to say this once It is hard it is very hard to be forbidden to enter into the cause of all these misunderstandings because I must not speak disrespectfully of one who supposes me in the way of his ambition and treats me like a slave Whither whither Clary My dearest Mamma My duty will not permit me so far to suppose my father arbitrary as to make a plea of that arbitrariness to you How now Clary O girl Your patience my dearest Mamma you were pleased to say you would hear me with patience PERSON in a man is nothing because I am supposed to be prudent so my eye is to be disgusted and my reason not convinced Girl girl Thus are my imputed good qualities to be made my punishment and I am to wedded to a monster Astonishing Can this Clarissa be from you The man Madam person and mind is a monster in my eye And that I may be induced to bear this treatment I am to be complimented with being indifferent to all men yet at other times and to serve other purposes be thought prepossessed in favour of a man against whose moral character lie just objections Confined as if like the giddiest of creatures I would run away with this man and disgrace my whole family O my dearest Mamma who can be patient under such treatment Now Clary I suppose you will allow me to speak I think I have had patience indeed with you Could I have thought but I will put all upon a short issue Your mother Clarissa shall shew you an example of that patience you so boldly claim from her without having any yourself O my dear how my mother s condescension distressed me at the time Infinitely more distressed me than rigour could have done But she knew she was to be sure aware that she was put upon a harsh upon an unreasonable service let me say or she would not she could not have had so much patience with me Let me tell you then proceeded she that all lies in a small compass as your father said You have been hitherto as you are pretty ready to plead a dutiful child You have indeed had no cause to be otherwise No child was ever more favoured Whether you will discredit all your past behaviour whether at a time and upon an occasion that the highest instance of duty is expected from you an instance that is to crown all and when you declare that your heart is free you will give that instance or whether having a view to the independence you may claim for so Clary whatever be your motive it will be judged and which any man you favour can assert for you against us all or rather for himself in spite of us whether I say you will break with us all and stand in defiance of a jealous father needlessly jealous I will venture to say of the prerogatives of his sex as to me and still ten times more jealous of the authority of a father this is now the point with us You know your father has made it a point and did he ever give up one he thought he had a right to carry Too true thought I to myself And now my brother has engaged my father his fine scheme will walk alone without needing his leading strings and it is become my father s will that I oppose not my brother s grasping views I was silent To say the truth I was just then sullenly silent My heart was too big I thought it was hard to be thus given up by my mother and that she should make a will so uncontroulable as my brother s her will My mother my dear though I must not say so was not obliged to marry against her liking My mother loved my father My silence availed me still less I see my dear said she that you are convinced Now my good child now my Clary do I love you It shall not be known that you have argued with me at all All shall be imputed to that modesty which has ever so much distinguished you You shall have the full merit of your resignation I wept She tenderly wiped the tears from my eyes and kissed my cheek Your father expects you down with a cheerful countenance but I will excuse your going All your scruples you see have met with an indulgence truly maternal from me I rejoice in the hope that you are convinced This indeed seems to be a proof of the truth of your agreeable declaration that your heart is free Did not this seem to border upon cruelty my dear in so indulgent a mother It would be wicked would it not to suppose my mother capable of art But she is put upon it and obliged to take methods to which her heart is naturally above stooping and all intended for my good because she sees that no arguing will be admitted any where else I will go down proceeded she and excuse your attendance at afternoon tea as I did to dinner for I know you will have some little reluctances to subdue I will allow you those and also some little natural shynesses and so you shall not come down if you chuse not to come down Only my dear do not disgrace my report when you come to supper And be sure behave as you used to do to your brother and sister for your behaviour to them will be one test of your cheerful obedience to us I advise as a friend you see rather than command as a mother So adieu my love And again she kissed me and was going O my dear Mamma said I forgive me But surely you cannot believe I can ever think of having that man She was very angry and seemed to be greatly disappointed She threatened to turn me over to my father and uncles she however bid me generously bid me consider what a handle I gave to my brother and sister if I thought they had views to serve by making my uncles dissatisfied with me I said she in a milder accent have early said all that I thought could be said against the present proposal on a supposition that you who have refused several other whom I own to be preferable as to person would not approve of it and could I have succeeded you Clary had never heard of it But if I could not how can you expect to prevail My great ends in the task I have undertaken are the preservation of the family peace so likely to be overturned to reinstate you in the affections of your father and uncles and to preserve you from a man of violence Your father you must needs think will flame out upon your refusal to comply your uncles are so thoroughly convinced of the consistency of the measure with their favourite views of aggrandizing the family that they are as much determined as your father your aunt Hervey and your uncle Hervey are of the same party And it is hard if a father and mother and uncles and aunt all conjoined cannot be allowed to direct your choice surely my dear girl proceeded she for I was silent all this time it cannot be that you are the more averse because the family views will be promoted by the match this I assure you is what every body must think if you comply not Nor while the man so obnoxious to us all remains unmarried and buzzes about you will the strongest wishes to live single be in the least regarded And well you know that were mister Lovelace an angel and your father had made it a point that you should not have him it would be in vain to dispute his will As to the prohibition laid upon you much as I will own against my liking that is owing to the belief that you corresponded by Miss Howe s means with that man nor do I doubt that you did so I answered to every article in such a manner as I am sure would have satisfied her could she have been permitted to judge for herself and I then inveighed with bitterness against the disgraceful prohibitions laid upon me They would serve to shew me she was pleased to say how much in earnest my father was They might be taken off whenever I thought fit and no harm done nor disgrace received But if I were to be contumacious I might thank myself for all that would follow I sighed I wept I was silent Shall I Clary said she shall I tell your father that these prohibitions are as unnecessary as I hoped they would be That you know your duty and will not offer to controvert his will What say you my love O Madam what can I say to questions so indulgently put I do indeed know my duty no creature in the world is more willing to practise it but pardon me dearest Madam if I say that I must bear these prohibitions if I am to pay so dear to have them taken off Determined and perverse my dear mamma called me and after walking twice or thrice in anger about the room she turned to me Your heart free Clarissa How can you tell me your heart is free Such extraordinary prepossessions to a particular person must be owing to extraordinary prepossessions in another s favour Tell me Clary and tell me truly Do you not continue to correspond with mister Lovelace Dearest Madam replied I you know my motives to prevent mischief I answered his letters The reasons for our apprehensions of this sort are not over I own to you Clary although now I would not have it known that I once thought a little qualifying among such violent spirits was not amiss I did not know but all things would come round again by the mediation of Lord M and his two sisters but as they all three think proper to resent for their nephew and as their nephew thinks fit to defy us all and as terms are offered on the other hand that could not be asked which will very probably prevent your grandfather s estate going out of the family and may be a means to bring still greater into it I see not that the continuance of your correspondence with him either can or ought to be permitted I therefore now forbid it to you as you value my favour Be pleased Madam only to advise me how to break it off with safety to my brother and uncles and it is all I wish for Would to heaven the man so hated had not the pretence to make of having been too violently treated when he meant peace and reconciliation It would always have been in my own power to have broke with him His reputed immoralities would have given me a just pretence at any time to do so But Madam as my uncles and my brother will keep no measures as he has heard what the view is and his regard for me from resenting their violent treatment of him and his family what can I do Would you have me Madam make him desperate The law will protect us child offended magistracy will assert itself But Madam may not some dreadful mischief first happen The law asserts not itself till it is offended You have made offers Clary if you might be obliged in the point in question Are you really in earnest were you to be complied with to break off all correspondence with mister Lovelace Let me know this Indeed I am and I will You Madam shall see all the letters that have passed between us You shall see I have given him no encouragement independent of my duty And when you have seen them you will be better able to direct me how on the condition I have offered to break entirely with him I take you at your word Clarissa Give me his letters and the copies of yours I am sure Madam you will keep the knowledge that I write and what I write No conditions with your mother surely my prudence may be trusted to I begged her pardon and besought her to take the key of the private drawer in my escritoire where they lay that she herself might see that I had no reserves to my mother She did and took all his letters and the copies of mine Unconditioned with she was pleased to say they shall be yours again unseen by any body else I thanked her and she withdrew to read them saying she would return them when she had You my dear have seen all the letters that passed between mister Lovelace and me till my last return from you You have acknowledged that he has nothing to boast of from them Three others I have received since by the private conveyance I told you of the last I have not yet answered In these three as in those you have seen after having besought my favour and in the most earnest manner professed the ardour of his passion for me and set forth the indignities done him the defiances my brother throws out against him in all companies the menaces and hostile appearance of my uncles wherever they go and the methods they take to defame him he declares That neither his own honour nor the honour of his family involved as that is in the undistinguishing reflection cast upon him for an unhappy affair which he would have shunned but could not permit him to bear these confirmed indignities that as my inclinations if not favourable to him cannot be nor are to such a man as the newly introduced Solmes he is interested the more to resent my brother s behaviour who to every body avows his rancour and malice and glories in the probability he has through the address of this Solmes of mortifying me and avenging himself on him that it is impossible he should not think himself concerned to frustrate a measure so directly levelled at him had he not a still higher motive for hoping to frustrate it that I must forgive him if he enter into conference with Solmes upon it He earnestly insists upon what he has so often proposed that I will give him leave in company with Lord M to wait upon my uncles and even upon my father and he promises patience if new provocations absolutely beneath a man to bear be not given which by the way I am far from being able to engage for In my answer I absolutely declare as I tell him I have often done That he is to expect no favour from me against the approbation of my friends that I am sure their consents for his visiting any of them will never be obtained that I will not be either so undutiful or so indiscreet as to suffer my interests to be separated from the interests of my family for any man upon earth that I do not think myself obliged to him for the forbearance I desire one flaming spirit to have with others that in this desire I require nothing of him but what prudence justice and the laws of his country require that if he has any expectations of favour from me on that account he deceives himself that I have no inclination as I have often told him to change my condition that I cannot allow myself to correspond with him any longer in this clandestine manner it is mean low undutiful I tell him and has a giddy appearance which cannot be excused that therefore he is not to expect that I will continue it To this in his last among other things he replies That if I am actually determined to break off all correspondence with him he must conclude that it is with a view to become the wife of a man whom no woman of honour and fortune can think tolerable And in that case I must excuse him for saying that he shall neither be able to bear the thoughts of losing for ever a person in whom all his present and all his future hopes are centred nor support himself with patience under the insolent triumphs of my brother upon it But that nevertheless he will not threaten either his own life or that of any other man He must take his resolutions as such a dreaded event shall impel him at the time If he shall know that it will have my consent he must endeavour to resign to his destiny but if it be brought about by compulsion he shall not be able to answer for the consequence I will send you these letters for your perusal in a few days I would enclose them but that it is possible something may happen which may make my mother require to re peruse them When you see them you will observe how he endeavours to hold me to this correspondence In about an hour my mother returned Take your letters Clary I have nothing she was pleased to say to tax your discretion with as to the wording of yours to him you have even kept up a proper dignity as well as observed all the rules of decorum and you have resented as you ought to resent his menacing invectives In a word I see not that he can form the least expectations from what you have written that you will encourage the passion he avows for you But does he not avow his passion Have you the least doubt about what must be the issue of this correspondence if continued And do you yourself think when you know the avowed hatred of one side and he declared defiances of the other that this can be that it ought to be a match By no means it can Madam you will be pleased to observed that I have said as much to him But now Madam that the whole correspondence is before you I beg your commands what to do in a situation so very disagreeable One thing I will tell you Clary but I charge you as you would not have me question the generosity of your spirit to take no advantage of it either mentally or verbally that I am so much pleased with the offer of your keys to me made in so cheerful and unreserved a manner and in the prudence you have shewn in your letters that were it practicable to bring every one or your father only into my opinion I should readily leave all the rest to your discretion reserving only to myself the direction or approbation of your future letters and to see that you broke off the correspondence as soon as possible But as it is not and as I know your father would have no patience with you should it be acknowledged that you correspond with mister Lovelace or that you have corresponded with him since the time he prohibited you to do so I forbid you to continue such a liberty Yet as the case is difficult let me ask you What you yourself can propose Your heart you say is free Your own that you cannot think as matters circumstanced that a match with a man so obnoxious as he now is to us all is proper to be thought of What do you propose to do What Clary are your own thoughts of the matter Without hesitation thus I answered What I humbly propose is this That I will write to mister Lovelace for I have not answered his last that he has nothing to do between my father and me that I neither ask his advice nor need it but that since he thinks he has some pretence for interfering because of my brother s avowal of the interest of mister Solmes in displeasure to him I will assure him without giving him any reason to impute the assurance to be in the least favourable to himself that I will never be that man s And if proceeded I I may never be permitted to give him this assurance and mister Solmes in consequence of it be discouraged from prosecuting his address let mister Lovelace be satisfied or dissatisfied I will go no farther nor write another line to him nor ever see him more if I can avoid it and I shall have a good excuse for it without bringing in any of my family Ah my love But what shall we do about the terms mister Solmes offers Those are the inducements with every body He has even given hopes to your brother that he will make exchanges of estates or at least that he will purchase the northern one for you know it must be entirely consistent with the family views that we increase our interest in this country Your brother in short has given a plan that captivates us all And a family so rich in all its branches and that has its views to honour must be pleased to see a very great probability of taking rank one day among the principal in the kingdom And for the sake of these views for the sake of this plan of my brother s am I Madam to be given in marriage to a man I can never endure O my dear Mamma save me save me if you can from this heavy evil I had rather be buried alive indeed I had than have that man She chid me for my vehemence but was so good as to tell me That she would sound my uncle Harlowe who was then below and if he encouraged her or would engage to second her she would venture to talk to my father herself and I should hear further in the morning She went down to tea and kindly undertook to excuse my attendance at supper But is it not a sad thing I repeat to be obliged to stand in opposition to the will of such a mother Why as I often say to myself was such a man as this Solmes fixed upon The only man in the world surely that could offer so much and deserve so little Little indeed does he deserve Why my dear the man has the most indifferent of characters Every mouth is opened against him for his sordid ways A foolish man to be so base minded When the difference between the obtaining of a fame for generosity and incurring the censure of being a miser will not prudently managed cost fifty pounds a year What a name have you got at a less expense And what an opportunity had he of obtaining credit at a very small one succeeding such a wretched creature as Sir Oliver in fortunes so vast Yet has he so behaved that the common phrase is applied to him That Sir Oliver will never be dead while mister Solmes lives The world as I have often thought ill natured as it is said to be is generally more just in characters speaking by what it feels than is usually apprehended and those who complain most of its censoriousness perhaps should look inwardly for the occasion oftener than they do My heart is a little at ease on the hopes that my mother will be able to procure favour for me and a deliverance from this man and so I have leisure to moralize But if I had not I should not forbear to intermingle occasionally these sorts of remarks because you command me never to omit them when they occur to my mind and not to be able to make them even in a more affecting situation when one sits down to write would shew one s self more engaged to self and to one s own concerns than attentive to the wishes of a friend If it be said that it is natural so to be what makes that nature on occasions where a friend may be obliged or reminded of a piece of instruction which writing down one s self may be the better for but a fault which it would set a person above nature to subdue LETTER XVIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SAT MAR four Would you not have thought something might have been obtained in my favour from an offer so reasonable from an expedient so proper as I imagine to put a tolerable end as from myself to a correspondence I hardly know how otherwise with safety to some of my family to get rid of But my brother s plan which my mother spoke of and of which I have in vain endeavoured to procure a copy with a design to take it to pieces and expose it as I question not there is room to do joined with my father s impatience of contradiction are irresistible I have not been in bed all night nor am I in the least drowsy Expectation and hope and doubt an uneasy state kept me sufficiently wakeful I stept down at my usual time that it might not be known I had not been in bed and gave directions in the family way About eight o clock Shorey came to me from my mother with orders to attend her in her chamber My mother had been weeping I saw by her eyes but her aspect seemed to be less tender and less affectionate than the day before and this as soon as I entered into her presence struck me with an awe which gave a great damp to my spirits Sit down Clary Harlowe I shall talk to you by and by and continued looking into a drawer among laces and linens in a way neither busy nor unbusy I believe it was a quarter of an hour before she spoke to me my heart throbbing with the suspense all the time and then she asked me coldly What directions I had given for the day I shewed her the bill of fare for this day and to morrow if I said it pleased her to approve of it She made a small alteration in it but with an air so cold and so solemn as added to my emotions mister Harlowe talks of dining out to day I think at my brother Antony s mister Harlowe Not my father Have I not then a father thought I Sit down when I bid you I sat down You look very sullen Clary I hope not Madam If children would always be children parents And there she stopt She then went to her toilette and looked into the glass and gave half a sigh the other half as if she would not have sighed if she could have helped it she gently hem d away I don t love to see the girl look so sullen Indeed Madam I am not sullen And I arose and turning from her drew out my handkerchief for the tears ran down my cheeks I thought by the glass before me I saw the mother in her softened eye cast towards me But her words confirmed not the hoped for tenderness One of the most provoking things in this world is to have people cry for what they can help I wish to heaven I could Madam And I sobbed again Tears of penitence and sobs of perverseness are mighty well suited You may go up to your chamber I shall talk with you by and by I courtesied with reverence Mock me not with outward gestures of respect The heart Clary is what I want Indeed Madam you have it It is not so much mine as my Mamma s Fine talking As somebody says If words were to pass for duty Clarissa Harlowe would be the dutifulest child breathing God bless that somebody Be it whom it will God bless that somebody And I courtesied and pursuant to her last command was going She seemed struck but was to be angry with me So turning from me she spoke with quickness Whither now Clary Harlowe You commanded me Madam to go to my chamber I see you are very ready to go out of my presence Is your compliance the effect of sullenness or obedience You are very ready to leave me I could hold no longer but threw myself at her feet O my dearest Mamma Let me know all I am to suffer Let me know what I am to be I will bear it if I can bear it but your displeasure I cannot bear Leave me leave me Clary Harlowe No kneeling Limbs so supple Will so stubborn Rise I tell you I cannot rise I will disobey my Mamma when she bids me leave her without being reconciled to me No sullens my Mamma no perverseness but worse than either this is direct disobedience Yet tear not yourself from me wrapping my arms about her as I kneeled she struggling to get from me my face lifted up to hers with eyes running over that spoke not my heart if they were not all humility and reverence You must not must not tear yourself from me for still the dear lady struggled and looked this way and that all in a sweet disorder as if she knew not what to do I will neither rise nor leave you nor let you go till you say you are not angry with me O thou ever moving child of my heart folding her dear arms about my neck as mine embraced her knees Why was this task But leave me You have discomposed me beyond expression Leave me my dear I won t be angry with you if I can help it if you ll be good I arose trembling and hardly knowing what I did or how I stood or walked withdrew to my chamber My Hannah followed me as soon as she heard me quit my mother s presence and with salts and spring water just kept me from fainting and that was as much as she could do It was near two hours before I could so far recover myself as to take up my pen to write to you how unhappily my hopes have ended My mother went down to breakfast I was not fit to appear but if I had been better I suppose I should not have been sent for since the permission for my attending her down was given by my father when in my chamber only on condition that she found me worthy of the name of daughter That I doubt I shall never be in his opinion if he be not brought to change his mind as to this mister Solmes LETTER XIX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE IN ANSWER TO LETTER XV SAT MARCH four twelve O CLOCK Hannah has just now brought me from the usual place your favour of yesterday The contents of it have made me very thoughtful and you will have an answer in my gravest style I to have that mister Solmes No indeed I will sooner But I will write first to those passages in your letter which are less concerning that I may touch upon this part with more patience As to what you mention of my sister s value for mister Lovelace I am not very much surprised at it She takes such officious pains and it is so much her subject to have it thought that she never did and never could like him that she gives but too much room to suspect that she does She never tells the story of their parting and of her refusal of him but her colour rises she looks with disdain upon me and mingles anger with the airs she gives herself anger as well as airs demonstrating that she refused a man whom she thought worth accepting Where else is the reason either for anger or boast Poor Bella She is to be pitied she cannot either like or dislike with temper Would to heaven she had been mistress of all her wishes Would to heaven she had As to what you say of my giving up to my father s controul the estate devised me my motives at the time as you acknowledge were not blamable Your advice to me on the subject was grounded as I remember on your good opinion of me believing that I should not make a bad use of the power willed me Neither you nor I my dear although you now assume the air of a diviner pardon me could have believed that would have happened which has happened as to my father s part particularly You were indeed jealous of my brother s views against me or rather of his predominant love of himself but I did not think so hardly of my brother and sister as you always did You never loved them and ill will has eyes ever open to the faulty side as good will or love is blind even to real imperfections I will briefly recollect my motives I found jealousies and uneasiness rising in every breast where all before was unity and love The honoured testator was reflected upon a second childhood was attributed to him and I was censured as having taken advantage of it All young creatures thought I more or less covet independency but those who wish most for it are seldom the fittest to be trusted either with the government of themselves or with power over others This is certainly a very high and unusual devise to so young a creature We should not aim at all we have power to do To take all that good nature or indulgence or good opinion confers shews a want of moderation and a graspingness that is unworthy of that indulgence and are bad indications of the use that may be made of the power bequeathed It is true thought I that I have formed agreeable schemes of making others as happy as myself by the proper discharge of the stewardship intrusted to me Are not all estates stewardships my dear But let me examine myself Is not vanity or secret love of praise a principal motive with me at the bottom Ought I not to suspect my own heart If I set up for myself puffed up with every one s good opinion may I not be left to myself Every one s eyes are upon the conduct upon the visits upon the visiters of a young creature of our sex made independent And are not such subjected more than any others to the attempts of enterprisers and fortune seekers And then left to myself should I take a wrong step though with ever so good an intention how many should I have to triumph over me how few to pity me The more of the one and the fewer of the other for having aimed at excelling These were some of my reflections at the time and I have no doubt but that in the same situation I should do the very same thing and that upon the maturest deliberation Who can command or foresee events To act up to our best judgments at the time is all we can do If I have erred tis to worldly wisdom only that I have erred If we suffer by an act of duty or even by an act of generosity is it not pleasurable on reflection that the fault is in others rather than in ourselves I had much rather have reason to think others unkind than that they should have any to think me undutiful And so my dear I am sure had you And now for the most concerning part of your letter You think I must of necessity as matters are circumstanced be Solmes s wife I will not be very rash my dear in protesting to the contrary but I think it never can and what is still more never ought to be My temper I know is depended upon But I have heretofore said that I have something in me of my father s family as well as of my mother s And have I any encouragement to follow too implicitly the example which my mother sets of meekness and resignedness to the wills of others Is she not for ever obliged as she was pleased to hint to me to be of the forbearing side In my mother s case your observation I must own is verified that those who will bear much shall have much to bear What is it as she says that she has not sacrificed to peace Yet has she by her sacrifices always found the peace she has deserved to find Indeed no I am afraid the very contrary And often and often have I had reason on her account to reflect that we poor mortals by our over solicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond of frequently lose the benefits we propose to ourselves from them since the designing and encroaching finding out what we most fear to forfeit direct their batteries against these our weaker places and making an artillery if I may so phrase it of our hopes and fears play upon us at their pleasure See Letter IX See Letter X Steadiness of mind a quality which the ill bred and censorious deny to any of our sex when we are absolutely convinced of being in the right otherwise it is not steadiness but obstinacy and when it is exerted in material cases is a quality which as my good doctor Lewen was wont to say brings great credit to the possessor of it at the same time that it usually when tried and known raises such above the attempts of the meanly machinating He used therefore to inculcate upon me this steadiness upon laudable convictions And why may I not think that I am now put upon a proper exercise of it I said above that I never can be that I never ought to be missus Solmes I repeat that I ought not for surely my dear I should not give up to my brother s ambition the happiness of my future life Surely I ought not to be the instrument of depriving mister Solmes s relations of their natural rights and reversionary prospects for the sake of further aggrandizing a family although that I am of which already lives in great affluence and splendour and which might be as justly dissatisfied were all that some of it aim at to be obtained that they were not princes as now they are that they are not peers For when ever was an ambitious mind as you observe in the case of avarice satisfied by acquisition The less surely ought I to give into these grasping views of my brother as I myself heartily despise the end aimed at as I wish not either to change my state or better my fortunes and as I am fully persuaded that happiness and riches are two things and very seldom meet together See Letter X Yet I dread I exceedingly dread the conflicts I know I must encounter with It is possible that I may be more unhappy from the due observation of the good doctor s general precept than were I to yield the point since what I call steadiness is deemed stubbornness obstinacy prepossession by those who have a right to put what interpretation they please upon my conduct So my dear were we perfect which no one can be we could not be happy in this life unless those with whom we have to deal those more especially who have any controul upon us were governed by the same principles But then does not the good Doctor s conclusion recur That we have nothing to do but to chuse what is right to be steady in the pursuit of it and to leave the issue to Providence This if you approve of my motives and if you don t pray inform me must be my aim in the present case But what then can I plead for a palliation to myself of my mother s sufferings on my account Perhaps this consideration will carry some force with it That her difficulties cannot last long only till this great struggle shall be one way or other determined Whereas my unhappiness if I comply will from an aversion not to be overcome be for life To which let me add That as I have reason to think that the present measures are not entered upon with her own natural liking she will have the less pain should they want the success which I think in my heart they ought to want I have run a great length in a very little time The subject touched me to the quick My reflections upon it will give you reason to expect from me a perhaps too steady behaviour in a new conference which I find I must have with my mother My father and brother as she was pleased to tell me dine at my uncle Antony s and that as I have reason to believe on purpose to give an opportunity for it Hannah informs me that she heard my father high and angry with my mother at taking leave of her I suppose for being to favourable to me for Hannah heard her say as in tears Indeed mister Harlowe you greatly distress me The poor girl does not deserve Hannah heard no more but that he said he would break somebody s heart Mine I suppose Not my mother s I hope As only my sister dines with my mother I thought I should have been commanded down but she sent me up a plate from her table I continued my writing I could not touch a morsel I ordered Hannah however to eat of it that I might not be thought sullen Before I conclude this I will see whether any thing offers from either of my private correspondencies that will make it proper to add to it and will take a turn in the wood yard and garden for that purpose I am stopped Hannah shall deposit this She was ordered by my mother who asked where I was to tell me that she would come up and talk with me in my own closet She is coming Adieu my dear LETTER XX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SAT AFTERNOON The expected conference is over but my difficulties are increased This as my mother was pleased to tell me being the last persuasory effort that is to be attempted I will be particular in the account of it as my head and my heart will allow it to be I have made said she as she entered my room a short as well as early dinner on purpose to confer with you and I do assure you that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or inclined to hold with you on the subject if you should prove as refractory as it is imagined you will prove by some who are of opinion that I have not the weight with you which my indulgence deserves But I hope you will convince as well them as me of the contrary Your father both dines and sups at your uncle s on purpose to give us this opportunity and according to the report I shall make on his return which I have promised shall be a very faithful one he will take his measures with you I was offering to speak Hear Clarissa what I have to tell you said she before you speak unless what you have to say will signify to me your compliance Say Will it If it will you may speak I was silent She looked with concern and anger upon me No compliance I find Such a dutiful young creature hitherto Will you not can you not speak as I would have you speak Then rejecting me as it were with her hand continue silent I no more than your father will bear your avowed contradiction She paused with a look of expectation as if she waited for my consenting answer I was still silent looking down the tears in my eyes O thou determined girl But say Speak out Are you resolved to stand in opposition to us all in a point our hearts are set upon May I Madam be permitted to expostulate To what purpose expostulate with me Clarissa Your father is determined Have I not told you there is no receding that the honour as well as the interest of the family is concerned Be ingenuous you used to be so even occasionally against yourself Who at the long run must submit all of us to you or you to all of us If you intend to yield at last if you find you cannot conquer yield now and with a grace for yield you must or be none of our child I wept I knew not what to say or rather how to express what I had to say Take notice that there are flaws in your grandfather s will not a shilling of that estate will be yours if you do not yield Your grandfather left it to you as a reward of your duty to him and to us You will justly forfeit it if Permit me good Madam to say that if it were unjustly bequeathed me I ought not to wish to have it But I hope mister Solmes will be apprised of these flaws This is very pertly said Clarissa but reflect that the forfeiture of that estate through your opposition will be attended with the total loss of your father s favour and then how destitute must you be how unable to support yourself and how many benevolent designs and good actions must you give up I must accommodate myself Madam in the latter case to my circumstance much only is required where much is given It becomes me to be thankful for what I have had I have reason to bless you Madam and my good missus Norton for bringing me up to be satisfied with little with much less I will venture to say than my father s indulgence annually confers upon me And then I thought of the old Roman and his lentils What perverseness said my mother But if you depend upon the favour of either or both of your uncles vain will be that dependence they will give you up I do assure you if your father does and absolutely renounce you I am sorry Madam that I have had so little merit as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts but I will love and honour them as long as I live All this Clarissa makes your prepossession in a certain man s favour the more evident Indeed your brother and sister cannot go any where but they hear of these prepossessions It is a great grief to me Madam to be made the subject of the public talk but I hope you will have the goodness to excuse me for observing that the authors of my disgrace within doors the talkers of my prepossession without and the reporters of it from abroad are originally the same persons She severely chid me for this I received her rebukes in silence You are sullen Clarissa I see you are sullen And she walked about the room in anger Then turning to me You can bear the imputation of sullenness I see You have no concern to clear yourself of it I was afraid of telling you all I was enjoined to tell you in case you were to be unpersuadable but I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy of your gentleness than I needed to have it cannot discompose so steady so inflexible a young creature to be told as I now tell you that the settlements are actually drawn and that you will be called down in a very few days to hear them read and to sign them for it is impossible if your heart be free that you can make the least objection to them except it will be an objection with you that they are so much in your favour and in the favour of all our family I was speechless absolutely speechless Although my heart was ready to burst yet could I neither weep nor speak I am sorry said she for your averseness to this match match she was pleased to call it but there is no help The honour and interest of the family as your aunt has told you and as I have told you are concerned and you must comply I was still speechless She folded the warm statue as she was pleased to call me in her arms and entreated me for heaven s sake to comply Speech and tears were lent me at the same time You have given me life Madam said I clasping my uplifted hands together and falling on one knee a happy one till now has your goodness and my papa s made it O do not do not make all the remainder of it miserable Your father replied she is resolved not to see you till he sees you as obedient a child as you used to be You have never been put to a test till now that deserved to be called a test This is this must be my last effort with you Give me hope my dear child my peace is concerned I will compound with you but for hope and yet your father will not be satisfied without an implicit and even a cheerful obedience Give me but hope child To give you hope my dearest my most indulgent Mamma is to give you every thing Can I be honest if I give a hope that I cannot confirm She was very angry She again called me perverse she upbraided me with regarding only my own prepossessions and respecting not either her peace of mind or my own duty It is a grating thing said she for the parents of a child who delighted in her in all the time of her helpless infancy and throughout every stage of her childhood and in every part of her education to womanhood because of the promises she gave of proving the most grateful and dutiful of children to find just when the time arrived which should crown their wishes that child stand in the way of her own happiness and her parents comfort and refusing an excellent offer and noble settlements give suspicions to her anxious friends that she would become the property of a vile rake and libertine who be the occasion what it will defies her family and has actually embrued his hands in her brother s blood I have had a very hard time of it said she between your father and you for seeing your dislike I have more than once pleaded for you but all to no purpose I am only treated as a too fond mother who from motives of a blamable indulgence encourage a child to stand in opposition to a father s will I am charged with dividing the family into two parts I and my youngest daughter standing against my husband his two brothers my son my eldest daughter and my sister Hervey I have been told that I must be convinced of the fitness as well as advantage to the whole your brother and mister Lovelace out of the question of carrying the contract with mister Solmes on which so many contracts depend into execution Your father s heart I tell you once more is in it he has declared that he had rather have no daughter in you than one he cannot dispose of for your own good especially if you have owned that your heart is free and as the general good of his whole family is to be promoted by your obedience He has pleaded poor man that his frequent gouty paroxysms every fit more threatening than the former give him no extraordinary prospects either of worldly happiness or of long days and he hopes that you who have been supposed to have contributed to the lengthening of your grandfather s life will not by your disobedience shorten your father s This was a most affecting plea my dear I wept in silence upon it I could not speak to it And my mother proceeded What therefore can be his motives Clary Harlowe in the earnest desire he has to see this treaty perfected but the welfare and aggrandizement of his family which already having fortunes to become the highest condition cannot but aspire to greater distinctions However slight such views as these may appear to you Clary you know that they are not slight ones to any other of the family and your father will be his own judge of what is and what is not likely to promote the good of his children Your abstractedness child affectation of abstractedness some call it savours let me tell you of greater particularity than we aim to carry Modesty and humility therefore will oblige you rather to mistrust yourself of peculiarity than censure views which all the world pursues as opportunity offers I was still silent and she proceeded It is owing to the good opinion Clary which your father has of you and of your prudence duty and gratitude that he engaged for your compliance in your absence before you returned from Miss Howe and that he built and finished contracts upon it which cannot be made void or cancelled But why then thought I did they receive me on my return from Miss Howe with so much intimidating solemnity To be sure my dear this argument as well as the rest was obtruded upon my mother She went on Your father has declared that your unexpected opposition unexpected she was pleased to call it and mister Lovelace s continued menaces and insults more and more convince him that a short day is necessary in order to put an end to all that man s hopes and to his own apprehensions resulting from the disobedience of a child so favoured He has therefore actually ordered patterns of the richest silks to be sent for from London I started I was out of breath I gasped at this frightful precipitance I was going to open with warmth against it I knew whose the happy expedient must be female minds I once heard my brother say that could but be brought to balance on the change of their state might easily be determined by the glare and splendour of the nuptial preparations and the pride of becoming the mistress of a family But she was pleased to hurry on that I might not have time to express my disgusts at such a communication to this effect Your father therefore my Clary cannot either for your sake or his own labour under a suspense so affecting to his repose He has even thought fit to acquaint me on my pleading for you that it becomes me as I value my own peace how harsh to such a wife and as I wish that he does not suspect that I secretly favour the address of a vile rake a character which all the sex he is pleased to say virtuous and vicious are but too fond of to exert my authority over you and that this I may the less scrupulously do as you have owned the old string that your heart is free Unworthy reflection in my mother s case surely this of our sex s valuing a libertine since she made choice of my father in preference to several suitors of equal fortune because they were of inferior reputation for morals Your father added she at his going out told me what he expected from me in case I found out that I had not the requisite influence upon you It was this That I should directly separate myself from you and leave you singly to take the consequence of your double disobedience I therefore entreat you my dear Clarissa concluded she and that in the most earnest and condescending manner to signify to your father on his return your ready obedience and this as well for my sake as your own Affected by my mother s goodness to me and by that part of her argument which related to her own peace and to the suspicions they had of her secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by them to the man so much my aversion I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey I therefore paused hesitated considered and was silent for some time I could see that my mother hoped that the result of this hesitation would be favourable to her arguments But then recollecting that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister wholly actuated by selfish and envious views that I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with that my disgrace was already become the public talk that the man was mister Solmes and that my aversion to him was too generally known to make my compliance either creditable to myself or to them that it would give my brother and sister a triumph over me and over mister Lovelace which they would not fail to glory in and which although it concerned me but little to regard on his account yet might be attended with fatal mischiefs And then mister Solmes s disagreeable person his still more disagreeable manners his low understanding Understanding the glory of a man so little to be dispensed with in the head and director of a family in order to preserve to him that respect which a good wife and that for the justification of her own choice should pay him herself and wish every body to pay him And as mister Solmes s inferiority in this respectable faculty of the human mind I must be allowed to say this to you and no great self assumption neither would proclaim to all future as well as to all present observers what must have been my mean inducement All these reflections crowding upon my remembrance I would Madam said I folding my hands with an earnestness in which my whole heart was engaged bear the cruelest tortures bear loss of limb and even of life to give you peace But this man every moment I would at you command think of him with favour is the more my aversion You cannot indeed you cannot think how my whole soul resists him And to talk of contracts concluded upon of patterns of a short day Save me save me O my dearest Mamma save your child from this heavy from this insupportable evil Never was there a countenance that expressed so significantly as my mother s did an anguish which she struggled to hide under an anger she was compelled to assume till the latter overcoming the former she turned from me with an uplifted eye and stamping Strange perverseness were the only words I heard of a sentence that she angrily pronounced and was going I then half frantically I believe laid hold of her gown Have patience with me dearest Madam said I Do not you renounce me totally If you must separate yourself from your child let it not be with absolute reprobation on your own part My uncles may be hard hearted my father may be immovable I may suffer from my brother s ambition and from my sister s envy But let me not lose my Mamma s love at least her pity She turned to me with benigner rays You have my love You have my pity But O my dearest girl I have not yours Indeed indeed Madam you have and all my reverence all my gratitude you have But in this one point Cannot I be this once obliged Will no expedient be accepted Have I not made a very fair proposal as to mister Lovelace I wish for both our sakes my dear unpersuadable girl that the decision of this point lay with me But why when you know it does not why should you thus perplex and urge me To renounce mister Lovelace is now but half what is aimed at Nor will any body else believe you in earnest in the offer if I would While you remain single mister Lovelace will have hopes and you in the opinion of others inclinations Permit me dearest Madam to say that your goodness to me your patience your peace weigh more with me than all the rest put together for although I am to be treated by my brother and through his instigations by my father as a slave in this point and not as a daughter yet my mind is not that of a slave You have not brought me up to be mean So Clary you are already at defiance with your father I have had too much cause before to apprehend as much What will this come to I and then my dear mamma sighed I am forced to put up with many humours That you are my ever honoured Mamma is my grief And can it be thought that this very consideration and the apprehension of what may result from a much worse tempered man a man who has not half the sense of my father has not made an impression upon me to the disadvantage of the married life Yet tis something of an alleviation if one must bear undue controul to bear it from a man of sense My father I have heard you say Madam was for years a very good humoured gentleman unobjectionable in person and manners but the man proposed to me Forbear reflecting upon your father Did I my dear in what I have repeated and I think they are the very words reflect upon my father it is not possible I must say again and again were all men equally indifferent to you that you should be thus sturdy in your will I am tired out with your obstinacy The most unpersuadable girl You forget that I must separate myself from you if you will not comply You do not remember that you father will take you up where I leave you Once more however I will put it to you Are you determined to brave your father s displeasure Are you determined to defy your uncles Do you choose to break with us all rather than encourage mister Solmes Rather than give me hope Dreadful alternative But is not my sincerity is not the integrity of my heart concerned in the answer May not my everlasting happiness be the sacrifice Will not the least shadow of the hope you just now demanded from me be driven into absolute and sudden certainty Is it not sought to ensnare to entangle me in my own desire of obeying if I could give answers that might be construed into hope Forgive me Madam bear with your child s boldness in such a cause as this Settlements drawn Patterns sent for An early day Dear dear Madam how can I give hope and not intend to be this man s Ah girl never say your heart is free You deceive yourself if you think it is Thus to be driven and I wrung my hands through impatience by the instigations of a designing an ambitious brother and by a sister that How often Clary must I forbid your unsisterly reflections Does not your father do not your uncles does not every body patronize mister Solmes And let me tell you ungrateful girl and unmovable as ungrateful let me repeatedly tell you that it is evident to me that nothing but a love unworthy of your prudence can make you a creature late so dutiful now so sturdy You may guess what your father s first question on his return will be He must know that I can do nothing with you I have done my part Seek me if your mind change before he comes back you have yet a little more time as he stays supper I will no more seek you nor to you And away she flung What could I do but weep I am extremely affected on my mother s account more I must needs say than on my own And indeed all things considered and especially that the measure she is engaged in is as I dare say it is against her own judgment she deserves more compassion than myself Excellent woman What pity that meekness and condescension should not be attended with the due rewards of those charming graces Yet had she not let violent spirits as I have elsewhere observed with no small regret find their power over hers it could not have been thus But here run away with my pen I suffer my mother to be angry with me on her own account She hinted to me indeed that I must seek her if my mind changed which is a condition that amounts to a prohibition of attending her but as she left me in displeasure will it not have a very obstinate appearance and look like a kind of renunciation of her mediation in my favour if I go not down before my father returns to supplicate her pity and her kind report to him I will attend her I had rather all the world should be angry with me than my mamma Mean time to clear my hands from papers of such a nature Hannah shall deposit this If two or three letters reach you together they will but express from one period to another the anxieties and difficulties which the mind of your unhappy but ever affectionate friend labours under CL H LETTER XXI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SAT NIGHT I have been down I am to be unlucky in all I do I think be my intentions ever so good I have made matters worse instead of better as I shall now tell you I found my mother and sister together in my sister s parlour My mother I fear by the glow of her fine face and as the browner sullener glow in her sister s confirmed had been expressing herself with warmth against her unhappier child perhaps giving such an account of what had passed as should clear herself and convince Bella and through her my brother and uncles of the sincere pains she had taken with me I entered like a dejected criminal and besought the favour of a private audience My mother s return both looks and words gave but too much reason for my above surmise You have said she looking at me with a sternness that never sits well on her sweet features rather a requesting than a conceding countenance Clarissa Harlowe if I am mistaken tell me so and I will withdraw with you wherever you will Yet whether so or not you may say what you have to say before your sister My mother I thought might have withdrawn with me as she knows that I have not a friend in my sister I come down Madam said I to beg of you to forgive me for any thing you may have taken amiss in what passed above respecting your honoured self and that you will be pleased to use your endeavours to soften my papa s displeasure against me on his return Such aggravating looks such lifting up of hands and eyes such a furrowed forehead in my sister My mother was angry enough without all that and asked me to what purpose I came down if I were still so intractable She had hardly spoken the words when Shorey came in to tell her that mister Solmes was in the hall and desired admittance Ugly creature What at the close of day quite dark brought him hither But on second thoughts I believe it was contrived that he should be here at supper to know the result of the conference between my mother and me and that my father on his return might find us together I was hurrying away but my mother commanded me since I had come down only as she said to mock her not to stir and at the same time see if I could behave so to mister Solmes as might encourage her to make the favourable report to my father which I had besought her to make My sister triumphed I was vexed to be so caught and to have such an angry and cutting rebuke given me with an aspect much more like the taunting sister than the indulgent mother if I may presume to say so for she herself seemed to enjoy the surprise upon me The man stalked in His usual walk is by pauses as if from the same vacuity of thought which made Dryden s clown whistle he was telling his steps and first paid his clumsy respects to my mother then to my sister next to me as if I was already his wife and therefore to be last in his notice and sitting down by me told us in general what weather it was Very cold he made it but I was warm enough Then addressing himself to me And how do you find it Miss was his question and would have taken my hand I withdrew it I believe with disdain enough My mother frowned My sister bit her lip I could not contain myself I was never so bold in my life for I went on with my plea as if mister Solmes had not been there My mother coloured and looked at him at my sister and at me My sister s eyes were opener and bigger than ever I saw them before The man understood me He hemmed and removed from one chair to another I went on supplicating for my mother s favourable report Nothing but invincible dislike said I What would the girl be at interrupted my mother Why Clary Is this a subject Is this Is this Is this a time And again she looked upon mister Solmes I am sorry on reflection that I put my mamma into so much confusion To be sure it was very saucy in me I beg pardon Madam said I But my papa will soon return And since I am not permitted to withdraw it is not necessary I humbly presume that mister Solmes s presence should deprive me of this opportunity to implore your favourable report and at the same time if he still visit on my account looking at him to convince him that it cannot possibly be to any purpose Is the girl mad said my mother interrupting me My sister with the affectation of a whisper to my mother This is This is spite Madam very spitefully she spoke the word because you commanded her to stay I only looked at her and turning to my mother Permit me Madam said I to repeat my request I have no brother no sister If I ever lose my mamma s favour I am lost for ever mister Solmes removed to his first seat and fell to gnawing the head of his hazel a carved head almost as ugly as his own I did not think the man was so sensible My sister rose with a face all over scarlet and stepping to the table where lay a fan she took it up and although mister Solmes had observed that the weather was cold fanned herself very violently My mother came to me and angrily taking my hand led me out of that parlour into my own which you know is next to it Is not this behaviour very bold very provoking think you Clary I beg your pardon Madam if it has that appearance to you But indeed my dear Mamma there seem to be snares laying in wait for me Too well I know my brother s drift With a good word he shall have my consent for all he wishes to worm me out of neither he nor my sister shall need to take half this pains My mother was about to leave me in high displeasure I besought her to stay One favour but one favour dearest Madam said I give me leave to beg of you What would the girl I see how every thing is working about I never never can think of mister Solmes My papa will be in tumults when he is told that I cannot They will judge of the tenderness of your heart to a poor child who seems devoted by every one else from the willingness you have already shewn to hearken to my prayers There will be endeavours used to confine me and keep me out of your presence and out of the presence of every one who used to love me this my dear Miss Howe is threatened If this be effected if it be put out of my power to plead my own cause and to appeal to you and to my uncle Harlowe of whom only I have hope then will every ear be opened against me and every tale encouraged It is therefore my humble request that added to the disgraceful prohibitions I now suffer under you will not if you can help it give way to my being denied your ear Your listening Hannah has given you this intelligence as she does many others My Hannah Madam listens not My Hannah No more in Hannah s behalf Hannah is known to make mischief Hannah is known But no more of that bold intermeddler Tis true your father threatened to confine you to your chamber if you complied not in order the more assuredly to deprive you of the opportunity of corresponding with those who harden your heart against his will He bid me tell you so when he went out if I found you refractory But I was loth to deliver so harsh a declaration being still in hope that you would come down to us in a compliant temper Hannah has overheard this I suppose and has told you of it as also that he declared he would break your heart rather than you should break his And I now assure you that you will be confined and prohibited making teasing appeals to any of us and we shall see who is to submit you to us or every body to you Again I offered to clear Hannah and to lay the latter part of the intelligence to my sister s echo Betty Barnes who had boasted of it to another servant but I was again bid to be silent on that head I should soon find my mother was pleased to say that others could be as determined as I was obstinate and once for all would add that since she saw that I built upon her indulgence and was indifferent about involving her in contentions with my father she would now assure me that she was as much determined against mister Lovelace and for mister Solmes and the family schemes as any body and would not refuse her consent to any measures that should be thought necessary to reduce a stubborn child to her duty I was ready to sink She was so good as to lend me her arm to support me And this said I is all I have to hope for from my Mamma It is But Clary this one further opportunity I give you Go in again to mister Solmes and behave discreetly to him and let your father find you together upon civil terms at least My feet moved of themselves I think farther from the parlour where he was and towards the stairs and there I stopped and paused If proceeded she you are determined to stand in defiance of us all then indeed you may go up to your chamber as you are ready to do And God help you God help me indeed for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intend But let me have your prayers my dear Mamma Those shall have mine who have brought me into all this distress I was moving to go up And will you go up Clary I turned my face to her my officious tears would needs plead for me I could not just then speak and stood still Good girl distress me not thus Dear good girl do not thus distress me holding out her hand but standing still likewise What can I do Madam What can I do Go in again my child Go in again my dear child repeated she and let your father find you together What Madam to give him hope To give hope to mister Solmes Obstinate perverse undutiful Clarissa with a rejecting hand and angry aspect then take your own way and go up But stir not down again I charge you without leave or till your father s pleasure be known concerning you She flung away from me with high indignation and I went up with a very heavy heart and feet as slow as my heart was heavy My father is come home and my brother with him Late as it is they are all shut up together Not a door opens not a soul stirs Hannah as she moves up and down is shunned as a person infected The angry assembly is broken up My two uncles and my aunt Hervey are sent for it seems to be here in the morning to breakfast I shall then I suppose know my doom Tis past eleven and I am ordered not to go to bed TWELVE O CLOCK This moment the keys of every thing are taken from me It was proposed to send for me down but my father said he could not bear to look upon me Strange alteration in a few weeks Shorey was the messenger The tears stood in her eyes when she delivered her message You my dear are happy May you always be so and then I can never be wholly miserable Adieu my beloved friend CL HARLOWE LETTER XXII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING MARCH five Hannah has just brought me from the private place in the garden wall a letter from mister Lovelace deposited last night signed also by Lord M He tells me in it That mister Solmes makes it his boast 
2496-156083-0000	train-other-500	that he is to be married in a few days to one of the shyest women in England that my brother explains his meaning This shy creature he says is me and he assures every one
2496-156083-0001	train-other-500	that his younger sister is very soon to be mister Solmes s wife He tells me of the patterns bespoken which my mother mentioned to me Not one thing escapes him that is done or said in this house
2496-156083-0002	train-other-500	My sister he says reports the same things and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon him that he cannot but be extremely piqued as well at the manner
2496-156083-0003	train-other-500	as from the occasion and expresses himself with great violence upon it He knows not he says what my relations inducements can be to prefer such a man as Solmes to him
2496-156083-0004	train-other-500	If advantageous settlements be the motive Solmes shall not offer what he will refuse to comply with As to his estate and family the first cannot be excepted against and for the second
2496-156083-0005	train-other-500	he will not disgrace himself by a comparison so odious He appeals to Lord M for the regularity of his life and manners ever since he has made his addresses to me or had hope of my favour
2496-156083-0006	train-other-500	I suppose he would have his Lordship s signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for him He desires my leave in company with my Lord in a pacific manner
2496-156083-0007	train-other-500	to attend my father and uncles in order to make proposals that must be accepted
none	none	 if they will see him 
2496-156083-0008	train-other-500	and hear what they are and tells me that he will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe in order to bring about a reconciliation He presumes to be very earnest with me
2496-156083-0009	train-other-500	to give him a private meeting some night in my father s garden attended by whom I please Really my dear were you to see his letter you would think I had given him great encouragement
2496-156083-0010	train-other-500	and that I am in direct treaty with him or that he is sure that my friends will drive me into a foreign protection for he has the boldness to offer in my Lord s name an asylum to me
none	none	 should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes s behalf 
2496-156083-0011	train-other-500	I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to entangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers in hopes that we shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them
none	none	 and if not checked to reckon upon our silence as assents voluntarily given or concessions made in their favour There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you 
2496-156083-0012	train-other-500	but I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself or a copy of it For my own part I am very uneasy to think how I have been drawn on one hand and driven on the other
none	none	 into a clandestine 
2496-156083-0013	train-other-500	in short into a mere loverlike correspondence which my heart condemns It is easy to see if I do not break it off that mister Lovelace s advantages by reason of my unhappy situation
none	none	 will every day increase and I shall be more and more entangled 
2496-156083-0014	train-other-500	Yet if I do put an end to it without making it a condition of being freed from mister Solmes s address May I my dear is it best to continue it a little longer in order to extricate myself out of the other difficulty
2496-156083-0015	train-other-500	by giving up all thoughts of mister Lovelace
none	none	 Whose advice can I now ask 
2496-156083-0016	train-other-500	but yours All my relations are met They are at breakfast together mister Solmes is expected I am excessively uneasy I must lay down my pen
2496-156083-0017	train-other-500	They are all going to church together Grievously disordered they appear to be as Hannah tells me She believes something is resolved upon
2496-156083-0018	train-other-500	SUNDAY NOON What a cruel thing is suspense I will ask leave to go to church this afternoon I expect to be denied But if I do not ask
2496-156083-0019	train-other-500	they may allege that my not going is owing to myself I desired to speak with Shorey Shorey came
2496-156083-0020	train-other-500	I directed her to carry to my mother my request for permission to go to church this afternoon What think you was the return Tell her that she must direct herself to her brother for any favour she has to ask
2496-156083-0021	train-other-500	So my dear I am to be delivered up to my brother I was resolved however to ask of him this favour Accordingly
none	none	 when they sent me up my solitary dinner 
2496-156083-0022	train-other-500	I gave the messenger a billet in which I made it my humble request through him to my father to be permitted to go to church this afternoon This was the contemptuous answer
2496-156083-0023	train-other-500	Tell her that her request will be taken into consideration to morrow Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult But this method will not do with me
2496-156083-0024	train-other-500	indeed it will not And yet it is but the beginning I suppose of what I am to expect from my brother now I am delivered up to him On recollection
2496-156083-0025	train-other-500	I thought it best to renew my request I did The following is a copy of what I wrote and what follows that of the answer sent me SIR
2496-156083-0026	train-other-500	I know not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being permitted to go to church this afternoon If you designed to shew your pleasantry by it I hope that will continue and then my request will be granted
2496-156083-0027	train-other-500	You know that I never absented myself
none	none	 when well and at home till the two last Sundays 
2496-156083-0028	train-other-500	when I was advised not to go My present situation is such that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers I will solemnly engage only to go thither and back again
2496-156083-0029	train-other-500	I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score of indisposition for avoiding visits Nor will I but by distant civilities
2496-156083-0030	train-other-500	return the compliments of any of my acquaintances My disgraces if they are to have an end need not be proclaimed to the whole world I ask this favour therefore for my reputation s sake
none	none	 that I may be able to hold up my head in the neighbourhood if I live to see an end of the unmerited severities which seem to be designed for Your unhappy sister CL HARLOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE For a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church and yet resolve to defy her parents in an article of the greatest consequence to them and to the whole family

HOWE MONDAY MORNING MARCH six They are resolved to break my heart My poor Hannah is discharged disgracefully discharged Thus it was Within half an hour after I had sent the poor girl down for my breakfast that bold creature Betty Barnes my sister s confidant and servant if a favourite maid and confidant can be deemed a servant came up What Miss will you please to have for breakfast I was surprised What will I have for breakfast Betty How What How comes it Then I named Hannah I could not tell what to say Don t be surprised Miss but you ll see Hannah no more in this house God forbid Is any harm come to Hannah What What is the matter with Hannah Why Miss the short and the long is this Your papa and mamma think Hannah has staid long enough in the house to do mischief and so she is ordered to troop that was the confident creature s word and I am directed to wait upon you in her stead I burst into tears I have no service for you Betty Barnes none at all But where is Hannah Cannot I speak with the poor girl I owe her half a year s wages May I not see the honest creature and pay her her wages I may never see her again perhaps for they are resolved to break my heart And they think you are resolved to break theirs so tit for tat Miss Impertinent I called her and asked her if it were upon such confident terms that her service was to begin I was so very earnest to see the poor maid that to oblige me as she said she went down with my request The worthy creature was as earnest to see me and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty I thanked her when she came up for her past service to me Her heart was ready to break And she began to vindicate her fidelity and love and disclaimed any mischief she had ever made I told her that those who occasioned her being turned out of my service made no question of her integrity that her dismission was intended for an indignity to me that I was very sorry to be obliged to part with her and hoped she would meet with as good a service Never never wringing her hands should she meet with a mistress she loved so well And the poor creature ran on in my praises and in professions of love to me We are all apt you know my dear to praise our benefactors because they are our benefactors as if every body did right or wrong as they obliged or disobliged us But this good creature deserved to be kindly treated so I could have no merit in favouring one whom it would have been ungrateful not to distinguish I gave her a little linen some laces and other odd things and instead of four pounds which were due to her ten guineas and said if ever I were again allowed to be my own mistress I would think of her in the first place Betty enviously whispered Shorey upon it Hannah told me before their faces having no other opportunity that she had been examined about letters to me and from me and that she had given her pockets to Miss Harlowe who looked into them and put her fingers in her stays to satisfy herself that she had not any She gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams and I said they should be my own care twice or thrice a day We wept over each other at parting The girl prayed for all the family To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed is very cruel and I could not help saying that these methods might break my heart but not any other way answer the end of the authors of my disgraces Betty with a very saucy fleer said to Shorey There would be a trial of skill about that she fancied But I took no notice of it If this wench thinks that I have robbed her young mistress of a lover as you say she has given out she may believe that it is some degree of merit in herself to be impertinent to me Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah If you can command the good creature to a place worthy of her pray do for my sake LETTER XXIV MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE MONDAY NEAR twelve O CLOCK The enclosed letter was just now delivered to me My brother has carried all his points I send you also the copy of my answer No more at this time can I write MONDAY MAR six MISS CLARY By command of your father and mother I write expressly to forbid you to come into their presence or into the garden when they are there nor when they are not there but with Betty Banes to attend you except by particular license or command On their blessings you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the vile Lovelace as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah Whence her sudden discharge As was fit Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe who has given herself high airs of late and might possibly help on your correspondence with that detested libertine Nor in short with any body without leave You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles without their leave first obtained It is a mercy to you after such a behaviour to your mother that your father refuses to see you You are not to be seen in any apartment of the house you so lately governed as you pleased unless you are commanded down In short you are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber except now and then in Betty Barnes s sight as aforesaid you take a morning or evening turn in the garden and then you are to go directly and without stopping at any apartment in the way up or down the back stairs that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to the pain you have given every body The hourly threatenings of your fine fellow as well as your own unheard of obstinacy will account to you for all this What a hand has the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you who so long pleaded for you and undertook for you even when others from the manner of your setting out despaired of moving you What must your perverseness have been that such a mother can give you up She thinks it right so to do nor will take you to favour unless you make the first steps by a compliance with your duty As for myself whom perhaps you think hardly of in very good company if you do that is my sole consolation I have advised that you may be permitted to pursue your own inclinations some people need no greater punishment than such a permission and not to have the house encumbered by one who must give them the more pain for the necessity she has laid them under of avoiding the sight of her although in it If any thing I have written appear severe or harsh it is still in your power but perhaps will not always be so to remedy it and that by a single word Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with her duty to those whom you owe it as well as she JA HARLOWE TO JAMES HARLOWE JUNIOR esquire SIR I will only say That you may congratulate yourself on having so far succeeded in all your views that you may report what you please of me and I can no more defend myself than if I were dead Yet one favour nevertheless I will beg of you It is this That you will not occasion more severities more disgraces that are necessary for carrying into execution your further designs whatever they be against Your unhappy sister CLARISSA HARLOWE LETTER XXV MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY MARCH seven By my last deposit you will see how I am driven and what a poor prisoner I am No regard had to my reputation The whole matter is now before you Can such measures be supposed to soften But surely they can only mean to try and frighten me into my brother s views All my hope is to be able to weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from Florence and he is soon expected yet if they are determined upon a short day I doubt he will not be here in time enough to save me It is plain by my brother s letter that my mother has not spared me in the report she was pleased to make of the conference between herself and me yet she was pleased to hint to me that my brother had views which she would have had me try to disappoint But indeed she had engaged to give a faithful account of what was to pass between herself and me and it was doubtless much more eligible to give up a daughter than to disoblige a husband and every other person of the family They think they have done every thing by turning away my poor Hannah but as long as the liberty of the garden and my poultry visits are allowed me they will be mistaken I asked missus Betty if she had any orders to watch or attend me or whether I was to ask her leave whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden or to go feed my bantams Lord bless her what could I mean by such a question Yet she owned that she had heard that I was not to go into the garden when my father mother or uncles were there However as it behoved me to be assured on this head I went down directly and staid an hour without question or impediment and yet a good part of the time I walked under and in sight as I may say of my brother s study window where both he and my sister happened to be And I am sure they saw me by the loud mirth they affected by way of insult as I suppose So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch of the authority given him The enforcing of that may perhaps come next But I hope not TUESDAY NIGHT Since I wrote the above I ventured to send a letter by Shorey to my mother I desired her to give it into her own hand when nobody was by I shall enclose a copy of it You will see that I would have it thought that now Hannah is gone I have no way to correspond out of the house I am far from thinking all I do right I am afraid this is a little piece of art that is not so But this is an afterthought The letter went first HONOURED MADAM Having acknowledged to you that I had received letters from mister Lovelace full of resentment and that I answered them purely to prevent further mischief and having shewn you copies of my answers which you did not disapprove of although you thought fit after you had read them to forbid me any further correspondence with him I think it my duty to acquaint you that another letter from him has since come to my hand in which he is very earnest with me to permit him to wait on my papa or you or my two uncles in a pacific way accompanied by Lord M on which I beg your commands I own to you Madam that had not the prohibition been renewed and had not Hannah been so suddenly dismissed my service I should have made the less scruple to have written an answer and to have commanded her to convey it to him with all speed in order to dissuade him from these visits lest any thing should happen on the occasion that my heart aches but to think of And here I cannot but express my grief that I should have all the punishment and all the blame who as I have reason to think have prevented great mischief and have not been the occasion of any For Madam could I be supposed to govern the passions of either of the gentlemen Over the one indeed I have had some little influence without giving him hitherto any reason to think he has fastened an obligation upon me for it Over the other Who Madam has any I am grieved at heart to be obliged to lay so great a blame at my brother s door although my reputation and my liberty are both to be sacrificed to his resentment and ambition May not however so deep a sufferer be permitted to speak out This communication being as voluntarily made as dutifully intended I humbly presume to hope that I shall not be required to produce the letter itself I cannot either in honour or prudence do that because of the vehemence of his style for having heard not I assure you by my means or through Hannah s of some part of the harsh treatment I have met with he thinks himself entitled to place it to his own account by reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations equally vehement If I do not answer him he will be made desperate and think himself justified thought I shall not think him so in resenting the treatment he complains of if I do and if in compliment to me he forbears to resent what he thinks himself entitled to resent be pleased Madam to consider the obligation he will suppose he lays me under If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is supposed I should not have wished this to be considered by you And permit me as a still further proof that I am not prepossessed to beg of you to consider Whether upon the whole the proposal I made of declaring for the single life which I will religiously adhere to is not the best way to get rid of his pretensions with honour To renounce him and not be allowed to aver that I will never be the other man s will make him conclude driven as I am driven that I am determined in that other man s favour If this has not its due weight my brother s strange schemes must be tried and I will resign myself to my destiny with all the acquiescence that shall be granted to my prayers And so leaving the whole to your own wisdom and whether you choose to consult my papa and uncles upon this humble application or not or whether I shall be allowed to write an answer to mister Lovelace or not and if allowed to do so I beg your direction by whom to send it I remain Honoured Madam Your unhappy but ever dutiful daughter CL HARLOWE WEDNESDAY MORNING I have just received an answer to the enclosed letter My mother you will observe has ordered me to burn it but as you will have it in your safekeeping and nobody else will see it her end will be equally answered as if it were burnt It has neither date nor superscription CLARISSA Say not all the blame and all the punishment is yours I am as much blamed and as much punished as you are yet am more innocent When your obstinacy is equal to any other person s passion blame not your brother We judged right that Hannah carried on your correspondencies Now she is gone and you cannot write we think you cannot to Miss Howe nor she to you without our knowledge one cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over I had no dislike of Hannah I did not tell her so because somebody was within hearing when she desired to pay her duty to me at going I gave her a caution in a raised voice To take care wherever she went to live next if there were any young ladies how she made parties and assisted in clandestine correspondencies But I slid two guineas into her hand nor was I angry to hear that you were still more bountiful to her So much for Hannah I don t know what to write about your answering that man of violence What can you think of it that such a family as ours should have such a rod held over it For my part I have not owned that I know you have corresponded By your last boldness to me an astonishing one it was to pursue before mister Solmes the subject I was forced to break from above stairs you may as far as I know plead that you had my countenance for your correspondence with him and so add to the uneasiness between your father and me You were once my comfort Clarissa you made all my hardships tolerable But now However nothing it is plain can move you and I will say no more on that head for you are under your father s discipline now and he will neither be prescribed to nor entreated I should have been glad to see the letter you tell me of as I saw the rest You say both honour and prudence forbid you to shew it to me O Clarissa what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a mother But it is not for me to see it if you would choose to shew it me I will not be in your secret I will not know that you did correspond And as to an answer take your own methods But let him know it will be the last you will write And if you do write I won t see it so seal it up if you do and give it to Shorey and she Yet do not think I give you license to write We will be upon no conditions with him nor will you be allowed to be upon any Your father and uncles would have no patience were he to come What have you to do to oblige him with your refusal of mister Solmes Will not that refusal be to give him hope And while he has any can we be easy or free from his insults Were even your brother in fault as that fault cannot be conquered is a sister to carry on a correspondence that shall endanger her brother But your father has given his sanction to your brother s dislikes your uncles and every body s No matter to whom owing As to the rest you have by your obstinacy put it out of my power to do any thing for you Your father takes it upon himself to be answerable for all consequences You must not therefore apply to me for favour I shall endeavour to be only an observer Happy if I could be an unconcerned one While I had power you would not let me use it as I would have used it Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your father s direction You ll have severe trials If you have any favour to hope for it must be from the mediation of your uncles And yet I believe they are equally determined for they make it a principle alas they never had children that that child who in marriage is not governed by her parents is to be given up as a lost creature I charge you let not this letter be found Burn it There is too much of the mother in it to a daughter so unaccountably obstinate Write not another letter to me I can do nothing for you But you can do every thing for yourself Now my dear to proceed with my melancholy narrative After this letter you will believe that I could have very little hopes that an application directly to my father would stand me in any stead but I thought it became me to write were it but to acquit myself to myself that I have left nothing unattempted that has the least likelihood to restore me to his favour Accordingly I wrote to the following effect I presume not I say to argue with my Papa I only beg his mercy and indulgence in this one point on which depends my present and perhaps my future happiness and beseech him not to reprobate his child for an aversion which it is not in her power to conquer I beg that I may not be sacrificed to projects and remote contingencies I complain of the disgraces I suffer in this banishment from his presence and in being confined to my chamber In every thing but this one point I promise implicit duty and resignation to his will I repeat my offers of a single life and appeal to him whether I have ever given him cause to doubt my word I beg to be admitted to his and to my mamma s presence and that my conduct may be under their own eye and this with the more earnestness as I have too much reason to believe that snares are laid for me and tauntings and revilings used on purpose to make a handle of my words against me when I am not permitted to speak in my own defence I conclude with hoping that my brother s instigations may not rob an unhappy child of her father This is the answer sent without superscription and unsealed although by Betty Barnes who delivered it with an air as if she knew the contents WEDNESDAY I write perverse girl but with all the indignation that your disobedience deserves To desire to be forgiven a fault you own and yet resolve to persevere in is a boldness no more to be equaled than passed over It is my authority you defy Your reflections upon a brother that is an honour to us all deserve my utmost resentment I see how light all relationship sits upon you The cause I guess at too I cannot bear the reflections that naturally arise from this consideration Your behaviour to your too indulgent and too fond mother But I have no patience Continue banished from my presence undutiful as you are till you know how to conform to my will Ingrateful creature Your letter but upbraid me for my past indulgence Write no more to me till you can distinguish better and till you are convinced of your duty to A JUSTLY INCENSED FATHER This angry letter was accompanied by one from my mother unsealed and unsuperscribed also Those who take so much pains to confederate every one against me I make no doubt obliged her to bear her testimony against the poor girl My mother s letter being a repetition of some of the severe things that passed between herself and me of which I have already informed you I shall not need to give you the contents only thus far that she also praises my brother and blames me for my freedoms with him LETTER XXVI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY MORN MARCH nine 
2496-156087-0001	train-other-500	I have another letter from mister Lovelace although I had not answered his former This man somehow or other knows every thing that passes in our family
2496-156087-0002	train-other-500	My confinement Hanna s dismission and more of the resentments and resolutions of my father uncles and brother than I can possibly know and almost as soon as the things happen which he tells me of
2496-156087-0003	train-other-500	He cannot come at these intelligencies fairly He is excessively uneasy upon what he hears and his expressions both of love to me and resentment to them are very fervent He solicits me
2496-156087-0004	train-other-500	To engage my honour to him never to have mister Solmes I think I may fairly promise him that I will not He begs
none	none	 That I will not think he is endeavouring to make to himself a merit at any man s expense since he hopes to obtain my favour on the foot of his own nor that he seeks to intimidate me into a consideration for him But declares that the treatment he meets with from my family is of such a nature 
2496-156087-0005	train-other-500	that he is perpetually reproached for not resenting it and that as well by Lord M and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty as by all his other friends and if he must have no hope from me
2496-156087-0006	train-other-500	he cannot answer for what his despair will make him do Indeed he says his relations the ladies particularly advise him to have recourse to a legal remedy But how he asks can a man of honour
none	none	 go to law for verbal abuses given by people entitled to wear swords You see my dear that my mother seems as apprehensive of mischief as myself and has indirectly offered to let Shorey carry my answer to the letter he sent me before 
2496-156087-0007	train-other-500	He is full of the favours of the ladies of his family to me to whom nevertheless I am personally a stranger except that I once saw Miss Patty Montague at missus Knolly s
2496-156087-0008	train-other-500	It is natural I believe for a person to be the more desirous of making new friends
none	none	 in proportion as she loses the favour of old ones 
2496-156087-0009	train-other-500	Yet had I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations and in your eyes
none	none	 than in those of all the world besides 
2496-156087-0010	train-other-500	but these four ladies of his family have such excellent characters that one cannot but wish to be thought well of by them Cannot there be a way to find out
none	none	 by missus Fortescue s means 
2496-156087-0011	train-other-500	or by mister Hickman who has some knowledge of Lord M covertly however what their opinions are of the present situation of things in our family and of the little likelihood there is that ever the alliance once approved of by them
2496-156087-0012	train-other-500	can take effect I cannot for my own part think so well of myself as to imagine that they can wish their kinsman to persevere in his views with regard to me through such contempts and discouragements
2496-156087-0013	train-other-500	Not that it would concern me should they advise him to the contrary By my Lord s signing mister Lovelace s former letter by mister Lovelace s assurances of the continued favour of all his relations and by the report of others
2496-156087-0014	train-other-500	I seem still to stand high in their favour But methinks I should be glad to have this confirmed to me as from themselves by the lips of an indifferent person and the rather because of their fortunes and family
2496-156087-0015	train-other-500	and take it amiss as they have reason to be included by ours in the contempt thrown upon their kinsman Curiosity at present is all my motive
none	none	 nor will there ever I hope be a stronger 
2496-156087-0016	train-other-500	notwithstanding your questionable throbs even were the merits of mister Lovelace much greater than they are I have answered his letters If he takes me at my word
2496-156087-0017	train-other-500	I shall need to be less solicitous for the opinions of his relations in my favour and yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy This is the substance of my letter
2496-156087-0018	train-other-500	I express my surprise at his knowing and so early all that passes here I assure him
none	none	 That were there not such a man in the world as himself 
2496-156087-0019	train-other-500	I would not have mister Solmes I tell him That to return as I understand he does defiances for defiances to my relations is far from being a proof with me either of his politeness
none	none	 or of the consideration he pretends to have for me 
2496-156087-0020	train-other-500	That the moment I hear he visits any of my friends without their consent I will make a resolution never to see him more if I can help it I apprize him
none	none	 That I am connived at in sending this letter although no one has seen the contents provided it shall be the last I will ever write to him that I had more than once told him that the single life was my choice and this before mister Solmes was introduced as a visitor in our family 
2496-156087-0021	train-other-500	that mister Wyerley and other gentlemen knew it to be my choice before himself was acquainted with any of us that I had never been induced to receive a line from him on the subject
none	none	 but that I thought he had not acted ungenerously by my brother and yet had not been so handsomely treated by my friends as he might have expected but that had he even my friends on his side 
2496-156087-0022	train-other-500	I should have very great objections to him were I to get over my choice of a single life so really preferable to me as it is and that I should have declared as much to him had I not regarded him as more than a common visiter
none	none	 On all these accounts I desire that the one more letter which I will allow him to deposit in the usual place 
2496-156087-0023	train-other-500	may be the very last and that only to acquaint me with his acquiescence that it shall be so at least till happier times This last I put in that he may not be quite desperate
2496-156087-0024	train-other-500	But if he take me at my word I shall be rid of one of my tormentors I have promised to lay before you all his letters and my answers I repeat that promise and am the less solicitous
2496-156087-0025	train-other-500	for that reason to amplify upon the contents of either But I cannot too often express my vexation to be driven to such streights and difficulties here at home as oblige me to answer letters from a man
2496-156087-0026	train-other-500	I had not absolutely intended to encourage and to whom I had really great objections filled as his are with such warm protestations and written to me with a spirit of expectation For my dear
2496-156087-0027	train-other-500	you never knew so bold a supposer As commentators find beauties in an author to which the author perhaps was a stranger so he sometimes compliments me in high strains of gratitude for favours and for a consideration
none	none	 which I never designed him insomuch that I am frequently under a necessity of explaining away 
2496-156087-0028	train-other-500	the attributed goodness to him which if I shewed I should have the less opinion of myself In short my dear like a restiff horse as I have heard described by sportsmen he pains one s hands
2496-156087-0029	train-other-500	and half disjoints one s arms to rein him in And when you see his letters you must form no judgment upon them till you have read my answers If you do you will indeed think you have cause to attribute self deceit
2496-156087-0030	train-other-500	and throbs and glows to your friend and yet at other times the contradictory nature complains that I shew him as little favour and my friends as much
none	none	 inveteracy as if in the rencontre betwixt my brother and him 
2496-156087-0031	train-other-500	he had been the aggressor and as if the catastrophe had been as fatal as it might have been If he has a design by this conduct sometimes complaining of my shyness at others exalting in my imaginary favours
2496-156087-0032	train-other-500	to induce me at one time to acquiesce with his compliments at another to be more complaisant for his complaints and if the contradiction be not the effect of his inattention and giddiness I shall think him as deep and as artful too probably as practised
none	none	 a creature as ever lived and were I to be sure of it should hate him if possible worse than I do Solmes But enough for the present of a creature so very various LETTER XXVII MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY NIGHT MARCH nine I have not patience with any of the people you are with I know not what to advise you to do How do you know that you are not punishable for being the cause though to your own loss that the will of your grandfather is not complied with Wills are sacred things child You see that they even they think so who imagine they suffer by a will through the distinction paid you in it I allow of all your noble reasonings for what you did at the time But since such a charming such a generous instance of filial duty is to go thus unrewarded why should you not resume Your grandfather knew the family failing He knew what a noble spirit you had to do good He himself perhaps excuse me my dear had done too little in his life time and therefore he put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole family Were it to me I would resume it Indeed I would You will say you cannot do it while you are with them I don t know that Do you think they can use you worse than they do And is it not your right And do they not make use of your own generosity to oppress you Your uncle Harlowe is one trustee your cousin Morden is the other insist upon your right to your uncle and write to your cousin Morden about it This I dare say will make them alter their behaviour to you Your insolent brother what has he to do to controul you Were it me I wish it were for one month and no more I d shew him the difference I would be in my own mansion pursuing my charming schemes and making all around me happy I would set up my own chariot I would visit them when they deserved it But when my brother and sister gave themselves airs I would let them know that I was their sister and not their servant and if that did not do I would shut my gates against them and bid them go and be company for each other It must be confessed however that this brother and sister of yours judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge have some reason for treating you as they do It must have long been a mortification to them set disappointed love on her side and avarice on his out of the question to be so much eclipsed by a younger sister Such a sun in a family where there are none but faint twinklers how could they bear it Why my dear they must look upon you as a prodigy among them and prodigies you know though they obtain our admiration never attract our love The distance between you and them is immense Their eyes ache to look up at you What shades does your full day of merit cast upon them Can you wonder then that they should embrace the first opportunity that offered to endeavour to bring you down to their level Depend upon it my dear you will have more of it and more still as you bear it As to this odious Solmes I wonder not at your aversion to him It is needless to say any thing to you who have so sincere any antipathy to him to strengthen your dislike Yet who can resist her own talents One of mine as I have heretofore said is to give an ugly likeness Shall I indulge it I will And the rather as in doing so you will have my opinion in justification of your aversion to him and in approbation of a steadiness that I ever admired and must for ever approve of in your temper I was twice in this wretch s company At one of the times your Lovelace was there I need not mention to you who have such a pretty curiosity though at present only a curiosity you know the unspeakable difference Lovelace entertained the company in his lively gay way and made every body laugh at one of his stories It was before this creature was thought of for you Solmes laughed too It was however his laugh for his first three years at least I imagine must have been one continual fit of crying and his muscles have never yet been able to recover a risible tone His very smile you never saw him smile I believe never at least gave him cause to smile is so little natural to his features that it appears to him as hideous as the grin of a man in malice I took great notice of him as I do of all the noble lords of the creation in their peculiarities and was disgusted nay shocked at him even then I was glad I remember on that particular occasion to see his strange features recovering their natural gloominess though they did this but slowly as if the muscles which contributed to his distortions had turned upon rusty springs What a dreadful thing must even the love of such a husband be For my part were I his wife But what have I done to myself to make such a supposition I should never have comfort but in his absence or when I was quarreling with him A splenetic woman who must have somebody to find fault with might indeed be brought to endure such a wretch the sight of him would always furnish out the occasion and all her servants for that reason and for that only would have cause to blame their master But how grievous and apprehensive a thing it must be for his wife had she the least degree of delicacy to catch herself in having done something to oblige him So much for his person As to the other half of him he is said to be an insinuating creeping mortal to any body he hopes to be a gainer by an insolent overbearing one where he has no such views And is not this the genuine spirit of meanness He is reported to be spiteful and malicious even to the whole family of any single person who has once disobliged him and to his own relations most of all I am told that they are none of them such wretches as himself This may be one reason why he is for disinheriting them My Kitty from one of his domestics tells me that his tenants hate him and that he never had a servant who spoke well of him Vilely suspicious of their wronging him probably from the badness of his own heart he is always changing His pockets they say are continually crammed with keys so that when he would treat a guest a friend he has not out of your family he is half as long puzzling which is which as his niggardly treat might be concluded in And if it be wine he always fetches it himself Nor has he much trouble in doing so for he has very few visiters only those whom business or necessity brings for a gentleman who can help it would rather be benighted than put up at his house Yet this is the man they have found out for considerations as sordid as those he is governed by for a husband that is to say for a lord and master for Miss Clarissa Harlowe But perhaps he may not be quite so miserable as he is represented Characters extremely good or extremely bad are seldom justly given Favour for a person will exalt the one as disfavour will sink the other But your uncle Antony has told my mother who objected to his covetousness that it was intended to tie him up as he called it to your own terms which would be with a hempen rather than a matrimonial cord I dare say But is not this a plain indication that even his own recommenders think him a mean creature and that he must be articled with perhaps for necessaries But enough and too much of such a wretch as this You must not have him my dear that I am clear in though not so clear how you will be able to avoid it except you assert the independence to which your estate gives you a title Here my mother broke in upon me She wanted to see what I had written I was silly enough to read Solmes s character to her She owned that the man was not the most desirable of men and that he had not the happiest appearance But what said she is person in a man And I was chidden for setting you against complying with your father s will Then followed a lecture on the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to discharge all his obligations to the world and to keep all together in opposition to a spendthrift or profligate A fruitful subject you know whether any particular person be meant by it or not Why will these wise parents by saying too much against the persons they dislike put one upon defending them Lovelace is not a spendthrift owes not obligations to the world though I doubt not profligate enough Then putting one upon doing such but common justice we must needs be prepossessed truly And so perhaps we are put upon curiosities first that is to say how such a one or his friends may think of one and then but too probably comes in a distinguishing preference or something that looks exceedingly like it My mother charged me at last to write that side over again But excuse me my good Mamma I would not have the character lost upon any consideration since my vein ran freely into it and I never wrote to please myself but I pleased you A very good reason why we have but one mind between us only that sometimes you are a little too grave methinks I no doubt a little too flippant in your opinion This difference in our tempers however is probably the reason that we love one another so well that in the words of Norris no third love can come in betwixt Since each in the other s eye having something amiss and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it and the rather perhaps as neither wishes to mend it this takes off a good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little if not a great deal of that latent spleen which in time might rise into envy and that into ill will So my dear if this be the case let each keep her fault and much good may do her with it and what an hero or heroine must he or she be who can conquer a constitutional fault Let it be avarice as in some I dare not name let it be gravity as in my best friend or let it be flippancy as in I need not say whom It is proper to acquaint you that I was obliged to comply with my mother s curiosity my mother has her share her full share of curiosity my dear and to let her see here and there some passages in your letters I am broken in upon but I will tell you by and by what passed between my mother and me on this occasion and the rather as she had her GIRL her favourite HICKMAN and your LOVELACE all at once in her eye in her part of the conversation Thus it was I cannot but think Nancy said she after all that there is a little hardship in Miss Harlowe s case and yet as her mother says it is a grating thing to have a child who was always noted for her duty in smaller points to stand in opposition to her parents will in the greater yea in the greatest of all And now to middle the matter between both it is pity that the man they favour has not that sort of merit which a person of a mind so delicate as that of Miss Harlowe might reasonably expect in a husband But then this man is surely preferable to a libertine to a libertine too who has had a duel with her own brother fathers and mothers must think so were it not for that circumstance and it is strange if they do not know best And so they must thought I from their experience if no little dirty views give them also that prepossession in one man s favour which they are so apt to censure their daughters for having in another s and if as I may add in your case they have no creeping old musty uncle Antonys to strengthen their prepossessions as he does my mother s Poor creeping positive soul what has such an old bachelor as he to do to prate about the duties of children to parents unless he had a notion that parents owe some to their children But your mother by her indolent meekness let me call it has spoiled all the three brothers But you see child proceeded my mother what a different behaviour MINE is to YOU I recommend to you one of the soberest yet politest men in England I think little of my mother s politest my dear She judges of honest Hickman for her daughter as she would have done I suppose twenty years ago for herself Of a good family continued my mother a fine clear and improving estate a prime consideration with my mother as well as with some other folks whom you know and I beg and I pray you to encourage him at least not to use him the worse for his being so obsequious to you Yes indeed To use him kindly that he may treat me familiarly but distance to the men wretches is best I say Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you What would you say were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe s father and mother treat her What would I say Madam That s easily answered I would say nothing Can you think such usage and to such a young lady is to be borne Come come Nancy be not so hasty you have heard but one side and that there is more to be said is plain by your reading to me but parts of her letters They are her parents They must know best Miss Harlowe as fine a child as she is must have done something must have said something you know how they loved her to make them treat her thus But if she should be blameless Madam how does your own supposition condemn them Then came up Solmes s great estate his good management of it A little too NEAR indeed was the word O how money lovers thought I will palliate Yet my mother is a princess in spirit to this Solmes What strange effects added she have prepossession and love upon young ladies I don t know how it is my dear but people take high delight in finding out folks in love Curiosity begets curiosity I believe that s the thing She proceeded to praise mister Lovelace s person and his qualifications natural and acquired But then she would judge as mothers will judge and as daughters are very loth to judge but could say nothing in answer to your offer of living single and breaking with him if if three or four if s she made of one good one if that could be depended on But still obedience without reserve reason what I will is the burden of my mother s song and this for my sake as well as for yours I must needs say that I think duty to parents is a very meritorious excellence But I bless God I have not your trials We can all be good when we have no temptation nor provocation to the contrary but few young persons who can help themselves too as you can would bear what you bear I will now mention all that is upon my mind in relation to the behaviour of your father and uncles and the rest of them because I would not offend you but I have now a higher opinion of my own sagacity than ever I had in that I could never cordially love any one of your family but yourself I am not born to like them But it is my duty to be sincere to my friend and this will excuse her Anna Howe to Miss Clarissa Harlowe I ought indeed to have excepted your mother a lady to be reverenced and now to be pitied What must have been her treatment to be thus subjugated as I may call it Little did the good old viscount think when he married his darling his only daughter to so well appearing a gentleman and to her own liking too that she would have been so much kept down Another would call your father a tyrant if I must not all the world that know him do call him so and if you love your mother you should not be very angry at the world for taking that liberty Yet after all I cannot help thinking that she is the less to be pitied as she may be said be the gout or what will the occasion of his moroseness to have long behaved unworthy of her birth and fine qualities in yielding so much as she yields to encroaching spirits you may confine the reflection to your brother if it will pain you to extend it and this for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to herself which was the less worth endeavouring to preserve as it always produced a strength in the will of others which subjected her to an arbitrariness that of course grew and became established upon her patience And now to give up the most deserving of her children against her judgment a sacrifice to the ambition and selfishness of the least deserving But I fly from this subject having I fear said too much to be forgiven and yet much less than is in my heart to say upon the over meek subject mister Hickman is expected from London this evening I have desired him to inquire after Lovelace s life and conversation in town If he has not inquired I shall be very angry with him Don t expect a very good account of either He is certainly an intriguing wretch and full of inventions Upon my word I most heartily despise that sex I wish they would let our fathers and mothers alone teasing them to tease us with their golden promises and protestations and settlements and the rest of their ostentatious nonsense How charmingly might you and I live together and despise them all But to be cajoled wire drawn and ensnared like silly birds into a state of bondage or vile subordination to be courted as princesses for a few weeks in order to be treated as slaves for the rest of our lives Indeed my dear as you say of Solmes I cannot endure them But for your relations friends no more will I call them unworthy as they are even of the other name to take such a wretch s price as that and to the cutting off of all reversions from his own family How must a mind but commonly just resist such a measure mister Hickman shall sound Lord M upon the subject you recommend But beforehand I can tell you what he and what his sisters will say when they are sounded Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss Clarissa Harlowe missus Fortescue told me that they are all your very great admirers If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do let me say that I can give it in one word it is only by re urging you to RESUME If you do all the rest will follow We are told here that missus Norton as well as your aunt Hervey has given her opinion on the implicit side of the question If she can think that the part she has had in your education and your own admirable talents and acquirements are to be thrown away upon such a worthless creature as Solmes I could heartily quarrel with her You may think I say this to lessen your regard for the good woman And perhaps not wholly without cause if you do For to own the truth methinks I don t love her so well as I should do did you love her so apparently less that I could be out of doubt that you love me better Your mother tells you That you will have great trials that you are under your father s discipline The word is enough for me to despise them who give occasion for its use That it is out of her power to help you And again That if you have any favour to hope for it must be by the mediation of your uncles I suppose you will write to the oddities since you are forbid to see them But can it be that such a lady such a sister such a wife such a mother has no influence in her own family Who indeed as you say if this be so would marry that can live single My choler is again beginning to rise RESUME my dear and that is all I will give myself time to say further lest I offend you when I cannot serve you only this that I am Your truly affectionate friend and servant ANNA HOWE LETTER XXVIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY MARCH ten You will permit me my dear to touch upon a few passages in your last letter that affect me sensibly 
2496-156089-0001	train-other-500	In the first place you must allow me to say low as I am in spirits that I am very angry with you for your reflections on my relations particularly on my father and mother and on the memory of my grandfather
2496-156089-0002	train-other-500	Nor my dear does your own mother always escape the keen edge of your vivacity One cannot one s self forbear to write or speak freely of those we love and honour when grief from imagined hard treatment
2496-156089-0003	train-other-500	wrings the heart but it goes against one to hear any body else take the same liberties Then you have so very strong a manner of expression where you take a distaste that when passion has subdued and I come
none	none	 upon reflection to see by your severity what I have given occasion for I cannot help condemning myself But least of all can I bear that you should reflect upon my mother What my dear 
2496-156089-0004	train-other-500	if her meekness should not be rewarded Is the want of reward or the want even of a grateful acknowledgement a reason for us to dispense with what we think our duty They were my father s lively spirits that first made him
2496-156089-0005	train-other-500	an interest in her gentle bosom They were the same spirits turned inward as I have heretofore observed that made him so impatient when the cruel malady seized him He always loved my mother
2496-156089-0006	train-other-500	And would not LOVE and PITY excusably nay laudably make a good wife
none	none	 who was an hourly witness of his pangs when labouring under a paroxysm and his paroxysms becoming more and more frequent 
2496-156089-0007	train-other-500	as well as more and more severe give up her own will
none	none	 her own likings to oblige a husband thus afflicted whose love for her was unquestionable And if so was it not too natural human nature is not perfect my dear that the husband thus humoured by the wife should be unable to bear controul from any body else much less contradiction from his children See Letter V If then you would avoid my highest displeasure you must spare my mother and surely you will allow me with her to pity as well as to love and honour my father I have no friend but you to whom I can appeal 
2496-156089-0008	train-other-500	to whom I dare complain Unhappily circumstanced as I am it is but too probable that I shall complain because it is but too probably that I shall have more and more cause given me for complaint
2496-156089-0009	train-other-500	But be it your part if I do to sooth my angry passions and to soften my resentments and this the rather as you know what an influence your advice has upon me and as you must also know
2496-156089-0010	train-other-500	that the freedoms you take with my friends can have no other tendency but to weaken the sense of my duty to them without answering any good end to myself
none	none	 I cannot help owning however 
2496-156089-0011	train-other-500	that I am pleased to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which mister Solmes deserves from me But yet permit me to say that he is not quite so horrible a creature as you make him
2496-156089-0012	train-other-500	as to his person I mean for with regard to his mind by all I have heard you have done him but justice but you have such a talent at an ugly likeness and such a vivacity
none	none	 that they sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude 
2496-156089-0013	train-other-500	In short my dear I have known you in more instances than one sit down resolved to write all that wit rather than strict justice could suggest upon the given occasion Perhaps it may be thought
2496-156089-0014	train-other-500	that I should say the less on this particular subject because your dislike of him arises from love to me But should it not be our aim to judge of ourselves and of every thing that affects us as we may reasonably imagine other people would judge of us and of our actions
2496-156089-0015	train-other-500	As to the advice you give to resume my estate I am determined not to litigate with my father let what will be the consequence to myself I may give you at another time
none	none	 a more particular answer to your reasonings on this subject but at present will only observe that it is in my opinion 
2496-156089-0016	train-other-500	that Lovelace himself would hardly think me worth addressing were he to know this would be my resolution These men my dear
none	none	 with all their flatteries look forward to the PERMANENT 
2496-156089-0017	train-other-500	Indeed it is fit they should For love must be a very foolish thing to look back upon
none	none	 when it has brought persons born to affluence into indigence 
2496-156089-0018	train-other-500	and laid a generous mind under obligation and dependence You very ingeniously account for the love we bear to one another from the difference in our tempers I own I should not have thought of that
2496-156089-0019	train-other-500	There may possibly be something in it but whether there be or not whenever I am cool and give myself time to reflect I will love you the better for the correction you give be as severe as you will upon me
2496-156089-0020	train-other-500	Spare me not therefore my dear friend whenever you think me in the least faulty I love your agreeable raillery you know I always did nor however over serious you think me did I ever think you flippant
2496-156089-0021	train-other-500	as you harshly call it One of the first conditions of our mutual friendship was each should say or write to the other whatever was upon her mind without any offence to be taken a condition
2496-156089-0022	train-other-500	that is indeed indispensable in friendship I knew your mother would be for implicit obedience in a child I am sorry my case is so circumstanced that I cannot comply It would be my duty to do so if I could
none	none	 You are indeed very happy that you have nothing but your own agreeable yet whimsical humours to contend with in the choice she invites you to make of mister Hickman 
2496-156089-0023	train-other-500	How happy I should be to be treated with so much lenity I should blush to have my mother say that she begged and prayed me and all in vain to encourage a man so unexceptionable as mister Hickman
2496-156089-0024	train-other-500	Indeed my beloved Miss Howe I am ashamed to have your mother say with ME in her view
none	none	 What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young creatures of our sex 
2496-156089-0025	train-other-500	This touches me the more sensibly because you yourself my dear are so ready to persuade me into it I should be very blamable
none	none	 to endeavour to hide any the least bias upon my mind from you and I cannot but say that this man 
2496-156089-0026	train-other-500	this Lovelace is a man that might be liked well enough if he bore such a character as mister Hickman bears and even if there were hopes of reclaiming him And further still I will acknowledge
none	none	 that I believe it possible that one might be driven 
2496-156089-0027	train-other-500	by violent measures step by step as it were into something that might be called I don t know what to call it a conditional kind of liking or so But as to the word
none	none	 LOVE justifiable and charming as it is in some cases that is to say in all the relative in all the social and what is still beyond both in all our superior duties 
2496-156089-0028	train-other-500	in which it may be properly called divine
none	none	 it has methinks in the narrow circumscribed selfish peculiar sense in which you apply it to me 
2496-156089-0029	train-other-500	the man too so little to be approved of for his morals if
none	none	 all that report says of him be true no pretty sound with it Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects I will love you as I have said 
2496-156089-0030	train-other-500	the better for your friendly freedom But methinks I could be glad that you would not let this imputation pass so glibly from your pen or your lips as attributable to one of your own sex whether I be the person or not
none	none	 since the other must have a double triumph when a person of your delicacy armed with such contempts of them all as you would have one think can give up a friend with an exultation over her weakness 
2496-156089-0031	train-other-500	as a silly love sick creature I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two letters but my mind is not free enough at present
none	none	 The occasion for the above stuck with me and I could not help taking the earliest notice of them Having written to the end of my second sheet I will close this letter and in my next acquaint you with all that has happened here since my last LETTER XXIX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY MARCH eleven I have had such taunting messages and such repeated avowals of ill offices brought me from my brother and sister if I do no comply with their wills delivered too with provoking sauciness by Betty Barnes that I have thought it proper before I entered upon my intended address to my uncles in pursuance of the hint given me in my mother s letter to expostulate a little with them But I have done it in such a manner as will give you if you please to take it as you have done some parts of my former letters great advantage over me In short you will have more cause than ever to declare me far gone in love if my reasons for the change of my style in these letters with regard to mister Lovelace do not engage your more favourable opinion For I have thought proper to give them their own way and since they will have it that I have a preferable regard for mister Lovelace I give them cause rather to confirm their opinion than doubt it These are my reasons in brief for the alteration of my style In the first place they have grounded their principal argument for my compliance with their will upon my acknowledgement that my heart is free and so supposing I give up no preferable person my opposition has the look of downright obstinacy in their eyes and they argue that at worst my aversion to Solmes is an aversion that may be easily surmounted and ought to be surmounted in duty to my father and for the promotion of family views Next although they build upon this argument in order to silence me they seem not to believe me but treat me as disgracefully as if I were in love with one of my father s footmen so that my conditional willingness to give up mister Lovelace has procured me no favour In the next place I cannot but think that my brother s antipathy to mister Lovelace is far from being well grounded the man s inordinate passion for the sex is the crime that is always rung in my ears and a very great one it is But does my brother recriminate upon him thus in love to me No his whole behaviour shews me that that is not his principal motive and that he thinks me rather in his way than otherwise It is then the call of justice as I may say to speak a little in favour of a man who although provoked by my brother did not do him all the mischief he could have done him and which my brother had endeavoured to do him It might not be amiss therefore I thought to alarm them a little with apprehension that the methods they are taking with me are the very reverse of those they should take to answer the end they design by them And after all what is the compliment I make mister Lovelace if I allow it to be thought that I do really prefer him to such a man as him they terrify me with Then my Miss Howe concluded I accuses me of a tameness which subject me to insults from my brother I will keep that dear friend in my eye and for all these considerations try what a little of her spirit will do sit it ever so awkwardly upon me In this way of thinking I wrote to my brother and sister This is my letter to him TREATED as I am and in a great measure if not wholly by your instigations Brother you must permit me to expostulate with you upon the occasion It is not my intention to displease you in what I am going to write and yet I must deal freely with you the occasion calls for it And permit me in the first place to remind you that I am your sister and not your servant and that therefore the bitter revilings and passionate language brought me from you upon an occasion in which you have no reason to prescribe to me are neither worthy of my character to bear nor of yours to offer Put the case that I were to marry the man you dislike and that he were not to make a polite or tender husband Is that a reason for you to be an unpolite and disobliging brother Why must you Sir anticipate my misfortunes were such a case to happen Let me tell you plainly that the man who could treat me as a wife worse than you of late have treated me as a sister must be a barbarous man indeed Ask yourself I pray you Sir if you would thus have treated your sister Bella had she thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so much hated by you If not let me caution you my Brother not to take your measures by what you think will be borne but rather by what ought to be offered How would you take it if you had a brother who in a like case were to act by you as you do by me You cannot but remember what a laconic answer you gave even to my father who recommended to you Miss Nelly D Oily You did not like her were your words and that was thought sufficient You must needs think that I cannot but know to whom to attribute my disgraces when I recollect my father s indulgence to me permitting me to decline several offers and to whom that a common cause is endeavoured to be made in favour of a man whose person and manners are more exceptional than those of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refuse I offer not to compare the two men together nor is there indeed the least comparison to be made between them All the difference to the one s disadvantage if I did is but one point of the greatest importance indeed But to whom of most importance To myself surely were I to encourage his application of the least to you Nevertheless if you do not by your strange politics unite that man and me as joint sufferers in one cause you shall find me as much resolved to renounce him as I am to refuse the other I have made an overture to this purpose I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions that it will be owing to you if it be not accepted It is a sad thing to have it to say without being conscious of ever having given you cause of offence that I have in you a brother but not a friend Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your late and present conduct with a foolish sister But if politeness if civility be not due to that character and to my sex justice is Let me take the liberty further to observe that the principal end of a young man s education at the university is to learn him to reason justly and to subdue the violence of his passions I hope Brother that you will not give room for any body who knows us both to conclude that the toilette has taught the one more of the latter doctrine than the university has taught the other I am truly sorry to have cause to say that I have heard it often remarked that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education I hope Sir that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you you have given me too much reason for it and you have taken much greater with me without reason so if you are offended ought to look at the cause and not at the effect then examining yourself that cause will cease and there will not be any where a more accomplished gentleman than my brother Sisterly affection I do assure you Sir unkindly as you have used me and not the pertness which of late you have been so apt to impute to me is my motive in this hint Let me invoke your returning kindness my only brother And give me cause I beseech you to call you my compassionating friend For I am and ever will be Your affectionate sister CLARISSA HARLOWE This is my brother s answer TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE I KNOW there will be no end of your impertinent scribble if I don t write to you I write therefore but without entering into argument with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner it is to forbid you to plague me with your quaint nonsense I know not what wit in a woman is good for but to make her overvalue herself and despise every other person Yours Miss Pert has set you above your duty and above being taught or prescribed to either by parents or any body else But go on Miss your mortification will be the greater that s all child It shall I assure you if I can make it so so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace who is justly hated by all your family to every body We see by your letter now what we too justly suspected before most evidently we see the hold he has got of your forward heart But the stronger the hold the greater must be the force and you shall have enough of that to tear such a miscreant from it In me notwithstanding your saucy lecturing and your saucy reflections before you are sure of a friend as well as of a brother if it be not your own fault But if you will still think of such a wretch as that Lovelace never expect either friend or brother in JA HARLOWE I will now give you a copy of my letter to my sister with her answer IN what my dear Sister have I offended you that instead of endeavouring to soften my father s anger against me as I am sure I should have done for you had my unhappy case been yours you should in so hard hearted a manner join to aggravate not only his displeasure but my mother s against me Make but my case your own my dear Bella and suppose you were commanded to marry mister Lovelace to whom you are believed to have such an antipathy would you not think it a very grievous injunction Yet cannot your dislike to mister Lovelace be greater than mine is to mister Solmes Nor are love and hatred voluntary passions My brother may perhaps think it a proof of a manly spirit to shew himself an utter stranger to the gentle passions We have both heard him boast that he never loved with distinction and having predominating passions and checked in his first attempt perhaps he never will It is the less wonder then raw from the college so lately himself the tutored that he should set up for a tutor a prescriber to our gentler sex whose tastes and manners are differently formed for what according to his account are colleges but classes of tyrants from the upper students over the lower and from them to the tutor That he with such masculine passions should endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy sister in a case where his antipathy and give me leave to say his ambition once you would have allowed the latter to be his fault can be gratified by so doing may not be quite so much to be wondered at but that a sister should give up the cause of a sister and join with him to set her father and mother against her in a case that might have been her own indeed my Bella this is not pretty in you There was a time that mister Lovelace was thought reclaimable and when it was far from being deemed a censurable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour a man of his sense and understanding I am far from wishing to make the experiment but nevertheless will say that if I have not a regard for him the disgraceful methods taken to compel me to receive the addresses of such a man as mister Solmes are enough to induce it Do you my Sister for one moment lay aside all prejudice and compare the two men in their births their educations their persons their understandings their manners their air and their whole deportments and in their fortunes too taking in reversions and then judge of both yet as I have frequently offered I will live single with all my heart if that will do I cannot thus live in displeasure and disgrace I would if I could oblige all my friends But will it be just will it be honest to marry a man I cannot endure If I have not been used to oppose the will of my father but have always delighted to oblige and obey judge of the strength of my antipathy by the painful opposition I am obliged to make and cannot help it Pity then my dearest Bella my sister my friend my companion my adviser as you used to be when I was happy and plead for Your ever affectionate CL HARLOWE TO MISS CLARY HARLOWE Let it be pretty or not pretty in your wise opinion I shall speak my mind I will assure you both of you and your conduct in relation to this detested Lovelace You are a fond foolish girl with all your wisdom Your letter shews that enough in twenty places And as to your cant of living single nobody will believe you This is one of your fetches to avoid complying with your duty and the will of the most indulgent parents in the world as yours have been to you I am sure though now they see themselves finely requited for it We all indeed once thought your temper soft and amiable but why was it You never were contradicted before you had always your own way But no sooner do you meet with opposition in your wishes to throw yourself away upon a vile rake but you shew what you are You cannot love mister Solmes that s the pretence but Sister Sister let me tell you that is because Lovelace has got into your fond heart a wretch hated justly hated by us all and who has dipped his hands in the blood of your brother yet him you would make our relation would you I have no patience with you but for putting the case of my liking such a vile wretch as him As to the encouragement you pretend he received formerly from all our family it was before we knew him to be so vile and the proofs that had such force upon us ought to have had some upon you and would had you not been a foolish forward girl as on this occasion every body sees you are O how you run out in favour of the wretch His birth his education his person his understanding his manners his air his fortune reversions too taken in to augment the surfeiting catalogue What a fond string of lovesick praises is here And yet you would live single Yes I warrant when so many imaginary perfections dance before your dazzled eye But no more I only desire that you will not while you seem to have such an opinion of your wit think every one else a fool and that you can at pleasure by your whining flourishes make us all dance after your lead Write as often as you will this shall be the last answer or notice you shall have upon this subject from ARABELLA HARLOWE I had in readiness a letter for each of my uncles and meeting in the garden a servant of my uncle Harlowe I gave him to deliver according to their respective directions If I am to form a judgment by the answers I have received from my brother and sister as above I must not I doubt expect any good from those letters But when I have tried every expedient I shall have the less to blame myself for if any thing unhappy should fall out I will send you copies of both when I shall see what notice they will be thought worthy of if of any LETTER XXX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY NIGHT MARCH twelve This man this Lovelace gives me great uneasiness He is extremely bold and rash He was this afternoon at our church in hopes to see me I suppose and yet if he had such hopes his usual intelligence must have failed him Shorey was at church and a principal part of her observation was upon his haughty and proud behaviour when he turned round in the pew where he sat to our family pew My father and both my uncles were there so were my mother and sister My brother happily was not They all came home in disorder Nor did the congregation mind any body but him it being his first appearance there since the unhappy rencounter What did the man come for if he intended to look challenge and defiance as Shorey says he did and as others it seems thought he did as well as she Did he come for my sake and by behaving in such a manner to those present of my family imagine he was doing me either service or pleasure He knows how they hate him nor will he take pains would pains do to obviate their hatred You and I my dear have often taken notice of his pride and you have rallied him upon it and instead of exculpating himself he has owned it and by owning it he has thought he has done enough For my own part I thought pride in his case an improper subject for raillery People of birth and fortune to be proud is so needless so mean a vice If they deserve respect they will have it without requiring it In other words for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour is to give a proof that they mistrust their own merit To make confession that they know that their actions will not attract it Distinction or quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a new thing And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon themselves by it is a counter balance Such added advantages too as this man has in his person and mien learned also as they say he is Such a man to be haughty to be imperious The lines of his own face at the same time condemning him how wholly inexcusable Proud of what Not of doing well the only justifiable pride Proud of exterior advantages Must not one be led by such a stop short pride as I may call it in him or her who has it to mistrust the interior Some people may indeed be afraid that if they did not assume they would be trampled upon A very narrow fear however since they trample upon themselves who can fear this But this man must be secure that humility would be an ornament to him He has talents indeed but those talents and his personal advantages have been snares to him It is plain they have And this shews that weighed in an equal balance he would be found greatly wanting Had my friends confided as they did at first in that discretion which they do not accuse me of being defective in I dare say I should have found him out and then should have been as resolute to dismiss him as I was to dismiss others and as I am never to have mister Solmes O that they did but know my heart It shall sooner burst than voluntarily uncompelled undriven dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon them or upon my sex Excuse me my dear friend for these grave soliloquies as I may call them How have I run from reflection to reflection But the occasion is recent They are all in commotion below upon it Shorey says that mister Lovelace watched my mother s eye and bowed to her and she returned the compliment He always admired my mother She would not I believe have hated him had she not been bid to hate him and had it not been for the rencounter between him and her only son doctor Lewen was at church and observing as every one else did the disorder into which mister Lovelace s appearance had put all our family was so good as to engage him in conversation when the service was over till they were all gone to their coaches See Letter XXXI for mister Lovelace s account of his behaviour and intentions in his appearance at church My uncles had my letters in the morning They as well as my father are more and more incensed against me it seems Their answers if they vouchsafe to answer me will demonstrate I doubt not the unseasonableness of this rash man s presence at our church They are angry also as I understand with my mother for returning his compliment What an enemy is hatred even to the common forms of civility which however more distinguish the payer of a compliment than the receiver But they all see they say that there is but one way to put an end to his insults So I shall suffer And in what will the rash man have benefited himself or mended his prospects I am extremely apprehensive that this worse than ghost like appearance of his bodes some still bolder step If he come hither and very desirous he is of my leave to come I am afraid there will be murder To avoid that if there were no other way I would most willingly be buried alive They are all in consultation upon my letters I suppose so they were in the morning which occasioned my uncles to be at our church I will send you the copies of those letters as I promised in my last when I see whether I can give you their answers with them This letter is all I cannot tell what the effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned my apprehensions Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story CL H LETTER XXXI mister LOVELACE TO JOHN BELFORD esquire MONDAY MARCH thirteen In vain dost thou and thy compeers press me to go to town while I am in such an uncertainty as I am in at present with this proud beauty All the ground I have hitherto gained with her is entirely owing to her concern for the safety of people whom I have reason to hate These gentlemen affected what they called the Roman style to wit the thee and the thou in their letters and it was an agreed rule with them to take in good part whatever freedoms they treated each other with if the passages were written in that style Write then thou biddest me if I will not come That indeed I can do and as well without a subject as with one And what follows shall be a proof of it The lady s malevolent brother has now as I told thee at M Hall introduced another man the most unpromising in his person and qualities the most formidable in his offers that has yet appeared This man has by his proposals captivated every soul of the Harlowes Soul did I say There is not a soul among them but my charmer s and she withstanding them all is actually confined and otherwise maltreated by a father the most gloomy and positive at the instigation of a brother the most arrogant and selfish But thou knowest their characters and I will not therefore sully my paper with them But is it not a confounded thing to be in love with one who is the daughter the sister the niece of a family I must eternally despise And the devil of it that love increasing with her what shall I call it Tis not scorn Tis not pride Tis not the insolence of an adored beauty But tis to virtue it seems that my difficulties are owin and I pay for not being a sly sinner an hypocrite for being regardless of my reputation for permittin slander to open its mouth against me But is it necessary for such a one as I who have been used to carry all before me upon my own terms I who never inspired a fear that had not a discernibly predominant mixture of love in it to be a hypocrite Well says the poet He who seems virtuous does but act a part And shews not his own nature but his art Well but it seems I must practise for this art if it would succeed with this truly admirable creature but why practise for it Cannot I indeed reform I have but one vice Have I Jack Thou knowest my heart if any man living does As far as I know it myself thou knowest it But tis a cursed deceiver for it has many a time imposed upon its master Master did I say That I am not now nor have I been from the moment I beheld this angel of a woman Prepared indeed as I was by her character before I saw her For what a mind must that be which though not virtuous itself admires not virtue in another My visit to Arabella owing to a mistake of the sister into which as thou hast heard me say I was led by the blundering uncle who was to introduce me but lately come from abroad to the divinity as I thought but instead of her carried me to a mere mortal And much difficulty had I so fond and forward my lady to get off without forfeiting all with a family I intended should give me a goddess I have boasted that I was once in love before and indeed I thought I was It was in my early manhood with that quality jilt whose infidelity I have vowed to revenge upon as many of the sex as shall come into my power I believe in different climes I have already sacrificed an hecatomb to my Nemesis in pursuance of this vow But upon recollecting what I was then and comparing it with what I find myself now I cannot say that I was ever in love before What was it then dost thou ask me since the disappointment had such effects upon me when I found myself jilted that I was hardly kept in my senses Why I ll grant thee what as near as I can remember for it was a great while ago It was Egad Jack I can hardly tell what it was but a vehement aspiration after a novelty I think Those confounded poets with their terrenely celestial descriptions did as much with me as the lady they fired my imagination and set me upon a desire to become a goddess maker I must needs try my new fledged pinions in sonnet elogy and madrigal I must have a Cynthia a Stella a Sacharissa as well as the best of them darts and flames and the devil knows what must I give to my cupid I must create beauty and place it where nobody else could find it and many a time have I been at a loss for a subject when my new created goddess has been kinder than it was proper for my plaintive sonnet that she should be Then I found I had a vanity of another sort in my passion I found myself well received among the women in general and I thought it a pretty lady like tyranny I was then very young and very vain to single out some one of the sex to make half a score jealous And I can tell thee it had its effect for many an eye have I made to sparkle with rival indignation many a cheek glow and even many a fan have I caused to be snapped at a sister beauty accompanied with a reflection perhaps at being seen alone with a wild young fellow who could not be in private with both at once In short Jack it was more pride than love as I now find it that put me upon making such a confounded rout about losing that noble varletess I thought she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved her nay I had the vanity to suppose she could not help it My friends were pleased with my choice They wanted me to be shackled for early did they doubt my morals as to the sex They saw that the dancing the singing the musical ladies were all fond of my company For who I am in a humour to be vain I think for who danced who sung who touched the string whatever the instrument with a better grace than thy friend I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which every one sees and acknowledges Such praise begetting hypocrisy Such affectedly disclaimed attributes Such contemptible praise traps But yet shall my vanity extend only to personals such as the gracefulness of dress my debonnaire and my assurance Self taught self acquired these For my parts I value not myself upon them Thou wilt say I have no cause Perhaps not But if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals those are not my own and to be proud of what a man is answerable for the abuse of and has no merit in the right use of is to strut like the jay in borrowed plumage But to return to my fair jilt I could not bear that a woman who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters they were not iron ones like those I now wear should prefer a coronet to me and when the bird was flown I set more value upon it that when I had it safe in my cage and could visit in when I pleased But now am I indeed in love I can think of nothing of nobody but the divine Clarissa Harlowe Harlowe How that hated word sticks in my throat But I shall give her for it the name of Love Lovelace CLARISSA O there s music in the name That soft ning me to infant tenderness Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life But couldst thou have believed that I who think it possible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured that I who for this charming creature think of foregoing the life of honour for the life of shackles could adopt these over tender lines of Otway I checked myself and leaving the first three lines of the following of Dryden to the family of whiners find the workings of the passion in my stormy soul better expressed by the three last Love various minds does variously inspire He stirs in gentle natures gentle fires Like that of incense on the alter laid But raging flames tempestuous souls invade A fire which ev ry windy passion blows With pride it mounts and with revenge it glows And with REVENGE it shall glow For dost thou think that if it were not from the hope that this stupid family are all combined to do my work for me I would bear their insults Is it possible to imagine that I would be braved as I am braved threatened as I am threatened by those who are afraid to see me and by this brutal brother too to whom I gave a life a life indeed not worth my taking had I not a greater pride in knowing that by means of his very spy upon me I am playing him off as I please cooling or inflaming his violent passions as may best suit my purposes permitting so much to be revealed of my life and actions and intentions as may give him such a confidence in his double faced agent as shall enable me to dance his employer upon my own wires This it is that makes my pride mount above my resentment By this engine whose springs I am continually oiling I play them all off The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe to engage her for example sake to her princessly daughter to join in their cause and to assert an authority they are resolved right or wrong or I could do nothing to maintain And what my motive dost thou ask No less than this That my beloved shall find no protection out of my family for if I know hers fly she must or have the man she hates This therefore if I take my measures right and my familiar fail me not will secure her mine in spite of them all in spite of her own inflexible heart mine without condition without reformation promises without the necessity of a siege of years perhaps and to be even then after wearing the guise of merit doubting hypocrisy at an uncertainty upon a probation unapproved of Then shall I have all the rascals and rascalesses of the family come creeping to me I prescribing to them and bringing that sordidly imperious brother to kneel at the footstool of my throne All my fear arises from the little hold I have in the heart of this charming frost piece such a constant glow upon her lovely features eyes so sparkling limbs so divinely turned health so florid youth so blooming air so animated to have an heart so impenetrable and I the hitherto successful Lovelace the addresser How can it be Yet there are people and I have talked with some of them who remember that she was born Her nurse Norton boasts of her maternal offices in her earliest infancy and in her education gradatim So there is full proof that she came not from above all at once an angel How then can she be so impenetrable But here s her mistake nor will she be cured of it She takes the man she calls her father her mother had been faultless had she not been her father s wife she takes the men she calls her uncles the fellow she calls her brother and the poor contemptible she calls her sister to be her father to be her uncles her brother her sister and that as such she owes to some of them reverence to others respect let them treat her ever so cruelly Sordid ties Mere cradle prejudices For had they not been imposed upon her by Nature when she was in a perverse humour or could she have chosen her relations would any of these have been among them How my heart rises at her preference of them to me when she is convinced of their injustice to me Convinced that the alliance would do honour to them all herself excepted to whom every one owes honour and from whom the most princely family might receive it But how much more will my heart rise with indignation against her if I find she hesitates but one moment however persecuted about preferring me to the man she avowedly hates But she cannot surely be so mean as to purchase her peace with them at so dear a rate She cannot give a sanction to projects formed in malice and founded in a selfishness and that at her own expense which she has spirit enough to despise in others and ought to disavow that we may not think her a Harlowe By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather that I am not likely to come up in haste since I must endeavour first to obtain some assurance from the beloved of my soul that I shall not be sacrificed to such a wretch as Solmes Woe be to the fair one if ever she be driven into my power for I despair of a voluntary impulse in my favour and I find a difficulty in obtaining this security That her indifference to me is not owing to the superior liking she has for any other is what rivets my chains But take care fair one take care O thou most exalted of female minds and loveliest of persons how thou debasest thyself by encouraging such a competition as thy sordid relations have set on foot in mere malice to me Thou wilt say I rave And so I do Perdition catch my soul but I do love her Else could I hear the perpetual revilings of her implacable family Else could I basely creep about not her proud father s house but his paddock and garden walls Yet a quarter of a mile distance between us not hoping to behold the least glimpse of her shadow Else should I think myself repaid amply repaid if the fourth fifth or sixth midnight stroll through unfrequented paths and over briery enclosures affords me a few cold lines the even expected purport only to let me know that she values the most worthless person of her very worthless family more than she values me and that she would not write at all but to induce me to bear insults which unman me to bear My lodging in the intermediate way at a wretched alehouse disguised like an inmate of it accommodations equally vile as those I met with in my Westphalian journey Tis well that the necessity for all this arise not from scorn and tyranny but is first imposed upon herself But was ever hero in romance fighting with giants and dragons excepted called upon to harder trials Fortune and family and reversionary grandeur on my side Such a wretched fellow my competitor Must I not be deplorably in love that can go through these difficulties encounter these contempts By my soul I am half ashamed of myself I who am perjured too by priority of obligation if I am faithful to any woman in the world And yet why say I I am half ashamed Is it not a glory to love her whom every one who sees her either loves or reveres or both Dryden says The cause of love can never be assign d Tis in no face but in the lover s mind And Cowley thus addresses beauty as a mere imaginary Beauty thou wild fantastic ape Who dost in ev ry country change thy shape Here black there brown here tawny and there white Thou flatt rer who comply saint with ev ry sight Who hast no certain what nor where But both these had they been her contemporaries and known her would have confessed themselves mistaken and taking together person mind and behaviour would have acknowledged the justice of the universal voice in her favour Full many a lady I ve ey d with best regard and many a time Th harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear For sev ral virtues Have I liked several women Never any With so full a soul but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow d And put it to the foil But SHE O SHE So perfect and so peerless is created Of ev ry creature s best SHAKESP Thou art curious to know if I have not started a new game If it be possible for so universal a lover to be confined so long to one object Thou knowest nothing of this charming creature that thou canst put such questions to me or thinkest thou knowest me better than thou dost All that s excellent in her sex is this lady Until by MATRIMONIAL or EQUAL intimacies I have found her less than angel it is impossible to think of any other Then there are so many stimulatives to such a spirit as mine in this affair besides love such a field of stratagem and contrivance which thou knowest to be the delight of my heart Then the rewarding end of all To carry off such a girl as this in spite of all her watchful and implacable friends and in spite of a prudence and reserve that I never met with in any of the sex what a triumph What a triumph over the whole sex And then such a revenge to gratify which is only at present politically reined in eventually to break forth with greater fury Is it possible thinkest thou that there can be room for a thought that is not of her and devoted to her By the devices I have this moment received I have reason to think that I shall have occasion for thee here Hold thyself in readiness to come down upon the first summons Let Belton and Mowbray and Tourville likewise prepare themselves I have a great mind to contrive a method to send James Harlowe to travel for improvement Never was there a booby squire that more wanted it Contrive it did I say I have already contrived it could I but put it in execution without being suspected to have a hand in it This I am resolved upon if I have not his sister I will have him But be this as it may there is a present likelihood of room for glorious mischief A confederacy had been for some time formed against me but the uncles and the nephew are now to be double servanted single servanted they were before and those servants are to be double armed when they attend their masters abroad This indicates their resolute enmity to me and as resolute favour to Solmes The reinforced orders for this hostile apparatus are owing it seems to a visit I made yesterday to their church A good place I thought to begin a reconciliation in supposing the heads of the family to be christians and that they meant something by their prayers My hopes were to have an invitation or at least to gain a pretence to accompany home the gloomy sire and so get an opportunity to see my goddess for I believed they durst not but be civil to me at least But they were filled with terror it seems at my entrance a terror they could not get over I saw it indeed in their countenances and that they all expected something extraordinary to follow And so it should have done had I been more sure than I am of their daughter s favour Yet not a hair of any of their stupid heads do I intend to hurt You shall all have your directions in writing if there be occasion But after all I dare say there will be no need but to shew your faces in my company Such faces never could four men shew Mowbray s so fierce and so fighting Belton s so pert and so pimply Tourville s so fair and so foppish thine so rough and so resolute and I your leader What hearts although meditating hostility must those be which we shall not appall Each man occasionally attended by a servant or two long ago chosen for qualities resembling those of his master Thus Jack as thou desirest have I written Written upon something upon nothing upon REVENGE which I love upon LOVE which I hate heartily hate because tis my master and upon the devil knows what besides for looking back I am amazed at the length of it Thou mayest read it I would not for a king s ransom But so as I do but write thou sayest thou wilt be pleased Be pleased then I command thee to be pleased if not for the writer s or written sake for thy word s sake And so in the royal style for am I not likely to be thy king and thy emperor in the great affair before us I bid thee very heartily Farewell LETTER XXXII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY MARCH fourteen I now send you copies of my letters to my uncles with their answers Be pleased to return the latter by the first deposit I leave them for you to make remarks upon I shall make none TO JOHN HARLOWE esquire SAT MARCH eleven Allow me my honoured second Papa as in my happy days you taught me to call you to implore your interest with my Papa to engage him to dispense with a command which if insisted upon will deprive me of my free will and make me miserable for my whole life For my whole life let me repeat Is that a small point my dear Uncle to give up Am not I to live with the man Is any body else Shall I not therefore be allowed to judge for myself whether I can or cannot live happily with him Should it be ever so unhappily will it be prudence to complain or appeal If it were to whom could I appeal with effect against a husband And would not the invincible and avowed dislike I have for him at setting out seem to justify any ill usage from him in that state were I to be ever so observant of him And if I were to be at all observant of him it must be from fear not love Once more let me repeat That this is not a small point to give up and that it is for life Why I pray you good Sir should I be made miserable for life Why should I be deprived of all comfort but that which the hope that it would be a very short one would afford me Marriage is a very solemn engagement enough to make a young creature s heart ache with the best prospects when she thinks seriously of it To be given up to a strange man to be engrafted into a strange family to give up her very name as a mark of her becoming his absolute and dependent property to be obliged to prefer this strange man to father mother to every body and his humours to all her own or to contend perhaps in breach of avowed duty for every innocent instance of free will To go no where to make acquaintance to give up acquaintance to renounce even the strictest friendships perhaps all at his pleasure whether she thinks it reasonable to do so or not Surely Sir a young creature ought not to be obliged to make all these sacrifices but for such a man as she can love If she be how sad must be the case How miserable the life if it can be called life I wish I could obey you all What a pleasure would it be to me if I could Marry first and love will come after was said by one of my dearest friends But this is a shocking assertion A thousand thing may happen to make that state but barely tolerable where it is entered into with mutual affections What must it then be where the husband can have no confidence in the love of his wife but has reason rather to question it from the preference he himself believes she would have given to somebody else had she had her own option What doubts what jealousies what want of tenderness what unfavourable prepossessions will there be in a matrimony thus circumstanced How will every look every action even the most innocent be liable to misconstruction While on the other hand an indifference a carelessness to oblige may take place and fear only can constrain even an appearance of what ought to be the effect of undisguised love Think seriously of these things dear good Sir and represent them to my father in that strong light which the subject will bear but in which my sex and my tender years and inexperience will not permit me to paint it and use your powerful interest that your poor niece may not be consigned to a misery so durable I offered to engage not to marry at all if that condition may be accepted What a disgrace is it to me to be thus sequestered from company thus banished my papa s and mamma s presence thus slighted and deserted by you Sir and my other kind uncle And to be hindered from attending at that public worship which were I out of the way of my duty would be most likely to reduce me into the right path again Is this the way Sir can this be thought to be the way to be taken with a free and open spirit May not this strange method rather harden than convince I cannot bear to live in disgrace thus The very servants so lately permitted to be under my own direction hardly daring to speak to me my own servant discarded with high marks of undeserved suspicion and displeasure and my sister s maid set over me The matter may be too far pushed Indeed it may And then perhaps every one will be sorry for their parts in it May I be permitted to mention an expedient If I am to be watched banished and confined suppose Sir it were to be at your house Then the neighbouring gentry will the less wonder that the person of whom they used to think so favourably appear not at church here and that she received not their visits I hope there can be no objection to this You used to love to have me with you Sir when all went happily with me And will you not now permit me in my troubles the favour of your house till all this displeasure is overblown Upon my word Sir I will not stir out of doors if you require the contrary of me nor will I see any body but whom you will allow me to see provided mister Solmes be not brought to persecute me there Procure then this favour for me if you cannot procure the still greater that of a happy reconciliation which nevertheless I presume to hope for if you will be so good as to plead for me and you will then add to those favours and to that indulgence which have bound me and will for ever bind me to be Your dutiful and obliged niece CLARISSA HARLOWE THE ANSWER SUNDAY NIGHT MY DEAR NIECE It grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask Yet it must be so for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point in which our promises and honour were engaged before we believed there could be so sturdy an opposition you must never expect to be what you have been to us all In short Niece we are in an embattled phalanx Your reading makes you a stranger to nothing but what you should be most acquainted with So you will see by that expression that we are not to be pierced by your persuasions and invincible persistence We have agreed all to be moved or none and not to comply without one another So you know your destiny and have nothing to do but to yield to it Let me tell you the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged again But give up an inclination and there is some merit in that As to your expedient you shall not come to my house Miss Clary though this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have denied you for were you to keep your word as to seeing nobody but whom we please yet can you write to somebody else and receive letters from him This we too well know you can and have done more is the shame and the pity You offer to live single Miss we wished you married but because you may not have the man your heart is set upon why truly you will have nobody we shall recommend and as we know that somehow or other you correspond with him or at least did as long as you could and as he defies us all and would not dare to do so if he were not sure of you in spite of us all which is not a little vexatious to us you must think we are resolved to frustrate him and triumph over him rather than that he should triumph over us that s one word for all So expect not any advocateship from me I will not plead for you and that s enough From Your displeased uncle JOHN HARLOWE P S For the rest I refer to my brother Antony TO ANTONY HARLOWE esquire SATURDAY MARCH eleven HONOURED SIR As you have thought fit to favour mister Solmes with your particular recommendation and was very earnest in his behalf ranking him as you told me upon introducing him to me among your select friends and expecting my regards to him accordingly I beg your patience while I offer a few things out of many that I could offer to your serious consideration on occasion of his address to me if I am to use that word I am charged with prepossession in another person s favour You will be pleased Sir to remember that till my brother returned from Scotland that other person was not absolutely discouraged nor was I forbid to receive his visits I believe it will not be pretended that in birth education or personal endowments a comparison can be made between the two And only let me ask you Sir if the one would have been thought of for me had he not made such offers as upon my word I think I ought not in justice to accept of nor he to propose offers which if he had not made I dare say my papa would not have required them of him But the one it seems has many faults Is the other faultless The principal thing objected to mister Lovelace and a very inexcusable one is that he is immoral in his loves Is not the other in his hatreds Nay as I may say in his loves too the object only differing if the love of money be the root of all evil But Sir if I am prepossessed what has mister Solmes to hope for Why should he persevere What must I think of the man who would wish me to be his wife against my inclination And is it not a very harsh thing for my friends to desire to see me married to one I cannot love when they will not be persuaded but that there is one whom I do love Treated as I am now is the time for me to speak out or never Let me review what it is mister Solmes depends upon on this occasion Does he believe that the disgrace which I supper on his account will give him a merit with me Does he think to win my esteem through my uncles sternness to me by my brother s contemptuous usage by my sister s unkindness by being denied to visit or be visited and to correspond with my chosen friend although a person of unexceptionable honour and prudence and of my own sex my servant to be torn from me and another servant set over me to be confined like a prisoner to narrow and disgraceful limits in order avowedly to mortify me and to break my spirit to be turned out of that family management which I loved and had the greater pleasure in it because it was an ease as I thought to my mamma and what my sister chose not and yet though time hangs heavy upon my hands to be so put out of my course that I have as little inclination as liberty to pursue any of my choice delights Are these steps necessary to reduce me to a level so low as to make me a fit wife for this man Yet these are all he can have to trust to And if his reliance is on these measures I would have him to know that he mistakes meekness and gentleness of disposition for servility and baseness of heart I beseech you Sir to let the natural turn and bent of his mind and my mind be considered What are his qualities by which he would hope to win my esteem Dear dear Sir if I am to be compelled let it be in favour of a man that can read and write that can teach me something For what a husband must that man make who can do nothing but command and needs himself the instruction he should be qualified to give I may be conceited Sir I may be vain of my little reading of my writing as of late I have more than once been told I am But Sir the more unequal the proposed match if so the better opinion I have of myself the worse I must have of him and the more unfit are we for each other Indeed Sir I must say I thought my friends had put a higher value upon me My brother pretended once that it was owing to such value that mister Lovelace s address was prohibited Can this be and such a man as mister Solmes be intended for me As to his proposed settlements I hope I shall not incur your great displeasure if I say what all who know me have reason to think and some have upbraided me for that I despise those motives Dear dear Sir what are settlements to one who has as much of her own as she wishes for Who has more in her own power as a single person than it is probable she would be permitted to have at her disposal as a wife Whose expenses and ambition are moderate and who if she had superfluities would rather dispense them to the necessitous than lay them by her useless If then such narrow motives have so little weight with me for my own benefit shall the remote and uncertain view of family aggrandizements and that in the person of my brother and his descendents be thought sufficient to influence me Has the behaviour of that brother to me of late or his consideration for the family which had so little weight with him that he could choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son s rather than not ratify passions which he is above attempting to subdue and give me leave to say has been too much indulged in either with regard to his own good or the peace of any body related to him Has his behaviour I say deserved of me in particular that I should make a sacrifice of my temporal and who knows of my eternal happiness to promote a plan formed upon chimerical at least upon unlikely contingencies as I will undertake to demonstrate if I may be permitted to examine it I am afraid you will condemn my warmth But does not the occasion require it To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my opposition it seems it is owing that such advances have been made as have been made Then dear Sir allow something I beseech you for a spirit raised and embittered by disgraces which knowing my own heart I am confident to say are unmerited But why have I said so much in answer to the supposed charge of prepossession when I have declared to my mamma as now Sir I do to you that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other person particularly this mister Solmes I will enter into any engagements never to have the other nor any man else without their consents that is to say without the consents of my father and my mother and of you my uncle and my elder uncle and my cousin Morden as he is one of the trustees for my grandfather s bounty to me As to my brother indeed I cannot say that his treatment of me has been of late so brotherly as to entitle him to more than civility from me and for this give me leave to add he would be very much my debtor If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my dislike to mister Solmes that the prepossession which is charged upon me may not be supposed to influence me against him I do absolutely declare That were there no such man as mister Lovelace in the world I would not have mister Solmes It is necessary in some one of my letters to my dear friends that I should write so clearly as to put this matter out of all doubt and to whom can I better address myself with an explicitness that can admit of no mistake than to that uncle who professes the highest regard for plain dealing and sincerity Let me for these reasons be still more particular in some of my exceptions to him mister Solmes appears to me to all the world indeed to have a very narrow mind and no great capacity he is coarse and indelicate as rough in his manners as in his person he is not only narrow but covetous being possessed of great wealth he enjoys it not nor has the spirit to communicate to a distress of any kind Does not his own sister live unhappily for want of a little of his superfluities And suffers not he his aged uncle the brother of his own mother to owe to the generosity of strangers the poor subsistence he picks up from half a dozen families You know Sir my open free communicative temper how unhappy must I be circumscribed in his narrow selfish circle out of which being with held by this diabolical parsimony he dare no more stir than a conjurer out of his nor would let me Such a man as this love Yes perhaps he may my grandfather s estate which he has told several persons and could not resist hinting the same thing tome with that sort of pleasure which a low mind takes when it intimates its own interest as a sufficient motive for it to expect another s favour lies so extremely convenient for him that it would double the value of a considerable part of his own That estate and an alliance which would do credit to his obscurity and narrowness they make him think he can love and induce him to believe he does but at most he is but a second place love Riches were are and always will be his predominant passion His were left him by a miser on this very account and I must be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life and be as mean as he or else be quite unhappy Pardon Sir this severity of expression one is apt to say more than one would of a person one dislikes when more is said in his favour than he can possibly deserve and when he is urged to my acceptance with so much vehemence that there is no choice left me Whether these things be perfectly so or not while I think they are it is impossible I should ever look upon mister Solmes in the light he is offered to me Nay were he to be proved ten times better than I have represented him and sincerely think him yet would he be still ten times more disagreeable to me than any other man I know in the world Let me therefore beseech you Sir to become an advocate for your niece that she may not be made a victim to a man so highly disgustful to her You and my other uncle can do a great deal for me if you please with my papa Be persuaded Sir that I am not governed by obstinacy in this case but by aversion an aversion I cannot overcome for if I have but endeavoured to reason with myself out of regard to the duty I owe to my father s will my heart has recoiled and I have been averse to myself for offering but to argue with myself in behalf of a man who in the light he appears to me has no one merit and who knowing this aversion could not persevere as he does if he had the spirit of a man If Sir you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable I beseech you to support them with your interest If not I shall be most unhappy Nevertheless it is but just in me so to write as that mister Solmes may know what he has to trust to Forgive dear Sir this tedious letter and suffer it to have weight with you and you will for ever oblige Your dutiful and affectionate niece CL HARLOWE mister ANTONY HARLOWE TO MISS CL HARLOWE NIECE CLARY You had better not write to us or to any of us To me particularly you had better never to have set pen to paper on the subject whereon you have written He that is first in his own cause saith the wise man seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him And so in this respect I will be your neighbour for I will search your heart to the bottom that is to say if your letter be written from your heart Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken because of the knack you are noted for at writing But in defence of a father s authority in behalf of the good and honour and prosperity of the family one comes of what a hard thing it would be if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe can bring in behalf of her obstinacy In the first place don t you declare and that contrary to your declarations to your mother remember that girl that you prefer the man we all hate and who hates us as bad Then what a character have you given of a worthy man I wonder you dare write so freely of one we all respect but possibly it may be for that very reason How you begin your letter Because I value mister Solmes as my friend you treat him the worse That s the plain dunstable of the matter Miss I am not such a fool but I can see that And so a noted whoremonger is to be chosen before a man who is a money lover Let me tell you Niece this little becomes so nice a one as you have been always reckoned Who think you does more injustice a prodigal man or a saving man The one saves his own money the other spends other people s But your favourite is a sinner in grain and upon record The devil s in your sex God forgive me for saying so the nicest of them will prefer a vile rake and wh I suppose I must not repeat the word the word will offend when the vicious denominated by that word will be chosen I had not been a bachelor to this time if I had not seen such a mass of contradictions in you all Such gnat strainers and camel swallowers as venerable Holy Writ has it What names will perverseness call things by A prudent man who intends to be just to every body is a covetous man While a vile profligate rake is christened with the appellation of a gallant man and a polite man I ll warrant you It is my firm opinion Lovelace would not have so much regard for you as he professes but for two reasons And what are these Why out of spite to all of us one of them The other because of your independent fortune I wish your good grandfather had not left what he did so much in your own power as I may say But little did he imagine his beloved grand daughter would have turned upon all her friends as she has done What has mister Solmes to hope for if you are prepossessed Hey day Is this you cousin Clary Has he then nothing to hope for from your father s and mother s and our recommendations No nothing at all it seems O brave I should think that this with a dutiful child as we took you to be was enough Depending on this your duty we proceeded and now there is no help for it for we will not be balked neither shall our friend mister Solmes I can tell you that If your estate is convenient for him what then Does that pert cousin make it out that he does not love you He had need to expect some good with you that has so little good to hope for from you mind that But pray is not this estate our estate as we may say Have we not all an interest in it and a prior right if right were to have taken place And was it not more than a good old man s dotage God rest his soul that gave it you before us all Well then ought we not to have a choice who shall have it in marriage with you and would you have the conscience to wish us to let a vile fellow who hates us all run away with it You bid me weigh what you write do you weigh this Girl and it will appear we have more to say for ourselves than you was aware of As to your hard treatment as you call it thank yourself for that It may be over when you will so I reckon nothing upon that You was not banished and confined till all entreaty and fair speeches were tried with you mind that And mister Solmes can t help your obstinacy let that be observed too As to being visited and visiting you never was fond of either so that s a grievance put into the scale to make weight As to disgrace that s as bad to us as to you so fine a young creature So much as we used to brag of you too And besides this is all in your power as the rest But your heart recoils when you would persuade yourself to obey your parent Finely described is it not Too truly described I own as you go on I know that you may love him if you will I had a good mind to bid you hate him then perhaps you would like him the better for I have always found a most horrid romantic perverseness in your sex To do and to love what you should not is meat drink and vesture to you all I am absolutely of your brother s mind That reading and writing though not too much for the wits of you young girls are too much for your judgments You say you may be conceited Cousin you may be vain And so you are to despise this gentleman as you do He can read and write as well as most gentlemen I can tell you that Who told you mister Solmes cannot read and write But you must have a husband who can learn you something I wish you knew but your duty as well as you do your talents that Niece you have of late days to learn and mister Solmes will therefore find something to instruct you in I will not shew him this letter of yours though you seem to desire it lest it should provoke him to be too severe a schoolmaster when you are his n But now I think of it suppose you are the reader at your pen than he You will make the more useful wife to him won t you For who so good an economist as you And you may keep all of his accounts and save yourselves a steward And let me tell you this is a fine advantage in a family for those stewards are often sad dogs and creep into a man s estate before he knows where he is and not seldom is he forced to pay them interest for his own money I know not why a good wife should be above these things It is better than lying a bed half the day and junketing and card playing all the night and making yourselves wholly useless to every good purpose in your own families as is now the fashion among ye The duce take you all that do so say I Only that thank my stars I am a bachelor Then this is a province you are admirably versed in you grieve that it is taken from you here you know So here Miss with mister Solmes you will have something to keep account of for the sake of you and your children with the other perhaps you will have an account to keep too but an account of what will go over the left shoulder only of what he squanders what he borrows and what he owes and never will pay Come come Cousin you know nothing of the world a man s a man and you may have many partners in a handsome man and costly ones too who may lavish away all you save mister Solmes therefore for my money and I hope for yours But mister Solmes is a coarse man He is not delicate enough for your niceness because I suppose he dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb and because he lays not himself out in complimental nonsense the poison of female minds He is a man of sense that I can tell you No man talks more to the purpose to us but you fly him so that he has no opportunity given him to express it to you and a man who loves if he have ever so much sense looks a fool especially when he is despised and treated as you treated him the last time he was in your company As to his sister she threw herself away as you want to do against his full warning for he told her what she had to trust to if she married where she did marry And he was as good as his word and so an honest man ought offences against warning ought to be smarted for Take care this be not your case mind that His uncle deserves no favour from him for he would have circumvented mister Solmes and got Sir Oliver to leave to himself the estate he had always designed for him his nephew and brought him up in the hope of it Too ready forgiveness does but encourage offences that s your good father s maxim and there would not be so many headstrong daughters as there are if this maxim were kept in mind Punishments are of service to offenders rewards should be only to the meriting and I think the former are to be dealt out rigourously in willful cases As to his love he shews it but too much for your deservings as they have been of late let me tell you that and this is his misfortune and may in time perhaps be yours As to his parsimony which you wickedly call diabolical a very free word in your mouth let me tell ye little reason have you of all people for this on whom he proposes of his own accord to settle all he has in the world a proof let him love riches as he will that he loves you better But that you may be without excuse on this score we will tie him up to your own terms and oblige him by the marriage articles to allow you a very handsome quarterly sum to do what you please with And this has been told you before and I have said it to missus Howe that good and worthy lady before her proud daughter that you might hear of it again To contradict the charge of prepossession to Lovelace you offer never to have him without our consents and what is this saying but that you will hope on for our consents and to wheedle and tire us out Then he will always be in expectation while you are single and we are to live on at this rate are we vexed by you and continually watchful about you and as continually exposed to his insolence and threats Remember last Sunday Girl What might have happened had your brother and he met Moreover you cannot do with such a spirit as his as you can with worthy mister Solmes the one you make tremble the other will make you quake mind that and you will not be able to help yourself And remember that if there should be any misunderstanding between one of them and you we should all interpose and with effect no doubt but with the other it would be self do self have and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you Nor let the supposition of matrimonial differences frighten you honey moon lasts not now a days above a fortnight and Dunmow flitch as I have been informed was never claimed though some say once it was Marriage is a queer state Child whether paired by the parties or by their friends Out of three brothers of us you know there was but one had courage to marry And why was it do you think We were wise by other people s experience Don t despise money so much you may come to know the value of it that is a piece of instruction that you are to learn and which according to your own notions mister Solmes will be able to teach you I do indeed condemn your warmth I will not allow for disgraces you bring upon yourself If I thought them unmerited I would be your advocate But it was always my notion that children should not dispute their parents authority When your grandfather left his estate to you though his three sons and a grandson and your elder sister were in being we all acquiesced and why Because it was our father s doing Do you imitate that example if you will not those who set it you have the more reason to hold you inexcusable mind that Cousin You mention your brother too scornfully and in your letter to him are very disrespectful and so indeed you are to your sister in the letter you wrote to her Your brother Madam is your brother and third older than yourself and a man and pray be so good as not to forget what is due to a brother who next to us three brothers is the head of the family and on whom the name depends as upon your dutiful compliance laid down for the honour of the family you are come of And pray now let me ask you If the honour of that will not be an honour to you If you don t think so the more unworthy you You shall see the plan if you promise not to be prejudiced against it right or wrong If you are not besotted to that man I am sure you will like it If you are were mister Solmes an angel it would signify nothing for the devil is love and love is the devil when it gets into any of your heads Many examples have I seen of that If there were no such man as Lovelace in the world you would not have mister Solmes You would not Miss Very pretty truly We see how your spirit is embittered indeed Wonder not since it is come to your will not s that those who have authority over you say You shall have the other And I am one mind that And if it behoves YOU to speak out Miss it behoves US not to speak in What s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander take that in your thought too I humbly apprehend that mister Solmes has the spirit of a man and a gentleman I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it He pities you as much as he loves you He says he will convince you of his love by deeds since he is not permitted by you to express it by words And all his dependence is upon your generosity hereafter We hope he may depend upon that we encourage him to think he may And this heartens him up So that you may lay his constancy at your parents and your uncles doors and this will be another mark of your duty you know You must be sensible that you reflect upon your parents and all of us when you tell me you cannot in justice accept of the settlements proposed to you This reflection we should have wondered at from you once but now we don t There are many other very censurable passages in this free letter of yours but we must place them to the account of your embittered spirit I am glad you mentioned that word because we should have been at a loss what to have called it I should much rather nevertheless have had reason to give it a better name I love you dearly still Miss I think you though my niece one of the finest young gentlewomen I ever saw But upon my conscience I think you ought to obey your parents and oblige me and my brother John for you know very well that we have nothing but your good at heart consistently indeed with the good and honour of all of us What must we think of any one of it who would not promote the good of the whole and who would set one part of it against another Which God forbid say I You see I am for the good of all What shall I get by it let things go as they will Do I want any thing of any body for my own sake Does my brother John Well then Cousin Clary what would you be at as I may say O but you can t love mister Solmes But I say you know not what you can do You encourage yourself in your dislike You permit your heart little did I think it was such a froward one to recoil Take it to task Niece drive it on as fast as it recoils we do so in all our sea fights and land fights too by our sailors and soldiers or we should not conquer and we are all sure you will overcome it And why Because you ought So we think whatever you think and whose thoughts are to be preferred You may be wittier than we but if you were wiser we have lived some of us let me tell you to very little purpose thirty or forty years longer than you I have written as long a letter as yours I may not write in so lively or so polite a style as my Niece but I think I have all the argument on my side and you will vastly oblige me if you will shew me by your compliance with all our desires that you think so too If you do not you must not expect an advocate or even a friend in me dearly as I love you For then I shall be sorry to be called Your uncle ANT HARLOWE TUESDAY TWO IN THE MORNING POSTSCRIPT You must send me no more letters but a compliable one you may send But I need not have forbid you for I am sure this by fair argument is unanswerable I know it is I have written day and night I may say ever since Sunday morning only church time or the like of that but this is the last I can tell you from ANT H LETTER XXXIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY MARCH sixteen Having met with such bad success in my application to my relations I have taken a step that will surprise you It is no other than writing a letter to mister Solmes himself I sent it and have his answer He had certainly help in it For I have seen a letter of his and indifferently worded as poorly spelt Yet the superscription is of his dictating I dare say for he is a formal wretch With these I shall enclose one from my brother to me on occasion of mine to mister Solmes I did think that it was possible to discourage the man from proceeding and if I could have done that it would have answered all my wishes It was worth the trial But you ll see nothing will do My brother has taken his measures too securely TO ROGER SOLMES esquire WEDNESDAY MARCH fifteen SIR You will wonder to receive a letter from me and more still at the uncommon subject of it But the necessity of the case will justify me at least in my own apprehension and I shall therefore make no other apology for it When you first came acquainted with our family you found the writer of this one of the happiest creatures in the world beloved by the best and most indulgent of parents and rejoicing in the kind favour of two affectionate uncles and in the esteem of every one But how is this scene now changed You was pleased to cast a favourable eye upon me You addressed yourself to my friends your proposals were approved of by them approved of without consulting me as if my choice and happiness were of the least signification Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me insisted upon it without reserve I had not the felicity to think as they did almost the first time my sentiments differed from theirs I besought them to indulge me in a point so important to my future happiness but alas in vain And then for I thought it was but honest I told you my mind and even that my affections were engaged But to my mortification and surprise you persisted and still persist The consequence of all is too grievous for me to repeat you who have such free access to the rest of the family know it too well too well you know it either for the credit of your own generosity or for my reputation I am used on your account as I never before was used and never before was thought to deserve to be used and this was the hard the impossible condition of their returning favour that I must prefer a man to all others that of all others I cannot prefer Thus distressed and made unhappy and all to your sake and through your cruel perseverance I write Sir to demand of you the peace of mind you have robbed me of to demand of you the love of so many dear friends of which you have deprived me and if you have the generosity that should distinguish a man and a gentleman to adjure you not to continue an address that has been attended with such cruel effects to the creature you profess to esteem If you really value me as my friends would make me believe and as you have declared you do must it not be a mean and selfish value A value that can have no merit with the unhappy object of it because it is attended with effects so grievous to her It must be for your own sake only not for mine And even in this point you must be mistaken For would a prudent man wish to marry one who has not a heart to give Who cannot esteem him Who therefore must prove a bad wife And how cruel would it be to make a poor creature a bad wife whose pride it would be to make a good one If I am capable of judging our tempers and inclinations are vastly different Any other of my sex will make you happier than I can The treatment I meet with and the obstinacy as it is called with which I support myself under it ought to convince you of this were I not able to give so good a reason for this my supposed perverseness as that I cannot consent to marry a man whom I cannot value But if Sir you have not so much generosity in your value for me as to desist for my own sake let me conjure you by the regard due to yourself and to your own future happiness to discontinue your suit and place your affections on a worthier object for why should you make me miserable and yourself not happy By this means you will do all that is now in your power to restore to me the affection of my friends and if that can be it will leave me in as happy a state as you found me in You need only to say that you see there are no HOPES as you will perhaps complaisantly call it of succeeding with me and indeed Sir there cannot be a greater truth and that you will therefore no more think of me but turn your thoughts another way Your compliance with this request will lay me under the highest obligation to your generosity and make me ever Your well wisher and humble servant CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE These most humbly present DEAREST MISS Your letter has had a very contrary effect upon me to what you seem to have expected from it It has doubly convinced me of the excellency of your mind and of the honour of your disposition Call it selfish or what you please I must persist in my suit and happy shall I be if by patience and perseverance and a steady and unalterable devoir I may at last overcome the difficulty laid in my way As your good parents your uncles and other friends are absolutely determined you shall never have mister Lovelace if they can help it and as I presume no other person is in the way I will contentedly wait the issue of this matter And forgive me dearest Miss but a person should sooner persuade me to give up to him my estate as an instance of my generosity because he could not be happy without it than I would a much more valuable treasure to promote the felicity of another and make his way easier to circumvent myself Pardon me dear Miss but I must persevere though I am sorry you suffer on my account as you are pleased to think for I never before saw the woman I could love and while there is any hope and that you remain undisposed of to some happier man I must and will be Your faithful and obsequious admirer ROGER SOLMES MARCH sixteen mister JAMES HARLOWE TO MISS CL HARLOWE MARCH sixteen What a fine whim you took into your head to write a letter to mister Solmes to persuade him to give up his pretensions to you Of all the pretty romantic flights you have delighted in this was certainly one of the most extraordinary But to say nothing of what fires us all with indignation against you your owning your prepossession in a villain s favour and your impertinence to me and your sister and your uncles one of which has given it you home child how can you lay at mister Solmes s door the usage you so bitterly complain of You know little fool as you are that it is your fondness for Lovelace that has brought upon you all these things and which would have happened whether mister Solmes had honoured you with his addresses or not As you must needs know this to be true consider pretty witty Miss if your fond love sick heart can let you consider what a fine figure all your expostulations with us and charges upon mister Solmes make With what propriety do you demand of him to restore to you your former happiness as you call it and merely call it for if you thought our favour so you would restore it to yourself since it is yet in your own power to do so Therefore Miss Pert none of your pathetics except in the right place Depend upon it whether you have mister Solmes or not you shall never have your heart s delight the vile rake Lovelace if our parents if our uncles if I can hinder it No you fallen angel you shall not give your father and mother such a son nor me such a brother in giving yourself that profligate wretch for a husband And so set your heart at rest and lay aside all thoughts of him if ever you expect forgiveness reconciliation or a kind opinion from any of your family but especially from him who at present styles himself Your brother JAMES HARLOWE P S I know your knack at letter writing If you send me an answer for this I will return it unopened for I will not argue with your perverseness in so plain a case Only once for all I was willing to put you right as to mister Solmes whom I think to blame to trouble his head about you LETTER XXXIV mister LOVELACE TO JOHN BELFORD esquire FRIDAY MARCH seventeen I receive with great pleasure the early and cheerful assurances of your loyalty and love And let our principal and most trusty friends named in my last know that I do I would have thee Jack come down as soon as thou canst I believe I shall not want the others so soon Yet they may come down to Lord M s I will be there if not to receive them to satisfy my lord that there is no new mischief in hand which will require his second intervention For thyself thou must be constantly with me not for my security the family dare do nothing but bully they bark only at a distance but for my entertainment that thou mayest from the Latin and the English classics keep my lovesick soul from drooping Thou hadst best come to me here in thy old corporal s coat thy servant out of livery and to be upon a familiar footing with me as a distant relation to be provided for by thy interest above I mean not in Heaven thou mayest be sure Thou wilt find me at a little alehouse they call it an inn the White Hart most terribly wounded but by the weather only the sign in a sorry village within five miles from Harlowe place Every body knows Harlowe place for like Versailles it is sprung up from a dunghill within every elderly person s remembrance Every poor body particularly knows it but that only for a few years past since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and daughters of men The people here at the Hart are poor but honest and have gotten it into their heads that I am a man of quality in disguise and there is no reining in their officious respect Here is a pretty little smirking daughter seventeen six days ago I call her my Rose bud Her grandmother for there is no mother a good neat old woman as ever filled a wicker chair in a chimney corner has besought me to be merciful to her This is the right way with me Many and many a pretty rogue had I spared whom I did not spare had my power been acknowledged and my mercy in time implored But the debellare superbos should be my motto were I to have a new one This simple chit for there is a simplicity in her thou wouldst be highly pleased with all humble all officious all innocent I love her for her humility her officiousness and even for her innocence will be pretty amusement to thee while I combat with the weather and dodge and creep about the walls and purlieus of Harlowe place Thou wilt see in her mind all that her superiors have been taught to conceal in order to render themselves less natural and of consequence less pleasing But I charge thee that thou do not what I would not permit myself to do for the world I charge thee that thou do not crop my Rose bud She is the only flower of fragrance that has blown in this vicinage for ten years past or will for ten years to come for I have looked backward to the have been s and forward to the will be s having but too much leisure upon my hands in my present waiting I never was so honest for so long together since my matriculation It behoves me so to be some way or other my recess at this little inn may be found out and it will then be thought that my Rose bud has attracted me A report in my favour from simplicities so amiable may establish me for the grandmother s relation to my Rose bud may be sworn to and the father is an honest poor man has no joy but in his Rose bud O Jack spare thou therefore for I shall leave thee often alone with her spare thou my Rose bud Let the rule I never departed from but it cost me a long regret be observed to my Rose bud never to ruin a poor girl whose simplicity and innocence were all she had to trust to and whose fortunes were too low to save her from the rude contempts of worse minds than her own and from an indigence extreme such a one will only pine in secret and at last perhaps in order to refuge herself from slanderous tongues and virulence be induced to tempt some guilty stream or seek her end in the knee encircling garter that peradventure was the first attempt of abandoned love No defiances will my Rose bud breathe no self dependent thee doubting watchfulness indirectly challenging thy inventive machinations to do their worst will she assume Unsuspicious of her danger the lamb s throat will hardly shun thy knife O be not thou the butcher of my lambkin The less thou be so for the reason I am going to give thee The gentle heart is touched by love her soft bosom heaves with a passion she has not yet found a name for I once caught her eye following a young carpenter a widow neighbour s son living to speak in her dialect at the little white house over the way A gentle youth he also seems to be about three years older than herself playmates from infancy till his eighteenth and her fifteenth year furnished a reason for a greater distance in shew while their hearts gave a better for their being nearer than ever for I soon perceived the love reciprocal A scrape and a bow at first seeing his pretty mistress turning often to salute her following eye and when a winding lane was to deprive him of her sight his whole body turned round his hat more reverently doffed than before This answered for unseen I was behind her by a low courtesy and a sigh that Johnny was too far off to hear Happy whelp said I to myself I withdrew and in tript my Rose bud as if satisfied with the dumb shew and wishing nothing beyond it I have examined the little heart She has made me her confidant She owns she could love Johnny Barton very well and Johnny Barton has told her he could love her better than any maiden he ever saw but alas it must not be thought of Why not be thought of She don t know And then she sighed But Johnny has an aunt who will give him an hundred pounds when his time is out and her father cannot give her but a few things or so to set her out with and though Johnny s mother says she knows not where Johnny would have a prettier or notabler wife yet And then she sighed again What signifies talking I would not have Johnny be unhappy and poor for me For what good would that do me you know Sir What would I give by my soul my angel will indeed reform me if her friends implacable folly ruin us not both What would I give to have so innocent and so good a heart as either my Rose bud s or Johnny s I have a confounded mischievous one by nature too I think A good motion now and then rises from it but it dies away presently a love of intrigue an invention for mischief a triumph in subduing fortune encouraging and supporting and a constitution What signifies palliating But I believe I had been a rogue had I been a plough boy But the devil s in this sex Eternal misguiders Who that has once trespassed with them ever recovered his virtue And yet where there is not virtue which nevertheless we freelivers are continually plotting to destroy what is there even in the ultimate of our wishes with them Preparation and expectation are in a manner every thing reflection indeed may be something if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a past trespass but the fruition what is there in that And yet that being the end nature will not be satisfied without it See what grave reflections an innocent subject will produce It gives me some pleasure to think that it is not out of my power to reform but then Jack I am afraid I must keep better company than I do at present for we certainly harden one another But be not cast down my boy there will be time enough to give the whole fraternity warning to choose another leader and I fancy thou wilt be the man Mean time as I make it my rule whenever I have committed a very capital enormity to do some good by way of atonement and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score I intend before I leave these parts successfully shall I leave them I hope or I shall be tempted to double the mischief by way of revenge though not to my Rose bud any to join an hundred pounds to Johnny s aunt s hundred pounds to make one innocent couple happy I repeat therefore and for half a dozen more therefores spare thou my Rose bud An interruption another letter anon and both shall go together LETTER XXXV mister LOVELACE TO JOHN BELFORD esquire I have found out by my watchful spy almost as many of my charmer s motions as those of the rest of her relations It delights me to think how the rascal is caressed by the uncles and nephew and let into their secrets yet it proceeds all the time by my line of direction I have charged him however on forfeiture of his present weekly stipend and my future favour to take care that neither my beloved nor any of the family suspect him I have told him that he may indeed watch her egresses and regresses but that only keep off other servants from her paths yet not to be seen by her himself The dear creature has tempted him he told them with a bribe which she never offered to convey a letter which she never wrote to Miss Howe he believes with one enclosed perhaps to me but he declined it and he begged they would take notice of it to her This brought him a stingy shilling great applause and an injunction followed it to all the servants for the strictest look out lest she should contrive some way to send it and above an hour after an order was given him to throw himself in her way and expressing his concern for denying her request to tender his service to her and to bring them her letter which it will be proper for him to report that she has refused to give him Now seest thou not how many good ends this contrivance answers In the first place the lady is secured by it against her own knowledge in the liberty allowed her of taking her private walks in the garden for this attempt has confirmed them in their belief that now they have turned off her maid she has no way to send a letter out of the house if she had she would not have run the risque of tempting a fellow who had not been in her secret so that she can prosecute unsuspectedly her correspondence with me and Miss Howe In the next place it will perhaps afford me an opportunity of a private interview with her which I am meditating let her take it as she will having found out by my spy who can keep off every body else that she goes every morning and evening to a wood house remote from the dwelling house under pretence of visiting and feeding a set of bantam poultry which were produced from a breed that was her grandfather s and of which for that reason she is very fond as also of some other curious fowls brought from the same place I have an account of all her motions here And as she has owned to me in one of her letters that she corresponds privately with Miss Howe I presume it is by this way The interview I am meditating will produce her consent I hope to other favours of the like kind for should she not choose the place in which I am expecting to see her I can attend her any where in the rambling Dutch taste garden whenever she will permit me that honour for my implement high Joseph Leman has procured me the opportunity of getting two keys made to the garden door one of which I have given him for reasons good which door opens to the haunted coppice as tradition has made the servants think it a man having been found hanging in it about twenty years ago and Joseph upon proper notice will leave it unbolted But I was obliged previously to give him my honour that no mischief should happen to any of my adversaries from this liberty for the fellow tells me that he loves all his masters and only that he knows I am a man of honour and that my alliance will do credit to the family and after prejudices are overcome every body will think so or he would not for the world act the part he does There never was a rogue who had not a salvo to himself for being so What a praise to honesty that every man pretends to it even at the instant that he knows he is pursuing the methods that will perhaps prove him a knave to the whole world as well as to his own conscience But what this stupid family can mean to make all this necessary I cannot imagine My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermost by turns If the latter succeed not the gratifying of the former will be my only consolation and by all that s good they shall feel it although for it I become an exile from my native country for ever I will throw myself into my charmer s presence I have twice already attempted it in vain I shall then see what I may depend upon from her favour If I thought I had no prospect of that I should be tempted to carry her off That would be a rape worthy of Jupiter But all gentle shall be my movements all respectful even to reverence my address to her her hand shall be the only witness to the pressure of my lip my trembling lip I know it will tremble if I do not bid it tremble As soft my sighs as the sighs of my gentle Rose bud By my humility will I invite her confidence the loneliness of the place shall give me no advantage to dissipate her fears and engage her reliance upon my honour for the future shall be my whole endeavour but little will I complain of not at all will I threaten those who are continually threatening me but yet with a view to act the part of Dryden s lion to secure my love or to let loose my vengeance upon my hunters What tho his mighty soul his grief contains He meditates revenge who least complains And like a lion slumb ring in his way Or sleep dissembling while he waits his prey His fearless foes within his distance draws Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws Till at the last his time for fury found He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground The prostrate vulgar passes o er and spares But with a lordly rage his hunter tears LETTER XXXVI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY MARCH eighteen I have been frighted out of my wits still am in a manner out of breath thus occasioned I went down under the usual pretence in hopes to find something from you Concerned at my disappointment I was returning from the wood house when I heard a rustling as of somebody behind a stack of wood I was extremely surprised but still more to behold a man coming from behind the furthermost stack Oh thought I at that moment the sin of a prohibited correspondence In the same point of time that I saw him he besought me not to be frighted and still nearer approaching me threw open a horseman s coat And who should it be but mister Lovelace I could not scream out yet attempted to scream the moment I saw a man and again when I saw who it was for I had no voice and had I not caught hold of a prop which supported the old roof I should have sunk I had hitherto as you know kept him at a distance And now as I recovered myself judge of my first emotions when I recollected his character from every mouth of my family his enterprising temper and found myself alone with him in a place so near a bye lane and so remote from the house But his respectful behaviour soon dissipated these fears and gave me others lest we should be seen together and information of it given to my brother the consequences of which I could readily think would be if not further mischief an imputed assignation a stricter confinement a forfeited correspondence with you my beloved friend and a pretence for the most violent compulsion and neither the one set of reflections nor the other acquitted him to me for his bold intrusion As soon therefore as I could speak I expressed with the greatest warmth my displeasure and told him that he cared not how much he exposed me to the resentment of all my friends provided he could gratify his own impetuous humour I then commanded him to leave the place that moment and was hurrying from him when he threw himself in the way at my feet beseeching my stay for one moment declaring that he suffered himself to be guilty of this rashness as I thought it to avoid one much greater for in short he could not bear the hourly insults he received from my family with the thoughts of having so little interest in my favour that he could not promise himself that his patience and forbearance would be attended with any other issue than to lose me for ever and be triumphed over and insulted upon it This man you know has very ready knees You have said that he ought in small points frequently to offend on purpose to shew what an address he is master of He ran on expressing his apprehensions that a temper so gentle and obliging as he said mine was to every body but him and a dutifulness so exemplary inclined me to do my part to others whether they did theirs or not by me would be wrought upon in favour of a man set up in part to be revenged upon myself for my grandfather s envied distinction of me and in part to be revenged upon him for having given life to one who would have taken his and now sought to deprive him of hopes dearer to him than life I told him he might be assured that the severity and ill usage I met with would be far from effecting the proposed end that although I could with great sincerity declare for a single life which had always been my choice and particularly that if ever I married if they would not insist upon the man I had an aversion to it should not be with the man they disliked He interrupted me here He hoped I would forgive him for it but he could not help expressing his great concern that after so many instances of his passionate and obsequious devotion And pray Sir said I let me interrupt you in my turn Why don t you assert in still plainer words the obligation you have laid me under by this your boasted devotion Why don t you let me know in terms as high as your implication that a perseverance I have not wished for which has set all my relations at variance with me is a merit that throws upon me the guilt of ingratitude for not having answered it as you seem to expect I must forgive him he said if he who pretended only to a comparative merit and otherwise thought no man living could deserve me had presumed to hope for a greater share in my favour than he had hitherto met with when such men as mister Symmes mister Wyerley and now lastly so vile a reptile as this Solmes however discouraged by myself were made his competitors As to the perseverance I mentioned it was impossible for him not to persevere but I must needs know that were he not in being the terms Solmes had proposed were such as would have involved me in the same difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under He therefore took the liberty to say that my favour to him far from increasing those difficulties would be the readiest way to extricate me from them They had made it impossible he told me with too much truth to oblige them any way but by sacrificing myself to Solmes They were well apprized besides of the difference between the two one whom they hoped to manage as they pleased the other who could and would protect me from every insult and who had natural prospects much superior to my brother s foolish views of a title How comes this man to know so well all our foibles But I more wonder how he came to have a notion of meeting me in this place I was very uneasy to be gone and the more as the night came on apace But there was no getting from him till I had heard a great deal more of what he had to say As he hoped that I would one day make him the happiest man in the world he assured me that he had so much regard for my fame that he would be as far from advising any step that was likely to cast a shade upon my reputation although that step was to be ever so much in his own favour as I would be to follow such advice But since I was not to be permitted to live single he would submit it to my consideration whether I had any way but one to avoid the intended violence to my inclinations my father so jealous of his authority both my uncles in my father s way of thinking my cousin Morden at a distance my uncle and aunt Hervey awed into insignificance was his word my brother and sister inflaming every one Solmes s offers captivating Miss Howe s mother rather of a party with them for motives respecting example to her own daughter And then he asked me if I would receive a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance on this occasion for Lady Sarah Sadleir he said having lately lost her only child hardly looked into the world or thought of it farther than to wish him married and preferably to all the women in the world with me To be sure my dear there is a great deal in what the man said I may be allowed to say this without an imputed glow or throb But I told him nevertheless that although I had great honour for the ladies he was related to yet I should not choose to receive a letter on a subject that had a tendency to promote an end I was far from intending to promote that it became me ill as I was treated at present to hope every thing to bear every thing and to try ever thing when my father saw my steadfastness and that I would die rather than have mister Solmes he would perhaps recede Interrupting me he represented the unlikelihood there was of that from the courses they had entered upon which he thus enumerated Their engaging missus Howe against me in the first place as a person I might have thought to fly to if pushed to desperation my brother continually buzzing in my father s ears that my cousin Morden would soon arrive and then would insist upon giving me possession of my grandfather s estate in pursuance of the will which would render me independent of my father their disgraceful confinement of me their dismissing so suddenly my servant and setting my sister s over me their engaging my mother contrary to her own judgment against me these he said were all so many flagrant proofs that they would stick at nothing to carry their point and were what made him inexpressibly uneasy He appealed to me whether ever I knew my father recede from any resolution he had once fixed especially if he thought either his prerogative or his authority concerned in the question His acquaintance with our family he said enabled him to give several instances but they would be too grating to me of an arbitrariness that had few examples even in the families of princes an arbitrariness which the most excellent of women my mother too severely experienced He was proceeding as I thought with reflections of this sort and I angrily told him I would not permit my father to be reflected upon adding that his severity to me however unmerited was not a warrant for me to dispense with my duty to him He had no pleasure he said in urging any thing that could be so construed for however well warranted he was to make such reflections from the provocations they were continually giving him he knew how offensive to me any liberties of this sort would be And yet he must own that it was painful to him who had youth and passions to be allowed for as well as others and who had always valued himself under speaking his mind to curb himself under such treatment Nevertheless his consideration for me would make him confine himself in his observations to facts that were too flagrant and too openly avowed to be disputed It could not therefore justly displease he would venture to say if he made this natural inference from the premises That if such were my father s behaviour to a wife who disputed not the imaginary prerogatives he was so unprecedently fond of asserting what room had a daughter to hope that he would depart from an authority he was so earnest and so much more concerned to maintain Family interests at the same time engaging an aversion however causelessly conceived stimulating my brother s and sister s resentments and selfish views cooperating and my banishment from their presence depriving me of all personal plea or entreaty in my own favour How unhappy my dear that there is but too much reason for these observations and for this inference made likewise with more coolness and respect to my family than one would have apprehended from a man so much provoked and of passions so high and generally thought uncontroulable Will you not question me about throbs and glows if from such instances of a command over his fiery temper for my sake I am ready to infer that were my friends capable of a reconciliation with him he might be affected by arguments apparently calculated for his present and future good Nor is it a very bad indication that he has such moderate notions of that very high prerogative in husbands of which we in our family have been accustomed to hear so much He represented to me that my present disgraceful confinement was known to all the world that neither my sister nor my brother scrupled to represent me as an obliged and favoured child in a state of actual rebellion That nevertheless every body who knew me was ready to justify me for an aversion to a man whom every body thought utterly unworthy of me and more fit for my sister that unhappy as he was in not having been able to make any greater impression upon me in his favour all the world gave me to him Nor was there but one objection made to him by his very enemies his birth his prospects all very unexceptionable and the latter splendid and that objection he thanked God and my example was in a fair way of being removed for ever since he had seen his error and was heartily sick of the courses he had followed which however were far less enormous than malice and envy had represented them to be But of this he should say the less as it were much better to justify himself by his actions than by the most solemn asseverations and promises And then complimenting my person he assured me for that he always loved virtue although he had not followed its rules as he ought that he was still more captivated with the graces of my mind and would frankly own that till he had the honour to know me he had never met with an inducement sufficient to enable him to overcome an unhappy kind of prejudice to matrimony which had made him before impenetrable to the wishes and recommendations of all his relations You see my dear he scruples not to speak of himself as his enemies speak of him I can t say but his openness in these particulars gives a credit to his other professions I should easily I think detect an hypocrite and this man particularly who is said to have allowed himself in great liberties were he to pretend to instantaneous lights and convictions at this time of life too Habits I am sensible are not so easily changed You have always joined with me in remarking that he will speak his mind with freedom even to a degree of unpoliteness sometimes and that his very treatment of my family is a proof that he cannot make a mean court to any body for interest sake What pity where there are such laudable traces that they should have been so mired and choaked up as I may say We have heard that the man s head is better than his heart But do you really think mister Lovelace can have a very bad heart Why should not there be something in blood in the human creature as well as in the ignobler animals None of his family are exceptionable but himself indeed The characters of the ladies are admirable But I shall incur the imputation I wish to avoid Yet what a look of censoriousness does it carry in an unsparing friend to take one to task for doing that justice and making those which one ought without scruple to do and to make in the behalf of any other man living He then again pressed me to receive a letter of offered protection from Lady Betty He said that people of birth stood a little too much upon punctilio as people of value also did but indeed birth worthily lived up to was virtue virtue birth the inducements to a decent punctilio the same the origin of both one how came this notion from him else Lady Betty would write to me but she would be willing to be first apprized that her offer will be well received as it would have the appearance of being made against the liking of one part of my family and which nothing would induce her to make but the degree of unworthy persecution which I actually laboured under and had reason further to apprehend I told him that however greatly I thought myself obliged to Lady Betty Lawrance if this offer came from herself yet it was easy to see to what it led It might look like vanity in me perhaps to say that this urgency in him on this occasion wore the face of art in order to engage me into measures from which I might not easily extricate myself I said that I should not be affected by the splendour of even a royal title Goodness I thought was greatness That the excellent characters of the ladies of his family weighed more with me than the consideration that they were half sisters to Lord M and daughters of an earl that he would not have found encouragement from me had my friends been consenting to his address if he had only a mere relative merit to those ladies since in that case the very reasons that made me admire them would have been so many objections to their kinsman I then assured him that it was with infinite concern that I had found myself drawn into an epistolary correspondence with him especially since that correspondence had been prohibited and the only agreeable use I could think of making of this unexpected and undesired interview was to let him know that I should from henceforth think myself obliged to discontinue it And I hoped that he would not have the thought of engaging me to carry it on by menacing my relations There was light enough to distinguish that he looked very grave upon this He so much valued my free choice he said and my unbiassed favour scorning to set himself upon a footing with Solmes in the compulsory methods used in that man s behalf that he should hate himself were he capable of a view of intimidating me by so very poor a method But nevertheless there were two things to be considered First that the continual outrages he was treated with the spies set over him one of which he had detected the indignities all his family were likewise treated with as also myself avowedly in malice to him or he should not presume to take upon himself to resent for me without my leave the artful wretch saw he would have lain open here had he not thus guarded all these considerations called upon him to shew a proper resentment and he would leave it to me to judge whether it would be reasonable for him as a man of spirit to bear such insults if it were not for my sake I would be pleased to consider in the next place whether the situation I was in a prisoner in my father s house and my whole family determined to compel me to marry a man unworthy of me and that speedily and whether I consented or not admitted of delay in the preventive measures he was desirous to put me upon in the last resort only Nor was there a necessity he said if I were actually in Lady Betty s protection that I should be his if afterwards I should see any thing objectionable in his conduct But what would the world conclude would be the end I demanded were I in the last resort as he proposed to throw myself into the protection of his friends but that it was with such a view And what less did the world think of me now he asked than that I was confined that I might not You are to consider Madam you have not now an option and to whom is it owing that you have not and that you are in the power of those parents why should I call them who are determined that you shall not have an option All I propose is that you will embrace such a protection but not till you have tried every way to avoid the necessity for it And give me leave to say proceeded he that if a correspondence on which I have founded all my hopes is at this critical conjuncture to be broken off and if you are resolved not to be provided against the worst it must be plain to me that you will at last yield to that worst worst to me only it cannot be to you and then and he put his hand clenched to his forehead How shall I bear this supposition Then will you be that Solmes s But by all that s sacred neither he nor your brother nor your uncles shall enjoy their triumph Perdition seize my soul if they shall The man s vehemence frightened me yet in resentment I would have left him but throwing himself at my feet again Leave me not thus I beseech you dearest Madam leave me not thus in despair I kneel not repenting of what I have vowed in such a case as that I have supposed I re vow it at your feet and so he did But think not it is by way of menace or to intimidate you to favour me If your heart inclines you and then he arose to obey your father your brother rather and to have Solmes although I shall avenge myself on those who have insulted me for their insults to myself and family yet will I tear out my heart from this bosom if possible with my own hands were it to scruple to give up its ardours to a woman capable of such a preference I told him that he talked to me in very high language but he might assure himself that I never would have mister Solmes yet that this I said not in favour to him and I had declared as much to my relations were there not such a man as himself in the world Would I declare that I would still honour him with my correspondence He could not bear that hoping to obtain greater instances of my favour he should forfeit the only one he had to boast of I bid him forbear rashness or resentment to any of my family and I would for some time at least till I saw what issue my present trials were likely to have proceed with a correspondence which nevertheless my heart condemned And his spirit him the impatient creature said interrupting me for bearing what he did when he considered that the necessity of it was imposed upon him not by my will for then he would bear it cheerfully and a thousand times more but by creatures And there he stopt I told him plainly that he might thank himself whose indifferent character as to morals had given such a handle against him for all It was but just that a man should be spoken evil of who set no value upon his reputation He offered to vindicate himself But I told him I would judge him by his own rule by his actions not by his professions Were not his enemies he said so powerful and so determined and had they not already shewn their intentions in such high acts of even cruel compulsion but would leave me to my choice or to my desire of living single he would have been content to undergo a twelvemonth s probation or more but he was confident that one month would either complete all their purposes or render them abortive and I best knew what hopes I had of my father s receding he did not know him if I had any I said I would try every method that either my duty or my influence upon any of them should suggest before I would put myself into any other protection and if nothing else would do would resign the envied estate and that I dared to say would He was contented he said to abide that issue He should be far from wishing me to embrace any other protection but as he had frequently said in the last necessity But dearest creature said he catching my hand with ardour and pressing it to his lips if the yielding up of that estate will do resign it and be mine and I will corroborate with all my soul your resignation This was not ungenerously said But what will not these men say to obtain belief and a power over one I made many efforts to go and now it was so dark that I began to have great apprehensions I cannot say from his behaviour indeed he has a good deal raised himself in my opinion by the personal respect even to reverence which he paid me during the whole conference for although he flamed out once upon a supposition that Solmes might succeed it was upon a supposition that would excuse passion if any thing could you know in a man pretending to love with fervour although it was so levelled that I could not avoid resenting it He recommended himself to my favour at parting with great earnestness yet with as great submission not offering to condition any thing with me although he hinted his wishes for another meeting which I forbad him ever attempting again in the same place And I will own to you from whom I should be really blamable to conceal any thing that his arguments drawn from the disgraceful treatment I meet with of what I am to expect make me begin to apprehend that I shall be under an obligation to be either the one man s or the other s and if so I fancy I shall not incur your blame were I to say which of the two it must be you have said which it must not be But O my dear the single life is by far the most eligible to me indeed it is And I hope yet to be permitted to make that option I got back without observation but the apprehension that I should not gave me great uneasiness and made me begin a letter in a greater flutter than he gave me cause to be in except at the first seeing him for then indeed my spirits failed me and it was a particular felicity that in such a place in such a fright and alone with him I fainted not away I should add that having reproached him with his behaviour the last Sunday at church he solemnly assured me that it was not what had been represented to me that he did not expect to see me there but hoped to have an opportunity to address himself to my father and to be permitted to attend him home But that the good doctor Lewen had persuaded him not to attempt speaking to any of the family at that time observing to him the emotions into which his presence had put every body He intended no pride or haughtiness of behaviour he assured me and that the attributing such to him was the effect of that ill will which he had the mortification to find insuperable adding that when he bowed to my mother it was a compliment he intended generally to every one in the pew as well as to her whom he sincerely venerated If he may be believed and I should think he would not have come purposely to defy my family yet expect favour from me one may see my dear the force of hatred which misrepresents all things Yet why should Shorey except officiously to please her principals make a report in his disfavour He told me that he would appeal to doctor Lewen for his justification on this head adding that the whole conversation between the Doctor and him turned upon his desire to attempt to reconcile himself to us all in the face of the church and upon the Doctor s endeavouring to dissuade him from making such a public overture till he knew how it would be accepted But to what purpose his appeal when I am debarred from seeing that good man or any one who would advise me what to do in my present difficult situation I fancy my dear however that there would hardly be a guilty person in the world were each suspected or accused person to tell his or her own story and be allowed any degree of credit I have written a very long letter To be so particular as you require in subjects of conversation it is impossible to be short I will add to it only the assurance That I am and ever will be Your affectionate and faithful friend and servant CLARISSA HARLOWE You ll be so good my dear as to remember that the date of your last letter to me was the ninth LETTER XXXVII

2526-156098-0002	train-other-500	being verily persuaded that one side or the other would have yielded by this time and then I should have had some degree of certainty to found my observations upon And indeed what can I write
none	none	 that I have not already written You know that I can do nothing 
2526-156098-0003	train-other-500	but rave at your stupid persecutors and that you don t like

none	none	 let who will say to the contrary I think you must be either the one man s or the other s 
2526-156098-0005	train-other-500	Let us see what their next step will be As to Lovelace while he tells his own story
none	none	 having also behaved so handsomely on his intrusion in the wood house and intended so well at church who can say that the man is in the least blameworthy 
2526-156098-0006	train-other-500	Wicked people to combine against so innocent a man But as I said let us see what their next step will be and what course you will take upon it and then we may be the more enlightened
2526-156098-0007	train-other-500	As to your change of style to your uncles and brother and sister since they were so fond of attributing to you a regard for Lovelace and would not be persuaded to the contrary and since you only strengthened their arguments against yourself by denying it
none	none	 you did but just as I would have done in giving way to their suspicions and trying what that would do But if but if Pray my dear indulge me a little you yourself think it was necessary 
2526-156098-0008	train-other-500	to apologize to me for that change of style to them and till you will speak out like a friend to her unquestionable friend I must tease you a little let it run therefore for it will run If then

2526-156098-0013	train-other-500	let me advise you to mind how it comes on For I am persuaded
none	none	 as surely as that I am now writing to you 
2526-156098-0014	train-other-500	that the indiscreet violence of your friends on the one hand and the insinuating address of Lovelace on the other if the man be not a greater fool than any body thinks him will effectually bring it to this and do all his work for him
2526-156098-0015	train-other-500	But let it if it must be Lovelace or Solmes the choice cannot admit of debate
none	none	 Yet if all be true

2526-156098-0022	train-other-500	if when you write to me you endeavour to keep from me any secret of your heart Let me add that if you would clearly and explicitly tell me how far Lovelace has or has not a hold in your affections

none	none	 who are so famed for prescience as I may call it and than whom no young lady ever had stronger pretensions to a share of it have had no doubt reasonings in your heart about him supposing you were to be one day his no doubt but you have had the same in Solmes s case whence the ground for the hatred of the one and for the conditional liking of the other Will you tell me my dear what you have thought of Lovelace s best and of his worst How far eligible for the first how far rejectable for the last Then weighing both parts in opposite scales we shall see which is likely to preponderate or rather which does preponderate Nothing less than the knowledge of the inmost recesses of your heart

2526-156098-0025	train-other-500	it has not been upon those passages which are written though perhaps not intended with such explicitness don t be alarmed my dear as leaves little cause of doubt but only when you affect reserve when you give new words

none	none	 ANNA HOWE LETTER XXXVIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MARCH twenty Your last so sensibly affects me that I must postpone every other consideration however weighty to reply to it and this I will do very distinctly and with all the openness of heart which our mutual friendship demands But let me observe in the first place gratefully observe that if I have in fifty passages of my letters given you such undoubted proofs of my value for mister Lovelace that you have spared me for the sake of my explicitness it is acting by me with a generosity worthy of yourself But lives the man think you who is so very bad that he does not give even a doubting mind reason at one time to be better pleased with him than at another And when that reason offers is it not just to express one s self accordingly I would do the man who addresses me as much justice as if he did not address me it has such a look of tyranny it appears so ungenerous methinks in our sex to use a man worse for his respect to us no other cause for disrespect occurring that I would not by any means be that person who should do so But although I may intend no more than justice it will perhaps be difficult to hinder those who know the man s views from construing it as a partial favour and especially if the eager eyed observer has been formerly touched herself and would triumph that her friend had been no more able to escape than she Noble minds emulative of perfection and yet the passion properly directed I do not take to be an imperfection neither may be allowed a little generous envy I think If I meant by this a reflection by way of revenge it is but a revenge my dear in the soft sense of the word I love as I have told you your pleasantry Although at the time your reproof may pain me a little yet on recollection when I find it more of the cautioning friend than of the satirizing observer I shall be all gratitude upon it All the business will be this I shall be sensible of the pain in the present letter perhaps but I shall thank you in the next and ever after In this way I hope my dear you will account for a little of that sensibility which you find above and perhaps still more as I proceed You frequently remind me by an excellent example your own to me that I must not spare you I am not conscious that I have written any thing of this man that has not been more in his dispraise than in his favour Such is the man that I think I must have been faulty and ought to take myself to account if I had not But you think otherwise I will not put you upon labouring the proof as you call it My conduct must then have a faulty appearance at least and I will endeavour to rectify it But of this I assure you that whatever interpretation my words were capable of I intended not any reserve to you I wrote my heart at the time if I had had thought of disguising it or been conscious that there was reason for doing so perhaps I had not given you the opportunity of remarking upon my curiosity after his relations esteem for me nor upon my conditional liking and such like All I intended by the first I believe I honestly told you at the time To that letter I therefore refer whether it make for me or against me and by the other that I might bear in mind what it became a person of my sex and character to be and to do in such an unhappy situation where the imputed love is thought an undutiful and therefore a criminal passion and where the supported object of it is a man of faulty morals too And I am sure you will excuse my desire of appearing at those times the person I ought to be had I no other view in it but to merit the continuance of your good opinion But that I may acquit myself of having reserves O my dear I must here break off LETTER XXXIX MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MARCH twelve This letter will account to you my dear for my abrupt breaking off in the answer I was writing to yours of yesterday and which possibly I shall not be able to finish and send you till to morrow or next day having a great deal to say to the subjects you put to me in it What I am now to give you are the particulars of another effort made by my friends through the good missus Norton It seems they had sent to her yesterday to be here this day to take their instructions and to try what she could do with me It would at least I suppose they thought have this effect to render me inexcusable with her or to let her see that there was no room for the expostulations she had often wanted to make in my favour to my mother The declaration that my heart was free afforded them an argument to prove obstinacy and perverseness upon me since it could be nothing else that governed me in my opposition to their wills if I had no particular esteem for another man And now that I have given them reason in order to obviate this argument to suppose that I have a preference to another they are resolved to carry their schemes into execution as soon as possible And in order to do this they sent for this good woman for whom they know I have even a filial regard She found assembled my father and mother my brother and sister my two uncles and my aunt Hervey My brother acquainted her with all that had passed since she was last permitted to see me with the contents of my letters avowing my regard for mister Lovelace as they all interpreted them with the substance of their answers to them and with their resolutions My mother spoke next and delivered herself to this effect as the good woman told me After reciting how many times I had been indulged in my refusals of different men and the pains she had taken with me to induce me to oblige my whole family in one instance out of five or six and my obstinacy upon it O my good missus Norton said the dear lady could you have thought that my Clarissa and your Clarissa was capable of so determined an opposition to the will of parents so indulgent to her But see what you can do with her The matter is gone too far to be receded from on our parts Her father had concluded every thing with mister Solmes not doubting her compliance Such noble settlements missus Norton and such advantages to the whole family In short she has it in her power to lay an obligation upon us all mister Solmes knowing she has good principles and hoping by his patience now and good treatment hereafter to engage her gratitude and by degrees her love is willing to overlook all Overlook all my dear mister Solmes to overlook all There s a word So missus Norton if you are convinced that it is a child s duty to submit to her parents authority in the most important point as well as in the least I beg you will try your influence over her I have none her father has none her uncles neither although it is her apparent interest to oblige us all for on that condition her grandfather s estate is not half of what living and dying is purposed to be done for her If any body can prevail with her it is you and I hope you will heartily enter upon this task The good woman asked Whether she was permitted to expostulate with them upon the occasion before she came up to me My arrogant brother told her she was sent for to expostulate with his sister and not with them And this Goody Norton she is always Goody with him you may tell her that the treaty with mister Solmes is concluded that nothing but her compliance with her duty is wanting of consequence that there is no room for your expostulation or hers either Be assured of this missus Norton said my father in an angry tone that we will not be baffled by her We will not appear like fools in this matter and as if we have no authority over our own daughter We will not in short be bullied out of our child by a cursed rake who had like to have killed our only son And so she had better make a merit of her obedience for comply she shall if I live independent as she thinks my father s indiscreet bounty has made her of me her father Indeed since that she has never been like she was before An unjust bequest And it is likely to prosper accordingly But if she marry that vile rake Lovelace I will litigate every shilling with her tell her so and that the will may be set aside and shall My uncles joined with equal heat My brother was violent in his declarations My sister put in with vehemence on the same side My aunt Hervey was pleased to say there was no article so proper for parents to govern in as this of marriage and it was very fit mine should be obliged Thus instructed the good woman came up to me She told me all that had passed and was very earnest with me to comply and so much justice did she to the task imposed upon her that I more than once thought that her own opinion went with theirs But when she saw what an immovable aversion I had to the man she lamented with me their determined resolution and then examined into the sincerity of my declaration that I would gladly compound with them by living single Of this being satisfied she was so convinced that this offer which carried into execution would exclude Lovelace effectually ought to be accepted that she would go down although I told her it was what I had tendered over and over to no purpose and undertake to be guaranty for me on that score She went accordingly but soon returned in tears being used harshly for urging this alternative They had a right to my obedience upon their own terms they said my proposal was an artifice only to gain time nothing but marrying mister Solmes should do they had told me so before they should not be at rest till it was done for they knew what an interest Lovelace had in my heart I had as good as owned it in my letters to my uncles and brother and sister although I had most disingenuously declared otherwise to my mother I depended they said upon their indulgence and my own power over them they would not have banished me from their presence if they had not known that their consideration for me was greater than mine for them And they would be obeyed or I never should be restored to their favour let the consequence be what it would My brother thought fit to tell the good woman that her whining nonsense did but harden me There was a perverseness he said in female minds a tragedy pride that would make a romantic young creature such a one as me risque any thing to obtain pity I was of an age and a turn the insolent said to be fond of a lover like distress and my grief which she pleaded would never break my heart I should sooner break that of the best and most indulgent of mothers He added that she might once more go up to me but that if she prevailed not he should suspect that the man they all hated had found a way to attach her to his interest Every body blamed him for this unworthy reflection which greatly affected the good woman But nevertheless he said and nobody contradicted him that if she could not prevail upon her sweet child as it seems she had fondly called me she had best draw to her own home and there tarry till she was sent for and so leave her sweet child to her father s management Sure nobody had ever so insolent so hard hearted a brother as I have So much resignation to be expected from me So much arrogance and to so good a woman and of so fine an understanding to be allowed in him She nevertheless told him that however she might be ridiculed for speaking of the sweetness of my disposition she must take upon herself to say that there never was a sweeter in the sex and that she had ever found that my mild methods and gentleness I might at any time be prevailed upon even in points against my own judgment and opinion My aunt Hervey hereupon said It was worth while to consider what missus Norton said and that she had sometimes allowed herself to doubt whether I had been begun with by such methods as generous tempers are only to be influenced by in cases where their hearts are supposed to be opposite to the will of their friends She had both my brother and sister upon her for this who referred to my mother whether she had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example My mother said she must own that no indulgence had been wanting from her but she must needs say and had often said it that the reception I met with on my return from Miss Howe and the manner in which the proposal of mister Solmes was made to me which was such as left nothing to my choice and before I had an opportunity to converse with him were not what she had by any means approved of She was silenced you will guess by whom with My dear my dear You have ever something to say something to palliate for this rebel of a girl Remember her treatment of you of me Remember that the wretch whom we so justly hate would not dare persist in his purposes but for her encouragement of him and obstinacy to us missus Norton angrily to her go up to her once more and if you think gentleness will do you have a commission to be gentle if it will not never make use of that plea again Ay my good woman said my mother try your force with her My sister Hervey and I will go up to her and bring her down in our hands to receive her father s blessing and assurances of every body s love if she will be prevailed upon and in that case we will all love you the better for your good offices She came up to me and repeated all these passages with tears But I told her that after what had passed between us she could not hope to prevail upon me to comply with measures so wholly my brother s and so much to my aversion And then folding me to her maternal bosom I leave you my dearest Miss said she I leave you because I must But let me beseech you to do nothing rashly nothing unbecoming your character If all be true that is said mister Lovelace cannot deserve you If you can comply remember it is your duty to comply They take not I own the right method with so generous a spirit But remember that there would not be any merit in your compliance if it were not to be against your own liking Remember also what is expected from a character so extraordinary as yours remember it is in your power to unite or disunite your whole family for ever Although it should at present be disagreeable to you to be thus compelled your prudence I dare say when you consider the matter seriously will enable you to get over all prejudices against the one and all prepossessions in favour of the other and then the obligation you will lay all your family under will be not only meritorious in you with regard to them but in a few months very probably highly satisfactory as well as reputable to yourself Consider my dear missus Norton said I only consider that it is not a small thing that is insisted upon not for a short duration it is for my life consider too that all this is owing to an overbearing brother who governs every body Consider how desirous I am to oblige them if a single life and breaking all correspondence with the man they hate because my brother hates him will do it I consider every thing my dearest Miss and added to what I have said do you only consider that if by pursuing your own will and rejecting theirs you should be unhappy you will be deprived of all that consolation which those have who have been directed by their parents although the event prove not answerable to their wishes I must go repeated she your brother will say and she wept that I harden you by my whining nonsense Tis indeed hard that so much regard should be paid to the humours of one child and so little to the inclination of another But let me repeat that it is your duty to acquiesce if you can acquiesce your father has given your brother s schemes his sanction and they are now his mister Lovelace I doubt is not a man that will justify your choice so much as he will their dislike It is easy to see that your brother has a view in discrediting you with all your friends with your uncles in particular but for that very reason you should comply if possible in order to disconcert his ungenerous measures I will pray for you and that is all I can do for you I must now go down and make a report that you are resolved never to have mister Solmes Must I Consider my dear Miss Clary Must I Indeed you must But of this I do assure you that I will do nothing to disgrace the part you have had in my education I will bear every thing that shall be short of forcing my hand into his who never can have any share in my heart I will try by patient duty by humility to overcome them But death will I choose in any shape rather than that man I dread to go down said she with so determined an answer they will have no patience with me But let me leave you with one observation which I beg of you always to bear in mind That persons of prudence and distinguished talents like yours seem to be sprinkled through the world to give credit by their example to religion and virtue When such persons wilfully err how great must be the fault How ungrateful to that God who blessed them with such talents What a loss likewise to the world What a wound to virtue But this I hope will never be to be said of Miss Clarissa Harlowe I could give her no answer but by my tears And I thought when she went away the better half of my heart went with her I listened to hear what reception she would meet with below and found it was just such a one as she had apprehended Will she or will she not be missus Solmes None of your whining circumlocutions missus Norton You may guess who said this Will she or will she not comply with her parents will This cut short all she was going to say If I must speak so briefly Miss will sooner die than have Any body but Lovelace interrupted my brother This Madam this Sir is your meek daughter This is missus Norton s sweet child Well Goody you may return to your own habitation I am empowered to forbid you to have any correspondence with this perverse girl for a month to come as you value the favour of our whole family or of any individual of it And saying this uncontradicted by any body he himself shewed her to the door no doubt with all that air of cruel insult which the haughty rich can put on to the unhappy low who have not pleased them So here my dear Miss Howe am I deprived of the advice of one of the most prudent and conscientious women in the world were I to have ever so much occasion for it I might indeed write as I presume under your cover and receive her answers to what I should write But should such a correspondence be charged upon her I know she would not be guilty of a falsehood for the world nor even of an equivocation and should she own it after this prohibition she would forfeit my mother s favour for ever And in my dangerous fever some time ago I engaged my mother to promise me that if I died before I could do any thing for the good woman she would set her above want for the rest of her life should her eyes fail her or sickness befall her and she could not provide for herself as she now so prettily does by her fine needle works What measures will they fall upon next Will they not recede when they find that it must be a rooted antipathy and nothing else that could make a temper not naturally inflexible so sturdy Adieu my dear Be you happy To know that it is in your power to be so is all that seems wanting to make you so CL HARLOWE LETTER XL MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE In continuation of the subject in Letter XXXVIII I will now though midnight for I have no sleep in my eyes resume the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit and will obey yours Miss Lloyd s Miss Campion s and Miss Biddulph s call with as much temper as my divided thought will admit The dead stillness of this solemn hour will I hope contribute to calm my disturbed mind In order to acquit myself of so heavy a charge as that of having reserves to so dear a friend I will acknowledge and I thought I had over and over that it is owing to my particular situation if mister Lovelace appears to me in a tolerable light and I take upon me to say that had they opposed to him a man of sense of virtue of generosity one who enjoyed his fortune with credit who had a tenderness in his nature for the calamities of others which would have given a moral assurance that he would have been still less wanting in grateful returns to an obliging spirit had they opposed such a man as this to mister Lovelace and been as earnest to have me married as now they are I do not know myself if they would have had reason to tax me with that invincible obstinacy which they lay to my charge and this whatever had been the figure of the man since the heart is what we women should judge by in the choice we make as the best security for the party s good behaviour in every relation of life But situated as I am thus persecuted and driven I own to you that I have now and then had a little more difficulty than I wished for in passing by mister Lovelace s tolerable qualities to keep up my dislike to him for his others You say I must have argued with myself in his favour and in his disfavour on a supposition that I might possibly be one day his I own that I have and thus called upon by my dearest friend I will set before you both parts of the argument And first what occurred to me in his favour At his introduction into our family his negative virtues were insisted upon He was no gamester no horse racer no fox hunter no drinker my poor aunt Hervey had in confidence given us to apprehend much disagreeable evil especially to a wife of the least delicacy from a wine lover and common sense instructed us that sobriety in a man is no small point to be secured when so many mischiefs happen daily from excess I remember that my sister made the most of this favourable circumstance in his character while she had any hopes of him He was never thought to be a niggard not even ungenerous nor when his conduct came to be inquired into an extravagant a squanderer his pride so far was it a laudable pride secured him from that Then he was ever ready to own his errors He was no jester upon sacred things poor mister Wyerley s fault who seemed to think there was wit in saying bold things which would shock a serious mind His conversation with us was always unexceptionable even chastely so which be his actions what they would shewed him capable of being influenced by decent company and that he might probably therefore be a led man rather than a leader in other company And one late instance so late as last Saturday evening has raised him not a little in my opinion with regard to this point of good and at the same time of manly behaviour As to the advantage of birth that is of his side above any man who has been found out for me If we may judge by that expression of his which you were pleased with at the time That upon true quality and hereditary distinction if good sense were not wanting humour sat as easy as his glove that with as familiar an air was his familiar expression while none but the prosperous upstart MUSHROOMED into rank another of his peculiars was arrogantly proud of it If I say we may judge of him by this we shall conclude in his favour that he knows what sort of behaviour is to be expected from persons of birth whether he act up to it or not Conviction is half way to amendment His fortunes in possession are handsome in expectation splendid so nothing need be said on that subject But it is impossible say some that he should make a tender or kind husband Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as mister Solmes and by methods so violent are not entitled to make this objection But now on this subject let me tell you how I have argued with myself for still you must remember that I am upon the extenuating part of his character A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from him will possibly depend upon herself Perhaps she must practise as well as promise obedience to a man so little used to controul and must be careful to oblige And what husband expects not this The more perhaps if he had not reason to assure himself of the preferable love of his wife before she became such And how much easier and pleasanter to obey the man of her choice if he should be even more unreasonable sometimes than one she would not have had could she have avoided it Then I think as the men were the framers of the matrimonial office and made obedience a part of the woman s vow she ought not even in policy to shew him that she can break through her part of the contract however lightly she may think of the instance lest he should take it into his head himself is judge to think as lightly of other points which she may hold more important but indeed no point so solemnly vowed can be slight Thus principled and acting accordingly what a wretch must that husband be who could treat such a wife brutally Will Lovelace s wife be the only person to whom he will not pay the grateful debt of civility and good manners He is allowed to be brave Who ever knew a brave man if a brave man of sense an universally base man And how much the gentleness of our sex and the manner of our training up and education make us need the protection of the brave and the countenance of the generous let the general approbation which we are all so naturally inclined to give to men of that character testify At worst will he confine me prisoner to my chamber Will he deny me the visits of my dearest friend and forbid me to correspond with her Will he take from me the mistressly management which I had not faultily discharged Will he set a servant over me with license to insult me Will he as he has not a sister permit his cousins Montague or would either of those ladies accept of a permission to insult and tyrannize over me It cannot be Why then think I often do you tempt me O my cruel friends to try the difference And then has the secret pleasure intruded itself to be able to reclaim such a man to the paths of virtue and honour to be a secondary means if I were to be his of saving him and preventing the mischiefs so enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of if he be such a one When I have thought of him in these lights and that as a man of sense he will sooner see his errors than another I own to you that I have had some difficulty to avoid taking the path they so violently endeavour to make me shun and all that command of my passions which has been attributed to me as my greatest praise and in so young a creature as my distinction has hardly been sufficient for me And let me add that the favour of his relations all but himself unexceptionable has made a good deal of additional weight thrown in the same scale But now in his disfavour When I have reflected upon the prohibition of my parents the giddy appearance disgraceful to our sex that such a preference would have that there is no manner of likelihood enflamed by the rencounter and upheld by art and ambition on my brother s side that ever the animosity will be got over that I must therefore be at perpetual variance with all my own family that I must go to him and to his as an obliged and half fortuned person that his aversion to them all is as strong as theirs to him that his whole family are hated for his sake they hating ours in return that he has a very immoral character as to women that knowing this it is a high degree of impurity to think of joining in wedlock with such a man that he is young unbroken his passions unsubdued that he is violent in his temper yet artful I am afraid vindictive too that such a husband might unsettle me in all my own principles and hazard my future hopes that his own relations two excellent aunts and an uncle from whom he has such large expectations have no influence upon him that what tolerable qualities he has are founded more in pride than in virtue that allowing as he does the excellency of moral precepts and believing the doctrine of future rewards and punishments he can live as if he despised the one and defied the other the probability that the taint arising from such free principles may go down into the manners of posterity that I knowing these things and the importance of them should be more inexcusable than one who knows them not since an error against judgment is worse infinitely worse than an error in judgment Reflecting upon these things I cannot help conjuring you my dear to pray with me and to pray for me that I may not be pushed upon such indiscreet measures as will render me inexcusable to myself for that is the test after all The world s opinion ought to be but a secondary consideration I have said in his praise that he is extremely ready to own his errors but I have sometimes made a great drawback upon this article in his disfavour having been ready to apprehend that this ingenuousness may possibly be attributable to two causes neither of them by any means creditable to him The one that his vices are so much his masters that he attempts not to conquer them the other that he may think it policy to give up one half of his character to save the other when the whole may be blamable by this means silencing by acknowledgment the objections he cannot answer which may give him the praise of ingenuousness when he can obtain no other and when the challenged proof might bring out upon discussion other evils These you will allow are severe constructions but every thing his enemies say of him cannot be false I will proceed by and by Sometimes we have both thought him one of the most undesigning merely witty men we ever knew at other times one of the deepest creatures we ever conversed with So that when in one visit we have imagined we fathomed him in the next he has made us ready to give him up as impenetrable This impenetrableness my dear is to be put among the shades in his character Yet upon the whole you have been so far of his party that you have contested that his principal fault is over frankness and too much regardlessness of appearances and that he is too giddy to be very artful you would have it that at the time he says any thing good he means what he speaks that his variableness and levity are constitutional owing to sound health and to a soul and body that was your observation fitted for and pleased with each other And hence you concluded that could this consentaneousness as you call it of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion that is to say could his vivacity be confined within the pale of but moral obligations he would be far from being rejectable as a companion for life But I used then to say and I still am of opinion that he wants a heart and if he does he wants every thing A wrong head may be convinced may have a right turn given it but who is able to give a heart if a heart be wanting Divine Grace working a miracle or next to a miracle can only change a bad heart Should not one fly the man who is but suspected of such a one What O what do parents do when they endeavour to force a child s inclination but make her think better than otherwise she would think of a man obnoxious to themselves and perhaps whose character will not stand examination I have said that I think mister Lovelace a vindictive man upon my word I have sometimes doubted whether his perseverance in his addresses to me has not been the more obstinate since he has found himself so disagreeable to my friends From that time I verily think he has been the more fervent in them yet courts them not but sets them at defiance For this indeed he pleads disinterestedness I am sure he cannot politeness and the more plausibly as he is apprized of the ability they have to make it worth his while to court them Tis true he has declared and with too much reason or there would be no bearing him that the lowest submissions on his part would not be accepted and to oblige me has offered to seek a reconciliation with them if I would give him hope of success As to his behaviour at church the Sunday before last I lay no stress upon that because I doubt there was too much outward pride in his intentional humility or Shorey who is not his enemy could not have mistaken it I do not think him so deeply learned in human nature or in ethics as some have thought him Don t you remember how he stared at the following trite observations which every moralist could have furnished him with Complaining as he did in a half menacing strain of the obloquies raised against him That if he were innocent he should despise the obloquy if not revenge would not wipe off his guilt That nobody ever thought of turning a sword into a sponge That it was in his own power by reformation of an error laid to his charge by an enemy to make that enemy one of his best friends and which was the noblest revenge in the world against his will since an enemy would not wish him to be without the faults he taxed him with But the intention he said was the wound How so I asked him when that cannot wound without the application That the adversary only held the sword he himself pointed it to his breast And why should he mortally resent that malice which he might be the better for as long as he lived What could be the reading he has been said to be master of to wonder as he did at these observations But indeed he must take pleasure in revenge and yet holds others to be inexcusable for the same fault He is not however the only one who can see how truly blamable those errors are in another which they hardly think such in themselves From these considerations from these over balances it was that I said in a former that I would not be in love with this man for the world and it was going further than prudence would warrant when I was for compounding with you by the words conditional liking which you so humourously rally Well but methinks you say what is all this to the purpose This is still but reasoning but if you are in love you are and love like the vapours is the deeper rooted for having no sufficient cause assignable for its hold And so you call upon me again to have no reserves and so forth Why then my dear if you will have it I think that with all his preponderating faults I like him better than I ever thought I should like him and those faults considered better perhaps than I ought to like him And I believe it is possible for the persecution I labour under to induce me to like him still more especially while I can recollect to his advantage our last interview and as every day produces stronger instances of tyranny I will call it on the other side In a word I will frankly own since you cannot think any thing I say too explicit that were he now but a moral man I would prefer him to all the men I ever saw So that this is but conditional liking still you ll say nor I hope is it more I never was in love as it is called and whether this be it or not I must submit to you But will venture to think it if it be no such mighty monarch no such unconquerable power as I have heard it represented and it must have met with greater encouragement than I think I have given it to be absolutely unconquerable since I am persuaded that I could yet without a throb most willingly give up the one man to get rid of the other But now to be a little more serious with you if my dear my particularly unhappy situation had driven or led me if you please into a liking of the man and if that liking had in your opinion inclined me to love him should you whose mind is susceptible of the most friendly impressions who have such high notions of the delicacy which ought to be observed by our sex in these matters and who actually do enter so deeply into the distresses of one you love should you have pushed so far that unhappy friend on so very nice a subject Especially when I aimed not as you could prove by fifty instances it seems to guard against being found out Had you rallied me by word of mouth in the manner you do it might have been more in character especially if your friend s distresses had been surmounted and if she had affected prudish airs in revolving the subject but to sit down to write it as methinks I see you with a gladdened eye and with all the archness of exultation indeed my dear and I take notice of it rather for the sake of your own generosity than for my sake for as I have said I love your raillery it is not so very pretty the delicacy of the subject and the delicacy of your own mind considered I lay down my pen here that you may consider of it a little if you please I resume to give you my opinion of the force which figure or person ought to have upon our sex and this I shall do both generally as to the other sex and particularly as to this man whence you will be able to collect how far my friends are in the right or in the wrong when they attribute a good deal of prejudice in favour of one man and in disfavour of the other on the score of figure But first let me observe that they see abundant reason on comparing mister Lovelace and mister Solmes together to believe that this may be a consideration with me and therefore they believe it is There is certainly something very plausible and attractive as well as creditable to a woman s choice in figure It gives a favourable impression at first sight in which we wish to be confirmed and if upon further acquaintance we find reason to be so we are pleased with our judgment and like the person the better for having given us cause to compliment our own sagacity in our first sighted impressions But nevertheless it has been generally a rule with me to suspect a fine figure both in man and woman and I have had a good deal of reason to approve my rule with regard to men especially who ought to value themselves rather upon their intellectual than personal qualities For as to our sex if a fine woman should be led by the opinion of the world to be vain and conceited upon her form and features and that to such a degree as to have neglected the more material and more durable recommendations the world will be ready to excuse her since a pretty fool in all she says and in all she does will please we know not why But who would grudge this pretty fool her short day Since with her summer s sun when her butterfly flutters are over and the winter of age and furrows arrives she will feel the just effects of having neglected to cultivate her better faculties for then lie another Helen she will be unable to bear the reflection even of her own glass and being sunk into the insignificance of a mere old woman she will be entitled to the contempts which follow that character While the discreet matron who carries up we will not in such a one s case say down into advanced life the ever amiable character of virtuous prudence and useful experience finds solid veneration take place of airy admiration and more than supply the want of it But for a man to be vain of his person how effeminate If such a one happens to have genius it seldom strikes deep into intellectual subjects His outside usually runs away with him To adorn and perhaps intending to adorn to render ridiculous that person takes up all his attention All he does is personal that is to say for himself all he admires is himself and in spite of the correction of the stage which so often and so justly exposes a coxcomb he usually dwindles down and sinks into that character and of consequence becomes the scorn of one sex and the jest of the other This is generally the case of your fine figures of men and of those who value themselves on dress and outward appearance whence it is that I repeat that mere person in a man is a despicable consideration But if a man besides figure has learning and such talents as would have distinguished him whatever were his form then indeed person is an addition and if he has not run too egregiously into self admiration and if he has preserved his morals he is truly a valuable being mister Lovelace has certainly taste and as far as I am able to determine he has judgment in most of the politer arts But although he has a humourous way of carrying it off yet one may see that he values himself not a little both on his person and his parts and even upon his dress and yet he has so happy an ease in the latter that it seems to be the least part of his study And as to the former I should hold myself inexcusable if I were to add to his vanity by shewing the least regard for what is too evidently so much his And now my dear let me ask you Have I come up to your expectation If I have not when my mind is more at ease I will endeavour to please you better For methinks my sentences drag my style creeps my imagination is sunk my spirits serve me not only to tell you that whether I have more or less I am wholly devoted to the commands of my dear Miss Howe P S The insolent Betty Barnes has just now fired me anew by reporting to me the following expressions of the hideous creature Solmes That he is sure of the coy girl and that with little labour to himself That be I ever so averse to him beforehand he can depend upon my principles and it will be a pleasure to him to see by what pretty degrees I shall come to Horrid wretch That it was Sir Oliver s observation who knew the world perfectly well that fear was a better security than love for a woman s good behaviour to her husband although for his part to such a fine creature truly he would try what love would do for a few weeks at least being unwilling to believe what the old knight used to aver that fondness spoils more wives than it makes good What think you my dear of such a wretch as this tutored too by that old surly misogynist as he was deemed Sir Oliver LETTER XLI MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY MARCH twenty one How willingly would my dear mother shew kindness to me were she permitted None of this persecution should I labour under I am sure if that regard were paid to her prudence and fine understanding which they so well deserve Whether owing to her or to my aunt or to both that a new trial was to be made upon me I cannot tell but this morning her Shorey delivered into my hand the following condescending letter MY DEAR GIRL For so I must still call you since dear you may be to me in every sense of the word we have taken into particular consideration some hints that fell yesterday from your good Norton as if we had not at mister Solmes s first application treated you with that condescension wherewith we have in all other instances treated you If it even had been so my dear you were not excusable to be wanting in your part and to set yourself to oppose your father s will in a point which he had entered too far to recede with honour But all yet may be well On your single will my child depends all our happiness Your father permits me to tell you that if you now at last comply with his expectations all past disobligations shall be buried in oblivion as if they had never been but withal that this is the last time that that grace will be offered you I hinted to you you must remember that patterns of the richest silks were sent for They are come And as they are come your father to shew how much he is determined will have me send them up to you I could have wished they might not have accompanied this letter but there is not great matter in that I must tell you that your delicacy is not quite so much regarded as I had once thought it deserved to be See Letter XX These are the newest as well as richest that we could procure answerable to our situation in the world answerable to the fortune additional to your grandfather s estate designed you and to the noble settlements agreed upon Your father intends you six suits three of them dressed suits at his own expense You have an entire new suit and one besides which I think you never wore but twice As the new suit is rich if you choose to make that one of the six your father will present you with an hundred guineas in lieu mister Solmes intends to present you with a set of jewels As you have your grandmother s and your own if you choose to have the former new set and to make them serve his present will be made in money a very round sum which will be given in full property to yourself besides a fine annual allowance for pin money as it is called So that your objection against the spirit of a man you think worse of than it deserves will have no weight but you will be more independent than a wife of less discretion than we attribute to you perhaps ought to be You know full well that I who first and last brought a still larger fortune into the family than you will carry to mister Solmes had not a provision made me of near this that we have made for you Where people marry to their liking terms are the least things stood upon yet should I be sorry if you cannot to oblige us all overcome a dislike Wonder not Clary that I write to you thus plainly and freely upon this subject Your behaviour hitherto has been such that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the subject with you Yet after all that has passed between you and me in conversation and between you and your uncles by letter you have no room to doubt what is to be the consequence Either child we must give up our authority or you your humour You cannot expect the one We have all the reason in the world to expect the other You know I have told you more than once that you must resolve to have mister Solmes or never to be looked upon as our child The draught of the settlement you may see whenever you will We think there can be no room for objection to any of the articles There is still more in them in our family s favour than was stipulated at first when your aunt talked of them to you More so indeed than we could have asked If upon perusal of them you think any alteration necessary it shall be made Do my dear girl send to me within this day or two or rather ask me for the perusal of them As a certain person s appearance at church so lately and what he gives out every where makes us extremely uneasy and as that uneasiness will continue while you are single you must not wonder that a short day is intended This day fortnight we design it to be if you have no objection to make that I shall approve of But if you determine as we would have you and signify it to us we shall not stand with you for a week or so Your sightlines of person may perhaps make some think this alliance disparaging But I hope you will not put such a personal value upon yourself if you do it will indeed be the less wonder that person should weigh with you however weak the consideration in another man Thus we parents in justice ought to judge that our two daughters are equally dear and valuable to us if so why should Clarissa think that a disparagement which Arabella would not nor we for her have thought any had the address been made to her You will know what I mean by this without my explaining myself farther Signify to us now therefore your compliance with our wishes And then there is an end of your confinement An act of oblivion as I may call it shall pass upon all your former refractoriness and you will once more make us happy in you and in one another You may in this case directly come down to your father and me in his study where we will give you our opinions of the patterns with our hearty forgiveness and blessings Come be a good child as you used to be my Clarissa I have notwithstanding your past behaviour and the hopelessness which some have expressed in your compliance undertaken this one time more for you Discredit not my hopes my dear girl I have promised never more to interfere between your father and you if this my most earnest application succeed not I expect you down love Your father expects you down But be sure don t let him see any thing uncheerful in your compliance If you come I will clasp you to my fond heart with as much pleasure as ever I pressed you to it in my whole life You don t know what I have suffered within these few weeks past nor ever will be able to guess till you come to be in my situation which is that of a fond and indulgent mother praying night and day and struggling to preserve against the attempts of more ungovernable spirits the peace and union of her family But you know the terms Come not near us if you have resolve to be undutiful but this after what I have written I hope you cannot be If you come directly and as I have said cheerfully as if your heart were in your duty and you told me it was free you know I shall then as I said give you the most tender proofs how much I am Your truly affectionate Mother Think for me my dearest friend how I must be affected by this letter the contents of it is so surprisingly terrifying yet so sweetly urged O why cried I to myself am I obliged to undergo this severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey and language so condescendingly moving Could I have been sure of being struck dead at the alter before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows I think I could have submitted to having been led to it But to think of living with and living for a man one abhors what a sad thing is that And then how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any inducement to one who has always held that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of her person ought to be to preserve the affection of her husband and to do credit to his choice and that she should be even fearful of attracting the eyes of others In this view must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgusts Great encouragement indeed to think of adorning one s self to be the wife of mister Solmes Upon the whole it was not possible for me to go down upon the prescribed condition Do you think it was And to write if my letter would have been read what could I write that would be admitted and after what I had written and said to so little effect I walked backward and forward I threw down with disdain the patterns Now to my closet retired I then quitting it threw myself upon the settee then upon this chair then upon that then into one window then into another I knew not what to do And while I was in this suspense having again taken up the letter to re peruse it Betty came in reminding me by order that my papa and mamma waited for me in my father s study Tell my mamma said I that I beg the favour of seeing her here for one moment or to permit me to attend her any where by herself I listened at the stairs head You see my dear how it is cried my father very angrily all your condescension as your indulgence heretofore is thrown away You blame your son s violence as you call it I had some pleasure in hearing this but nothing else will do with her You shall not see her alone Is my presence an exception to the bold creature Tell her said my mother to Betty she knows upon what terms she may come down to us Nor will I see her upon any other The maid brought me this answer I had recourse to my pen and ink but I trembled so that I could not write nor knew what to say had I steadier fingers At last Betty brought me these lines from my father UNDUTIFUL AND PERVERSE CLARISSA No condescension I see will move you Your mother shall not see you nor will I Prepare however to obey You know our pleasure Your uncle Antony your brother and your sister and your favourite missus Norton shall see the ceremony performed privately at your uncle s chapel And when mister Solmes can introduce you to us in the temper we wish to behold you in we may perhaps forgive his wife although we never can in any other character our perverse daughter As it will be so privately performed clothes and equipage may be provided for afterwards So prepare to go to your uncle s for an early day in next week We will not see you till all is over and we will have it over the sooner in order to shorten the time of your deserved confinement and our own trouble in contending with such a rebel as you have been of late I will hear no pleas I will receive no letter nor expostulation Nor shall you hear from me any more till you have changed your name to my liking This from Your incensed Father If this resolution be adhered to then will my father never see me more For I will never be the wife of that Solmes I will die first TUESDAY EVENING He this Solmes came hither soon after I had received my father s letter He sent up to beg leave to wait upon me I wonder at his assurance I said to Betty who brought me this message let him restore an unhappy creature to her father and mother and then I may hear what he has to say But if my friends will not see me on his account I will not see him upon his own I hope Miss said Betty you will not send me down with this answer He is with you papa and mamma I am driven to despair said I I cannot be used worse I will not see him Down she went with my answer She pretended it seems to be loth to repeat it so was commanded out of her affected reserves and gave it in its full force O how I heard my father storm They were altogether it seems in his study My brother was for having me turned out of the house that moment to Lovelace and my evil destiny My mother was pleased to put in a gentle word for me I know not what it was but thus she was answered My dear this is the most provoking thing in the world in a woman of your good sense To love a rebel as well as if she were dutiful What encouragement for duty is this Have I not loved her as well as ever you did And why am I changed Would to the Lord your sex knew how to distinguish It is plain that she relies upon her power over you The fond mother ever made a hardened child She was pleased however to blame Betty as the wench owned for giving my answer its full force But my father praised her for it The wench says that he would have come up in his wrath at my refusing to see mister Solmes had not my brother and sister prevailed upon him to the contrary I wish he had And were it not for his own sake that he had killed me mister Solmes condescended I am mightily obliged to him truly to plead for me They are all in tumults How it will end I know not I am quite weary of life So happy till within these few weeks So miserable now Well indeed might my mother say that I should have severe trials See Letter XXV P S The idiot such a one am I treated like is begged as I may say by my brother and sister They have desired that I may be consigned over entirely to their management If it be granted it is granted on my father s part I understand but not yet on my mother s what cruelty may I not expect from their envy jealousy and ill will I shall soon see by its effects if I am to be so consigned This is a written intimation privately dropt in my wood house walk by my cousin Dolly Hervey The dear girl longs to see me she tells me but is forbidden till she see me as missus Solmes or as consenting to be his I will take example by their perseverance Indeed I will LETTER XLII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE An angry dialogue a scolding bout rather has passed between my sister and me Did you think I could scold my dear She was sent up to me upon my refusal to see mister Solmes let loose upon me I think No intention on their parts to conciliate It seems evident that I am given up to my brother and her by general consent I will do justice to every thing she said against me which carried any force with it As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct upon the facts I lay before you I should think it the sign of a very bad cause if I endeavoured to mislead my judge She began with representing to me the danger I had been in had my father come up as he would have done had he not been hindered by mister Solmes among the rest She reflected upon my Norton as if she encouraged me in my perverseness She ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for mister Lovelace was surprised that the witty the prudent nay the dutiful and pi ous so she sneeringly pronounced the word Clarissa Harlowe should be so strangely fond of a profligate man that her parents were forced to lock her up in order to hinder her from running into his arms Let me ask you my dear said she how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time How many hours in the twenty four do you devote to your needle How many to your prayers How many to letter writing And how many to love I doubt I doubt my little dear was her arch expression the latter article is like Aaron s rod and swallows up the rest Tell me is it not so To these I answered That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from the effects of my father s indignation to a man I could never thank for any thing I vindicated the good missus Norton with a warmth that was due to her merit With equal warmth I resented her reflections upon me on mister Lovelace s account As to the disposition of my time in the twenty four hours I told her it would better have become her to pity a sister in distress than to exult over her especially when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of her wakeful hours no small part of that distress She raved extremely at this last hint but reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends my mother s in particular before it came to this She said that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected that if they had thought me such a championess they would hardly have ventured to engage with me but that now the short and the long of it was that the matter had gone too far to be given up that it was become a contention between duty and willfulness whether a parent s authority were to yield to a daughter s obstinacy or the contrary that I must therefore bend or break that was all child I told her that I wished the subject were of such a nature that I could return her pleasantry with equal lightness of heart but that if mister Solmes had such merit in every body s eyes in hers particularly why might he not be a brother to me rather than a husband O child says she methinks you are as pleasant to the full as I am I begin to have some hopes of you now But do you think I will rob my sister of her humble servant Had he first addressed himself to me proceeded she something might have been said but to take my younger sister s refusal No no child it is not come to that neither Besides that would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who child and we would fain bar him out if possible In short and then she changed both her tone and her looks had I been as forward as somebody to throw myself into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England who had endeavoured to support his claim to me through the blood of my brother then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch and to marry me as fast as they could to some worthy man who might opportunely offer himself And now Clary all s out and make the most of it Did not this deserve a severe return Do say it did to justify my reply Alas for my poor sister said I The man was not always so great a profligate How true is the observation That unrequited love turns to deepest hate I thought she would beat me But I proceeded I have heard often of my brother s danger and my brother s murderer When so little ceremony is made with me why should I not speak out Did he not seek to kill the other if he could have done it Would my brother have given Lovelace his life had it been in his power The aggressor should not complain And as to opportune offers would to Heaven some one had offered opportunely to somebody It is not my fault Bella the opportune gentleman don t come Could you my dear have shewn more spirit I expected to feel the weight of her hand She did come up to me with it held up then speechless with passion ran half way down the stairs and came up again When she could speak God give me patience with you Amen said I but you see Bella how ill you bear the retort you provoke Will you forgive me and let me find a sister in you as I am sorry if you had reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said Then did she pour upon me with greater violence considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over her She was resolved she said to let every body know how I took the wicked Lovelace s part against my brother I wished I told her I could make the plea for myself which she might for herself to wit that my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment But I presumed she had some other view in coming to me than she had hitherto acquainted me with Let me said I but know after all that has passed if you have any thing to propose that I can comply with any thing that can make my only sister once more my friend I had before upon hearing her ridiculing me on my supposed character of meekness said that although I wished to be thought meek I would not be abject although humble not mean and here in a sneering way she cautioned me on that head I replied that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger But I wished she would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto between us been so unsisterly She desired to be informed in the name of every body was her word what I was determined upon And whether to comply or not One word for all My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature for ever This then I told her I would do Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against upon condition however that neither mister Solmes nor any other were urged upon me with the force of a command And what was this more than I had offered before What but ringing my changes upon the same bells and neither receding nor advancing one tittle If I knew what other proposals I could make I told her that would be acceptable to them all and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me I would make them I had indeed before offered never to marry without my father s consent She interrupted me That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased A poor dependence I said She knew those who would make that dependence vain And I should have brought them to my own beck very probably and my uncle Harlowe too as also my aunt Hervey had I not been forbidden from their sight and thereby hindered from playing my pug s tricks before them At least Bella said I you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged that my father and mother and every body else treat me thus harshly But surely you make them all very weak Indifferent persons judging of us two from what you say would either think me a very artful creature or you a very spiteful one You are indeed a very artful one for that matter interrupted she in a passion one of the artfullest I ever knew And then followed an accusation so low so unsisterly That I half bewitched people by my insinuating address that nobody could be valued or respected but must stand like ciphers wherever I came How often said she have I and my brother been talking upon a subject and had every body s attention till you came in with your bewitching meek pride and humble significance And then have we either been stopped by references to Miss Clary s opinion forsooth or been forced to stop ourselves or must have talked on unattended to by every body She paused Dear Bella proceed She indeed seemed only gathering breath And so I will said she Did you not bewitch my grandfather Could any thing be pleasing to him that you did not say or do How did he use to hang till he slabbered again poor doting old man on your silver tongue Yet what did you say that we could not have said What did you do that we did not endeavour to do And what was all this for Why truly his last will shewed what effect your smooth obligingness had upon him To leave the acquired part of his estate from the next heirs his own sons to a grandchild to his youngest grandchild A daughter too To leave the family pictures from his sons to you because you could tiddle about them and though you now neglect their examples could wipe and clean them with your dainty hands The family plate too in such quantities of two or three generations standing must not be changed because his precious child humouring his old fal lal taste admired it to make it all her own Alluding to his words in the preamble to the clauses in his will See Letter IV This was too low to move me O my poor sister said I not to be able or at least willing to distinguish between art and nature If I did oblige I was happy in it I looked for no further reward my mind is above art from the dirty motives you mention I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me he saw my brother likely to be amply provided for out of the family as well as in it he desired that you might have the greater share of my father s favour for it and no doubt but you both have You know Bella that the estate my grandfather bequeathed me was not half the real estate he left What s all that to an estate in possession and left you with such distinctions as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate itself Hence my misfortune Bella in your envy I doubt But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I could Yes interrupting me she hated me for that best manner Specious little witch she called me your best manner so full of art and design had never been seen through if you with your blandishing ways have not been put out of sight and reduced to positive declarations Hindered from playing your little declarations Hindered from playing your little whining tricks curling like a serpent about your mamma and making her cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon Obstinate heart Bella Yes obstinate heart For did you ever give up any thing Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked though my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import I know not Bella that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted I seldom asked favours for myself but for others I was a reflecting creature for this All you speak of Bella was a long time ago I cannot go so far back into our childish follies Little did I think of how long standing your late shewn antipathy is I was a reflector again Such a saucy meekness such a best manner and such venom in words O Clary Clary Thou wert always a two faced girl Nobody thought I had two faces when I gave up all into my father s management taking from his bounty as before all my little pocket money without a shilling addition to my stipend or desiring it Yes cunning creature And that was another of your fetches For did it not engage my fond father as no doubt you thought it would to tell you that since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing he would keep entire for your use all the produce of the estate left you and be but your steward in it and that you should be entitled to the same allowances as before Another of your hook in s Clary So that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis My extravagancies Bella But did my father ever give me any thing he did not give you Yes indeed I got more by that means than I should have had the conscience to ask But I have still the greater part to shew But you What have you to shew I dare say not fifty pieces in the world Indeed I have not I believe you Your mamma Norton I suppose But mum for that Unworthy Bella The good woman although low in circumstance is great in mind Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squander Let me ask you affecting archness Has has has Lovelace has your rake put it out at interest for you O that my sister would not make me blush for her It is however out at interest And I hope it will bring me interest upon interest Better than to lie useless in my cabinet She understood me she said Were I a man she should suppose I was aiming to carry the county Popularity A crowd to follow me with their blessings as I went to and from church and nobody else to be regarded were agreeable things House top proclamations I hid not my light under a bushel she would say that for me But was it not a little hard upon me to be kept from blazing on a Sunday And to be hindered from my charitable ostentations This indeed Bella is cruel in you who have so largely contributed to my confinement But go on You ll be out of breath by and by I cannot wish to be able to return this usage Poor Bella And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister to a sister None of your saucy contempts rising in her voice None of your poor Bella s with that air of superiority in a younger sister Well then rich Bella courtesying that will please you better and it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of Look ye Clary holding up her hand if you are not a little more abject in your meekness a little more mean in your humility and treat me with the respect due to an elder sister you shall find Not that you will treat me worse than you have done Bella That cannot be unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon me and that would less become you to do than me to bear Good meek creature But you were upon your overtures just now I shall surprise every body by tarrying so long They will think some good may be done with you and supper will be ready A tear would stray down my cheek How happy have I been said I sighing in the supper time conversations with all my dear friends in my eye round their hospitable board I met only with insult for this Bella has not a feeling heart The highest joy in this life she is not capable of but then she saves herself many griefs by her impenetrableness yet for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with would I not part with the pleasure it brings with it She asked me upon my turning from her if she should not say any thing below of my compliances You may say that I will do every thing they would have me do if they will free me from mister Solmes s address This is all you desire at present creeper on insinuator What words she has But will not t other man flame out and roar most horribly upon the snatching from his paws a prey he thought himself sure of I must let you talk in your own way or we shall never come to a point I shall not matter in his roaring as you call it I will promise him that if I ever marry any other man it shall not be till he is married And if he be not satisfied with such a condescension I shall think he ought and I will give any assurances that I will neither correspond with him nor see him Surely this will do But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse on a civil footing with mister Solmes as your father s friend or so No I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever he comes I would no more converse with the one than correspond with the other That would be to make mister Lovelace guilty of some rashness on a belief that I broke with him to have mister Solmes And so that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you that you are not to be civil to your father s friends at his own house for fear of incensing him When this comes to be represented be so good as to tell me what is it you expect from it Every thing I said or nothing as she was pleased to represent it Be so good as to give it your interest Bella and say further That I will by any means I can in the law or otherwise make over to my father to my uncles or even to my brother all I am entitled to by my grandfather s will as a security for the performance of my promises And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from my father if I break them I shall not be worth any body s having And further still unkindly as my brother has used me I will go down to Scotland privately as his housekeeper I now see I may be spared here if he will promise to treat me no worse than he would do an hired one Or I will go to Florence to my cousin Morden if his stay in Italy will admit of it In either case it may be given out that I am gone to the other or to the world s end I care not whither it is said I am gone or do go Let me ask you child if you will give your pretty proposal in writing Yes with all my heart And I stepped to my closet and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned and moreover the following lines to my brother MY DEAR BROTHER I hope I have made such proposals to my sister as will be accepted I am sure they will if you please to give them your sanction Let me beg of you for God s sake that you will I think myself very unhappy in having incurred your displeasure No sister can love a brother better than I love you Pray do not put the worst but the best constructions upon my proposals when you have them reported to you Indeed I mean the best I have no subterfuges no arts no intentions but to keep to the letter of them You shall yourself draw up every thing into writing as strong as you can and I will sign it and what the law will not do to enforce it my resolution and my will shall so that I shall be worth nobody s address that has not my papa s consent nor shall any person nor any consideration induce me to revoke it You can do more than any body to reconcile my parents and uncles to me Let me owe this desirable favour to your brotherly interposition and you will for ever oblige Your afflicted Sister CL HARLOWE And how do you think Bella employed herself while I was writing Why playing gently upon my harpsichord and humming to it to shew her unconcernedness When I approached her with what I had written she arose with an air of levity Why love you have not written already You have I protest O what a ready penwoman And may I read it If you please And let me beseech you my dear Bella to back these proposals with your good offices and folding my uplifted hands tears I believe standing in my eyes I will love you as never sister loved another Thou art a strange creature said she there is no withstanding thee She took the proposals and letter and having read them burst into an affected laugh How wise ones may be taken in Then you did not know that I was jesting with you all this time And so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense Don t let me be surprised at your seeming unsisterliness Bella I hope it is but seeming There can be no wit in such jesting as this The folly of the creature How natural is it for people when they set their hearts upon any thing to think every body must see with their eyes Pray dear child what becomes of your father s authority here Who stoops here the parent or the child How does this square with engagements actually agreed upon between your father and mister Solmes What security that your rake will not follow you to the world s end Nevertheless that you may not think that I stand in the way of a reconciliation on such fine terms as these I will be your messenger this once and hear what my papa will say to it although beforehand I can tell you these proposals will not answer the principal end So down she went But it seems my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe were not gone away and as they have all engaged to act in concert messengers were dispatched to my uncle and aunt to desire them to be there to breakfast in the morning MONDAY NIGHT ELEVEN O CLOCK I am afraid I shall not be thought worthy Just as I began to fear I should not be thought worthy of an answer Betty rapped at my door and said if I were not in bed she had a letter for me I had but just done writing the above dialogue and stept to the door with the pen in my hand Always writing Miss said the bold wench it is admirable how you can get away what you write but the fairies they say are always at hand to help lovers She retired in so much haste that had I been disposed I could not take the notice of this insolence which it deserved I enclose my brother s letter He was resolved to let me see that I should have nothing to expect from his kindness But surely he will not be permitted to carry every point The assembling of my friends to morrow is a good sign and I will hope something from that and from proposals so reasonable And now I will try if any repose will fall to my lot for the remainder of this night TO MISS CLARY HARLOWE ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING Your proposals will be considered by your father and mother and all your friends to morrow morning What trouble does your shameful forwardness give us all I wonder you have the courage to write to me upon whom you are so continually emptying your whole female quiver I have no patience with you for reflecting upon me as the aggressor in a quarrel which owed its beginning to my consideration for you You have made such confessions in a villain s favour as ought to cause all your relations to renounce you for ever For my part I will not believe any woman in the world who promises against her avowed inclination To put it out of your power to ruin yourself is the only way left to prevent your ruin I did not intend to write but your too kind sister has prevailed upon me As to your going to Scotland that day of grace is over Nor would I advise that you should go to grandfather up your cousin Morden Besides that worthy gentleman might be involved in some fatal dispute upon your account and then be called the aggressor A fine situation you have brought yourself to to propose to hide yourself from your rake and to have falsehoods told to conceal you Your confinement at this rate is the happiest thing that could befal you Your bravo s behaviour at church looking out for you is a sufficient indication of his power over you had you not so shamelessly acknowledged it One word for all Your parents and uncles may do as they will but if for the honour of the family I cannot carry this point I will retire to Scotland and never see the face of any one of it more JAMES HARLOWE There s a brother There s flaming duty to a father and mother and uncles But he sees himself valued and made of consequence and he gives himself airs accordingly Nevertheless as I said above I will hope better things from those who have not the interest my brother has to keep open these unhappy differences LETTER XLIII MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY MARCH twenty one Would you not have thought my dear Miss Howe as well as I that my proposal must have been accepted and that my brother by the last article of his unbrotherly letter where he threatens to go to Scotland if it should be hearkened to was of opinion that it would For my part after I had read the unkind letter over and over I concluded upon the whole that a reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself as hardly any other person in my case I dare say would have proposed must be the result of this morning s conference And in that belief I had begun to give myself new trouble in thinking this difficulty over how I should be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement by which I undertook to break off all correspondence with him unless my friends should be brought by the interposition of his powerful friends and any offers they might make which it was rather his part to suggest than mine to intimate to change their minds Thus was I employed not very agreeably you may believe because of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with when breakfasting time approached and my judges began to arrive And oh how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one and then of the other rattle through the court yard and the hollow sounding foot step giving notice of each person s stepping out to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges That thought I is my aunt Hervey s That my uncle Harlowe s Now comes my uncle Antony And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes although it happened he was not there And now thought I are they all assembled and now my brother calls upon my sister to make her report Now the hard hearted Bella interlards her speech with invective Now has she concluded her report Now they debate upon it Now does my brother flame Now threaten to go to Scotland Now is he chidden and now soothed And then I ran through the whole conference in my imagination forming speeches for this person and that pro and con till all concluded as I flattered myself in an acceptance of my conditions and in giving directions to have an instrument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour while I supposed all agreed to give Solmes a wife every way more worthy of him and with her the promise of my grandfather s estate in case of my forfeiture or dying unmarried on the righteous condition he proposes to entitle himself to it with me And now thought I am I to be ordered down to recognize my own proposals And how shall I look upon my awful judges How shall I stand the questions of some the set surliness of others the returning love of one or two How greatly shall I be affected Then I wept then I dried my eyes then I practised at my glass for a look more cheerful than my heart And now as any thing stirred is my sister coming to declare the issue of all Tears gushing again my heart fluttering as a bird against its wires drying my eyes again and again to no purpose And thus my Nancy excuse the fanciful prolixity was I employed and such were my thoughts and imaginations when I found a very different result from the hopeful conference For about ten o clock up came my sister with an air of cruel triumph waving her hand with a light flourish Obedience without reserve is required of you Clary My papa is justly incensed that you should presume to dispute his will and to make conditions with him He knows what is best for you and as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Lovelace and you they will believe nothing you say except you will give the one only instance that will put them out of doubt of the sincerity of your promises What child are you surprised Cannot you speak Then it seems you had expected a different issue had you Strange that you could With all your acknowledgements and confessions so creditable to your noted prudence I was indeed speechless for some time my eyes were even fixed and ceased to flow But upon the hard hearted Bella s proceeding with her airs of insult Indeed I was mistaken said I indeed I was For in you Bella I expected I hoped for a sister What interrupted she with all your mannerly flings and your despising airs did you expect that I was capable of telling stories for you Did you think that when I was asked my own opinion of the sincerity of your declarations I could not tell tem how far matters had gone between you and your fellow When the intention is to bend that stubborn will of yours to your duty do you think I would deceive them Do you think I would encourage them to call you down to contradict all that I should have invented in your favour Well well Bella I am the less obliged to you that s all I was willing to think that I had still a brother and sister But I find I am mistaken Pretty mopsy eyed soul was her expression And was it willing to think it had still a brother and sister And why don t you go on Clary mocking my half weeping accent I thought I had a father and mother two uncles and an aunt but I am mis taken that s all come Clary say this and it will in part be true because you have thrown off all their authority and because you respect one vile wretch more than them all How have I deserved this at your hands Sister But I will only say I pity you And with that disdainful air too Clary None of that bridled neck none of your scornful pity girl I beseech you This sort of behaviour is natural to you surely Bella What new talents does it discover in you But proceed If it be a pleasure to you proceed Bella And since I must not pity you I will pity myself for nobody else will Because you don t said she Hush Bella interrupting her because I don t deserve it I know you were going to say so I will say as you say in every thing and that s the way to please you Then say Lovelace is a villain So I will when I think him so Then you don t think him so Indeed I don t You did not always Bella And what Clary mean you by that bristling up to me Tell me what you mean by that reflection Tell me why you call it a reflection What did I say Thou art a provoking creature But what say you to two or three duels of that wretch s I can t tell what to say unless I knew the occasions Do you justify duelling at all I do not neither can I help his duelling Will you go down and humble that stubborn spirit of yours to your mamma I said nothing Shall I conduct your Ladyship down offering to take my declined hand What not vouchsafe to answer me I turned from her in silence What turn your back upon me too Shall I bring up your mamma to you love following me and taking my struggling hand What not speak yet Come my sullen silent dear speak one word to me you must say two very soon to mister Solmes I can tell you that Then gushing into tears which I could not hold in longer they shall be the last words I will ever speak Well well insultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief while her other hand held mine in a ridiculing tone I am glad any thing will make thee speak then you think you may be brought to speak the two words only they are to be the last How like a gentle lovyer from its tender bleeding heart was that Ridiculous Bella Saucy Clary changing her sneering tone to an imperious one But do you think you can humble yourself to go down to your mamma I am tired of such stuff as this Tell me Bella if my mamma will condescend to see me Yes if you can be dutiful at last I can I will But what call you dutiful To give up my own inclinations That s something more for you to tell of in obedience to my parents commands and to beg that I may not be made miserable with a man that is fitter for any body than for me For me do you mean Clary Why not since you have put the question You have a better opinion of him than I have My friends I hope would not think him too good for me and not good enough for you But cannot you tell me Bella what is to become of me without insulting over me thus If I must be thus treated remember that if I am guilty of any rashness the usage I meet with will justify it So Clary you are contriving an excuse I find for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while If it were so you seem resolved for your part and so does my brother for his that I shall not want one But indeed Bella I can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday s conversation I desire I may throw myself at my father s and mother s feet and hear from them what their sentence is I shall at least avoid by that means the unsisterly insults I meet with from you Hey day What is this you Is it you my meek sister Clary Yes it is I Bella and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family or to know why I am to be thus treated when I offer only to preserve to myself the liberty of refusal which belongs to my sex and to please my parents would give up my choice I have contented myself till now to take second hand messengers and first hand insults you are but my sister my brother is not my sovereign And while I have a father and mother living I will not be thus treated by a brother and sister and their servants all setting upon me as it should seem to make me desperate and do a rash thing I will know in short sister Bella why I am to be constrained thus What is intended by it And whether I am to be considered as a child or a slave She stood aghast all this time partly with real partly with affected surprise And is it you Is it indeed you Well Clary you amaze me But since you are so desirous to refer yourself to your father and mother I will go down and tell them what you say Your friends are not yet gone I believe they shall assemble again and then you may come down and plead your own cause in person Let me then But let my brother and you be absent You have made yourselves too much parties against me to sit as my judges And I desire to have none of yours or his interpositions I am sure you could not have represented what I proposed fairly I am sure you could not Nor is it possible you should be commissioned to treat me thus Well well I ll call up my brother to you I will indeed He shall justify himself as well as me I desire not to see my brother except he will come as a brother laying aside the authority he has unjustly assumed over me And so Clary it is nothing to him or to me is it that our sister shall disgrace her whole family As how Bella disgrace it The man whom you thus freely treat is a man of birth and fortune he is a man of parts and nobly allied He was once thought worthy of you and I wish to Heaven you had had him I am sure it was not thus my fault you had not although you treat me thus This set her into a flame I wish I had forborne it O how the poor Bella raved I thought she would have beat me once or twice and she vowed her fingers itched to do so but I was not worth her anger yet she flamed on We were heard to be high And Betty came up from my mother to command my sister to attend her She went down accordingly threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had shewn myself to be TUESDAY NOON MARCH twenty one I have as yet heard no more of my sister and have not courage enough to insist upon throwing myself at the feet of my father and mother as I thought in my heat of temper I should be able to do And I am now grown as calm as ever and were Bella to come up again as fit to be played upon as before I am indeed sorry that I sent her from me in such disorder But my papa s letter threatening me with my uncle Antony s house and chapel terrifies me strangely and by their silence I m afraid some new storm is gathering But what shall I do with this Lovelace I have just now but the unsuspected hole in the wall that I told you of in my letter by Hannah got a letter from him so uneasy is he for fear I should be prevailed upon in Solmes s favour so full of menaces if I am so resenting the usage I receive for how I cannot tell but he has undoubtedly intelligence of all that is done in the family such protestations of inviolable faith and honour such vows of reformation such pressing arguments to escape from this disgraceful confinement O my Nancy what shall I do with this Lovelace LETTER XLIV MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE WENESDAY MORNING NINE O CLOCK My aunt Hervey lay here last night and is but just gone from me She came up to me with my sister They would not trust my aunt without this ill natured witness When she entered my chamber I told her that this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner in her hard confinement I kissed her hand She kindly saluting me said Why this distance to your aunt my dear who loves you so well She owned that she came to expostulate with me for the peace sake of the family for that she could not believe it possible if I did not conceive myself unkindly treated that I who had ever shewn such a sweetness of temper as well as manners should be thus resolute in a point so very near to my father and all my friends My mother and she were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun with and to my supposing that my brother had originally more of a hand in the proposals made by mister Solmes than my father or other friends In short fain would my aunt have furnished me with an excuse to come off my opposition Bell all the while humming a tune and opening this book and that without meaning but saying nothing After having shewed me that my opposition could not be of signification my father s honour being engaged my aunt concluded with enforcing upon me my duty in stronger terms than I believe she would have done the circumstances of the case considered had not my sister been present It would be repeating what I have so often mentioned to give you the arguments that passed on both sides So I will only recite what she was pleased to say that carried with it a new face When she found me inflexible as she was pleased to call it she said For her part she could not but say that if I were not to have either mister Solmes or mister Lovelace and yet to make my friends easy must marry she should not think amiss of mister Wyerley What did I think of mister Wyerley Ay Clary put in my sister what say you to mister Wyerley I saw through this immediately It was said on purpose I doubted not to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in mister Lovelace s favour since mister Wyerley every where avows his value even to veneration for me and is far less exceptionable both in person and mind than mister Solmes and I was willing to turn the tables by trying how far mister Solmes s terms might be dispensed with since the same terms could not be expected from mister Wyerley I therefore desired to know whether my answer if it should be in favour of mister Wyerley would release me from mister Solmes For I owned that I had not the aversion to him that I had to the other Nay she had no commission to propose such a thing She only knew that my father and mother would not be easy till mister Lovelace s hopes were entirely defeated Cunning creature said my sister And this and her joining in the question before convinced me that it was a designed snare for me Don t you dear Madam said I put questions that can answer no end but to support my brother s schemes against me But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace without having this hated man imposed upon me Will not what I have offered be accepted I am sure it ought I will venture to say that Why Niece if there be not any such hopes I presume you don t think yourself absolved from the duty due from a child to her parents Yes said my sister I do not doubt but it is Miss Clary s aim if she does not fly to her Lovelace to get her estate into her own hands and go to live at The Grove in that independence upon which she builds all her perverseness And dear heart my little love how will you then blaze away Your mamma Norton your oracle with your poor at your gates mingling so proudly and so meanly with the ragged herd Reflecting by your ostentation upon all the ladies in the county who do not as you do This is known to be your scheme and the poor without doors and Lovelace within with one hand building up a name pulling it down with the other O what a charming scheme is this But let me tell you my pretty little flighty one that your father s living will shall controul your grandfather s dead one and that estate will be disposed of as your fond grandfather would have disposed of it had he lived to see such a change in his favourite In a word Miss it will be kept out of your hands till my father sees you discreet enough to have the management of it or till you can dutifully by law tear it from him Fie Miss Harlowe said my aunt this is not pretty to your sister O Madam let her go on This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss Harlowe She is either commissioned to treat me ill by her envy or by an higher authority to which I must submit As to revoking the estate what hinders if I pleased I know my power but have not the least thought of exerting it Be pleased to let my father know that whatever be the consequence to myself were he to turn me out of doors which I should rather he would do than to be confined and insulted as I am and were I to be reduced to indigence and want I would seek no relief that should be contrary to his will For that matter child said my aunt were you to marry you must do as your husband will have you If that husband be mister Lovelace he will be glad of any opportunity of further embroiling the families And let me tell you Niece if he had the respect for you which he pretends to have he would not throw out defiances as he does He is known to be a very revengeful man and were I you Miss Clary I should be afraid he would wreak upon me that vengeance though I had not offended him which he is continually threatening to pour upon the family mister Lovelace s threatened vengeance is in return for threatened vengeance It is not every body will bear insult as of late I have been forced to bear it O how my sister s face shone with passion But mister Lovelace proceeded I as I have said twenty and twenty times would be quite out of question with me were I to be generously treated My sister said something with great vehemence but only raising my voice to be heard without minding her Pray Madam provokingly interrogated I was he not known to have been as wild a man when he was at first introduced into our family as he now is said to be Yet then the common phrases of wild oats and black oxen and such like were qualifiers and marriage and the wife s discretion were to perform wonders but turning to my sister I find I have said too much O thou wicked reflecter And what made me abhor him think you but the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon you were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to be Proof did you say Bella I thought you had not proof But you know best Was not this very spiteful my dear Now Clary said she would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment I might let you know for a much less sum and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been Well young ladies I am sorry to see passion run so high between you You know Niece to me you had not been confined thus to your apartment could your mother by condescension or your father by authority have been able to move you But how can you expect when there must be a concession on one side that it should be on theirs If my Dolly who has not the hundredth part of your understanding were thus to set herself up in absolute contradiction to my will in a point so material I should not take it well of her indeed I should not I believe not Madam and if Miss Hervey had just such a brother and just such a sister you may look Bella and if both were to aggravate her parents as my brother and sister do mine then perhaps you might use her as I am used and if she hated the man you proposed to her and with as much reason as I do mister Solmes And loved a rake and libertine Miss as you do Lovelace said my sister Then might she continued I not minding her beg to be excused from obeying Yet if she did and would give you the most solemn assurances and security besides that she would never have the man you disliked against your consent I dare say Miss Hervey s father and mother would sit down satisfied and not endeavour to force her inclinations So said my sister with uplifted hands father and mother now come in for their share But if child replied my aunt I knew she loved a rake and suspected that she sought only to gain time in order to wire draw me into a consent I beg pardon Madam for interrupting you but if Miss Hervey could obtain your consent what further would be said True child but she never should Then Madam it would never be That I doubt Niece If you do Madam can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness My dear this sort of intimation would make one but too apprehensive that there is no trusting to yourself when one knows your inclination That apprehension Madam seems to have been conceived before this intimation or the least cause for it was given Why else the disgraceful confinement I have been laid under Let me venture to say that my sufferings seem to be rather owing to a concerted design to intimidate me Bella held up her hands knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition than to a doubt of my conduct for when they were inflicted first I had given no cause of doubt nor should there now be room for any if my discretion might be trusted to My aunt after a little hesitation said But consider my dear what confusion will be perpetuated in your family if you marry this hated Lovelace And let it be considered what misery to me Madam if I marry that hated Solmes Many a young creature has thought she could not love a man with whom she has afterwards been very happy Few women child marry their first loves That may be the reason there are so few happy marriages But there are few first impressions fit to be encouraged I am afraid so too Madam I have a very indifferent opinion of light and first impressions But as I have often said all I wish for is to have leave to live single Indeed you must not Miss Your father and mother will be unhappy till they see you married and out of Lovelace s reach I am told that you propose to condition with him so far are matters gone between you never to have any man if you have not him I know no better way to prevent mischief on all sides I freely own it and there is not if he be out of the question another man in the world I can think favourably of Nevertheless I would give all I have in the world that he were married to some other person indeed I would Bella for all you put on that smile of incredulity May be so Clary but I will smile for all that If he be out of the question repeated my aunt So Miss Clary I see how it is I will go down Miss Harlowe shall I follow you And I will endeavour to persuade your father to let my sister herself come up and a happier event may then result Depend upon it Madam said my sister this will be the case my mother and she will both be in tears but with this different effect my mother will come down softened and cut to the heart but will leave her favourite hardened from the advantages she will think she has over my mother s tenderness why Madam it is for this very reason the girl is not admitted into her presence Thus she ran on as she went downstairs END OF VOL one End of Project Gutenberg s
