H M Robert Printed by Burdick Armitage Milwaukee Page three PREFACE There appears to be much needed a work on parliamentary law based in its general principles upon the rules and practice of Congress and adapted in its details to the use of ordinary societies Such a work should give not only the methods of organizing and conducting the meetings the duties of the officers and the names of the ordinary motions but in addition should state in a systematic manner in reference to each motion its object and effect whether it can be amended or debated if debatable the extent to which it opens the main question to debate the circumstances under which it can be made and what other motions can be made while it is pending This Manual has been prepared with a view to supplying the above information in a condensed and systematic manner each rule being either complete in itself or giving references to every section that in any way qualifies it so that a stranger to the work can refer to any special subject with safety To aid in quickly referring to as many as possible of the rules relating to each motion there is placed immediately before the Index a Table of Rules which enables one without turning a page to find the answers to some two hundred questions The Table of Rules is so arranged as to greatly assist the reader in systematizing his knowledge of parliamentary law The second part is a simple explanation of the common methods of conducting business in ordinary Page four meetings in which the motions are classified according to their uses and those used for a similar purpose compared together This part is expressly intended for that large class of the community who are unfamiliar with parliamentary usages and are unwilling to devote much study to the subject but would be glad with little labor to learn enough to enable them to take part in meetings of deliberative assemblies without fear of being out of order The object of Rules of Order in deliberative assemblies is to assist an assembly to accomplish the work for which it was designed in the best possible manner To do this it is necessary to somewhat restrain the individual as the right of an individual in any community to do what he pleases is incompatible with the best interests of the whole Where there is no law but every man does what is right in his own eyes there is the least of real liberty Experience has shown the importance of definiteness in the law and in this country where customs are so slightly established and the published manuals of parliamentary practice so conflicting no society should attempt to conduct business without having adopted some work upon the subject as the authority in all cases not covered by their own rules It has been well said by one of the greatest of English writers on parliamentary law Whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not is really not of so great importance It is much more material that there should be a rule to go by than what that rule is that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the chairman or captiousness of the members It is very material that order decency and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body H M R December eighteen seventy five Page five TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Page Parliamentary Law nine Plan of the Work twelve Part I

one hundred sixty six Index one hundred sixty nine Page nine INTRODUCTION Parliamentary Law Parliamentary Law refers originally to the customs and rules of conducting business in the English Parliament and thence to the customs and rules of our own legislative assemblies In England these customs and usages of Parliament form a part of the unwritten law of the land and in our own legislative bodies they are of authority in all cases where they do not conflict with existing rules or precedents But as a people we have not the respect which the English have for customs and precedents and are always ready for innovations which we think are improvements and hence changes have been and are being constantly made in the written rules which our legislative bodies have found best to adopt As each house adopts its own rules it results that the two houses of the same legislature do not always agree in their practice even in Congress the order of precedence of motions is not the same in both houses and the Previous Question is admitted in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate As a consequence of this the exact method of conducting business in any particular Page ten legislative body is to be obtained only from the Legislative Manual of that body The vast number of societies political literary scientific benevolent and religious formed all over the land though not legislative are still deliberative in their character and must have some system of conducting business and some rules to govern their proceedings and are necessarily subject to the common parliamentary law where it does not conflict with their own special rules But as their knowledge of parliamentary law has been obtained from the usages in this country rather than from the customs of Parliament it has resulted that these societies have followed the customs of our own legislative bodies and our people have thus been educated under a system of parliamentary law which is peculiar to this country and yet so well established as to supersede the English parliamentary law as the common law of ordinary deliberative assemblies The practice of the National House of Representatives should have the same force in this country as the usages of the House of Commons have in England in determining the general principles of the common parliamentary law of the land but it does not follow that in every matter of detail the rules of Congress can be appealed to as the common law governing every deliberative assembly In these matters of detail the rules of each House of Congress are adapted to their own peculiar wants and are of no force whatever in other assemblies Page eleven But upon all great parliamentary questions such as what motions can be made what is their order of precedence which can be debated what is their effect et cetera the common law of the land is settled by the practice of the U S House of Representatives and not by that of the English Parliament the U S Senate or any other body While in extreme cases there is no difficulty in deciding the question as to whether the practice of Congress determines the common parliamentary law yet between these extremes there must necessarily be a large number of doubtful cases upon which there would be great difference of opinion and to avoid the serious difficulties always arising from a lack of definiteness in the law every deliberative assembly should imitate our legislative bodies in adopting Rules of Order for the conduct of their business Where the practice of Congress differs from that of Parliament upon a material point the common law of this country follows the practice of Congress Thus in every American deliberative assembly having no rules for conducting business the motion to adjourn would be decided to be undebatable as in Congress the English parliamentary law to the contrary notwithstanding so if the Previous Question were negatived the debate upon the subject would continue as in Congress whereas in Parliament the subject would be immediately dismissed so too the Previous Question could be moved when there was before the assembly a motion either to amend to commit or to postpone definitely or indefinitely just as in Congress notwithstanding that according to English parliamentary law the Previous Question could not be moved under such circumstances When the rules of the two Houses of Congress conflict the H R rules are of greater authority than those of the Senate in determining the parliamentary law of the country just as the practice of the House of Commons and not the House of Lords determines the parliamentary law of England For instance though the Senate rules do not allow the motion for the Previous Question and make the motion to postpone indefinitely take precedence of every other subsidiary motion Sec seven except to lie on the table yet the parliamentary law of the land follows the practice of the House of Representatives in recognizing the Previous Question as a legitimate motion and assigning to the very lowest rank the motion to postpone indefinitely But in matters of detail the rules of the House of Representatives are adapted to the peculiar wants of that body and are of no authority in any other assembly No one for instance would accept the following H R rules as common parliamentary law in this country That the chairman in case of disorderly conduct would have the power to order the galleries to be cleared that the ballot could not be used in electing the officers of an assembly that any fifteen members would be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members and make them pay the expenses of the messengers sent after them that all committees not appointed by the Chair would have to be appointed by ballot and if the required number were not elected by a majority vote then a second ballot must be taken in which a plurality of votes would prevail that each member would be limited in debate upon any question to one hour that a day s notice must be given of the introduction of a bill and that before its passage it must be read three times and that without the special order of the assembly it cannot be read twice the same day These examples are sufficient to show the absurdity of the idea that the rules of Congress in all things determine the common parliamentary law Page twelve Plan of the Work This Manual is prepared to partially meet this want in deliberative assemblies that are not legislative in their character It has been made sufficiently complete to answer for the rules of an assembly until they see fit to adopt special rules conflicting with and superseding any of its rules of detail such as the Order of Business Sec forty four et cetera Even in matters of detail the practice of Congress is followed wherever it is not manifestly unsuited to ordinary assemblies and in such cases in Part I there will be found in a foot note the Congressional practice In the important matters referred to above in which the practice of the House of Page thirteen Representatives settles the common parliamentary law of the country this Manual strictly conforms to such practice On account of the party lines being so strictly drawn in Congress no such thing as harmony of action is possible and it has been found best to give a bare majority in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate the power to take final action upon a question without allowing of any discussion In ordinary societies more regard should be paid to the rights of the minority and a two thirds vote be required as in this Manual Sec thirty nine for sustaining an objection to the introduction of a question or for adopting a motion for the Previous Question or for adopting an order closing or limiting debate In this respect the policy of the Pocket Manual is a mean between those of the House and Senate But some societies will doubtless find it advantageous to follow the practice of the H R and others will prefer that of the Senate It requires a majority according to the Pocket Manual to order the yeas and nays which is doubtless best in the majority of assemblies but in all bodies in which the members are responsible to their constituents a much smaller number should have this power In Congress it requires but a one fifth vote and in some bodies a single member can require a vote to be taken by yeas and nays Any society adopting this Manual should make its rules govern them in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the By Laws and Rules of Order of the society Their own rules should include all of the cases where it is desirable to vary from the rules in the Manual and especially should provide for a Quorum Sec forty three and an Order of Business Sec forty four as suggested in these rules The Manual is divided into two distinct parts each complete in itself The table at the end contains a large amount of information in a tabular form for easy reference in the midst of the business of a meeting Part I contains a set of Rules of Order systematically arranged as shown in the Table of Contents Each one of the forty five sections is complete in itself so that no one unfamiliar with the work can be misled in examining any particular subject Cross references are freely used to save repeating Page fourteen from other sections and by this means the reader without using the index is referred to everything in the Rules of Order that has any bearing upon the subject he is investigating The references are by sections and for convenience the numbers of the sections are placed at the top of each page The motions are arranged under the usual classes in their order of rank but in the index under the word motion will be found an alphabetical list of all the motions generally used In reference to each motion there is stated one Of what motions it takes precedence that is what motions may be pending and yet it be in order to make this motion two To what motions it yields that is what motions may be made while this motion is pending three Whether it is debatable or not four Whether it can be amended or not five In case the motion can have no subsidiary motion applied to it the fact is stated see Adjourn Sec eleven for an example the meaning is that the particular motion to adjourn for example cannot be laid on the table postponed committed or amended six The effect of the motion if adopted seven The form of stating the question when peculiar and whatever other information is necessary to enable one to understand the question Part II While the second part covers the entire ground of the first part it does so in a much simpler manner being intended for those who have Page fifteen no acquaintance with the usages of deliberative assemblies It also explains the method of organizing an assembly or society and conducting a meeting The motions are treated on an entirely different plan being classified according to the objects for which they are used and those of each class compared together so that the reader may obtain the best motion for the accomplishment of any given object It omits the complications of parliamentary law and has but few references to the rules of Congress or those in this Manual In order to make it complete in itself it was necessary to repeat a few pages from the first part Definitions In addition to the terms defined above taking precedence of yielding to and applying to see p fourteen there are other terms that are liable to be misunderstood to which attention should he called Meeting and Session In this Manual the term meeting is used to denote an assembling together of the members of a deliberative assembly for any length of time during which there is no separation of the members by adjournment An adjournment to meet again at some other time even the same day terminates the meeting but not the session which latter includes all the adjourned meetings The next meeting in this case would be an adjourned meeting of the same session A meeting of an assembly is terminated by a Page sixteen temporary adjournment a session of an assembly ends with an adjournment without day and may consist of many meetings see Session Sec forty two Previous Question This term is frequently understood to refer to the question previously under consideration As used in this country it is equivalent to a motion to Stop debate and proceed to voting on all the questions before the assembly with certain exceptions where it affects only one motion as to postpone to reconsider and an appeal see Sec twenty for a full explanation Shall the Question be Considered or discussed This question which is put as soon as a subject is brought before an assembly if any member objects to its consideration or discussion or introduction is not intended to merely cut off debate but to prevent the question from coming before the assembly for its action If decided by a two thirds vote in the negative the question is removed from before the assembly immediately see Sec fifteen Whenever the word assembly which is used throughout these rules occurs in forms of motions as in Appeals Sec fourteen it is better to replace it by the special term used to designate the particular assembly as for instance Society or Convention or Board The term Congress when used in this Manual refers to the House of Representatives of the U S Page seventeen Part I Rules of Order Art I Introduction of Business Sec Sec one five one All business should be brought before the assembly by a motion of a member or by the presentation of a communication to the assembly It is not usual however to make a motion to receive the reports of committees Sec thirty or communications to the assembly and in many other cases in the ordinary routine of business the formality of a motion is dispensed with but should any member object a regular motion becomes necessary two Before a member can make a motion or address the assembly upon any question it is necessary that he obtain the floor that is he must rise and address the presiding officer Page eighteen by his title thus mister Chairman Sec thirty four who will then announce the member s name Where two or more rise at the same time the Chairman must decide who is entitled to the floor which he does by announcing that member s name From this decision however an appeal Sec fourteen can he taken though if there is any doubt as to who is entitled to the floor the Chairman can at the first allow the assembly to decide the question by a vote the one getting the largest vote being entitled to the floor The member upon whose motion the subject under discussion was brought before the assembly or in case of a committee s report the one who presented the report is entitled to be recognized as having the floor if he has not already had it during that discussion notwithstanding another member may have first risen and addressed the Chair If the Chairman rise to speak before the floor has been assigned to any one it is the duty of a member who may have previously risen to take his seat See Decorum in Debate Sec thirty six When a member has obtained the floor he cannot be cut off from addressing the assembly nor be interrupted in this speech by a Page nineteen motion to adjourn or for any purpose by either the Chairman or any member except a to have entered on the minutes a motion to reconsider Sec twenty seven b by a call to order Sec fourteen c by an objection to the consideration of the question Sec fifteen or d by a call for the orders of the day Sec thirteen See note to Sec sixty one In such cases the member when he arises and addresses the Chair should state at once for what purpose he rises as for instance that he rises to a point of order A call for an adjournment or for the question by members in their seats is not a motion as no motion can be made without rising and addressing the Chair and being announced by the presiding officer Such calls for the question are themselves breaches of order and do not prevent the speaker from going on if he pleases three Before any subject is open to debate Sec thirty four it is necessary first that a motion he made second that it be seconded see exceptions below and third that it be stated by the presiding officer When the motion is in writing it shall be handed to the Chairman and read before it is debated This does not prevent suggestions of alterations before the question is stated by the Page twenty presiding officer To the contrary much time may be saved by such informal remarks which however must never be allowed to run into debate The member who offers the motion until it has been stated by the presiding officer can modify his motion or even withdraw it entirely after it is stated he can do neither without the consent of the assembly See Sec Sec five and seventeen When the mover modifies his motion the one who seconded it can withdraw his second Exceptions A call for the order of the day a question of order though not an appeal or an objection to the consideration of a question Sec Sec thirteen fourteen fifteen does not have to be seconded and many questions of routine are not seconded or even made the presiding officer merely announcing that if no objection is made such will be considered the action of the assembly four All Principal Motions Sec six Amendments and Instructions to Committees should be in writing if required by the presiding officer Although a question is complicated and capable of being made into several questions no one member without there is a special rule allowing it can insist upon its being divided his resource is to move that the question be divided specifying in his motion how it is to be divided Any one else can move as Page twenty one an amendment to this to divide it differently This Division of a Question is really an amendment Sec twenty three and subject to the same rules Instead of moving a division of the question the same result can be usually attained by moving some other form of an amendment When the question is divided each separate question must be a proper one for the assembly to act upon even if none of the others were adopted Thus a motion to commit with instructions is indivisible because if divided and the motion to commit should fail then the other motion to instruct the committee would be improper as there would be no committee to instruct The forty sixth Rule of the House of Representatives requires the division of a question on the demand of one member provided it comprehends propositions in substance so distinct that one being taken away a substantive proposition shall remain for the decision of the House But this does not allow a division so as to have a vote on separate items or names The one hundred and twenty first Rule expressly provides that on the demand of one fifth of the members a separate vote shall be taken on such items separately and others collectively as shall be specified in the call in the case of a bill making appropriations for internal improvements But this right to divide a question into items extends to no case but the one specified The common parliamentary law allows of no division except when the assembly orders it and in ordinary assemblies this rule will be found to give less trouble than the Congressional one The motion to strike out certain words and insert others is indivisible as it is strictly one proposition five After a question has been stated by the presiding officer it is in the possession of the Page twenty two assembly for debate the mover cannot withdraw or modify it if any one objects except by obtaining leave from the assembly Sec seventeen or by moving an amendment Art II General Classification of Motions Sec Sec six nine six A Principal or Main Question or Motion is a motion made to bring before the assembly for its consideration any particular subject No Principal Motion can be made when any other question is before the assembly It takes precedence of nothing and yields to all Privileged Incidental and Subsidiary Questions Sec Sec seven eight nine seven Subsidiary or Secondary Questions or Motions relate to a Principal Motion and enable the assembly to dispose of it in the most appropriate manner These motions take precedence of the Principal Question and must be decided before the Principal Question can be acted upon They yield to Privileged and Incidental Questions Sec Sec eight nine and are as follows being arranged in their order of precedence among themselves Page twenty three Lie on the Table See Sec nineteen The Previous Question Sec twenty Postpone to a Certain Day Sec twenty one Commit Sec twenty two Amend Sec twenty three Postpone Indefinitely Sec twenty four Any of these motions except Amend can be made when one of a lower order is pending but none can supersede one of a higher order They cannot be applied See Plan of Work and Definitions in Introduction for explanation of some of these technical terms to one another except in the following cases a the Previous Question applies to the motion to Postpone without affecting the principal motion and can if specified be applied to a pending amendment Sec twenty b the motions to Postpone to a certain day and to Commit can be amended and c a motion to Amend the minutes can be laid on the table without carrying the minutes with it Sec nineteen eight Incidental Questions are such as arise out of other questions and consequently take precedence of and are to be decided before the questions which give rise to them They yield to Privileged Questions Sec nine and cannot be amended Excepting an Appeal Page twenty four they are undebatable an Appeal is debatable or not according to circumstances as shown in Sec fourteen They are as follows Appeal or Questions of Order See Sec fourteen Objection to the Consideration of a Question Sec fifteen The Reading of Papers Sec sixteen Leave to Withdraw a Motion Sec seventeen Suspension of the Rules Sec eighteen nine Privileged Questions are such as on account of their importance take precedence over all other questions whatever and on account of this very privilege they are undebatable Sec thirty five excepting when relating to the rights of the assembly or its members as otherwise they could be made use of so as to seriously interrupt business They are as follows being arranged in their order of precedence among themselves To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn See Sec ten Adjourn Sec eleven Questions relating to the Rights and Privileges of the Assembly or any of its Members Sec twelve Call for the Orders of the Day Sec thirteen Page twenty five Art III Motions and their Order of Precedence For a list of all the ordinary motions arranged in their order of precedence see Sec sixty four All the Privileged and Subsidiary ones in this Article are so arranged Sec Sec ten twenty seven Privileged Motions Sec Sec ten thirteen See Sec nine ten To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn This motion takes precedence of all others and is in order even after the assembly has voted to adjourn provided the Chairman has not announced the result of the vote If made when another question is before the assembly it is undebatable Sec thirty five it can be amended by altering the time If made when no other question is before the asembly it stands as any other principal motion and is debatable In ordinary societies it is better to follow the common parliamentary law and permit this question to be introduced as a principal question when it can be debated and suppressed Sec fifty eight fifty nine like other questions In Congress it is never debatable and has entirely superseded the unprivileged and inferior motion to adjourn to a particular time The Form of this motion is When this assembly Page twenty six adjourns it adjourns to meet at such a time eleven To Adjourn This motion when unqualified takes precedence of all others except to fix the time to which to adjourn to which it yields It is not debatable and cannot be amended or have any other subsidiary motion Sec seven applied to it If qualified in any way it loses its privileged character and stands as any other principal motion The motion to adjourn can be repeated if there has been any intervening business though it be simply progress in debate Sec twenty six When a committee is through with any business referred to it and prepared to report instead of adjourning a motion should be made to rise which motion in committee has the same privileges as to adjourn in the assembly Sec thirty two The effect upon Unfinished Business of an adjournment is as follows After six days from the commencement of a second or subsequent session of any Congress all bills resolutions and reports which originated in the House and at the close of the next preceding session remained undetermined shall be resumed and acted on in the same manner as if an adjournment had not taken place Rule one hundred thirty six H R Any ordinary society that meets as seldom as once each year is apt to be composed of as different membership at its successive meetings as any two successive Congresses and only trouble would result from allowing unfinished business to hold over to the next yearly meeting see Session Sec forty two Page twenty seven a When it does not close the session the business interrupted by the adjournment is the first in order after the reading of the minutes at the next meeting and is treated the same as if there had been no adjournment an adjourned meeting being legally the continuation of the meeting of which it is an adjournment b When it closes a session in an assembly which has more than one regular session each year then the unfinished business is taken up at the next succeeding session previous to new business and treated the same as if there had been no adjournment see Sec forty four for its place in the order of business Provided that in a body elected for a definite time as a board of directors elected for one year unfinished business falls to the ground with the expiration of the term for which the board or any portion of them were elected c When the adjournment closes a session in an assembly which does not meet more frequently than once a year or when the assembly is an elective body and this session ends Page twenty eight the term of a portion of the members the adjournment shall put an end to all business unfinished at the close of the session The business can be introduced at the next session the same as if it had never been before the assembly twelve Questions of Privilege Questions relating to the rights and privileges of the assembly or any of its members take precedence of all other questions except the two preceding to which they yield The Previous Question Sec twenty can be applied to these as to all other debatable questions thirteen Orders of the Day A call for the Orders of the Day takes precedence of every other motion excepting to Reconsider Sec twenty seven and the three preceding to which latter three it yields and is not debatable nor can it be amended It does not require to be seconded When one or more subjects have been assigned to a particular day or hour they become the Orders of the Day for that day or hour and they cannot be considered before that time except by a two thirds vote Sec thirty nine And when that day or hour arrives if called up they take precedence of all but the three Page twenty nine preceding questions Sec Sec ten eleven twelve Instead of considering them the assembly may appoint another time for their consideration If not taken up on the day specified the order falls to the ground When the Orders of the Day are taken up it is necessary to take up the separate questions in their exact order the one first assigned to the day or hour taking precedence of one afterwards assigned to the same day or hour A motion to take up a particular part of the Orders of the Day or a certain question is not a privileged motion Any of the subjects when taken up instead of being then considered can be assigned to some other time The Form of this question as put by the Chair when the proper time arrives or on the call of a member is Shall the Order of the Day be taken up or Will the assembly now proceed with the Orders of the Day The Effect of an affirmative vote on a call for the Orders of the Day is to remove the question under consideration from before the assembly the same as if it had been interrupted by an adjournment Sec eleven The Effect of a negative vote is to dispense Page thirty with the orders merely so far as they interfere with the consideration of the question then before the assembly Incidental Motions Sec Sec fourteen eighteen see Sec eight fourteen Appeal Questions of Order A Question of Order takes precedence of the question giving rise to it and must be decided by the presiding officer without debate If a member objects to the decision he says I appeal from the decision of the Chair If the Appeal is seconded the Chairman immediately states the question as follows Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgement of the assembly The word Assembly can be replaced by Society Convention Board et cetera according to the name of the organization This Appeal yields to Privileged Questions Sec nine It cannot be amended it cannot be debated when it relates simply to indecorum Sec thirty six or to transgressions of the rules of speaking or to the priority of business or if it is made while the previous question Sec twenty is pending When debatable no member is allowed to speak but once and whether debatable or not the presiding officer without leaving the Page thirty one Chair can state the reasons upon which he bases his decision The motions to Lie on the Table Sec nineteen or for the Previous Question Sec twenty can be applied to an Appeal when it is debatable and when adopted they affect nothing but the Appeal The vote on an Appeal may also be reconsidered Sec twenty seven An Appeal is not in order when another Appeal is pending It is the duty of the presiding officer to enforce the rules and orders of the assembly without debate or delay It is also the right of every member who notices a breach of a rule to insist upon its enforcement In such cases he shall rise from his seat and say mister Chairman I rise to a point of order The speaker should immediately take his seat and the Chairman requests the member to state his point of order which he does and resumes his seat The Chair decides the point and then if no appeal is taken permits the first member to resume his speech If the member s remarks are decided to be improper and any one objects to his continuing his speech he cannot continue it without a vote of the assembly to that effect Instead of the method just described it is usual when it is simply a case of improper language used in debate for a member to say I call the gentleman to order the Chairman Page thirty two decides whether the speaker is in or out of order and proceeds as before The Chairman can ask the advice of members when he has to decide questions of order but the advice must be given sitting to avoid the appearance of debate or the Chair when unable to decide the question may at once submit it to the assembly The effect of laying an appeal on the table is to sustain at least for the time the decision of the Chair and does not carry to the table the question which gave rise to the question of order fifteen Objection to the Consideration of a Question An objection can be made to any principal motion Sec six but only when it is first introduced before it has been debated It is similar to a question of order Sec fourteen in that it can be made while another member has the floor and does not require a second and as the Chairman can call a member to order so can he put this question if he deems it necessary upon his own responsibility It can not be debated Sec thirty five or have any subsidiary motion Sec seven applied to it When a motion is made and any member objects to its consideration the Chairman shall immediately put the question Will the assembly consider it or Shall the question be considered Page thirty three or discussed If decided in the negative by a two thirds vote Sec thirty nine the whole matter is dismissed for that session Sec forty two otherwise the discussion continues as if this question had never been made The Object of this motion is not to cut off debate for which other motions are provided see Sec thirty seven but to enable the assembly to avoid altogether any question which it may deem irrelevant unprofitable or contentious In Congress the introduction of such questions could be temporarily prevented by a majority vote under the forty first Rule of the House of Representatives which is as follows Where any motion or proposition is made the question Will the House now consider it shall not be put unless it is demanded by some member or is deemed necessary by the Speaker The English use the Previous Question for a similar purpose see note to Sec twenty The question of consideration is seldom raised in Congress but in assemblies with very short sessions where but few questions can or should be considered it seems a necessity that two thirds of the assembly should be able to instantly throw out a question they do not wish to consider The more common form in ordinary societies of putting this question is Shall the question be discussed The form to which preference is given in the rule conforms more to the Congressional one and is less liable to be misunderstood sixteen Reading Papers For the order of precedence see Sec eight Where papers are laid before the assembly every member has a right to have them once read before he can be compelled to vote on them and whenever a member asks for the reading of any such Page thirty four paper evidently for information and not for delay the Chair should direct it to be read if no one objects But a member has not the right to have anything read excepting stated above without getting permission from the assembly seventeen Withdrawal of a Motion For order of precedence see Sec eight When a question is before the assembly and the mover wishes to withdraw or modify it or substitute a different one in its place if no one objects the presiding officer grants the permission if any objection is made it will be necessary to obtain leave to withdraw et cetera on a motion for that purpose This motion cannot be debated or amended When a motion is withdrawn the effect is the same as if it had never been made In Congress a motion may be withdrawn by the mover before a decision or amendment Rule forty H R Nothing would be gained in ordinary societies by varying from the common law as stated above eighteen Suspension of the Rules For the order of precedence see Sec eight This motion is not debatable and cannot be amended nor can any subsidiary Sec seven motion be applied to it nor a vote on it be reconsidered Sec twenty seven Page thirty five nor a motion to suspend the rules for the same purpose be renewed Sec twenty six at the same meeting though it may be renewed after an adjournment though the next meeting be held the same day In Congress it cannot be renewed the same day The rules of the assembly shall not be suspended except for a definite purpose and by a two thirds vote The Form of this motion is to suspend the rules which interfere with et cetera specifying the object of the suspension Subsidiary Motions Sec Sec nineteen twenty four see Sec seven nineteen To Lie on the Table This motion takes precedence of all other Subsidiary Questions Sec seven and yields to any Privileged Sec nine or Incidental Sec eight Question It is not debatable and cannot be amended or have any other subsidiary motion Sec seven applied to it It removes the subject from consideration till the assembly vote to take it from the table The Form of this motion is I move that the question lie on the table or that it be laid on the table or to lay the question Page thirty six on the table When it is desired to take the question up again a motion is made either to take the question from the table or to now consider such and such a question which motion is undebatable and cannot have any subsidiary motion applied to it The Object of this motion is to postpone the subject in such a way that at any time it can be taken up either at the same or some future meeting which could not be accomplished by a motion to postpone either definitely or indefinitely It is also frequently used to suppress a question Sec fifty nine which it does provided a majority vote can never be obtained to take it from the table during that session Sec forty two The Effect of this motion is in general to place on the table everything that adheres to the subject so that if an amendment be ordered to lie on the table the subject which it is proposed to amend goes there with it The following cases are exceptional a An appeal Sec fourteen being laid on the table has the effect of sustaining at least for the time the decision of the Chair and does not carry the original subject to the table b So when a motion to reconsider Sec twenty seven a question is Page thirty seven laid on the table the original question is left where it was before the reconsideration was moved c An amendment to the minutes being laid on the table does not carry the minutes with it Even after the ordering of the Previous Question up to the moment of taking the last vote under it it is in order to lay upon the table the questions still before the assembly twenty The Previous Question The Previous Question is a technical name for this motion conveying a wrong impression of its import as it has nothing to do with the subject previously under consideration To demand the previous question is equivalent in effect to moving That debate now cease and the assembly immediately proceed to vote on the questions before it the exceptions are stated above The English Previous Question is an entirely different one from ours and is used for a different purpose In the English Parliament it is moved by the enemies of a measure who then vote in the negative and thus prevent for the day the consideration of the main question which in this country could be accomplished by objecting to the consideration of the question Sec fifteen if the objection were sustained In our Congress it is moved by the friends of a measure who vote in the affirmative with a view to cutting off debate and immediately bringing the assembly to a vote on the questions before it The rules in the two cases are as different as the objects of the motions It requires only a majority vote for its adoption in the House of Representatives and is not allowed in the United States Senate takes precedence of every debatable question Sec thirty five and yields to Privileged Sec nine and Incidental Sec eight questions and to the motion to Lie on the table Sec nineteen It is not debatable and cannot be amended or have any other Subsidiary Page thirty eight Sec seven motion applied to it It shall require a two thirds vote for its adoption When a member calls for the previous question and the call is seconded the presiding officer must immediately put the question Shall the main question be now put If adopted the member who introduced the pending measure still has the right to close the debate Sec thirty four after which the presiding officer without allowing further discussion shall put to vote the questions before the assembly in their order of precedence till the main question with all its subsidiary and incidental questions is disposed of see the exceptions below If it fails the discussion continues as if this motion had not been made The previous question can be moved on a pending amendment and if adopted debate is closed on the amendment only After the amendment is voted on the main question is again open to debate and amendments In this case the form of the question would be similar to this Shall the amendment be now put to the question Page thirty nine The Object of this motion is to bring the assembly to a vote on the question before it without further debate In ordinary assemblies it is rarely expedient to deprive a large minority of the right of debate and yet two thirds of the members should have the right to close the debate when they think it best It applies to questions of privilege Sec twelve as well as any other debatable questions It is allowable for a member to submit a resolution and at the same time move the previous question thereon To illustrate the Effect of this motion suppose it is adopted when we have before the assembly a the main question b an amendment c a motion to commit d a motion to amend the last motion by giving the committee instructions The previous question being carried the presiding officer would immediately put the question on the last motion d then on the motion to commit c and if this is adopted of course the subject is referred to the committee and disposed of for the present but if it fails the amendment b is put and finally the main question Exceptions If the Previous Question is Page forty carried while a motion to Postpone is pending its effect is only to bring the assembly to a vote on that motion if it is voted not to postpone the subject is again open for debate So if an Appeal Sec fourteen or a motion to Reconsider Sec twenty seven is pending when the Previous Question is ordered it applies only to them and is exhausted by the vote on them An affirmative vote on the motion to Commit Sec twenty two exhausts the Previous Question and if the vote is reconsidered it is divested of the Previous Question For other methods of closing debate see Sec thirty seven and Sec fifty eight twenty one To Postpone to a Certain Day This motion takes precedence of a motion to Commit or Amend or Indefinitely Postpone and yields to any Privileged Sec nine or Incidental Sec eight question and to the motion to Lie on the Table or for the Previous Question It can be amended by altering the time and the Previous Question can be applied to it without affecting any other motions pending It allows of very limited debate Sec thirty five and that must not go into the merits of the subject matter any further than is necessary to enable the Page forty one assembly to judge the propriety of the postponement The Effect of this motion is to postpone the entire subject to the time specified until which time it cannot be taken up except by a two thirds vote Sec thirteen When that time arrives it is entitled to be taken up in preference to every thing except Privileged questions Where several questions are postponed to different times and are not reached then they shall be considered in the order of the times to which they were postponed It is not in order to postpone to a time beyond that session Sec forty two of the assembly except In Congress a motion cannot be postponed to the next session but it is customary in ordinary societies to the day of the next session when it comes up with the unfinished business and consequently takes precedence of new business Sec forty four If it is desired to hold an adjourned meeting to consider a special subject the time to which the assembly shall adjourn Sec ten should be first fixed before making the motion to postpone the subject to that day twenty two To Commit or Recommit as it is called when the subject has been previously committed This motion takes precedence of the motions to Amend or Indefinitely Postpone and yields to any Privileged Sec nine or Incidental Page forty two Sec eight Question and also to the motion to Lie on the Table or for the Previous Question or to Postpone to a certain day It can be amended by altering the committee or giving it instructions It is debatable and opens to debate Sec thirty five the merits of the question it is proposed to commit The Form of this motion is to refer the subject to a committee When different committees are proposed they should he voted in the following order one Committee the whole Sec thirty two two a standing committee and three a special or select committee The number of a committee is usually decided without the formality of a motion as in filling blanks Sec twenty five the Chairman asks of how many shall the committee consist and a question is then put upon each number suggested beginning with the largest The number and kind of the committee need not be decided till after it has been voted to refer the subject to a committee If the committee is a select one and the motion does not include the method of appointing it and there is no standing rule on the subject the Chairman inquires how the committee shall be appointed and this is usually decided informally Sometimes the Chair appoints in which case he names the members of the committee and no vote is taken Page forty three upon them or the committee is nominated either by the Chair or members of the assembly no member nominating more than one except by general consent and then they are all voted upon together except where more nominations are made than the number of the committee when they shall be voted upon singly Where a committee is one for action a committee of arrangements for holding a public meeting for example it should generally be small and no one placed upon it who is not favorable to the proposed action and if any such should be appointed he should ask to be excused But when the committee is for deliberation or investigation it is of the utmost importance that all parties be represented on it so that in committee the fullest discussion may take place and thus diminish the chances of unpleasant debates in the assembly In ordinary assemblies by judicious appointment of committees debates upon delicate and troublesome questions can be mostly confined to the committees which will contain the representative members of all parties See Reports of Committees Sec twenty nine twenty three To Amend This motion takes precedence of nothing but the question which it proposed to amend and yields to any Privileged Page forty four Sec nine Incidental Sec eight or Subsidiary Sec seven Question except to Indefinitely Postpone It can be amended itself but this amendment of an amendment cannot be amended An Amendment may be inconsistent with one already adopted or may directly conflict with the spirit of the original motion but it must have a direct bearing upon the subject of that motion To illustrate a motion for a vote of thanks could be amended by substituting for thanks the word censure or one condemning certain customs could be amended by adding other customs An Amendment may be in any of the following forms a to add or insert certain words or paragraphs b to strike out certain words or paragraphs the question however being stated by the Chair thus Shall these words or paragraphs stand as a part of the resolution and if this is adopted that is the motion to strike out fails it does not preclude either amendment or a motion to strike out and insert c to strike certain words and insert others which motion is indivisible and if lost does not preclude Page forty five another motion to strike out the same words and insert different ones d to substitute another motion on the same subject for the one pending e to divide the question into two or more questions as the mover specifies so as to get a separate vote on any particular point or points see Sec four If a paragraph is inserted it should be perfected by its friends previous to voting on it as when once inserted it cannot be struck out or amended except by adding to it The same is true in regard to words to be inserted in a resolution as when once inserted they cannot be struck out except by a motion to strike out the paragraph or such a portion of it as shall make the question an entirely different one from that of inserting the particular words The principle involved is that when the assembly has voted that certain words shall form a part of a resolution it is not in order to make another motion which involves exactly the same question as the one they have decided The only way to bring it up again is to move a Reconsideration Sec twenty seven of the vote by which the words were inserted In stating the question on an Amendment the Chairman should read one the passage to be amended two the words to be struck out if any three the words to be inserted if any and four the whole passage as it will stand if Page forty six the amendment is adopted For amending reports of committees and propositions containing several paragraphs see Sec forty four The numbers prefixed to paragraphs are only marginal indications and should be corrected if necessary by the clerk without any motion to amend The following motions cannot be amended To Adjourn when unqualified See Sec eleven For the Orders of the Day Sec twelve All Incidental Questions Sec eight To Lie on the Table Sec nineteen For the Previous Question Sec twenty An Amendment of an Amendment Sec twenty three To Postpone Indefinitely Sec twenty four Reconsider Sec twenty seven An Amendment to Rules of Order By Laws or a Constitution shall require previous notice and a two thirds vote for its adoption see Sec forty five twenty four To Postpone Indefinitely This motion takes precedence of nothing except the Principal Question Sec six and yields to any Privileged Sec nine Incidental Sec eight or Subsidiary Sec seven Motion except to Amend It cannot be amended it opens to debate the entire question which it is proposed to postpone Its effect is to entirely remove the question from before the assembly for that session Sec forty two Page forty seven The Previous Question Sec twenty if ordered when this motion is pending applies only to it without affecting the main question Miscellaneous Motions Sec Sec twenty five twenty seven twenty five Filling Blanks In filling blanks the largest sum and the longest time proposed shall be first put to the question Sometimes the most convenient way of amending a resolution is to create a blank by moving to strike out a certain number or time It is customary for any number of members to propose numbers to fill a blank without the formality of a motion these different propositions not being regarded in the light of amendments Nominations are treated in a similar manner so that the second nomination instead of being an amendment to the first is an independent motion which if the first fails is to be immediately voted upon Any number of nominations can be made the Chairman announcing each name as he hears it and they Page forty eight should be voted upon in the order announced until one receives a vote sufficient for an election twenty six Renewal of a Motion When any Principal Question Sec six or Amendment has been once acted upon by the assembly it cannot be taken up again at the same session Sec forty two except by a motion to Reconsider Sec twenty seven The motion to Adjourn can be renewed if there has been progress in debate or any business transacted As a general rule the introduction of any motion that alters the state of affairs makes it admissible to renew any Privileged or Incidental motion excepting Suspension of the Rules as provided in Sec eighteen or Subsidiary motion excepting an amendment as in such a case the real question before the assembly is a different one To illustrate a motion that a question lie on the table having failed suppose afterwards it be moved to refer the matter to a committee it is now in order to move again that the subject lie on the table but such a motion would not be in order if it were not made till after the failure of the motion to commit as Page forty nine the question then resumes its previous condition When a subject has been referred to a committee which reports at the same meeting the matter stands before the assembly as if it had been introduced for the first time A motion which has been withdrawn has not been acted upon and therefore can be renewed twenty seven Reconsider It is in order at any time even when another member has the floor or while the assembly is voting on the motion to Adjourn during the day In Congress any one can move a reconsideration excepting where the vote is taken by yeas and nays Sec thirty eight when the rule above applies The motion can be made on the same or succeeding day on which a motion has been acted upon to move to Reconsider the vote and have such motion entered on the record but it cannot be considered while another question is before the assembly It must be made excepting when the vote is by ballot by a member who voted with the prevailing side for instance in case a motion fails to pass for lack of a two thirds vote a reconsideration must be moved by one who voted against the motion A motion to reconsider the vote on a Subsidiary Sec seven motion takes precedence of the main question It yields to Privileged Sec nine Page fifty questions except for the Orders of the Day and Incidental Sec eight questions This motion can be applied It is not the practice to reconsider an affirmative vote on the motion to lie on the table as the same result can be more easily reached by the motion to take from the table For a similar reason an affirmative vote on the motion to take from the table cannot be reconsidered to every question except to Adjourn and to Suspend the Rules It is debatable or not just as the question to be reconsidered is debatable or undebatable Sec thirty five when debatable it opens up for discussion the entire subject to be reconsidered and can have the Previous question Sec twenty applied to it without affecting any thing but the motion to reconsider It can be laid on the table Sec nineteen and in such cases the last motion cannot be reconsidered it is quite common and allowable to combine these two motions though they must be voted on separately in this case the reconsideration like any other question can be taken from the table but possesses no privilege In Congress this is a common method used by the friends of a measure to prevent its reconsideration The motion to reconsider being laid on the table does not carry with it the pending measure If an amendment to a motion has been either adopted or rejected and then a vote taken on the motion as amended it is not in order to reconsider the vote on the amendment until Page fifty one after the vote on the original motion has been reconsidered If anything which the assembly cannot reverse has been done as the result a vote then that vote cannot be reconsidered The Effect of making this motion is to suspend all action that the original motion would have required until the reconsideration is acted upon but if it is not called up its effect terminates with the session Sec forty two provided In Congress the effect always terminates with the session and it cannot be called up by any one but the mover until the expiration of the time during which it is in order to move a reconsideration that in an assembly having regular meetings as often as monthly if no adjourned meeting upon another day is held of the one at which the reconsideration was moved its effect shall not terminate till the close of the next succeeding session See note at end of this section While this motion is so highly privileged as far as relates to having it entered on the minutes yet the reconsideration of another question cannot be made to interfere with the discussion of a question before the assembly but as soon as that subject is disposed of the reconsideration if called up takes precedence of every thing except the motions to adjourn and to fix the time to which to adjourn As long as its effect lasts as shown above any one can call up the motion to reconsider and have it acted upon excepting that when its effect extends beyond the meeting at which the motion was made no one but the mover can call it up at that meeting But the reconsideration of an Incidental Sec eight or Subsidiary Sec seven Page fifty two motion shall be immediately acted upon as otherwise it would prevent action on the main question The Effect of the adoption of this motion is to place before the assembly the original question in the exact position it occupied before it was voted upon consequently no one can debate the question reconsidered who had previously exhausted his right of debate Sec thirty four on that question his only resource is to discuss the question while the motion to reconsider is before the assembly When a vote taken under the operation of the previous question Sec twenty is reconsidered the question is then divested of the previous question and is open to debate and amendment provided the previous question had been exhausted see latter part of Sec twenty by votes taken on all the questions covered by it before the motion to reconsider was made A reconsideration requires only a majority vote regardless of the vote necessary to adopt the motion reconsidered For reconsidering in committee see Sec twenty eight Note On Reconsider In the English Parliament a vote once taken cannot be reconsidered but in our Congress it is allowed to move a reconsideration of the vote on the same or succeeding day and after the close of the last day for making the motion any one can call up the motion to reconsider so that this motion cannot delay action more than two days and the effect Page fifty three of the motion if not acted upon terminates with the session There seems to be no reason or good precedent for permitting merely two persons by moving a reconsideration to suspend for any length of time all action under resolutions adopted by the assembly and yet where the delay is very short the advantages of reconsideration overbalance the evils Where a permanent society has meetings weekly or monthly and usually only a small proportion of the society is present it seems best to allow a reconsideration to hold over to another meeting so that the society may have notice of what action is about to be taken To prevent the motion being used to defeat a measure that cannot be deferred till the next regular meeting it is provided that in case the society adjourn to meet the next day for instance then the reconsideration will not hold over beyond that session this allows sufficient delay to notify the society while if the question is one requiring immediate action the delay cannot extend beyond the day to which they adjourn Where the meetings are only quarterly or annual the society should be properly represented at each meeting and their best interests are subserved by following the practice of Congress and letting the effect of the reconsideration terminate with the session Page fifty four Art IV Committees and Informal Action Sec Sec twenty eight thirty three twenty eight Committees It is usual in deliberative assemblies to have all preliminary work in the preparation of matter for their action done by means of committees These may be either standing committees which are appointed for the session Sec forty two or for some definite time as one year or select committees appointed for a special purpose or a committee of the whole Sec thirty two consisting of the entire assembly For method of appointing committees of the whole see Sec thirty two other committees see commit Sec twenty two The first person named on a committee is chairman and should act as such without the committee should see fit to elect another chairman which they are competent to do The clerk should furnish him or some other member of the committee with notice of the appointment of the committee giving the names Page fifty five of the members the matter referred to them and such instructions as the assembly have decided upon The chairman shall call the committee together and if there is a quorum a majority of the committee see Sec forty three he should read or have read the entire resolutions referred to them he should then read each paragraph and pause for amendments to be offered when the amendments to that paragraph are voted on he proceeds to the next only taking votes on amendments as the committee cannot vote on the adoption of matter referred to them by the assembly If the committee originate the resolutions they vote in the same way on amendments to each paragraph of the draft of the resolutions which draft has been previously prepared by one of their members or a sub committee they do not vote on the separate paragraphs but having completed the amendments they vote on the adoption of the entire report When there is a preamble it is considered last If the report originates with the committee all amendments are to be incorporated in the report but if the resolutions were referred the committee cannot alter Page fifty six the text but must submit the original paper intact with their amendments which may be in the form of a substitute Sec twenty three written on a separate sheet A committee is a miniature assembly that must meet together in order to transact business and usually one of its members should be appointed its clerk Whatever is not agreed to by the majority of the members present at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of a majority of the members of the committee shall be present cannot form a part of its report The minority may be permitted to submit their views in writing also either together or each member separately but their reports can only be acted upon by voting to substitute one of them for the report of the committee The rules of the assembly as far as possible shall apply in committee but a reconsideration Sec twenty seven of a vote shall be allowed regardless of the time elapsed only when every member who voted with the majority is present when the reconsideration is moved Both the English common parliamentary law and the rules of Congress prohibit the reconsideration of a vote by a committee but the strict enforcement of this rule in ordinary committees would interfere with rather than assist the transaction of business The rule given above seems more just and more in accordance with the practice of ordinary committees who usually reconsider at pleasure No improper advantage can be taken of the privilege as long as every member who voted with the majority must be present when the reconsideration is moved A committee except a committee Page fifty seven of the whole Sec thirty two may appoint a sub committee When through with the business assigned them a motion is made for the committee to rise which is equivalent to the motion to adjourn and that the chairman or some member who is more familiar with the subject make its report to the assembly The committee ceases to exist as soon as the assembly receives the report Sec thirty The committee has no power to punish its members for disorderly conduct its resource being to report the facts to the assembly No allusion can be made in the assembly to what has occurred in committee except it be by a report of the committee or by general consent It is the duty of a committee to meet on the call of any two its of members if the chairman be absent or decline to appoint such meeting When a committee adjourns without appointing a time for the next meeting it is called together in the same way as at its first meeting When a committee adjourns to meet at another time it is not necessary though Page fifty eight usually advisable that absent members should be notified of the adjourned meeting twenty nine Forms of Reports of Committees The form of a report is usually similar to the following A standing committee reports thus The committee on insert name of committee respectfully report or beg leave to report or beg leave to submit the following report et cetera letting the report follow A select or special committee reports as follows The committee to which was referred state the matter referred having considered the same respectfully report et cetera Or for The committee is sometimes written Your committee or The undersigned a committee When a minority report is submitted it should be in this form the majority reporting as above The undersigned a minority of a committee to which was referred et cetera The majority report is the report of the committee and should never be made out as the report of the majority All reports conclude with All of which is Page fifty nine respectfully submitted They are sometimes signed only by the chairman of the committee but if the matter is of much importance it is better that the report be signed by every member who concurs The report is not usually dated or addressed but can he headed as for example Report of the Finance Committee of the Y P A on Renting a Hall thirty Reception of Reports When the report of a committee is to be made the chairman or member appointed to make the report informs the assembly that the committee to whom was referred such a subject or paper has directed him to make a report thereon or report it with or without amendment as the case may be either he or any other member may move that it be received A very common error is after a report has been read to move that it be received whereas the fact that it has been read shows that it has been already received by the assembly Another mistake less common but dangerous is to vote that the report be accepted which is equivalent to adopting it see Sec thirty one when the intention is only to have the report up for consideration and afterwards move its adoption Still a third error is to move that the report be adopted and the committee discharged when the committee have reported in full and their report been received so that the committee has already ceased to exist If the committee however have made but a partial report or report progress then it is in order to move that the committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject now or at some other specified time Page sixty Usually the formality of a vote on the reception of a report of a committee is dispensed with the time being settled by general consent Should any one object a formal motion becomes necessary When the time arrives for the assembly to receive the report the chairman of the committee reads it in his place and then delivers it to the clerk when it lies on the table till the assembly sees fit to consider it If the report consists of a paper with amendments the chairman of the committee reads the amendments with the coherence in the paper explaining the alterations and reasons of the committee for the amendments till he has gone through the whole If the report is very long it is not usually read until the assembly is ready to consider it see Sec Sec thirty one and forty four When the report has been received whether it has been read or not the committee is thereby dissolved and can act no more without it is revived by a vote to recommit If the report is recommitted all the parts of the report that have not been agreed to by the assembly are ignored by the committee as if the report had never been made Page sixty one thirty one Adoption of Reports When the assembly is to consider a report a motion should be made to adopt accept or agree to the report all of which when carried have the same effect namely to make the doings of the committee become the acts of the assembly the same as if done by the assembly without the intervention of a committee If the report contains merely a statement of opinion or facts the motion should be to accept the report if it also concludes with resolutions or certain propositions the motion should be to agree to the resolutions or to adopt the propositions After the above motion is made the matter stands before the assembly exactly the same as if there had been no committee and the subject had been introduced by the motion of the member who made the report See Sec thirty four for his privileges in debate and Sec forty four for the method of treating a report containing several propositions when being considered by the assembly thirty two Committee of the Whole When an assembly has to consider a subject which it does not wish to refer to a committee and yet where the subject matter is not well digested Page sixty two and put into proper form for its definite action or when for any other reason it is desirable for the assembly to consider a subject with all the freedom of an ordinary committee it is the practice to refer the matter to the Committee of the Whole In large assemblies such as the U S House of Representatives where a member can speak to any question but once the committee of the whole seems almost a necessity as it allows the freest discussion of a subject while at any time it can rise and thus bring into force the strict rules of the assembly If it is desired to consider the question at once the motion is made That the assembly do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole to take under consideration et cetera specifying the subject This is really a motion to commit see Sec twenty two for its order of precedence et cetera If adopted the Chairman immediately calls another member to the chair and takes his place as a member of the committee The committee is under the rules of the assembly excepting as stated hereafter in this section The only motions in order are to amend and adopt and that the committee rise and report as it cannot adjourn nor can it order the yeas and nays Sec thirty eight The only way to close or limit debate in committee of the whole is for the assembly to vote that the debate in committee shall cease at a certain time or that after a certain time no debate shall be allowed excepting on new amendments and then only one speech in favor of Page sixty three and one against it of say five minutes each or in some other way regulate the time for debate In Congress no motion to limit debate in committee of the whole is in order till after the subject has been already considered in committee of the whole As no subject would probably be considered more than once in committee of the whole in an ordinary society the enforcement of this rule would practically prevent such a society from putting any limit to debate in the committee The rule as given above allows the society whenever resolving itself into committee of the whole to impose upon the debate in the committee such restrictions as are allowed in Congress after the subject has already been considered in committee of the whole If no limit is prescribed any member may speak as often as he can get the floor and as long each time as allowed in debate in the assembly provided no one wishes the floor who has not spoken on that particular question Debate having been closed at a particular time by order of the assembly it is not competent for the committee even by unanimous consent to extend the time The committee cannot refer the subject to another committee Like other committees Sec twenty eight it cannot alter the text of any resolution referred to it but if the resolution originated in the committee then all the amendments are incorporated in it When it is through with the consideration of the subject referred to it or if it wishes to adjourn or to have the assembly limit debate a motion is made that the committee rise and report et cetera specifying the result of its proceedings Page sixty four This motion to rise is equivalent to the motion to adjourn in the assembly and is always in order except when another member has the floor and is undebatable As soon as this motion is adopted the presiding officer takes the chair and the chairman of the committee having resumed his place in the assembly arises and informs him that the committee have gone through the business referred to them and that he is ready to make the report when the assembly is ready to receive it or he will make such other report as will suit the case The clerk does not record the proceedings of the committee on the minutes but should keep a memorandum of the proceedings for the use of the committee In large assemblies the clerk vacates his chair which is occupied by the chairman of the committee and the assistant clerk acts as clerk of the committee Should the committee get disorderly and the chairman be unable to preserve order the presiding officer can take the chair and declare the committee dissolved The quorum of the committee of the whole is the same as that of the assembly Sec forty three If the committee finds itself without a quorum it can only rise and report the fact to the assembly which in such a case would have to adjourn Page sixty five thirty three Informal Consideration of a Question or acting as if in committee of the whole It has become customary in many assemblies instead of going into committee of the whole to consider the question informally and afterwards to act formally In a small assembly there is no objection to this In the U S Senate all bills joint resolutions and treaties upon their second reading are considered as if the Senate were in committee of the whole which is equivalent to considering them informally U S Senate Rules twenty eight and thirty eight In large assemblies it is better to follow the practice of the House of Representatives and go into committee of the whole While acting informally upon any resolutions the assembly can only amend and adopt them and without further motion the Chairman announces that the assembly acting informally or as in committee of the whole has had such a subject under consideration and has made certain amendments which he will report The subject comes before the assembly then as if reported by a committee While acting informally the Chairman retains his seat as it is not necessary to move that the committee rise but at any time the adoption of such motions as to adjourn the previous question to commit or any motion except to amend or adopt puts an end to the informal consideration as for example the motion to commit is equivalent to the following motions when in committee of the whole one That the committee rise two that the committee of Page sixty six the whole be discharged from the further consideration of the subject and three that it be referred to a committee While acting informally every member can speak as many times as he pleases and as long each time as permitted in the assembly Sec thirty four and the informal action may be rejected or altered by the assembly While the clerk should keep a memorandum of the informal proceedings it should not be entered on the minutes being only for temporary use The Chairman s report to the assembly of the informal action should be entered on the minutes as it belongs to the assembly s proceedings Art V Debate and Decorum Sec Sec thirty four thirty seven thirty four Debate In connection with this section read Sec Sec one five When a motion is made and seconded it shall be stated by the Chairman before being debated see Sec three When any member is about to speak in debate he shall rise and respectfully address himself to mister Chairman mister President is used where that is the designated title of the presiding Page sixty seven officer Brother Moderator is more common in religious meetings The Chairman shall then announce his name see Sec two By parliamentary courtesy the member upon whose motion a subject is brought before the assembly is first entitled to the floor even though another member has risen first and addressed the Chair in case of a report of a committee it is the member who presents the report and this member is also entitled to close the debate but not until every member choosing to speak has spoken This right to make the last speech upon the question is not taken away by the Previous Question Sec twenty being ordered or in any other way With this exception no member shall speak more than twice to the same question only once to a question of order Sec fourteen nor longer than ten minutes at one time without leave of the assembly and the question upon granting the leave shall be decided by a majority vote without debate The limit in time should vary to suit circumstances but the limit of two speeches of ten minutes each will usually answer in ordinary assemblies and it can be increased when desirable by a majority vote as shown above or diminished as shown in Sec thirty seven In the U S House of Representatives no member can speak more than once to the same question nor longer than one hour The fourth rule of the Senate is as follows No Senator shall speak more than twice in any one debate on the same day without leave of the Senate which question shall be decided without debate If no rule is adopted each member can speak but once to the same question If greater freedom is desired the Page sixty eight proper course is to refer the subject to the committee of the whole Sec thirty two or to consider it informally Sec thirty three For limiting or closing the debate see Sec thirty seven No member can speak the second time to a question until every member choosing to speak has spoken But an amendment or any other motion being offered makes the real question before the assembly a different one and in regard to the right to debate is treated as a new question Merely asking a question or making a suggestion is not considered as speaking thirty five Undebatable Questions The following questions shall be decided without debate all others being debatable see note at end of this section To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn when a privileged question Sec ten To Adjourn Sec eleven or in committee to rise which is used instead of to adjourn For the Orders of the Day Sec thirteen and questions relating to the priority of business An Appeal Sec fourteen when made while the Previous Question is pending or when simply relating to indecorum or transgressions of the rules of speaking or to the priority of business Objection to the Consideration of a Question Sec fifteen Page sixty nine Questions relating to Reading of Papers Sec sixteen or Withdrawing a Motion Sec seventeen or Suspending the Rules Sec eighteen or extending the limits of debate Sec thirty four or limiting or closing debate or granting leave to continue his speech to one who has been guilty of indecorum in debate Sec thirty six To Lie on the Table or to Take from the Table Sec nineteen The Previous Question Sec twenty To Reconsider Sec twenty six a question which is itself undebatable The motion to Postpone to a certain time Sec twenty one allows of but very limited debate which must be confined to the propriety of the postponement but to Reconsider a debatable question Sec twenty six or to Commit Sec twenty two or Indefinitely Postpone Sec twenty four opens the main question Sec six to debate To Amend Sec twenty three opens the main question to debate only so far as it is necessarily involved in the amendment The distinction between debate and making suggestions or asking a question should always be kept in view and when the latter will assist the assembly in determining the question is allowed to a limited extent even though the question before the assembly is undebatable Note On Undebatable Questions The English common parliamentary law makes all motions Page seventy debatable without there is a rule adopted limiting debate Cushing s Manual Sec three hundred thirty but every assembly is obliged to restrict debate upon certain motions The restrictions to debate prescribed in this section conform to the practice of Congress where however it is very common to allow of brief remarks upon the most undebatable questions sometimes five or six members speaking this of course is allowed only when no one objects By examining the above list it will be found that while free debate is allowed upon every principal question Sec six it is permitted or prohibited upon other questions in accordance with the following principles a Highly privileged questions as a rule should not be debated as in that case they could be used to prevent the assembly from coming to a vote on the main question for instance if the motion to adjourn were debatable it could be used see Sec eleven in a way to greatly hinder business High privilege is as a rule incompatible with the right of debate on the privileged question b A motion that has the effect to suppress a question before the assembly so that it cannot again be taken up that session Sec forty two allows of free debate And a subsidiary motion Sec seven except commit which see below is debatable to just the extent that it interferes with the right of the assembly to take up the original question at its pleasure Illustrations To Indefinitely Postpone Sec twenty four a question places it out of the power of the assembly to again take it up during that session and consequently this motion allows of free debate even involving the whole merits of the original question To Postpone to a certain time prevents the assembly taking up the question till the specified time and therefore allows of limited debate upon the propriety of the postponement To Lie on the Table leaves the question so Page seventy one that the assembly can at any time consider it and therefore should not be and is not debatable To Commit would not be very debatable according to this rule but it is an exception because it is often important that the committee should know the views of the assembly on the question and it therefore is not only debatable but opens to debate the whole question which it is proposed to refer to the committee thirty six Decorum in Debate see Sec two In debate a member must confine himself to the question before the assembly and avoid personalities He cannot reflect upon any act of the assembly unless he intends to conclude his remarks with a motion to rescind such action or else while debating such motion In referring to another member he should as much as possible avoid using his name rather referring to him as the member who spoke last or in some other way describing him The officers of the assembly should always be referred to by their official titles It is not allowable to arraign the motives of a member but the nature or consequences of a measure may be condemned in strong terms It is not the man but the measure that is the subject of debate If at any time the Chairman rises to state a point of order or give information or otherwise speak within his privilege see Page seventy two Sec forty the member speaking must take his seat till the Chairman has been first heard When called to order the member must sit down until the question of order is decided If his remarks are decided to be improper he cannot proceed if any one objects without the leave of the assembly expressed by a vote upon which question there shall be no debate Disorderly words should be taken down by the member who objects to them or by the clerk and then read to the member if he denies them the assembly shall decide by a vote whether they are his words or not If a member cannot justify the words he used and will not suitably apologize for using them it is the duty of the assembly to act in the case requiring both members to withdraw If both are personally interested See page one hundred sixty one till it has decided its course it being a general rule that no member should he present in the assembly when any matter relating to himself is under debate If any business has taken place since the member spoke it is too late to take notice of any disorderly words he used thirty seven Closing Debate Debate upon a question is not closed by the Chairman rising to put the question as until both the affirmative Page seventy three and negative are put a member can claim the floor and re open debate see Sec thirty eight Debate can be closed by the following motions which are undebatable Sec thirty five and except to Lie on the Table shall require a two thirds In Congress where each speaker can occupy the floor one hour any of these motions to cut off debate can be adopted by a mere majority In ordinary societies harmony is so essential that a two thirds vote should be required to force the assembly to a final vote without allowing free debate vote for their adoption Sec thirty nine a An objection to the consideration of a question only allowable when the question is first introduced Sec fifteen which if sustained not only stops debate but also throws the subject out of the assembly for that session Sec forty two which latter effect is the one for which it was designed b To lie on the table Sec nineteen which if adopted carries the question to the table from which it cannot be taken without a majority favors such action c The previous question Sec twenty which has the effect of requiring all the questions before the assembly excepting as limited in Sec twenty to be put to vote at once without further debate It may be applied merely to an amendment or to an amendment of an amendment Page seventy four d For the assembly to adopt an order one limiting debate upon a special subject either as to the number or length of the speeches or two closing debate upon the subject at a stated time when all pending questions shall be put to vote without further debate Either of these two measures may be applied only to a pending amendment or an amendment thereto and when this is voted upon the original question is still open to debate and amendment Art VI Vote Sec Sec thirty eight thirty nine thirty eight Voting Whenever from the nature of the question it permits of no modification or debate the Chairman immediately puts it to vote if the question is debatable when the Chairman thinks the debate has been brought to a close he should inquire if the assembly is ready for the question and if no one rises he puts the question to vote There are various forms for putting the question in use in different parts of the country The rule in Congress in Page seventy five the House of Representatives is as follows Questions shall be distinctly put in this form to wit As many as are of the opinion that as the question may be say Aye and after the affirmative voice is expressed As many as are of the contrary opinion say No The following form is very common It has been moved and seconded that here state the question As many as are favor of the motion say Aye those opposed No Or if the motion is for the adoption of a certain resolution after it has been read the Chairman can say You have heard the resolution read those in favor of its adoption will hold up the right hand those opposed will manifest it by the same sign These examples are sufficient to show the usual methods of putting a question the affirmative being always put first When a vote is taken the Chairman should always announce the result in the following form The motion is carried the resolution is adopted or The ayes have it the resolution is adopted If when he announces a vote any member rises and states that he doubts the vote or calls for a division the Page seventy six Chairman shall say A division is called for those in favor of the motion will rise After counting these and announcing the number he shall say Those opposed will rise will count these announce the number and declare the result that is whether the motion is carried or lost Instead of counting the vote himself he can appoint tellers to make the count and report to him When tellers are appointed they should be selected from both sides of the question A member has the right to change his vote when not made by ballot before the decision of the question has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the Chair but not afterwards Until the negative is put it is in order for any member in the same manner as if the voting had not been commenced to rise and speak make motions for amendment or otherwise and thus renew the debate and this whether the member was in the assembly room or not when the question was put and the vote partly taken In such case the question is in the same condition as if it had never been put No one can vote on a question affecting Page seventy seven himself but if more than one name is included in the resolution though a sense of delicacy would prevent this right being exercised excepting when it would change the vote all are entitled to vote for if this were not so a minority could control an assembly by including the names of a sufficient number in a motion say for preferring charges against them and suspend them or even expel them from the assembly When there is a tie vote the motion fails without the Chairman gives his vote for the affirmative which in such case he can do Where his vote will make a tie he can cast it and thus defeat the measure Another form of voting is by ballot This method is only adopted when required by the constitution or by laws of the assembly or when the assembly has ordered the vote to be so taken The Chairman in such cases appoints at least two tellers who distribute slips of paper upon which each member including the Chairman Should the Chairman neglect to vote before the ballots are counted he cannot then vote without the permission of the assembly writes his vote the votes are then collected counted by the tellers and the result reported to the Chairman who announces Page seventy eight it to the assembly The Chairman announces the result of the vote in case of an election to office in a manner similar to the following The whole number of votes cast is the number necessary for an election is mister A received mister B mister C mister B having received the required number is elected Where there is only one candidate for an office and the constitution requires the vote to be by ballot it is common to authorize the clerk to cast the vote of the assembly for such and such a person if any one objects however it is necessary to ballot in the usual way So when a motion is made to make a vote unanimous it fails if any one objects In counting the ballots all blanks are ignored The assembly can by a majority vote order that the vote on any question be taken by Yeas and Nays Taking a vote by yeas and nays which has the effect to place on the record how each member votes is peculiar to this country and while it consumes a great deal of time is rarely useful in ordinary societies By the Constitution one fifth of the members present can in either house of Congress order a vote to be taken by yeas and nays and to avoid some of the resulting inconveniences various rules and customs have been established which are ignored in this Manual as according to it the yeas and nays can only be ordered by a majority which prevents its being made use of to hinder business In representative bodies it is very useful especially where the proceedings are published as it enables the people to know how their representatives voted on important measures In some small bodies a vote on a resolution must be taken by yeas and nays upon the demand of a single member In this method of voting the Chairman states both sides of the question Page seventy nine at once the clerk calls the roll and each member as his name is called rises and answers yes or no and the clerk notes his answer Upon the completion of the roll call the clerk reads over the names of those who answered the affirmative and afterwards those in the negative that mistakes may be corrected he then gives the number voting on each side to the Chairman who announces the result An entry must be made in the minutes of the names of all voting in the affirmative and also of those in the negative The form of putting a question upon which the vote has been ordered to be taken by yeas and nays is similar to the following As many as are in favor of the adoption of these resolutions will when their names are called answer yes or aye those opposed will answer no The Chairman will then direct the clerk to call the roll The negative being put at the same time as the affirmative it is too late after the question is put to renew the Page eighty debate After the commencement of the roll call it is too late to ask to be excused from voting The yeas and nays cannot be ordered in committee of the whole Sec thirty two thirty nine Motions Requiring More than a Majority Vote Where no rule to the contrary is adopted a majority vote of the assembly when a quorum Sec forty three is present is sufficient for the adoption of any motion except for the suspension of a rule which can only be done by general consent or unanimously Congress requires a two thirds vote for only the motions to suspend and to amend the Rules to take up business out of its proper order and to make a special order see note to Sec thirty seven The following motions shall require a two thirds vote for their adoption as the right of discussion and the right to have the rules enforced should not be abridged by a mere majority An Objection to the Consideration of a Question Sec fifteen To Take up a Question out of its proper order Sec thirteen To Suspend the Rules Sec eighteen The Previous Question Sec twenty To Close or Limit Debate Sec thirty seven To Amend the Rules requires previous notice also Sec forty three To Make a special order Sec thirteen Page eighty one Art VII The Officers and the Minutes Sec Sec forty forty one forty Chairman In connection with this section read Sec forty four and also Sec forty forty one or President The presiding officer when no special title has been assigned him is ordinarily called the Chairman or in religious assemblies more usually the Moderator frequently the constitution of the assembly prescribes for him a title such as President His duties are generally as follows To open the session at the time at which the assembly is to meet by taking the chair and calling the members to order to announce the business before the assembly in the order in which it is to be acted upon Sec forty four to state and to put to vote Sec thirty eight all questions which are regularly moved or necessarily arise in the course of proceedings and to announce the result of the vote To restrain the members when engaged in Page eighty two debate within the rules of order to enforce on all occasions the observance of order and decorum Sec thirty six among the members deciding all questions of order subject to an appeal to the assembly by any two members Sec fourteen and to inform the assembly when necessary or when referred to for the purpose on a point of order or practice To authenticate by his signature when necessary all the acts orders and proceedings of the assembly and in general to represent and stand for the assembly declaring its will and in all things obeying its commands The chairman shall rise It is not customary for the chairman to rise while putting questions in very small bodies such as committees boards of trustees c to put a question to vote but may state it sitting he shall also rise from his seat without calling any one to the chair when speaking to a question of order which he can do in preference to other members In referring to himself he should always use his official title thus The Chair decides so and so not I decide c When a member has the floor the chairman cannot interrupt him as long as he does not transgress Page eighty three any of the rules of the assembly excepting as provided in Sec two He is entitled to vote when the vote is by ballot But this right is lost if he does not use it before the tellers have commenced to count the ballots The assembly can give leave to the chairman to vote under such circumstances and in all other cases where the vote would change the result Thus in a case where two thirds vote is necessary and his vote thrown with the minority would prevent the adoption of the question he can cast his vote so also he can vote with the minority when it will produce a tie vote and thus cause the motion to fail Whenever a motion is made referring especially to the chairman the maker of the motion should put it to vote The chairman can if it is necessary to vacate the chair appoint a chairman pro tem When there are Vice Presidents then the first one on the list that is present is by virtue of his office chairman during the absence of the President and should always be called to the chair when the President temporarily vacates it but the first adjournment puts an end to the appointment which the assembly can terminate before if it pleases by electing another chairman But the regular chairman knowing that he will be absent from a future meeting cannot authorize another member to act Page eighty four in his place at such meeting the clerk Sec forty one or in his absence any member should in such case call the meeting to order and a chairman pro tem be elected who would hold office during that session Sec forty two without such office was terminated by the entrance of the regular chairman The chairman sometimes calls a member to the chair and himself takes part in the debate But this should rarely be done and nothing can justify it in a case where much feeling is shown and there is a liability to difficulty in preserving order If the chairman has even the appearance of being a partisan he loses much of his ability to control those who are on the opposite side of the question The unfortunate habit many chairmen have of constantly speaking upon questions before the assembly even interrupting the member who has the floor is unjustified by either the common parliamentary law or the practice of Congress One who expects to take an active part in debate should never accept the chair It is a general rule in all deliberative assemblies that the presiding officer shall not participate in the debate or other proceedings in any other capacity than as such officer He is only allowed therefore to state matters of fact within his knowledge to inform the assembly on points of order or the course of proceeding when called upon for that purpose or when he finds it necessary to do so and on appeals from his decision on questions of order to address the assembly in debate Cushing s Manual page one hundred six Though the Speaker chairman may of right speak to matters of order and be first heard he is restrained from speaking on any other subject except where the assembly have occasion for facts within his knowledge then he may with their leave state the matter of fact Jefferson s Manual sec xvii and Barclay s Digest of the Rules and Practice of the House of Representatives U S page one hundred ninety five The chairman should not only be familiar with parliamentary usage and set the example of strict conformity to it but he should be a Page eighty five man of executive ability capable of controlling men and it should never be forgotten that to control others it is necessary to control one s self An excited chairman can scarcely fail to cause trouble in a meeting A chairman will often find himself perplexed with the difficulties attending his position and in such cases he will do well to heed the advice of a distinguished writer on parliamentary law and recollect that The great purpose of all rules and forms is to subserve the will of the assembly rather than to restrain it to facilitate and not to obstruct the expression of their deliberate sense forty one Clerk or Secretary and the Minutes The recording officer is usually called Page eighty six the Clerk or Secretary When there are two secretaries he is termed the recording secretary and the other one the corresponding secretary In many societies the secretary besides acting as recording officer collects the dues of members and thus becomes to a certain extent a financial officer In most cases the treasurer acts as banker only paying on the order of the society signed by the secretary alone or by the president and secretary In such cases the secretary becomes in reality the financial officer of the society and should make reports to the society of funds received and from what sources and of the funds expended and for what purposes See Sec fifty two for his duties as financial officer and the record of proceedings the Minutes His desk should be near that of the chairman and in the absence of the chairman if there is no vice president present when the hour for opening the session arrives it is his duty to call the meeting to order and to preside until the election of a chairman pro tem which should be done immediately He should keep a record of the proceedings commencing in a form similar to the following See Clerk and Minutes in Part II Sec fifty one At a regular quarterly meeting of state the name of the society held on the thirty first day of March eighteen seventy five at state the place of meeting the President in the chair the minutes were read by the clerk and approved If the regular clerk is absent insert after the words in the chair the following The clerk being absent Robert Smith was appointed clerk pro tem Page eighty seven The minutes were then read and approved If the minutes were not read say the reading of the minutes was dispensed with The above form will show the essentials which are as follows a The kind of meeting regular or stated or special or adjourned regular or adjourned special six name of the assembly c date and place of meeting excepting when the place is always the same d the fact of the presence of the regular chairman and clerk or in their absence the names of their substitutes e whether the minutes of the previous meeting were approved The minutes should be signed by the person who acted as clerk for that meeting in some societies the chairman must also sign them When published they should be signed by both officers In keeping the minutes much depends upon the kind of meeting and whether the minutes are to be published If they are to be published it is often of far more interest to know what was said by the leading speakers than to know what routine business was done and what resolutions adopted Page eighty eight In such case the duties of the secretary are arduous and he should have at least one assistant In ordinary society meetings and meetings of Boards of Managers and Trustees on the contrary there is no object in reporting the debates the duty of the clerk in such cases is mainly to record what is done by the assembly not what is said by the members Without there is a rule to the contrary he should enter every Principal motion Sec six that is before the assembly whether it is adopted or rejected and where there is a division see Voting Sec thirty eight or where the vote is by ballot he should enter the number of votes on each side and when the voting is by yeas and nays Sec thirty eight he should enter a list of the names of those voting on each side He should endorse on the reports of committees the date of their reception and what further action was taken upon them and preserve them among the records for which he is responsible He should in the minutes make a brief summary of a report that has been agreed to except where it contains resolutions in which case the resolutions will be entered in full as adopted by the assembly and not as Page eighty nine if it was the report accepted The proceedings of the committee of the whole Sec thirty two or while acting informally Sec thirty three should not be entered on the minutes Before an adjournment without day it is customary to read over the minutes for approval if the next meeting of the board or society will not occur for a long period Where the regular meetings are not separated by too great a time the minutes are read at the next meeting The clerk should previous to each meeting for the use of the chairman make out an order of business Sec forty four showing in their exact order what is necessarily to come before the assembly He should also have at each meeting a list of all standing committees and such select committees as are in existence at the time When a committee is appointed he should hand the names of the committee and all papers referred to it to the chairman or some other of its members Page ninety Art VIII Miscellaneous Sec Sec forty two forty five forty two A Session of an assembly is a meeting See definitions in Introduction for the distinction between meeting and session which though it may last for days is virtually one meeting 
8215-117570-0000	train-other-500	as a session of a Convention or even months as a session of Congress it terminates by an adjournment without day The intermediate adjournments from day to day or the recesses taken during the day do not destroy the continuity of the meeting
8215-117570-0001	train-other-500	they in reality constitute one session In the case of a permanent society having regular meetings every week month or year for example each meeting constitutes a separate session of the society which session however can be prolonged by adjourning to another day
8215-117570-0002	train-other-500	If a principal motion
none	none	 Sec six 
8215-117570-0003	train-other-500	is indefinitely postponed or rejected at one session while it cannot be introduced again at the same session see Renewal of a Motion
none	none	 Sec twenty six it can be at Page ninety one the next 
8215-117570-0004	train-other-500	without it is prohibited by a rule of the assembly No one session of the assembly can interfere with the rights of the assembly at any future session
8215-117570-0005	train-other-500	Any one session can adopt a rule or resolution of a permanent nature and it continues in force until at some future session it is rescinded But these Standing Rules as they are termed do not interfere with future sessions
8215-117570-0006	train-other-500	because at any moment a majority can suspend or rescind them or adopt new ones
8215-117570-0007	train-other-500	without it is expressly so provided in their Constitution Bylaws or Rules of Order all of which are so guarded by requiring notice of amendments and at least a two thirds vote for their adoption that they are not subject to sudden changes
8215-117570-0008	train-other-500	but may be considered as expressing the deliberate views of the whole society rather than the opinions or wishes of any particular meeting Thus if the presiding officer were ill it would not be competent for one session of the assembly to elect a chairman to hold office longer than that session
8215-117570-0009	train-other-500	as it cannot control or dictate to the next session of the assembly By going through the prescribed routine of an election to fill the vacancy giving whatever notice is required it could then legally elect a chairman to hold office while the vacancy lasted
none	none	 So it Page ninety two is improper for an assembly to postpone anything to a day beyond the next succeeding session 
8215-117570-0010	train-other-500	and thus attempt to prevent the next session from considering the question On the other hand it is not permitted to move a reconsideration
none	none	 Sec twenty seven 
8215-117570-0011	train-other-500	of a vote taken at a previous session though the motion to reconsider can be called up provided it was made at the last meeting of the previous session Committees can be appointed to report at a future session Note On Session
8215-117570-0012	train-other-500	In Congress and in fact all legislative bodies the limits of the sessions are clearly defined but in ordinary societies having a permanent existence with regular meetings more or less frequent there appears to be a great deal of confusion upon the subject
8215-117570-0013	train-other-500	Any society is competent to decide what shall constitute one of its sessions but where there is no rule on the subject the common parliamentary law would make each of its regular or special meetings a separate session as they are regarded in this Manual
8215-117570-0014	train-other-500	The disadvantages of a rule making a session include all the meetings of an ordinary society held during a long time as one year are very great Examine Indefinitely Postpone

8215-117570-0015	train-other-500	and Renewal of a Motion
none	none	 Sec twenty six If members of any society take advantage of the freedom allowed by considering Page ninety three each regular meeting a separate session 
8215-117570-0016	train-other-500	and repeatedly renew obnoxious or unprofitable motions the society can adopt a rule prohibiting the second introduction of any principal question
none	none	 Sec six 
8215-117570-0017	train-other-500	within say three or six months after its rejection or indefinite postponement or after the society has refused to consider it But generally it is better to suppress the motion by refusing to consider it
none	none	 Sec fifteen forty three 
8215-117570-0018	train-other-500	A Quorum of an assembly is such a number as is competent to transact its business Without there is a special rule on the subject the quorum of every assembly is a majority of all the members of the assembly But whenever a society has any permanent existence
8215-117570-0019	train-other-500	it is usual to adopt a much smaller number the quorum being often less than one twentieth of its members this becomes a necessity in most large societies where only a small fraction of the members are ever present at a meeting
none	none	 While a quorum is competent to transact any business 
8215-117570-0020	train-other-500	it is usually not expedient to transact important business without there is a fair attendance at the meeting or else previous notice of such action has been given
8215-117570-0021	train-other-500	The Chairman should not take the chair till a quorum is present except where there is no hope of there being a quorum
none	none	 and then no business can be transacted except simply Page ninety four to adjourn 
8215-117570-0022	train-other-500	So whenever during the meeting there is found not to be a quorum present the only thing to be done is to adjourn though if no question is raised about it the debate can be continued but no vote taken except to adjourn In committee of the whole
8215-117570-0023	train-other-500	the quorum is the same as in the assembly in any other committee the majority is a quorum without the assembly order otherwise and it must wait for a quorum before proceeding to business If the number afterwards should be reduced below a quorum business is not interrupted
8215-117570-0024	train-other-500	unless a member calls attention to the fact but no question can be decided except when a quorum is present Boards of Trustees Managers Directors et cetera are on the same footing as committees in regard to a quorum
8215-117570-0025	train-other-500	Their power is delegated to them as a body and what number shall be present in order that they may act as a Board is to be decided by the society that appoints the Board
none	none	 If no quorum is specified then a majority constitutes a quorum forty four Order of Business It is customary for every society having a permanent existence Page ninety five to adopt an order of business for its meetings 
8215-117570-0026	train-other-500	When no rule has been adopted the following is the order one Reading the Minutes of the previous meeting and their approval two Reports of Standing Committees three Reports of Select Committees four Unfinished Business
8215-117570-0027	train-other-500	five New Business Boards of Managers Trustees et cetera come under the head of standing committees Questions that have been postponed from a previous meeting come under the head of unfinished business
none	none	 and if a subject has been made a special order for the day 
8215-117570-0028	train-other-500	it shall take precedence of all business except reading the minutes If it is desired to transact business out of its order it is necessary to suspend the rules
none	none	 Sec eighteen 
8215-117570-0029	train-other-500	which can only be done by a two thirds vote but as each subject comes up a majority can at once lay it on the table
none	none	 Sec nineteen 
8215-117570-0030	train-other-500	and thus reach any question which they desire to first dispose of The order of business in considering any report or proposition containing several paragraphs No
none	none	 vote should be taken on the adoption of the several paragraphs 
8215-117570-0031	train-other-500	one vote being taken finally on the adoption of the whole paper By not adopting separately the different paragraphs it is in order after they have all been amended to go back and amend any of them still further In committee a similar paper would be treated the same way
none	none	 see Sec thirty In Sec forty eight b 
8215-117570-0032	train-other-500	an illustration is given of the practical application of this section

8215-117570-0033	train-other-500	then the Chairman should read it by paragraphs pausing at the end of each and asking Are there any amendments proposed to this paragraph If none are offered he says No amendments being offered to this paragraph the next will be read
8215-117570-0034	train-other-500	he then reads the next and proceeds thus to the last paragraph when he states that the whole report or resolutions have been read and are open to amendment He finally puts the question on agreeing to or adopting the whole paper as amended
8215-117570-0035	train-other-500	If there is a preamble it should be read after the last paragraph If the paper has been reported back by a committee with amendments the clerk reads only the amendments

none	none	 When Page ninety seven through with the committee s amendments the Chairman pauses for any other amendments to be proposed by the assembly 
8215-117570-0037	train-other-500	and when these are voted on he puts the question on agreeing to or adopting the paper as amended Where the resolutions have been just read by the member presenting them the reading by the clerk is usually dispensed with without the formality of a vote

by the chairman or member are in many cases in quotations It is not to be inferred that these are the only forms permitted but that these forms are proper and common They are inserted for the benefit of those unaccustomed to parliamentary forms and are sufficiently numerous for ordinary meetings Art IX Organization and Meetings Sec Sec forty six forty nine forty six An Occasional or Mass Meeting a Organization When a meeting is held which is not one of an organized society shortly after the time appointed for the meeting some member of the assembly steps forward and says The meeting will please come to order I move that mister A act as chairman of this meeting Some one else says I second the motion The first member then puts the Page one hundred question to vote by saying It has been moved and seconded that mister A act as chairman of this meeting those in favor of the motion will say aye and when the affirmative vote is taken he says those opposed will say no If the majority vote in the affirmative he says The motion is carried mister A will take the chair If the motion is lost he announces that fact and calls for the nomination of some one else for chairman and proceeds with the new nomination as in the first case Sometimes a member nominates a chairman and no vote is taken the assembly signifying their approval by acclamation The member who calls the meeting to order instead of making the motion himself may act as temporary chairman and say The meeting will please come to order will some one nominate a chairman He puts the question to vote on the nomination as described above In large assemblies the member who nominates with one other member frequently conducts the presiding officer to the chair and the chairman makes a short speech thanking the assembly for the honor conferred on him When mister A takes the chair he says The first business in order is the election of a secretary Some one then makes a motion as just described or he says I nominate mister B when the chairman puts the question as before Sometimes several names are called out and the chairman as he hears them says mister B is nominated mister C is nominated et cetera he then takes a vote on the first one he heard putting the question thus As many as are in favor of Page one hundred one mister B acting as secretary of this meeting will say aye those opposed will say no If the motion is lost the question is put on mister C and so on till some one is elected In large meetings the secretary takes his seat near the chairman he should in all cases keep a record of the proceedings as described in Sec fifty one b Adoption of Resolutions These two officers are all that are usually necessary for a meeting so when the secretary is elected the chairman asks What is the further pleasure of the meeting If the meeting is merely a public assembly called together to consider some special subject it is customary at this stage of the proceedings for some one to offer a series of resolutions previously prepared or else to move the appointment of a committee to prepare resolutions upon the subject In the first case he rises and says mister Chairman the chairman responds mister C mister C having thus obtained the floor then says I move the adoption of the following resolutions which he then reads and hands to the chairman The practice in legislative bodies is to send to the clerk s desk all resolutions bills et cetera the title of the bill and the name of the member introducing it being endorsed on each In such bodies however there are several clerks and only one chairman In many assemblies there is but one clerk or secretary and as he has to keep the minutes there is no reason for his being constantly interrupted to read every resolution offered In such assemblies without there is a rule or established custom to the contrary it is allowable and frequently much better to hand all resolutions reports et cetera directly to the chairman If they were read by the member introducing them and no one calls for another reading the chairman can omit reading them when be thinks they are fully understood In reference to the manner of reading and stating the question when the resolution contains several paragraphs see Rules of Order Sec forty four Page one hundred two some one else says I second the motion The chairman sometimes directs the secretary to read the resolutions again after which he says The question is on the adoption of the resolutions just read and if no one rises immediately he adds Are you ready for the question If no one then rises he says As many as are in favor of the adoption of the resolutions just read will say aye after the ayes have voted he says As many as are of a contrary opinion will say no he then announces the result of the vote as follows The motion is carried the resolutions are adopted or The ayes have it the resolutions are adopted c Committee to draft Resolutions If it is preferred to appoint a committee to draft resolutions a member after he has addressed the Chair and been recognized says I move that a committee be appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of this meeting on Page one hundred three et cetera adding the subject for which the meeting was called This motion being seconded the Chairman states the question Sec sixty seven and asks Are you ready for the question If no one rises he puts the question announces the result and if it is carried he asks Of how many shall the committee consist If only one number is suggested he announces that the committee will consist of that number if several numbers are suggested he states the different ones and then takes a vote on each beginning with the largest until one number is selected He then inquires How shall the committee be appointed This is usually decided without the formality of a vote The committee may be appointed by the Chair in which case the chairman names the committee and no vote is taken or the committee may be nominated by the Chair or the members of the assembly no member naming more than one except by unanimous consent and then the assembly vote on their appointment When the chairman nominates after stating the names he puts one question on the entire committee thus As many as are in favor of these gentlemen constituting the committee will say Page one hundred four aye If nominations are made by members of the assembly and more names mentioned than the number of the committee a separate vote should be taken on each name In a mass meeting it is safer to have all committees appointed by the chairman When the committee are appointed they should at once retire and agree upon a report which should be written out as described in Sec fifty three During their absence other business may be attended to or the time may be occupied with hearing addresses Upon their return the chairman of the committee who is the one first named on the committee and who quite commonly though not necessarily is the one who made the motion to appoint the committee avails himself of the first opportunity to obtain the floor See Rules of Order Sec two when he says The committee appointed to draft resolutions are prepared to report The chairman tells him that the assembly will now hear the report which is then read by the chairman of the committee and handed to the presiding officer upon which the committee is dissolved without any action of the assembly A member then moves the adoption or Page one hundred five acceptance of the report or that the resolutions be agreed to which motions have the same effect if carried namely to make the resolutions the resolutions of the assembly just as if the committee had had nothing to do with them A very common error is after a report has been read to move that it be received whereas the fact that it has been read shows that it has been already received by the assembly Another mistake less common but dangerous is to vote that the report be accepted which is equivalent to adopting it when the intention is only to have the report up for consideration and afterwards move its adoption When one of these motions is made the chairman acts as stated above when the resolutions were offered by a member If it is not desired to immediately adopt the resolutions they can be debated modified their consideration postponed et cetera as explained in Sec Sec fifty five sixty three When through with the business for which the assembly were convened or when from any other cause it is desirable to close the meeting some one moves to adjourn if the motion is carried and no other time for meeting has been appointed the chairman says The motion is carried this assembly stands adjourned without day Another method by which the meeting may be conducted is shown in Sec forty eight d Additional Officers If more officers are Page one hundred six required than a chairman and secretary they can be appointed before introducing the resolutions in the manner described for those officers or the assembly can first form a temporary organization in the manner already described only adding pro tem to the title of the officers thus chairman pro tem In this latter case as soon as the secretary pro tem is elected a committee is appointed to nominate the permanent officers as in the case of a convention Sec forty seven Frequently the presiding officer is called the President and sometimes there is a large number of Vice Presidents appointed for mere complimentary purposes The Vice Presidents in large formal meetings sit on the platform beside the President and in his absence or when he vacates the chair the first on the list that is present should take the chair forty seven Meeting of a Convention or Assembly of Delegates If the members of the assembly have been elected or appointed as members it becomes necessary to know who are properly members of the assembly and entitled to vote before the permanent organization is effected In this case a temporary organization is made as already described by the election of a chairman Page one hundred seven and secretary pro tem when the chairman announces The next business in order is the appointment of a committee on credentials A motion may then be made covering the entire case thus I move that a committee of three on the credentials of members be appointed by the Chair and that the committee report as soon as practicable or they may include only one of these details thus I move that a committee be appointed on the credentials of members In either case the Chair proceeds as already described in the cases of committees on resolutions Sec forty six c On the motion to accept the report of the committee none can vote except those reported by the committee as having proper credentials The committee beside reporting a list of members with proper credentials may report doubtful or contested cases with recommendations which the assembly may adopt or reject or postpone et cetera Only members whose right to their seats is undisputed can vote The chairman after the question of credentials is disposed of at least for the time announces that The next business in order is the election of permanent officers of the assembly Some one then moves the appointment of a Page one hundred eight committee to nominate the officers in a form similar to this I move that a committee of three be appointed by the Chair to nominate the permanent officers of this convention This motion is treated as already explained When the committee make their report some one moves That the report of the committee be accepted and that the officers nominated be declared the officers of this convention Where there is any competition for the offices it is better that they be elected by ballot In this case when the nominating committee report a motion can be made as follows I move that the convention now proceed to ballot for its permanent officers or I move that we now proceed to the election by ballot of the permanent officers of this convention See Rules of Order Sec thirty eight for balloting and other methods of voting The constitutions of permanent societies usually provide that the officers shall be elected by ballot This motion being carried the chairman declares the officers elected and instantly calls the new presiding officer to the chair and the temporary secretary is at the same time replaced The convention is now organized for work forty eight A Permanent Society a First Meeting When it is desired to form a permanent society those interested in it should see that only the proper persons are invited to be present at a certain time and place It is not usual in mass meetings or meetings called to organize a society to commence until Page one hundred nine fifteen or thirty minutes after the appointed time when some one steps forward and says The meeting will please come to order I move that mister A act as chairman of this meeting some one seconds the motion when the one who made the motion puts it to vote or as it is called puts the question as already described under an occasional meeting Sec forty six a and as in that case when the chairman is elected he announces as the first business in order the election of a secretary After the secretary is elected the chairman calls on some member who is most interested in getting up the society to state the object of the meeting When this member rises he says mister Chairman the chairman then announces his name when the member proceeds to state the object of the meeting Having finished his remarks the chairman may call on other members to give their opinions upon the subject and sometimes a particular speaker is called out by members who wish to hear him The chairman should observe the wishes of the assembly and while being careful not to be too strict he must not permit any one to occupy too much time and weary the meeting When a sufficient time has been spent in this Page one hundred ten informal way some one should offer a resolution so that definite action can be taken Those interested in getting up the meeting if it is to be a large one should have previously agreed upon what is to be done and be prepared at the proper time to offer a suitable resolution which may be in a form similar to this Resolved That it is the sense of this meeting that a society for state the object of the society should now be formed in this city This resolution when seconded and stated by the chairman would be open to debate and be treated as already described Sec forty six b This preliminary motion could have been offered at the commencement of the meeting and if the meeting is a very large one this would probably be better than to have the informal discussion After this preliminary motion has been voted on or even without waiting for such motion one like this can be offered I move that a committee of five be appointed by the Chair to draft a Constitution and By Laws for a society for here state the object and that they report at an adjourned meeting of this assembly This motion can be amended Sec fifty six by striking out and adding words et cetera and it is debatable Page one hundred eleven When this committee is appointed the chairman may inquire Is there any other business to be attended to or What is the further pleasure of the meeting When all business is finished a motion can be made to adjourn to meet at a certain place and time which when seconded and stated by the Chair is open to debate and amendment It is usually better to fix the time of the next meeting see Sec sixty three at an earlier stage of the meeting and then when it is desired to close the meeting move simply to adjourn which cannot be amended or debated When this motion is carried the chairman says This meeting stands adjourned to meet at et cetera specifying the time and place of the next meeting b Second Meeting Ordinary meetings of a society are conducted like this second meeting the chairman however announcing the business in the order prescribed by the rules of the society Sec seventy two For example after the minutes are read and approved he would say The next business in order is hearing reports from the standing committees He may then call upon each committee in their order for a report thus Has the committee on applications for membership any report to make In which case the committee may report as shown above or some member of it reply that they have no report to make Or when the chairman knows that there are but few if any reports to make it is better after making the announcement of the business for him to ask Have these committees any reports to make After a short pause if no one rises to report he states There being no reports from the standing committees the next business in order is hearing the reports of select committees when he will act the same as in the case of the standing committees The chairman should always have a list of the committees to enable him to call upon them as well as to guide him in the appointment of new committees At the next meeting the officers of the previous meeting if present serve until the permanent officers are elected When the hour arrives for the meeting the chairman standing says The meeting will Page one hundred twelve please come to order as soon as the assembly is seated he adds The secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting If any one notices an error in the minutes he can state the fact as soon as the secretary finishes reading them if there is no objection without waiting for a motion the chairman directs the secretary to make the correction The chairman then says If there is no objection the minutes will stand approved as read or corrected if any corrections have been made He announces as the next business in order the hearing of the report of the committee on the Constitution and By Laws The chairman of the committee after addressing mister Chairman and being recognized reads the committee s report and then hands it to the chairman In large and formal bodies the chairman before inquiring what is to be done with the report usually directs the secretary to read it again See note to Sec forty six c for a few common errors in acting upon reports of committees See also note to Sec forty six b If no motion is made the chairman says You have heard the report read Page one hundred thirteen what order shall be taken upon it Or simply inquires What shall be done with the report Some one moves its adoption or still better moves the adoption of the Constitution reported by the committee and when seconded the chairman says The question is on the adoption of the Constitution reported by the committee He then reads the first article of the Constitution and asks Are there any amendments proposed to this article If none are offered after a pause he reads the next article and asks the same question and proceeds thus until he reads the last article when he says The whole Constitution having been read it is open to amendment Now any one can move amendments to any part of the Constitution When the chairman thinks it has been modified to suit the wishes of the assembly he inquires Are you ready for the question If no one wishes to speak he puts the question As many as are in favor of adopting the Constitution as amended will say aye and then As many as are opposed will say no He distinctly announces the result of the vote which should always be done If the articles of the Constitution are subdivided into sections Page one hundred fourteen or paragraphs then the amendments should be made by sections or paragraphs instead of by articles The chairman now states that the Constitution having been adopted it will be necessary for those wishing to become members to sign it and pay the initiation fee if required by the Constitution and suggests if the assembly is a large one that a recess be taken for the purpose A motion is then made to take a recess for say ten minutes or until the Constitution is signed The constitution being signed no one is permitted to vote excepting those who have signed it The recess having expired the chairman calls the meeting to order and says The next business in order is the adoption of By Laws Some one moves the adoption of the By Laws reported by the committee and they are treated just like the Constitution The chairman then asks What is the further pleasure of the meeting or states that the next business in order is the election of the permanent officers of the society In either case some one moves the appointment of a committee to nominate the permanent officers of the society which motion is treated as already described in Sec forty seven As Page one hundred fifteen each officer is elected he replaces the temporary one and when they are all elected the organization is completed If the society is one that expects to own real estate it should be incorporated according to the laws of the state in which it is situated and for this purpose some one on the committee on the Constitution should consult a lawyer before this second meeting so that the laws may be conformed to In this case the trustees are usually instructed to take the proper measures to have the society incorporated forty nine Constitutions By Laws Rules of Order and Standing Rules In forming a Constitution and By Laws it is always best to procure copies of those adopted by several similar societies and for the committee after comparing them to select one as the basis of their own amending each article just as their own report is amended by the Society When they have completed amending the Constitution it is adopted by the committee The By Laws are treated in the same way and then having finished the work assigned them some one moves That the committee rise and that the chairman or some other Page one hundred sixteen member report the Constitution and By Laws to the assembly If this is adopted the Constitution and By Laws are written out and a brief report made of this form Your committee appointed to draft a Constitution and By Laws would respectfully submit the following with the recommendation that they be adopted as the Constitution and By Laws of this society which is signed by all the members of the committee that concur in it Sometimes the report is only signed by the chairman of the committee In the organization just given it is assumed that both a Constitution and By Laws are adopted This is not always done some societies adopt only a Constitution and others only By Laws Where both are adopted the constitution usually contains only the following one Name and object of the society two Qualification of members three Officers their election and duties four Meetings of the society only including what is essential leaving details to the By Laws five How to amend the Constitution These can be arranged in five articles each article being subdivided into sections The Page one hundred seventeen Constitution containing nothing but what is fundamental it should be made very difficult to amend usually previous notice of the amendment is required and also a two thirds or three fourths vote for its adoption Sec seventy three It is better not to require a larger vote than two thirds and where the meetings are frequent an amendment should not be allowed to be made except at a quarterly or annual meeting after having been proposed at the previous quarterly meeting The By Laws contain all the other standing rules of the society of such importance that they should be placed out of the power of any one meeting to modify or they may omit the rules relating to the conduct of business in the meetings which would then constitute the Rules of Order of the society Every society in its By Laws or Rules of Order should adopt a rule like this The rules contained in specifying the work on parliamentary practice shall govern the society in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the Rules of Order or By Laws adopted by the society Without such a rule any one so disposed could cause great trouble in a meeting Page one hundred eighteen In addition to the Constitution By Laws and Rules of Order in nearly every society resolutions of a permanent nature are occasionally adopted which are binding on the society until they are rescinded or modified These are called Standing Rules and can be adopted by a majority vote at any meeting After they have been adopted they cannot be modified at the same session except by a reconsideration Sec sixty At any future session they can be suspended modified or rescinded by a majority vote The Standing Rules then comprise those rules of a society which have been adopted like ordinary resolutions without the previous notice et cetera required for By Laws and consequently future sessions of the society are at liberty to terminate them whenever they please No Standing Rule or other resolution can be adopted which conflicts with the Constitution By Laws or Rules of Order In practice these various classes of rules are frequently very much mixed The Standing Rules of some societies are really By Laws as the society cannot suspend them nor can they be amended until previous notice is given This produces confusion without any corresponding benefit Standing Rules should contain only such rules as are subject to the will of the majority of any meeting and which it may be expedient to change at any time without the delay incident to giving previous notice Rules of Order should contain only the rules relating to the orderly transaction of the business in the meetings of the society The By Laws should contain all the other rules of the society which are of too great importance to be changed without giving notice to the society of such change provided that the most important of these can be placed in a Constitution instead of in the By Laws These latter three should provide for their amendment The Rules of Order should provide for their suspension The By Laws sometimes provide for the suspension of certain articles None of these three can be suspended without it is expressly provided for Page one hundred nineteen Art X Officers and Committees fifty Chairman or President It is the duty of the chairman to call the meeting to order at the appointed time to preside at all the meetings to announce the business before the assembly in its proper order to state and put all questions properly brought before the assembly to preserve order and decorum and to decide all questions of order subject to an appeal When he puts a question to vote and when speaking upon an appeal he should stand In meetings of boards of managers committees and other small bodies the chairman usually retains his seat and even members in speaking do not rise in all other cases he can sit In all cases where his vote would affect the result or where the vote is by ballot he can vote When a member rises to speak he Page one hundred twenty should say mister Chairman and the chairman should reply mister A he should not interrupt a speaker as long as he is in order but should listen to his speech which should be addressed to him and not to the assembly The chairman should be careful to abstain from the appearance of partizanship but he has the right to call another member to the chair while he addresses the assembly on a question when speaking to a question of order he does not leave the chair fifty one The Clerk Secretary or Recording Secretary as he is variously called should keep a record of the proceedings the character of which depends upon the kind of meeting In an occasional or mass meeting the record usually amounts to nothing but he should always record every resolution or motion that is adopted In a convention it is often desirable to keep a full record for publication and where it lasts for several days it is usual and generally best to appoint one or more assistant clerks Frequently it is a tax on the judgment of the clerk to decide what to enter on the record or the Minutes as it is usually called Sometimes the points of each speech should be entered Page one hundred twenty one and at other times only the remark that the question was discussed by Messrs A B and C in the affirmative and Messrs D E and F in the negative Every resolution that is adopted should be entered which can be done in this form On motion of mister D it was resolved that c Sometimes a convention does its work by having certain topics previously assigned to certain speakers who deliver formal addresses or essays the subjects of which are afterwards open for discussion in short speeches of five minutes for instance In such cases the minutes are very brief without they are to be published when they should contain either the entire addresses or carefully prepared abstracts of them and should show the drift of the discussion that followed each one In permanent societies where the minutes are not published they consist of a record of what was done and not what was said and should be kept in a book The Form of the Minutes can be as follows At a regular meeting of the M L Society held in their hall on Tuesday evening March sixteen eighteen seventy five mister A in the chair and mister B acting as secretary the minutes of the previous meeting were read and Page one hundred twenty two approved The committee on Applications reported the names of Messrs C and D as applicants for membership and on motion of mister F they were admitted as members The committee on reported a series of resolutions which were thoroughly discussed and amended and finally adopted as follows Resolved That On motion of mister L the society adjourned L B Secretary If the proceedings are to be published the secretary should always examine the published proceedings of similar meetings so as to conform to the custom excepting where it is manifestly improper The Constitution By Laws Rules of Order and Standing Rules should all be written in one book leaving every other page blank and whenever an amendment is made to any of them it should be immediately entered on the page opposite to the article amended with a reference to the date and page of the minutes where is recorded the action of the society The secretary has the custody of all papers belonging to the society not specially under charge of any other officer Sometimes his Page one hundred twenty three duties are also of a financial kind when he should make such reports as are prescribed in the next section fifty two Treasurer The duties of this officer vary in different societies In probably the majority of cases he acts as a banker merely holding the funds deposited with him and paying them out on the order of the society signed by the secretary His annual report which is always required in this case consists of merely a statement of the amount on hand at the commencement of the year the amount received during the year stating from what source received the total amount paid out by order of the society and the balance on hand When this report is presented it is referred to an auditing committee consisting of one or two persons who examine the treasurer s books and vouchers and certify on his report that they have examined his accounts and vouchers and find them correct and the balance on hand is et cetera stating the amount on hand The auditing committee s report being accepted is equivalent to a resolution of the society to the same effect namely that the treasurer s report is correct In the case here supposed the real financial Page one hundred twenty four statement is made either by the board of trustees or by the secretary or some other officer according to the Constitution of the society The principles involved are that every officer who receives money is to account for it in a report to the society and that whatever officer is responsible for the disbursements shall report them to the society If the secretary as in many societies is really responsible for the expenses the treasurer merely paying upon his order then the secretary should make a full report of these expenses so classified as to enable the society to readily see the amounts expended for various purposes It should always be remembered that the financial report is made for the information of members The details of dates and separate payments for the same object are a hinderance to its being understood and are useless as it is the duty of the auditing committee to examine into the details and see if the report is correct Every disbursing officer should be careful to get a receipt whenever he makes a payment these receipts should be preserved in regular order as they are the vouchers for the payments which must be examined by the auditing committee Disbursing officers cannot be Page one hundred twenty five too careful in keeping their accounts and they should insist upon having their accounts audited every time they make a report as by this means any error is quickly detected and may be corrected When the society has accepted the auditing committee s report that the financial report is correct the disbursing officer is relieved from the responsibility of the past and if his vouchers were lost afterwards it would cause no trouble The best form for these financial reports depends upon the kind of society and is best determined by examining those made in similar societies The following form can be varied to suit most cases when the statement of receipts and expenses is very long it is often desirable to specify the amounts received from one or two particular sources which can be done immediately after stating the total receipts the same course can be taken in regard to the expenditures Treasurer s Report The undersigned Treasurer of the M L Society begs leave to submit the following annual report The balance on hand at the commencement of the year was dollars and cents There was received from all sources during the year dollars and cents during the same time the Page one hundred twenty six expenses amounted to dollars and cents leaving a balance on hand of dollars and cents The annexed statement of receipts and expenditures will show in detail the sources from which the receipts were obtained and the objects to which the expenditures have been applied All of which is respectfully submitted S M Treasurer M L S The Statement of receipts and expenditures can be made by simply giving a list of receipts followed by a list of expenses and finishing up with the balance on hand The auditing committee s certificate to the correctness of the account should be written on the statement Often the statement is made out in the form of an account as follows doctor The M L S in acct with S M Treas Cr eighteen seventy four eighteen seventy four Dec thirty one To rent of hall five hundred dollars zero Jan one By balance on hand Gas eighty zero from last year s Stationery twenty six fifty account twenty one thirteen Janitor three hundred sixty zero Dec thirty one By initiation fees ninety five zero Balance on hand twenty four sixty three members dues eight hundred seventy five zero nine hundred ninety one dollars thirteen nine hundred ninety one dollars thirteen We do hereby certify that we have examined the accounts and vouchers of the treasurer and find them correct and that the balance in his hands is twenty four dollars and sixty three cents R V J L Audit Comm Page one hundred twenty seven fifty three Committees In small assemblies especially in those where but little business is done there is not much need of committees But in large assemblies or in those doing a great deal of business committees are of the utmost importance When a committee is properly selected in nine cases out of ten its action decides that of the assembly A committee for action should be small and consist only of those heartily in favor of the proposed action A committee for deliberation or investigation on the contrary should be larger and represent all parties in the assembly so that its opinion will carry with it as great weight as possible The usefulness of the committee will be greatly impaired if any important faction of the assembly be unrepresented on the committee The appointment of a committee is fully explained in Sec forty six c The first member named on a committee is their chairman and it is his duty to call together the committee and preside at their meetings If he is absent or from any cause fails or declines to call a meeting it is the duty of the committee to assemble on the call of any two of their members The committee are a miniature assembly only being able to act when Page one hundred twenty eight a quorum is present If a paper is referred to them they must not deface it in any way but write their amendments on a separate sheet If they originate the paper all amendments must be incorporated in it When they originate the paper usually one member has previously prepared a draft which is read entirely through and then read by paragraphs the chairman pausing after each paragraph and asking Are there any amendments proposed to this paragraph No vote is taken on the adoption of the separate paragraphs but after the whole paper has been read in this way it is open to amendment generally by striking out any paragraph or inserting new ones or by substituting an entirely new paper for it When it has been amended to suit the committee they should adopt it as their report and direct the chairman or some other member to report it to the assembly It is then written out usually commencing in a style similar to this The committee to which was referred state the matter referred beg leave to submit the following report or Your committee appointed to specify the object would respectfully report et cetera It usually closes thus All of which is respectfully submitted followed by the signatures of Page one hundred twenty nine all the members concurring in the report or sometimes by only that of the chairman If the minority submit a report it commences thus The undersigned a minority of the committee appointed et cetera continuing as the regular report of the committee After the committee s report has been read it is usual to allow the minority to present their report but it cannot be acted upon except by a motion to substitute it for the report of the committee When the committee s report is read they are discharged without any motion A motion to refer the paper back to the same committee or to re commit if adopted revives the committee Art XI Introduction of Business fifty four Any member wishing to bring business before the assembly should without it is very simple write down in the form of a motion what he would like to have the assembly adopt thus Resolved That the thanks of this convention be tendered to the citizens of this community for their hearty welcome and generous hospitality Page one hundred thirty When there is no other business before the assembly he rises and addresses the chairman by his title thus mister Chairman who immediately recognizes him by announcing his name If the chairman has any special title as President for instance he should be addressed by it thus mister President Sometimes the chairman recognizes the speaker by merely bowing to him but the proper course is to announce his name He then having the floor says that he moves the adoption of the following resolution which he reads and hands to the chairman Or when he is recognized by the chair he may say that he wishes to offer the following resolutions which he reads and then moves their adoption Some one else seconds the motion and the chairman says It has been moved and seconded that the following resolution be adopted when he reads the resolution or he may read the resolution and then state the question thus The question is on the adoption of the resolution just read The merits of the resolution are then open to discussion but before any member can discuss the question or make any motion he must first obtain the floor as just described After the chairman states the question if no one rises to speak or when he thinks the debate closed he asks Are you ready for the question If no one then rises he puts the question in a form similar to the following The question is on the adoption of the resolution Page one hundred thirty one which you have heard as many as are in favor of its adoption will say aye When the ayes have voted he says As many as are of a contrary opinion will say no There are many other ways of putting a question see Sec sixty seven and Rules of Order Sec thirty eight Other illustrations of the ordinary practice in introducing business will be seen in Sec Sec forty six forty eight He then announces the result stating that the motion is carried or lost as the case may be in the following form The motion is carried the resolution is adopted or The ayes have it the resolution is adopted A majority of the votes cast is sufficient for the adoption of any motion excepting those mentioned in Sec sixty eight Art XII Motions fifty five Motions Classified According to their Object Instead of immediately adopting or rejecting a resolution as originally submitted it may be desirable to dispose of it in some other way and for this purpose various motions have come into use which can be made while a resolution is being considered and for the time being supersede it No one can make any of these motions while another member has the floor Page one hundred thirty two excepting as shown in Sec sixty four which see for the circumstances under which each motion can be made The following list comprises most of these motions arranged in eight classes according to the object for which each motion is used The names of the motions are printed in Italics each class is treated separately as shown by the references

fifty six To Amend or Modify a Amend If it is desired to modify the question in any way the proper motion to make is to amend either by adding words or by striking out words or by striking out certain words and inserting others or by substituting a different motion on the same subject for the one before the assembly or by dividing the question into two or more questions as the mover specifies so as to get a separate vote on any particular point or points Sometimes the enemies of a measure seek to amend it in such a way as to divide its friends and thus defeat it When the amendment has been moved and seconded the chairman should always state the question distinctly so that every one may know exactly what is before them reading first the paragraph which it is proposed to amend then the words to be struck out if there are any next the words to be inserted if any and finally the paragraph as it will stand if the Page one hundred thirty four amendment is adopted He then states that the question is on the adoption of the amendment which is open to debate the remarks being confined to the merits of the amendment only going into the main question so far as is necessary in order to ascertain the propriety of adopting the amendment This amendment can be amended but an amendment of an amendment cannot be amended None of the undebatable motions mentioned in Sec sixty six except to fix the time to which to adjourn can be amended nor can the motion to postpone indefinitely b Commit If the original question is not well digested or needs more amendment than can well be made in the assembly it is usual to move to refer it to a committee This motion can be made while an amendment is pending and it opens the whole merits of the question to debate This motion can be amended by specifying the number of the committee or how they shall be appointed or when they shall report or by giving them any other instructions See Sec fifty three on committees and Sec forty six c on their appointment fifty seven To Defer Action a Postpone to a certain time If it is desired to defer action Page one hundred thirty five upon a question till a particular time the proper motion to make is to postpone it to that time This motion allows of but limited debate which must be confined to the propriety of the postponement to that time it can be amended by altering the time and this amendment allows of the same debate The time specified must not be beyond that session Sec seventy of the assembly except it be the next session in which case it comes up with the unfinished business at the next session This motion can be made when a motion to amend or to commit or to postpone indefinitely is pending b Lie on the table Instead of postponing a question to a particular time it may be desired to lay it aside temporarily until some other question is disposed of retaining the privilege of resuming its consideration at any time In Congress this motion is commonly used to defeat a measure though it does not prevent a majority from taking it at any other time Some societies prohibit a question from being taken from the table except by a two thirds vote This rule deprives the society of the advantages of the motion to lie on the table because it would not be safe to lay a question aside temporarily if one third of the assembly were opposed to the measure as that one third could prevent its ever being taken from the table A bare majority should not have the power in ordinary societies to adopt or reject a question or prevent its consideration without debate See note at end of Sec thirty five Rules of Order on the principles involved in making questions undebatable The only way to accomplish this is to move that the question lie on the table This motion Page one hundred thirty six allowing of neither debate nor amendment the chairman immediately puts the question if carried the whole matter is laid aside until the assembly vote to take it from the table which latter motion is undebatable and possesses no privilege Sometimes this motion is used to suppress a measure as shown in Sec fifty nine c fifty eight To Suppress Debate a Previous Question While as a general rule free debate is allowed upon every motion Except an objection to the consideration of the question Sec fifty nine a See note to Sec thirty five Rules of Order for a full discussion of this subject of debate which if adopted has the effect of adopting the original question or removing it from before the assembly for the session yet to prevent a minority from making an improper use of this privilege it is necessary to have methods by which debate can be closed and final action at once be taken upon a question To accomplish this when any debatable question is before the assembly it is only necessary for some one to obtain the floor and call for the previous question this call being seconded the chairman as it allows of no debate instantly puts the question thus Shall the main question be now put If this is carried by a two thirds vote Sec sixty eight all debate instantly Page one hundred thirty seven ceases excepting that the member who offered the original resolution or reported it from a committee is as in all other cases entitled to the floor to close the debate after which the chairman immediately puts the questions to the assembly first on the motion to commit if it is pending if this is carried of course the subject goes to the committee if however it fails the vote is next taken on amendments and finally on the resolution as amended If a motion to postpone either definitely or indefinitely or a motion to reconsider or an appeal is pending the previous question is exhausted by the vote on the postponement reconsideration or appeal and does not cut off debate upon any other motions that may be pending If the call for the previous question fails that is the debate is not cut off the debate continues the same as if this motion had not been made The previous question can be called for simply on an amendment and after the amendment has been acted upon the main question is again open to debate b An order limiting or closing debate Sometimes instead of cutting off debate entirely by ordering the previous question it is desirable to allow of but very limited debate In Page one hundred thirty eight this case a motion is made to limit the time allowed each speaker or the number of speeches on each side or to appoint a time at which debate shall close and the question be put The motion may be made to limit debate on an amendment in which case the main question would afterwards be open to debate and amendment or it may be made simply on an amendment to an amendment In ordinary societies where harmony is so important a two thirds vote should be required for the adoption of any of the above motions to cut off or limit debate In the House of Representatives these motions require only a majority vote for their adoption In the Senate to the contrary not even two thirds of the members can force a measure to its passage without allowing debate the Senate rules not recognizing the above motions fifty nine To Suppress the Question a Objection to the consideration of a question Sometimes a resolution is introduced that the assembly do not wish to consider at all because it is profitless or irrelevant to the objects of the assembly or for other reasons The proper course to pursue in such case is for some one as soon as it is introduced to object to the consideration of the question This objection not requiring a second the chairman immediately Page one hundred thirty nine puts the question Will the assembly consider this question If decided in the negative by a two thirds vote the question is immediately dismissed and cannot be again introduced during that session This objection must be made when the question is first introduced before it has been debated and it can be made when another member has the floor b Postpone indefinitely After the question has been debated the proper motion to use in order to suppress the question for the session is to postpone indefinitely It cannot be made while any motion except the original or main question is pending but it can be made after an amendment has been acted upon and the main question as amended is before the assembly It opens the merits of the main question to debate to as great an extent as if the main question were before the assembly On account of these two facts in assemblies with short sessions it is not very useful as the same result can usually be more easily attained by the next motion c Lie on the table If there is no possibility during the remainder of the session of obtaining a majority vote for taking up the question then the quickest way of suppressing it is Page one hundred forty to move that the question lie on the table which allowing of no debate enables the majority to instantly lay the question on the table from which it cannot be taken without their consent From its high rank Sec sixty four and undebatable character this motion is very commonly used to suppress a question but as shown in Sec fifty seven b its effect is merely to lay the question aside till the assembly choose to consider it and it only suppresses the question so long as there is a majority opposed to its consideration sixty To Consider a question a second time Reconsider When a question has been once adopted rejected or suppressed it cannot be again considered during that session Sec seventy except by a motion to reconsider the vote on that question This motion can only be made by one who voted on the prevailing side and on the day the vote was taken which it is proposed to reconsider In Congress it can be made on the same or succeeding day and if the yeas and nays were not taken on the vote any one can move the reconsideration The yeas and nays are however ordered on all important votes in Congress which is not the case in ordinary societies It can be made and entered on the minutes in the midst of debate even when another member has the floor but cannot be considered until there is no question Page one hundred forty one before the assembly when if called up it takes precedence of every motion except to adjourn and to fix the time to which the assembly shall adjourn A motion to reconsider a vote on a debatable question opens to debate the entire merits of the original motion If the question to be reconsidered is undebatable then the reconsideration is undebatable If the motion to reconsider is carried the chairman announces that the question now recurs on the adoption of the question the vote on which has been just reconsidered the original question is now in exactly the same condition that it was in before the first vote was taken on its adoption and must be disposed of by a vote When a motion to reconsider is entered on the minutes it need not be called up by the mover till the next meeting on a succeeding day If the assembly has not adopted these or similar rules this paragraph would not apply but this motion to reconsider would like any other motion fall to the ground if not acted upon before the close of the session at which the original vote was adopted If he fails to call it up then any one else can do so But should there be no succeeding meeting either adjourned or regular within a month then the effect of the motion to reconsider Page one hundred forty two terminates with the adjournment of the meeting at which it was made and any one can call it up at that meeting In general no motion except to adjourn that has been once acted upon can again be considered during the same session except by a motion to reconsider The motion to adjourn can be renewed if there has been progress in business or debate and it cannot be reconsidered But this rule does not prevent the renewal of any of the motions mentioned in Sec sixty four provided the question before the assembly has in any way changed for in this case while the motions are nominally the same they are in fact different Thus to move to postpone a resolution is a different question from moving to postpone it after it has been amended A motion to suspend the rules for a certain purpose cannot be renewed at the same meeting but can be at an adjourned meeting A call for the orders of the day that has been negatived cannot be renewed while the question then before the assembly is still under consideration See Rules of Order Sec twenty seven for many peculiarities of this motion sixty one Order and Rules a Orders of the Day Sometimes an assembly decides that certain questions shall be considered at a particular time and when that time arrives those questions constitute what is termed the orders of the day and if any member calls for the orders of the day as it requires no second the Page one hundred forty three chairman immediately puts the question thus Will the assembly now proceed to the orders of the day If carried the subject under consideration is laid aside and the questions appointed for that time are taken up in their order When the time arrives the chairman may state that fact and put the above question without waiting for a motion If the motion fails the call for the orders of the day cannot be renewed till the subject then before the assembly is disposed of In Congress a member entitled to the floor cannot be interrupted by a call for the orders of the day In an ordinary assembly the most common case where orders of the day are decided upon is where it is necessary to make a programme for the session When the hour arrives for the consideration of any subject on the programme these rules permit any member to call for the orders of the day as described in Rules of Order Sec two even though another person has the floor If this were not permitted it would often be impossible to carry out the programme though wished for by the majority A majority could postpone the orders of the day when called for so as to continue the discussion of the question then before the assembly An order as to the time when any subject shall be considered must not be confounded with the rules of the assembly the latter must be enforced by the chairman without they are suspended by a two thirds vote the former in strictness can only be carried out by the order of a majority of the assembly then present and voting b Special Order If a subject is of such importance that it is desired to consider it at a special time in preference to the orders of the day and established order of business then a motion should be made to make the question a special order for that particular time This Page one hundred forty four motion requires a two thirds vote for its adoption because it is really a suspension of the rules and it is in order whenever a motion to suspend the rules is in order If a subject is a special order for a particular day then on that day it supersedes all business except the reading of the minutes A special order can be postponed by a majority vote If two special orders are made for the same day the one first made takes precedence c Suspension of the Rules It is necessary for every assembly if discussion is allowed to have rules to prevent its time being wasted and to enable it to accomplish the object for which the assembly was organized And yet at times their best interests are subserved by suspending their rules temporarily In order to do this some one makes a motion to suspend the rules that interfere with et cetera stating the object of the suspension If this motion is carried by a two thirds vote then the particular thing for which the rules were suspended can be done By general consent that is if no one objects the rules can at any time be ignored without the formality of a motion d Questions of Order It is the duty of the chairman to enforce the rules and preserve Page one hundred forty five order and when any member notices a breach of order he can call for the enforcement of the rules In such cases when he rises he usually says mister Chairman I rise to a point of order The chairman then directs the speaker to take his seat and having heard the point of order decides the question and permits the first speaker to resume his speech directing him to abstain from any conduct that was decided to be out of order When a speaker has transgressed the rules of decorum he cannot continue his speech if any one objects without permission is granted him by a vote of the assembly Instead of the above method when a member uses improper language some one says I call the gentleman to order when the chairman decides as before whether the language is disorderly e Appeal While on all questions of order and of interpretation of the rules and of priority of business it is the duty of the chairman to first decide the question it is the privilege of any member to appeal from the decision If the appeal is seconded the chairman states his decision and that it has been appealed from and then states the question thus Shall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the assembly or society convention et cetera Page one hundred forty six The chairman can then without leaving the chair state the reasons for his decision after which it is open to debate no member speaking but once excepting in the following cases when it is undebatable one When it relates to transgressions of the rules of speaking or to some indecorum or to the priority of business and two when the previous question was pending at the time the question of order was raised After the vote is taken the chairman states that the decision of the chair is sustained or reversed as the case may be sixty two Miscellaneous a Reading of papers and b Withdrawal of a motion If a speaker wishes to read a paper or a member to withdraw his motion after it has been stated by the chair it is necessary if any one objects to make a motion to grant the permission c Questions of Privilege Should any disturbance occur during the meeting or anything affecting the rights of the assembly or any of the members any member may rise to a question of privilege and state the matter which the chairman decides to be or not to be a matter of privilege from the chairman s decision of course an appeal can be taken If the question is one of privilege it supersedes Page one hundred forty seven for the time being the business before the assembly its consideration can be postponed to another time or the previous question can be ordered on it so as to stop debate or it can be laid on the table or referred to a committee to examine and report upon it As soon as the question of privilege is in some way disposed of the debate which was interrupted is resumed sixty three To Close the Meeting a Fix the time to which to adjourn If it is desired to have an adjourned meeting of the assembly it is best some time before its close to move That when this assembly adjourns it adjourns to meet at such a time specifying the time This motion can be amended by altering the time but if made when another question is before the assembly neither the motion nor the amendment can be debated If made when no other business is before the assembly it stands as any other main question and can be debated This motion can be made even while the assembly is voting on the motion to adjourn but not when another member has the floor b Adjourn In order to prevent an assembly Page one hundred forty eight from being kept in session an unreasonably long time it is necessary to have a rule limiting the time that the floor can be occupied by any one member at one time Ten minutes is allowed by these rules When it is desired to close the meeting without the member who has the floor will yield it the only resource is to wait till his time expires and then a member who gets the floor should move to adjourn The motion being seconded the chairman instantly put the question as it allows of no amendment or debate and if decided in the affirmative he says The motion is carried this assembly stands adjourned If the assembly is one that will have no other meeting instead of adjourned he says adjourned without day or sine die If previously it had been decided when they adjourned to adjourn to a particular time then he states that the assembly stands adjourned to that time If the motion to adjourn is qualified by specifying the time as to adjourn to to morrow evening it cannot be made when any other question is before the assembly like any other main motion it can then be amended and debated For the effect of an adjournment upon unfinished business see Sec sixty nine Page one hundred forty nine sixty four Order of Precedence of Motions The ordinary motions rank as follows and any of them except to amend can be made while one of a lower order is pending but none can supersede one of a higher order To Fix the Time to which to Adjourn To Adjourn when unqualified For the Orders of the Day To Lie on the Table For the Previous Question To Postpone to a Certain Time To Commit To Amend To Postpone Indefinitely The motion to Reconsider can be made when any other question is before the assembly but cannot be acted upon until the business then before the assembly is disposed of when if called up it takes precedence of all other motions except to adjourn and to fix the time to which to adjourn Questions incidental to those before the assembly take precedence of them and must be acted upon first A question of order a call for the orders of the day or an objection to the consideration of a question can be made while another member has the floor so too can a motion to reconsider but it can only be entered on the minutes Page one hundred fifty at that time as it cannot supersede the question then before the assembly Art XIII Debate sixty five Rules of Speaking in Debate All remarks must be addressed to the chairman and must be confined to the question before the assembly avoiding all personalities and reflections upon any one s motives It is usual for permanent assemblies to adopt rules limiting the number of times any member can speak to the same question and the time allowed for each speech In Congress the House of Representatives allows from each member only one speech of one hour s length the Senate allows two speeches without limit as to length as otherwise one member while he could speak only once to the same question might defeat a measure by prolonging his speech and declining to yield the floor except for a motion to adjourn In ordinary assemblies two speeches should be allowed each member except upon an appeal and these rules also limit the time for each speech to ten minutes A majority can permit a member to speak oftener or longer whenever it is desired and the motion granting such permission cannot be debated Page one hundred fifty one However if greater freedom is wanted it is only necessary to consider the question informally or if the assembly is large go into committee of the whole See Rules of Order Sec Sec thirty two thirty three If on the other hand it is desired to limit the debate more or close it altogether it can be done by a two thirds vote as shown in Sec fifty eight b sixty six Undebatable Questions and those Opening the Main Question to Debate A full list of these will be found in Sec thirty five to which the reader is referred To the undebatable motions in that list should be added the motion to close or limit debate Art XIV Miscellaneous sixty seven Forms of Stating and Putting Questions Whenever a motion has been made and seconded it is the duty of the chairman if the motion is in order to state the question so that the assembly may know what question is before them The seconding of a motion is required to prevent a question being introduced when only one member is in favor of it and consequently Page one hundred fifty two but little attention is paid to it in mere routine motions or when it is evident that many are in favor of the motion in such cases the chairman assumes that the motion is seconded Often in routine work the chairman puts the question without waiting for even a motion as few persons like to make such formal motions and much time would be wasted by waiting for them but the chairman can only do this as long as no one objects The following motions however do not have to be seconded a a call for the orders of the day b a call to order or the raising of any question of order and c an objection to the consideration of a question One of the commonest forms of stating a question is to say that It is moved and seconded that and then give the motion When an amendment has been voted on the chairman announces the result and then says The question now recurs on the resolution or on the resolution as amended as the case may be So in all cases as soon as a vote is taken he should immediately state the question then before the assembly if there be any If the motion is debatable or can be amended the chairman usually after stating the question and Page one hundred fifty three always before finally putting it inquires Are you ready for the question Some of the common forms of stating and putting questions are shown in Sec Sec forty six forty eight The forms of putting the following questions are however peculiar If a motion is made to Strike out certain words the question is put in this form Shall these words stand as a part of the resolution so that on a tie vote they are struck out If the Previous Question is demanded it is put thus Shall the main question be now put If an Appeal is made from the decision of the Chair the question is put thus Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the assembly convention society et cetera If the Orders of the Day are called for the question is put thus Will the assembly now proceed to the Orders of the Day When upon the introduction of a question some one objects to its consideration the chairman immediately puts the question thus Will the assembly consider it or Shall the question be considered or discussed If the vote has been ordered to be taken by yeas and nays the question is put in a form similar to the following As many as are in favor of the adoption of these resolutions will when their names are called answer yes or aye those opposed will answer no Page one hundred fifty four sixty eight Motions requiring a two thirds vote See Two thirds Vote page one hundred fifty nine and Sec thirty nine of Rules of Order All motions that have the effect to make a variation from the established rules and customs should require a two thirds vote for their adoption Among these established customs should be regarded the right of free debate upon the merits of any measure before the assembly can be forced to take final action upon it The following motions would come under this rule To amend or suspend the rules To make a special order To take up a question out of its proper order An objection to the consideration of a question The Previous Question or a motion to limit or close debate sixty nine Unfinished Business When an assembly adjourns the unfinished business comes up at the adjourned meeting if one is held as the first business after the reading of the minutes if there is no adjourned meeting the unfinished business comes up immediately before new business at the next regular meeting provided the regular meetings are more frequent than yearly See Rules of Order Sec eleven for a fuller explanation of the effect of an adjournment upon unfinished business and the Congressional practice If the meetings are only once a Page one hundred fifty five year the adjournment of the session puts an end to all unfinished business seventy Session Each regular meeting of a society constitutes a separate session Any meeting which is not an adjournment of another meeting commences a new session the session terminates as soon as the assembly adjourns without day In ordinary practice a meeting is closed by moving simply to adjourn the society meet again at the time provided either by their rules or by a resolution of the society If they do not meet till the time for the next regular meeting as provided in the By Laws then the adjournment closed the session and was in effect an adjournment without day If however they had previously fixed the time for the next meeting either by a direct vote or by adopting a programme of exercises covering several meetings or even days in either case the adjournment is in effect to a certain day and does not close the session When an assembly has meetings for several days consecutively they all constitute one session Each session of a society is independent of the other sessions excepting as expressly provided in their Constitution By Laws or Rules of Order and excepting that resolutions adopted by one session are in force during succeeding sessions until rescinded by a majority vote see note to Sec forty nine Where a society holds more than one regular session a year these rules limit the independence of each session as follows a The Order of Business prescribed in Sec seventy two requires that the Page one hundred fifty six minutes of the previous meeting the reports of committees previously appointed and the unfinished business of the last session shall all take precedence of new business and that no subject can be considered out of its proper order except by a two thirds vote b it is allowable to postpone a question to the next session when it comes up with unfinished business but it is not allowable to postpone to a day beyond the next session and thus interfere with the right of the next session to consider the question c a motion to reconsider a vote can be made at one meeting and called up at the next meeting even though it be another session provided the society holds its regular sessions as frequently as monthly See Rules of Order Sec forty two for a full discussion of this subject seventy one Quorum See Sec forty three for full information on this subject seventy two Order of Business Every society should adopt an order of business adapted to its special wants The following is the usual order where no special rule is adopted and when more than one regular meeting is held each year Page one hundred fifty seven one Reading of the minutes of the last meeting two Reports of Boards of Trustees or Managers and Standing Committees three Reports of Select Committees four Unfinished Business including questions postponed to this meeting five New Business Business cannot be considered out of its order except by a two thirds vote but a majority can lay on the table the different questions as they come up and thus reach a subject they wish first to consider If a subject has been made a Special Order for this meeting then it is to be considered immediately after the minutes are read seventy three Amendments of Constitutions By Laws and Rules of Order should be permitted only when adopted by a two thirds vote at a regular meeting of the society after having been proposed at the previous regular meeting If the meetings are very frequent weekly for instance amendments should be adopted only at the quarterly meetings after having been proposed at the previous quarterly meeting Page one hundred fifty eight Legal Rights of Assemblies and the Trial of their Members The Right of Deliberative Assemblies to Punish their Members A deliberative assembly has the inherent right to make and enforce its own laws and punish an offender the extreme penalty however being expulsion from its own body When expelled if the assembly is a permanent society it has a right for its own protection to give public notice that the person has ceased to be a member of that society But it has no right to go beyond what is necessary for self protection and publish the charges against the member In a case where a member of a society was expelled and an officer of the society published by their order a statement of the grave charges upon which he had been found guilty the expelled member recovered damages from the officer in a suit for libel the court holding that the truth of the charges did not affect the case Page one hundred fifty nine The Right of an Assembly to Eject any one from its place of meeting Every deliberative assembly has the right to decide who may be present during its session and when the assembly either by a rule or by a vote decides that a certain person shall not remain in the room it is the duty of the chairman to enforce the rule or order using whatever force is necessary to eject the party The chairman can detail members to remove the person without calling upon the police If however in enforcing the order any one uses harsher treatment than is necessary to remove the person the courts have held that he and he alone is liable to prosecution just the same as a policeman would be under similar circumstances However badly the man may be abused while being removed from the room neither the chairman nor the society are liable for damages as in ordering his removal they did not exceed their legal rights Rights of Ecclesiastical Tribunals Many of our deliberative assemblies are ecclesiastical bodies and it is important to know how much respect will be paid to their decisions by the civil courts A church became divided and each party Page one hundred sixty claimed to be the church and therefore entitled to the church property The case was taken into the civil courts and finally on appeal to the U S Supreme Court which held the case under advisement for one year and then reversed the decision of the State Court because it conflicted with the decision of the highest ecclesiastical court that had acted upon the case The Supreme Court in rendering its decision laid down the broad principle that when a local church is but a part of a larger and more general organization or denomination it will accept the decision of the highest ecclesiastical tribunal to which the case has been carried within that general church organization as final and will not inquire into the justice or injustice of its decree as between the parties before it The officers the ministers the members or the church body which the highest judiciary of the denomination recognizes the court will recognize Whom that body expels or cuts off the court will hold to be no longer members of that church Trial of Members of Societies Every deliberative assembly having the right to purify its own body must therefore have the right to investigate the character of its members Page one hundred sixty one It can require any of them to testify in the case under pain of expulsion if they refuse In Sec thirty six is shown the method of procedure when a member is charged with violating the rules of decorum in debate If the disorderly words are of a personal nature before the assembly proceeds to deliberate upon the case both parties to the personality should retire It is not necessary for the member objecting to the words to retire unless he is personally involved in the case When the charge is against the member s character it is usually referred to a committee of investigation or discipline or to some standing committee to report upon Some societies have standing committees whose duty it is to report cases for discipline whenever any are known to them In either case the committee investigate the matter and report to the society This report need not go into details but should contain their recommendations as to what action the society should take and should usually close with resolutions covering the case so that there is no need for any one to offer any additional resolutions upon it The ordinary resolutions where the member is recommended to be expelled Page one hundred sixty two are one to fix the time to which the society shall adjourn and two to instruct the clerk to cite the member to appear before the society at this adjourned meeting to show cause why he should not be expelled upon the following charges which should then be given After charges are preferred against a member and the assembly has ordered that he be cited to appear for trial he is theoretically under arrest and is deprived of all the rights of membership until his case is disposed of The clerk should send the accused a written notice to appear before the society at the time appointed and should at the same time furnish him with a copy of the charges A failure to obey the summons is generally cause enough for summary expulsion At the appointed meeting what may be called the trial takes place Frequently the only evidence required against the member is the report of the committee After it has been read and any additional evidence offered that the committee may see fit to introduce the accused should be allowed to make an explanation and introduce witnesses if he so desires Either party should be allowed to cross examine the other s witnesses and introduce rebutting testimony Page one hundred sixty three When the evidence is all in the accused should retire from the room and the society deliberate upon the question and finally act by a vote upon the question of expulsion or other punishment proposed In acting upon the case it must be borne in mind that there is a vast distinction between the evidence necessary to convict in a civil court and that required to convict in an ordinary society or ecclesiastical body A notorious pickpocket could not even be arrested much less convicted by a civil court simply on the ground of being commonly known as a pickpocket while such evidence would convict and expel him from any ordinary society The moral conviction of the truth of the charge is all that is necessary in an ecclesiastical or other deliberative body to find the accused guilty of the charges If the trial is liable to be long and

MISCELLANEOUS RULES Order of Precedence of Motions The ordinary motions rank as follows and any of them except to amend can be made while one of a lower order is pending but none can supercede one of a higher order To Fix the Time to which to Adjourn To Adjourn when unqualified For the Orders of the Day To Lie on the Table For the Previous Question To Postpone to a Certain Time To Commit To Amend To Postpone Indefinitely The motion to Reconsider can be made when any other question is before the assembly but cannot be acted upon until the business then before the assembly is disposed of see note five above when if called up it takes precedence of all other motions except to adjourn and to fix the time to which to adjourn Questions incidental to those before the assembly take precedence of them and must be acted upon first Two thirds Vote In Congress the only motions requiring a two thirds vote are to suspend or amend the Rules to take up business out of its proper order and to make a special order In ordinary societies harmony is so essential that a two thirds vote should be required to force the assembly to a final vote upon a resolution without allowing free debate The Table conforms to the Rules of Order which are based upon this principle If an assembly has adopted no Rules of Order then a majority vote is sufficient for the adoption of any motion except to suspend the rules which would require a unanimous vote Forms of Putting Certain Questions If a motion is made to Strike out certain words the question is put in this form Shall these words stand as a part of the resolution so that on a tie vote they are struck out If the Previous Question is demanded it is put thus Shall the main question now be put If an Appeal is made from the decision of the Chair the question is put thus Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgement of the assembly convention society et cetera If the Orders of the Day are called for the question is put thus Will the assembly now proceed to the Orders of the Day When upon the introduction of a question some one objects to its consideration the chairman immediately puts the question thus Will the assembly consider it or Shall the question be considered or discussed If the vote has been ordered to be taken by yeas and nays the question is put in a form similar to the following As many as are in favor of the adoption of these resolutions will when their names are called answer yes or aye those opposed will answer no Various Forms of Amendments An Amendment may be either one by adding or two by striking out words or paragraphs or three by striking out certain words and inserting others or four by substituting a different motion on the same subject or five by dividing the question into two or more questions so as to get a separate vote on any particular point or points Page one hundred sixty eight Additions and Corrections These corrections though mostly contained in other parts of the Manual
