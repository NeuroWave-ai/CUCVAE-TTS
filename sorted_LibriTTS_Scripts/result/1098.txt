2573_178449_000064_000002	train-clean-360	There 
none	none	is a midland city in the heart of fair open country a dirty and wonderful city nesting dingily in the fog of its own smoke The stranger must feel the dirt before he feels the wonder for the dirt will be upon him instantly It will be upon him and within him since he must breathe it and he may care for no further proof that wealth is here better loved than cleanliness but whether he cares or not the negligently tended streets incessantly press home the point and so do the flecked and grimy citizens At a breeze he must smother in the whirlpools of dust and if he should decline at any time to inhale the smoke he has the meager alternative of suicide The smoke is like the bad breath of a giant panting for more and more riches He gets them and pants the fiercer smelling and swelling prodigiously He has a voice a hoarse voice hot and rapacious trained to one tune Wealth I will get Wealth I will make Wealth I will sell Wealth for more Wealth My house shall be dirty my garment shall be dirty and I will foul my neighbor so that he cannot be clean but I will get Wealth There shall be no clean thing about me my wife shall be dirty and my child shall be dirty but I will get Wealth And yet it is not wealth that he is so greedy for what the giant really wants is hasty riches To get these he squanders wealth upon the four winds for wealth is in the smoke Not so long ago as a generation there was no panting giant here no heaving grimy city there was but a pleasant big town of neighborly people who had understanding of one another being on the whole much of the same type It was a leisurely and kindly place homelike it was called and when the visitor had been taken through the State Asylum for the Insane and made to appreciate the view of the cemetery from a little hill his host s duty as Baedeker was done The good burghers were given to jogging comfortably about in phaetons or in surreys for a family drive on Sunday No one was very rich few were very poor the air was clean and there was time to live But there was a spirit abroad in the land and it was strong here as elsewhere a spirit that had moved in the depths of the American soil and labored there sweating till it stirred the surface rove the mountains and emerged tangible and monstrous the god of all good American hearts Bigness And that god wrought the panting giant In the souls of the burghers there had always been the profound longing for size Year by year the longing increased until it became an accumulated force We must Grow We must be Big We must be Bigger Bigness means Money And the thing began to happen their longing became a mighty Will We must be Bigger Bigger Bigger Get people here Coax them here Bribe them Swindle them into coming if you must but get them Shout them into coming Deafen them into coming Any kind of people all kinds of people We must be Bigger Blow Boost Brag Kill the fault finder Scream and bellow to the Most High Bigness is patriotism and honor Bigness is love and life and happiness Bigness is Money We want Bigness They got it From all the states the people came thinly at first and slowly but faster and faster in thicker and thicker swarms as the quick years went by White people came and black people and brown people and yellow people the negroes came from the South by the thousands and thousands multiplying by other thousands and thousands faster than they could die From the four quarters of the earth the people came the broken and the unbroken the tame and the wild Germans Irish Italians Hungarians Scotch Welsh English French Swiss Swedes Norwegians Greeks Poles Russian Jews Dalmatians Armenians Rumanians Servians Persians Syrians Japanese Chinese Turks and every hybrid that these could propagate And if there were no Eskimos nor Patagonians what other human strain that earth might furnish failed to swim and bubble in this crucible With Bigness came the new machinery and the rush the streets began to roar and rattle the houses to tremble the pavements were worn under the tread of hurrying multitudes The old leisurely quizzical look of the faces was lost in something harder and warier and a cockney type began to emerge discernibly a cynical young mongrel barbaric of feature muscular and cunning dressed in good fabrics fashioned apparently in imitation of the sketches drawn by newspaper comedians The female of his kind came with him a pale girl shoddy and a little rouged and they communicated in a nasal argot mainly insolences and elisions Nay the common speech of the people showed change in place of the old midland vernacular irregular but clean and not unwholesomely drawling a jerky dialect of coined metaphors began to be heard held together by GUNNAS and GOTTAS and much fostered by the public journals The city piled itself high in the center tower on tower for a nucleus and spread itself out over the plain mile after mile and in its vitals like benevolent bacilli contending with malevolent in the body of a man missions and refuges offered what resistance they might to the saloons and all the hells that cities house and shelter Temptation and ruin were ready commodities on the market for purchase by the venturesome highwaymen walked the streets at night and sometimes killed snatching thieves were busy everywhere in the dusk while house breakers were a common apprehension and frequent reality Life itself was somewhat safer from intentional destruction than it was in medieval Rome during a faction war though the Roman murderer was more like to pay for his deed but death or mutilation beneath the wheels lay in ambush at every crossing The politicians let the people make all the laws they liked it did not matter much and the taxes went up which is good for politicians Law making was a pastime of the people

they forbade cigarettes to smoke They made laws for all things and forgot them immediately though sometimes they would remember after a while and hurry to make new laws that the old laws should be enforced and then forget both new and old Wherever enforcement threatened Money or Votes or wherever it was too much to bother it became a joke Influence was the law So the place grew And it grew strong Straightway when he came each man fell to the same worship Give me of thyself O Bigness Power to get more power Riches to get more riches Give me of thy sweat that I may sweat more Give me Bigness to get more Bigness to myself O Bigness for Thine is the Power and the Glory And there is no end but Bigness ever and for ever CHAPTER II The Sheridan Building was the biggest skyscraper the Sheridan Trust Company was the biggest of its kind and Sheridan himself had been the biggest builder and breaker and truster and buster under the smoke He had come from a country cross roads at the beginning of the growth and he had gone up and down in the booms and relapses of that period but each time he went down he rebounded a little higher until finally after a year of overwork and anxiety the latter not decreased by a chance remote but possible of recuperation from the former in the penitentiary he found himself on top with solid substance under his feet and thereafter played it safe But his hunger to get was unabated for it was in the very bones of him and grew fiercer He was the city incarnate He loved it calling it God s country as he called the smoke Prosperity breathing the dingy cloud with relish And when soot fell upon his cuff he chuckled he could have kissed it It s good It s good he said and smacked his lips in gusto Good clean soot it s our life blood God bless it The smoke was one of his great enthusiasms he laughed at a committee of plaintive housewives who called to beg his aid against it Smoke s what brings your husbands money home on Saturday night he told them jovially Smoke may hurt your little shrubberies in the front yard some but it s the catarrhal climate and the adenoids that starts your chuldern coughing Smoke makes the climate better Smoke means good health it makes the people wash more They have to wash so much they wash off the microbes You go home and ask your husbands what smoke puts in their pockets out o the pay roll and you ll come around next time to get me to turn out more smoke instead o chokin it off It was Narcissism in him to love the city so well he saw his reflection in it and like it he was grimy big careless rich strong and unquenchably optimistic From the deepest of his inside all the way out he believed it was the finest city in the world Finest was his word He thought of it as his city as he thought of his family as his family and just as profoundly believed his city to be the finest city in the world so did he believe his family to be in spite of his son Bibbs the finest family in the world As a matter of fact he knew nothing worth knowing about either Bibbs Sheridan was a musing sort of boy poor in health and considered the failure the odd one of the family Born during that most dangerous and anxious of the early years when the mother fretted and the father took his chance he was an ill nourished baby and grew meagerly only lengthwise through a feeble childhood At his christening he was committed for life to Bibbs mainly through lack of imagination on his mother s part for though it was her maiden name she had no strong affection for it but it was her turn to name the baby and as she explained later she couldn t think of anything else she liked AT ALL She offered this explanation one day when the sickly boy was nine and after a long fit of brooding had demanded some reason for his name s being Bibbs He requested then with unwonted vehemence to be allowed to exchange names with his older brother Roscoe Conkling Sheridan or with the oldest James Sheridan Junior and upon being refused went down into the cellar and remained there the rest of that day And the cook descending toward dusk reported that he had vanished but a search revealed that he was in the coal pile completely covered and still burrowing Removed by force and carried upstairs he maintained a cryptic demeanor refusing to utter a syllable of explanation even under the lash This obvious thing was wholly a mystery to both parents the mother was nonplussed failed to trace and connect and the father regarded his son as a stubborn and mysterious fool an impression not effaced as the years went by At twenty two Bibbs was physically no more than the outer scaffolding of a man waiting for the building to begin inside a long shanked long faced rickety youth sallow and hollow and haggard dark haired and dark eyed with a peculiar expression of countenance indeed at first sight of Bibbs Sheridan a stranger might well be solicitous for he seemed upon the point of tears But to a slightly longer gaze not grief but mirth was revealed as his emotion while a more searching scrutiny was proportionately more puzzling he seemed about to burst out crying or to burst out laughing one or the other inevitably but it was impossible to decide which And Bibbs

none	none	on any occasion of his life either laughed aloud or wept He was a disappointment to his father At least that was the parent s word a confirmed and established word after his first attempt to make a business man of the boy He sent Bibbs to begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up in the machine shop of the Sheridan Automatic Pump Works and at the end of six months the family physician sent Bibbs to begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up in a sanitarium You needn t worry mamma Sheridan told his wife There s

none	none	and out in the dark and the snow to build a fire in a country grocery store And here Bibbs has to go and have a DOCTOR because he can t Pho it makes me tired If he d gone at it like a man he wouldn t be sick He paced the bedroom the usual setting for such parental discussions in his nightgown shaking his big grizzled head and gesticulating to his bedded spouse My Lord he said If a little teeny bit o work like this is too much for him why he ain t fit for anything It s nine tenths imagination and the rest of it well I won t say it s deliberate but 
2573_178450_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I WOULD 
none	none	like to know just how much of it s put on Bibbs didn t want the doctor said missus Sheridan It was when he was here to dinner that night and noticed how he couldn t eat anything Honey you better come to bed Eat he snorted Eat It s work that makes men eat And it s imagination that keeps people from eatin Busy men don t get time for that kind of imagination and there s another thing you ll notice about good health if you ll take the trouble to look around you missus Sheridan busy men haven t got time to be sick and they don t GET sick You just think it over and you ll find that ninety nine per cent of the sick people you know are either women or loafers Yes ma am Honey she said again drowsily you better come to bed Look at the other boys her husband bade her Look at Jim and Roscoe Look at how THEY work There isn t a shiftless bone in their bodies Work never made Jim or Roscoe sick Jim takes half the load off my shoulders already Right now there isn t a harder workin brighter business man in this city than Jim I ve pushed him but he give me something to push AGAINST You can t push nervous dyspepsia And look at Roscoe just LOOK at what that boy s done for himself and barely twenty seven years old married got a fine wife and ready to build for himself with his own money when I put up the New House for you and Edie Papa you ll catch cold in your bare feet she murmured You better come to bed And I m just as proud of Edie for a girl he continued emphatically as I am of Jim and Roscoe for boys She ll make some man a mighty good wife when the time comes She s the prettiest and talentedest girl in the United States Look at that poem she wrote when she was in school and took the prize with it s the best poem I ever read in my life and she d never even tried to write one before It s the finest thing I ever read and R T Bloss said so too and I guess he s a good enough literary judge for me turns out more advertisin liter cher than any man in the city I tell you she s smart Look at the way she worked me to get me to promise the New House and I guess you had your finger in that too mamma This old shack s good enough for me but you and little Edie ll have to have your way I ll get behind her and push her the same as I will Jim and Roscoe I tell you I m mighty proud o them three chuldern But Bibbs He paused shaking his head Honest mamma when I talk to men that got ALL their boys doin well and worth their salt why I have to keep my mind on Jim and Roscoe and forget about Bibbs missus Sheridan tossed her head fretfully upon the pillow You did the best you could papa she said impatiently so come to bed and quit reproachin yourself for it He glared at her indignantly Reproachin myself he snorted I ain t doin anything of the kind What in the name o goodness would I want to reproach myself for And it wasn t the best I could either It was the best ANYBODY could I was givin him a chance to show what was in him and make a man of himself and here he goes and gets nervous dyspepsia on me He went to the old fashioned gas fixture turned out the light and muttered his way morosely into bed What said his wife crossly bothered by a subsequent mumbling More like hook worm I said he explained speaking louder I don t know what to do with him CHAPTER III Beginning at the beginning and learning from the ground up was a long course for Bibbs at the sanitarium with milk and zwieback as the basis of instruction and the months were many and tiresome before he was considered near enough graduation to go for a walk leaning on a nurse and a cane These and subsequent months saw the planning the building and the completion of the New House and it was to that abode of Bigness that Bibbs was brought when the cane without the nurse was found sufficient to his support Edith met him at the station Well well Bibbs she said as he came slowly through the gates the last of all the travelers from that train She gave his hand a brisk little shake averting her eyes after a quick glance at him and turning at once toward the passage to the street Do you think they ought to ve let you come You certainly don t look well But I certainly do look better he returned in a voice as slow as his gait a drawl that was a necessity for when Bibbs tried to speak quickly he stammered Up to about a month ago it took two people to see me They had to get me in a line between em Edith did not turn her eyes directly toward him again after her first quick glance and her expression in spite of her showed a faint troubled distaste the look of a healthy person pressed by some obligation of business to visit a bad ward in a hospital She was nineteen fair and slim with small unequal features but a prettiness of color and a brilliancy of eyes that created a total impression close upon beauty Her movements were eager and restless there was something about her as kind old ladies say that was very sweet and there was something that was hurried and breathless This was new to Bibbs it was a perceptible change since he had last seen her and he bent upon her a steady whimsical scrutiny as they stood at the curb waiting for an automobile across the street to disengage itself from the traffic That s the new car she said Everything s new We ve got four now besides Jim s Roscoe s got two Edith you look he began and paused Oh WE re all well she said briskly and then as if something in his tone had caught her as significant Well HOW do I look Bibbs You look He paused again taking in the full length of her her trim brown shoes her scant tapering rough skirt and her coat of brown and green her long green tippet and her mad little rough hat in the mad mode all suited to the October day How do I look she insisted You look he answered as his examination ended upon an incrusted watch of platinum and enamel at her wrist you look expensive That was a substitute for what he intended to say for her constraint and preoccupation manifested particularly in her keeping her direct glance away from him did not seem to grant the privilege of impulsive intimacies I expect I am she laughed and sidelong caught the direction of his glance Of course I oughtn t to wear it in the daytime it s an evening thing for the theater but my day wrist watch is out of gear Bobby Lamhorn broke it yesterday he s a regular rowdy sometimes Do you want Claus to help you in Oh no said Bibbs I m alive And after a fit of panting subsequent to his climbing into the car unaided he added Of course I have to TELL people We only got your telegram this morning she said as they began to move rapidly through the wholesale district neighboring the station Mother said she d hardly expected you this month They seemed to be through with me up there in the country he explained gently At least they said they were and they wouldn t keep me any longer because so many really sick people wanted to get in They told me to go home and I didn t have any place else to go It ll be

none	none	Edith I ll sit in the woodshed until after dark every day Pshaw She laughed nervously Of course we re all of us glad to have you back Yes he said Father Of course Didn t he write and tell you to come home She did not turn to him with the question All the while she rode with her face directly forward No he said father hasn t written She flushed a little I expect I ought to ve written sometime or one of the boys Oh no that was all right You can t think how busy we ve all been this year Bibbs I often planned to write and then just as I was going to something would turn up And I m sure it s been just the same way with Jim and Roscoe Of course we knew mamma was writing often and Of course he said readily There s a chunk of coal fallen on your glove Edith Better flick it off before it smears My word I d almost forgotten how sooty it is here We ve been having very bright weather this month for us She blew the flake of soot into the air seeming relieved He looked up at the dingy sky wherein hung the disconsolate sun like a cold tin pan nailed up in a smoke house by some lunatic for a decoration Yes said Bibbs It s very gay A few moments later as they passed a corner Aren t we going home he asked Why yes Did you want to go somewhere else first No Your new driver s taking us out of the way isn t he No This is right We re going straight home But we ve passed the corner We always turned Good gracious she cried Didn t you know we d moved Didn t you know we were in the New House Why no said Bibbs Are you We ve been there a month Good gracious Didn t you know She broke off flushing again and then went on hastily Of course mamma s never been so busy in her life we ALL haven t had time to do anything but keep on the hop Mamma couldn t even come to the station

none	none	Papa s got some of his business friends and people from around the OLD house neighborhood coming to night for a big dinner and house warming dreadful kind of people but mamma s got it all on her hands She s never sat down a MINUTE and if she did papa would have her up again before Of course said Bibbs Do you like the new place Edith I don t like some of the things father WOULD have in it but it s the finest house in town and that ought to be good enough for me Papa bought one thing I like a view of the Bay of Naples in oil that s perfectly beautiful it s the first thing you see as you come in the front hall and it s eleven feet long But he would have that old fruit picture we had in the Murphy Street house hung up in the new dining room You remember it a table and a watermelon sliced open and a lot of rouged looking apples and some shiny lemons with two dead prairie chickens on a chair He bought it at a furniture store years and years ago and he claims it s a finer picture than any they saw in the museums that time he took mamma to Europe But it s horribly out of date to have those things in dining rooms and I caught Bobby Lamhorn giggling at it and Sibyl made fun of it too with Bobby and then told papa she agreed with him about its being such a fine thing and said he did just right to insist on having it where he wanted it She makes me tired Sibyl Edith s first constraint with her brother amounting almost to awkwardness vanished with this theme though she still kept her full gaze always to the front even in the extreme ardor of her denunciation of her sister in law SIBYL she repeated with such heat and vigor that the name seemed to strike fire on her lips I d like to know why Roscoe couldn t have married somebody from HERE that would have done us some good He could have got in with Bobby Lamhorn years ago just as well as now and Bobby d have introduced him to the nicest girls in town but instead of that he had to go and pick up this Sibyl Rink I met some awfully nice people from her town when mamma and I were at Atlantic City last spring and not one had ever heard of the Rinks Not even HEARD of em I thought you were great friends with Sibyl Bibbs said Up to the time I found her out the sister returned with continuing vehemence I ve found out some things about missus Roscoe Sheridan lately It s only lately Well Edith hesitated her lips setting primly Of course I always did see that she never cared the snap of her little finger about ROSCOE It seems said Bibbs in laconic protest that she married him The sister emitted a shrill cry to be interpreted as contemptuous laughter and in her emotion spoke too impulsively Why she d have married YOU

none	none	he said she couldn t be that bad I didn t mean she began distressed I only meant I didn t mean Never mind Edith he consoled her You see she couldn t have married me because I didn t know her and besides if she s as mercenary as all that she d have been too clever The head doctor even had to lend me the money for my ticket home I didn t mean anything unpleasant about YOU Edith babbled I only meant I thought she was the kind of girl who was so simply crazy to marry somebody she d have married anybody that asked her Yes yes said Bibbs it s all straight And perceiving that his sister s expression was that of a person whose adroitness has set matters perfectly to rights he chuckled silently Roscoe s perfectly lovely to her she continued a moment later Too lovely If he d wake up a little and lay down the law some day like a MAN I guess she d respect him more and learn to behave herself Behave Oh well I mean she s so insincere said Edith characteristically evasive when it came to stating the very point to which she had led and in this not unique of her sex Bibbs contented himself with a non committal gesture Business is crawling up the old streets he said his long tremulous hand indicating a vasty structure in course of erection The boarding houses come first and then the That isn t for shops she informed him That s a new investment of papa s the Sheridan Apartments Well well he murmured I supposed Sheridan was almost well enough known here already Oh we re well enough known ABOUT she said impatiently I guess there isn t a man woman child or nigger baby in town that doesn t know who we are But we aren t in with the right people No he exclaimed Who s all that Who s all what The right people You know what I mean the best people the old families the people that have the real social position in this town and that know they ve got it Bibbs indulged in his silent chuckle again he seemed greatly amused I thought that the people who actually had the real what you may call it didn t know it he said I ve always understood that it was very unsatisfactory because if you thought about it you didn t have it and if you had it you didn t know it That s just bosh she retorted They know it in this town all right I found out a lot of things long before we began to think of building out in this direction The right people in this town aren t always the society column ones and they mix around with outsiders and they don t all belong to any one club they re taken in all sorts into all their clubs but they re a clan just the same and they have the clan feeling and they re just as much We Us and Company as any crowd you read about anywhere in the world Most of em were here long before papa came and the grandfathers of the girls of my age knew each other and I see Bibbs interrupted gravely Their ancestors fled together from many a stricken field and Crusaders blood flows in their veins I always understood the first house was built by an old party of the name of Vertrees who couldn t get along with Dan l Boone and hurried away to these parts because Dan l wanted him to give back a gun he d lent him Edith gave a little ejaculation of alarm You mustn t repeat that story Bibbs even if it s true The Vertreeses are THE best family and of course the very oldest here they were an old family even before Mary Vertrees s great great grandfather came west and founded this settlement He came from Lynn Massachusetts and they have relatives there YET some of the best people in Lynn No exclaimed Bibbs incredulously And there are other old families like the Vertreeses she went on not heeding him the Lamhorns and the Kittersbys and the J Palmerston Smiths Strange names to me he interrupted Poor things None of them have my acquaintance No that s just it she cried And papa had never even heard the name of Vertrees missus Vertrees went with some anti smoke committee to see him and he told her that smoke was what made her husband bring home his wages from the pay roll on Saturday night HE told us about it and I thought I just couldn t live through the night I was so ashamed mister Vertrees has always lived on his income and papa didn t know him of course They re the stiffist most elegant people in the whole town And to crown it all papa went and bought the next lot to the old Vertrees country mansion it s in the very heart of the best new residence district now and that s where the New House is right next door to them and I must say it makes their place look rather shabby I met Mary Vertrees when I joined the Mission Service Helpers but she never did any more than just barely bow to me and since papa s break I doubt if she ll do that They haven t called And you think if I spread this gossip about Vertrees the First stealing Dan l Boone s gun the chances that they WILL call Papa knows what a break he made with missus Vertrees I made him understand that said Edith demurely and he s promised to try and meet mister Vertrees and be nice to him It s just this way if we don t know THEM it s practically no use in our having build the New House and if we DO know them and they re decent to us we re right with the right people They can do the whole thing for us Bobby Lamhorn told Sibyl he was going to bring his mother to call on her and on mamma but it was weeks ago and I notice he hasn t done it and if missus Vertrees decides not to know us I m darn sure missus Lamhorn ll never come That s ONE thing Sibyl didn t manage She SAID Bobby offered to bring his mother You say he is a friend of Roscoe s Bibbs asked Oh he s a friend of the whole family she returned with a petulance which she made an effort to disguise Roscoe and he got acquainted somewhere and they take him to the theater about every other night Sibyl has him to lunch too and keeps She broke off with an angry little jerk of the head We can see the New House from the second corner ahead Roscoe has built straight across the street from us you know Honestly Sibyl makes me think of a snake sometimes the way she pulls the wool over people s eyes She honeys up to papa and gets anything in the world she wants out of him and then makes fun of him behind his back yes and to his face but HE can t see it She got him to give her a twelve thousand dollar porch for their house after it was Good heavens said Bibbs staring ahead as they reached the corner and the car swung to the right following a bend in the street Is that the New House Yes What do you think of it Well he drawled I m pretty sure the sanitarium s about half a size bigger I can t be certain till I measure And a moment later as they entered the driveway he added seriously But it s beautiful CHAPTER IV It was gray stone with long roofs of thick green slate An architect who loved the milder Gothic motives had built what he liked it was to be seen at once that he had been left unhampered and he had wrought a picture out of his head into a noble and exultant reality At the same time a landscape designer had played so good a second with ready made accessories of screen approach and vista that already whatever look of newness remained upon the place was to its advantage as showing at least one thing yet clean under the grimy sky For though the smoke was thinner in this direction and at this long distance from the heart of the town it was not absent and under tutelage of wind and weather could be malignant even here where cows had wandered in the meadows and corn had been growing not ten years gone Altogether the New House was a success It was one of those architects successes which leave the owners veiled in privacy it revealed nothing of the people who lived in it save that they were rich There are houses that cannot be detached from their own people without protesting every inch of mortar seems to mourn the separation and such a house no matter what be done to it is ever murmurous with regret whispering the old name sadly to itself unceasingly But the New House was of a kind to change hands without emotion In our swelling cities great places of its type are useful as financial gauges of the business tides rich families one after another take title and occupy such houses as fortunes rise and fall they mark the high tide It was impossible to imagine a child s toy wagon left upon a walk or driveway of the New House and yet it was as Bibbs rightly called it beautiful What the architect thought of the Golfo di Napoli which hung in its vast gold revel of rococo frame against the gray wood of the hall is to be conjectured perhaps he had not seen it Edith did you say only eleven feet Bibbs panted staring at it as the white jacketed twin of a Pullman porter helped him to get out of his overcoat Eleven without the frame she explained It s splendid don t you think It lightens things up so The hall was kind of gloomy before No gloom now said Bibbs This statue in the corner is pretty too she remarked Mamma and I bought that And Bibbs turned at her direction to behold amid a grove of tubbed palms a life size black bearded Moor of a plastic composition painted with unappeasable gloss and brilliancy Upon his chocolate head he wore a gold turban in his hand he held a gold tipped spear and for the rest he was red and yellow and black and silver Hallelujah was the sole comment of the returned wanderer and Edith saying she would find mamma left him blinking at the Moor Presently after she had disappeared he turned to the colored man who stood waiting Bibbs s traveling bag in his hand What do YOU think of it Bibbs asked solemnly Gran replied the servitor She mighty hard to dus Dus git in all em wrinkles Yessuh she mighty hard to dus I expect she must be said Bibbs his glance returning reflectively to the black bull beard for a moment Is there a place anywhere I could lie down Yessuh We got one nem spare rooms all fix up fo you suh Right up staihs suh Nice room He led the way and Bibbs followed slowly stopping at intervals to rest and noting a heavy increase in the staff of service since the exodus from the old house Maids and scrubwomen were at work under the patently nominal direction of another Pullman porter who was profoundly enjoying his own affectation of being harassed with care Ev ything got look spick an span fo the big doin s to night Bibbs s guide explained chuckling Yessuh we got big doin s to night Big doin s The room to which he conducted his lagging charge was furnished in every particular like a room in a new hotel and Bibbs found it pleasant though indeed any room with a good bed would have seemed pleasant to him after his journey He stretched himself flat immediately and having replied Not now to the attendant s offer to unpack the bag closed his eyes wearily White jacket racially sympathetic lowered the window shades and made an exit on tiptoe encountering the other white jacket the harassed overseer in the hall without Said the emerging one He mighty shaky Mist Jackson Drop right down an shet his eyes Eyelids all black Rich folks gotta go same as anybody else Anybody ast me if I change ith at ole boy No suh Le m keep is money I keep my black skin an keep out the ground mister Jackson expressed the same preference Yessuh he look tuh me like somebody awready laid out he concluded And upon the stairway landing near by two old women on all fours at their work were likewise pessimistic Hech said one lamenting in a whisper It give me a turn to see him go by white as wax an bony as a dead fish missus Cronin tell me d it make ye kind o sick to look at um Sick No more than the face of a blessed angel already in heaven Well said the other I d a b y o me own come home t die once She fell silent at a rustling of skirts in the corridor above them It was missus Sheridan hurrying to greet her son She was one of those fat pink people who fade and contract with age like drying fruit and her outside was a true portrait of her Her husband and her daughter had long ago absorbed her What intelligence she had was given almost wholly to comprehending and serving those two and except in the presence of one of them she was nearly always absent minded Edith lived all day with her mother as daughters do and Sheridan so held his wife to her unity with him that she had long ago become unconscious of her existence as a thing separate from his She invariably perceived his moods and nursed him through them when she did not share them and she gave him a profound sympathy with the inmost spirit and purpose of his being even though she did not comprehend it and partook of it only as a spectator They had known but one actual altercation in their lives and that was thirty years past in the early days of Sheridan s struggle when in order to enhance the favorable impression he believed himself to be making upon some capitalists he had thought it necessary to accompany them to a performance of The Black Crook But she had not once referred to this during the last ten years missus Sheridan s manner was hurried and inconsequent her clothes rustled more than other women s clothes she seemed to wear too many at a time and to be vaguely troubled by them and she was patting a skirt down over some unruly internal dissension at the moment she opened Bibbs s door At sight of the recumbent figure she began to close the door softly withdrawing but the young man had heard the turning of the knob and the rustling of skirts and he opened his eyes Don t go mother he said I m not asleep He swung his long legs over the side of the bed to rise but she set a hand on his shoulder restraining him and he lay flat again No she said bending over to kiss his cheek I just come for a minute but I want to see how you seem Edith said Poor Edith he murmured She couldn t look at me She Nonsense missus Sheridan having let in the light at a window came back to the bedside You look a great deal better than what you did before you went to the sanitarium anyway It s done you good a body can see that right away You need fatting up of course and you haven t got much color No he said I haven t much color But you will have when you get your strength back 
2573_178449_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Oh yes 
none	none	he responded cheerfully THEN I will You look a great deal better than what I expected Edith must have a great vocabulary he chuckled She s too sensitive said missus Sheridan and it makes her exaggerate a little What about your diet That s all right They told me to eat anything Anything at all Well anything I could That s good she said nodding They mean for you just to build up your strength That s what they told me the last time I went to see you at the sanitarium You look better than what you did then and that s only a little time ago How long was it Eight months I think No it couldn t be I know it ain t THAT long but maybe it was longer n I thought And this last month or so I haven t had scarcely even time to write more than just a line to ask how you were gettin along but I told Edith to write the weeks I couldn t and I asked Jim to too and they both said they would so I suppose you ve kept up pretty well on the home news Oh yes What I think you need said the mother gravely is to liven up a little and take an interest in things That s what papa was sayin this morning after we got your telegram and that s what ll stimilate your appetite too He was talkin over his plans for you Plans Bibbs turning on his side shielded his eyes from the light with his hand so that he might see her better What He paused What plans is he making for me mother She turned away going back to the window to draw down the shade Well you better talk it over with HIM she said with perceptible nervousness He better tell you himself I don t feel as if I had any call exactly to go into it and you better get to sleep now anyway She came and stood by the bedside once more But you must remember Bibbs whatever papa does is for the best He loves his chuldern and wants to do what s right by ALL of em and you ll always find he s right in the end He made a little gesture of assent which seemed to content her and she rustled to the door turning to speak again after she had opened it You get a good nap now so as to be all rested up for to night You you mean he Bibbs stammered having begun to speak too quickly Checking himself he drew a long breath then asked quietly Does father expect me to come down stairs this evening Well I think he does she answered You see it s the house warming as he calls it and he said he thinks all our chuldern ought to be around us as well as the old friends and other folks It s just what he thinks you need to take an interest and liven up You don t feel too bad to come down do you Mother Well Take a good look at me he said Oh see here she cried with brusque cheerfulness You re not so bad off as you think you are Bibbs You re on the mend and it won t do you any harm to please your It isn t that he interrupted Honestly I m only afraid it might spoil somebody s appetite Edith I told you the child was too sensitive she interrupted in turn You re a plenty good lookin enough young man for anybody You look like you been through a long spell and begun to get well and that s all there is to it All right I ll come to the party If the rest of you can stand it I can It ll do you good she returned rustling into the hall Now take a nap and I ll send one o the help to wake you in time for you to get dressed up before dinner You go to sleep right away now Bibbs Bibbs was unable to obey though he kept his eyes closed Something she had said kept running in his mind repeating itself over and over interminably His plans for you his plans for you his plans for you his plans for you And then taking the place of his plans for you after what seemed a long long while her flurried voice came back to him insistently seeming to whisper in his ear He loves his chuldern he loves his chuldern he loves his chuldern you ll find he s always right you ll find he s always right Until at last as he drifted into the state of half dreams and distorted realities the voice seemed to murmur from beyond a great black wing that came out of the wall and stretched over his bed it was a black wing within the room and at the same time it was a black cloud crossing the sky bridging the whole earth from pole to pole It was a cloud of black smoke and out of the heart of it came a flurried voice whispering over and over His plans for you his plans for you his plans for you And then there was nothing He woke refreshed stretched himself gingerly as one might have a care against too quick or too long a pull upon a frayed elastic and getting to his feet went blinking to the window and touched the shade so that it flew up letting in a pale sunset He looked out into the lemon colored light and smiled wanly at the next house as Edith s grandiose phrase came to mind the old Vertrees country mansion It stood in a broad lawn which was separated from the Sheridans by a young hedge and it was a big square plain old box of a house with a giant salt cellar atop for a cupola Paint had been spared for a long time and no one could have put a name to the color of it but in spite of that the place had no look of being out at heel and the sward was as neatly trimmed as the Sheridans own The separating hedge ran almost beneath Bibbs s window for this wing of the New House extended here almost to the edge of the lot and directly opposite the window the Vertreeses lawn had been graded so as to make a little knoll upon which stood a small rustic summer house It was almost on a level with Bibbs s window and not thirty feet away and it was easy for him to imagine the present dynasty of Vertreeses in grievous outcry when they had found this retreat ruined by the juxtaposition of the parvenu intruder Probably the summer house was pleasant and pretty in summer It had the look of a place wherein little girls had played for a generation or so with dolls and housekeeping or where a lovely old lady might come to read something dull on warm afternoons but now in the thin light it was desolate the color of dust and hung with haggard vines which had lost their leaves Bibbs looked at it with grave sympathy probably feeling some kinship with anything so dismantled then he turned to a cheval glass beside the window and paid himself the dubious tribute of a thorough inspection He looked the mirror up and down slowly repeatedly but came in the end to a long and earnest scrutiny of the face Throughout this cryptic seance his manner was profoundly impersonal he had the air of an entomologist intent upon classifying a specimen but finally he appeared to become pessimistic He shook his head solemnly then gazed again and shook his head again and continued to shake it slowly in complete disapproval You certainly are one horrible sight he said aloud And at that he was instantly aware of an observer Turning quickly he was vouchsafed the picture of a charming lady framed in a rustic aperture of the summer house and staring full into his window straight into his eyes too for the infinitesimal fraction of a second before the flashingly censorious withdrawal of her own Composedly she pulled several dead twigs from a vine the manner of her action conveying a message or proclamation to the effect that she was in the summer house for the sole purpose of such like pruning and tending and that no gentleman could suppose her presence there to be due to any other purpose whatsoever or that being there on that account she had allowed her attention to wander for one instant in the direction of things of which she was in reality unconscious Having pulled enough twigs to emphasize her unconsciousness and at the same time her disapproval of everything in the nature of a Sheridan or belonging to a Sheridan she descended the knoll with maintained composure and sauntered toward a side door of the country mansion of the Vertreeses An elderly lady bonneted and cloaked opened the door and came to meet her Are you ready Mary I ve been looking for you What were you doing Nothing Just looking into one of Sheridans windows said Mary Vertrees I got caught at it Mary cried her mother Just as we were going to call Good heavens We ll go just the same the daughter returned I suppose those women would be glad to have us if we d burned their house to the ground But WHO saw you insisted missus Vertrees One of the sons I suppose he was I believe he s insane or something At least I hear they keep him in a sanitarium somewhere and never talk about him He was staring at himself in a mirror and talking to himself Then he looked out and caught me What did he Nothing of course How did he look Like a ghost in a blue suit said Miss Vertrees moving toward the street and waving a white gloved hand in farewell to her father who was observing them from the window of his library Rather tragic and altogether impossible Do come on mother and let s get it over And missus Vertrees with many misgivings set forth with her daughter for their gracious assault upon the New House next door CHAPTER V mister Vertrees having watched their departure with the air of a man who had something at hazard upon the expedition turned from the window and began to pace the library thoughtfully pending their return He was about sixty a small man withered and dry and fine a trim little sketch of an elderly dandy His lambrequin mustache relic of a forgotten Anglomania had been profoundly black but now like his smooth hair it was approaching an equally sheer whiteness and though his clothes were old they had shapeliness and a flavor of mode And for greater spruceness there were some jaunty touches gray spats a narrow black ribbon across the gray waistcoat to the eye glasses in a pocket a fleck of color from a button in the lapel of the black coat labeling him the descendant of patriot warriors The room was not like him being cheerful and hideous whereas mister Vertrees was anxious and decorative Under a mantel of imitation black marble a merry little coal fire beamed forth upon high and narrow Eastlake bookcases with long glass doors and upon comfortable incongruous furniture and upon meaningless woodwork everywhere and upon half a dozen Landseer engravings which mister and missus Vertrees sometimes mentioned to each other after thirty years of possession as very fine things They had been the first people in town to possess Landseer engravings and there in art they had rested but they still had a feeling that in all such matters they were in the van and when mister Vertrees discovered Landseers upon the walls of other people s houses he thawed as a chieftain to a trusted follower and if he found an edition of Bulwer Lytton accompanying the Landseers as a final corroboration of culture he would say inevitably Those people know good pictures and they know good books The growth of the city which might easily have made him a millionaire had ruined him because he had failed to understand it When towns begin to grow they have whims and the whims of a town always ruin somebody mister Vertrees had been most strikingly the somebody in this case At about the time he bought the Landseers he owned through inheritance an office building and a large house not far from it where he spent the winter and he had a country place a farm of four hundred acres where he went for the summers to the comfortable ugly old house that was his home now perforce all the year round If he had known how to sit still and let things happen he would have prospered miraculously but strangely enough the dainty little man was one of the first to fall down and worship Bigness the which proceeded straightway to enact the role of Juggernaut for his better education He was a true prophet of the prodigious growth but he had a fatal gift for selling good and buying bad He should have stayed at home and looked at his Landseers and read his Bulwer but he took his cow to market and the trained milkers milked her dry and then ate her He sold the office building and the house in town to buy a great tract of lots in a new suburb then he sold the farm except the house and the ground about it to pay the taxes on the suburban lots and to keep them up The lots refused to stay up but he had to do something to keep himself and his family up so in despair he sold the lots which went up beautifully the next year for traction stock that was paying dividends and thereafter he ceased to buy and sell Thus he disappeared altogether from the commercial surface at about the time James Sheridan came out securely on top and Sheridan until missus Vertrees called upon him with her anti smoke committee had never heard the name mister Vertrees pinched retired to his Landseers and missus Vertrees managed somehow on the dividends though managing became more and more difficult as the years went by and money bought less and less But there came a day when three servitors of Bigness in Philadelphia took greedy counsel with four fellow worshipers from New York and not long after that there were no more dividends for mister Vertrees In fact there was nothing for mister Vertrees because the traction stock henceforth was no stock at all and he had mortgaged his house long ago to help manage somehow according to his conception of his position in life one of his own old fashioned phrases Six months before the completion of the New House next door mister Vertrees had sold his horses and the worn Victoria and station wagon to pay the arrears of his two servants and re establish credit at the grocer s and butcher s and a pair of elderly carriage horses with such accoutrements are not very ample barter in these days for six months food and fuel and service mister Vertrees had discovered too that there was no salary for him in all the buzzing city he could do nothing It may be said that he was at the end of his string Such times do come in all their bitterness finally to the man with no trade or craft if his feeble clutch on that slippery ghost Property shall fail The windows grew black while he paced the room and smoky twilight closed round about the house yet not more darkly than what closed round about the heart of the anxious little man patrolling the fan shaped zone of firelight But as the mantel clock struck wheezily six there was the rattle of an outer door and a rich and beautiful peal of laughter went ringing through the house Thus cheerfully did Mary Vertrees herald her return with her mother from their expedition among the barbarians She came rushing into the library and threw herself into a deep chair by the hearth laughing so uncontrollably that tears were in her eyes missus Vertrees followed decorously no mirth about her on the contrary she looked vaguely disturbed as if she had eaten something not quite certain to agree with her and regretted it Papa Oh oh And Miss Vertrees was fain to apply a handkerchief upon her eyes I m SO glad you made us go I wouldn t have missed it missus Vertrees shook her head I suppose I m very dull she said gently I didn t see anything amusing They re most ordinary and the house is altogether in bad taste but we anticipated that and Papa Mary cried breaking in They asked us to DINNER What And I m GOING she shouted and was seized with fresh paroxysms Think of it Never in their house before never met any of them but the daughter and just BARELY met her What about you interrupted mister Vertrees turning sharply upon his wife She made a little face as if positive now that what she had eaten would not agree with her I couldn t she said I Yes that s just just the way she she looked when they asked her cried Mary choking And then she she realized it and tried to turn it into a cough and she didn t know how and it sounded like like a squeal I suppose said missus Vertrees much injured that Mary will have an uproarious time at my funeral She makes fun of Mary jumped up instantly and kissed her then she went to the mantel and leaning an elbow upon it gazed thoughtfully at the buckle of her shoe twinkling in the firelight THEY didn t notice anything she said So far as they were concerned mamma it was one of the finest coughs you ever coughed Who were they asked her father Whom did you see Only the mother and daughter Mary answered missus Sheridan is dumpy and rustly and Miss Sheridan is pretty and pushing dresses by the fashion magazines and talks about New York people that have their pictures in em She tutors the mother but not very successfully partly because her own foundation is too flimsy and partly because she began too late They ve got an enormous Moor of painted plaster or something in the hall and the girl evidently thought it was to her credit that she selected it They have oil paintings too added missus Vertrees with a glance of gentle price at the Landseers I ve always thought oil paintings in a private house the worst of taste Oh if one owned a Raphael or a Titian said mister Vertrees finishing the implication not in words but with a wave of his hand

none	none	Mary None of the rest of them came in You didn t meet mister Sheridan or He paused and adjusted a lump of coal in the fire delicately with the poker Or one of the sons Mary s glance crossed his at that with a flash of utter comprehension He turned instantly away but she had begun to laugh again No she said no one except the women but mamma inquired about the sons thoroughly Mary missus Vertrees protested Oh most adroitly too laughed the girl Only she couldn t help unconsciously turning to look at me when she did it Mary Vertrees Never mind mamma missus Sheridan and Miss Sheridan neither of THEM could help unconsciously turning to look at me speculatively at the same time They all three kept looking at me and talking about the oldest son mister James Sheridan Junior missus Sheridan said his father is very anxious to get Jim to marry and settle down and she assured me that Jim is right cultivated Another of the sons the youngest one caught me looking in the window this afternoon but they didn t seem to consider him quite one of themselves somehow though missus Sheridan mentioned that a couple of years or so ago he had been right sick and had been to some cure or other They seemed relieved to bring the subject back to Jim and his virtues and to look at me The other brother is the middle one Roscoe he s the one that owns the new house across the street where that young black sheep of the Lamhorns Robert goes so often I saw a short dark young man standing on the porch with Robert Lamhorn there the other day so I suppose that was Roscoe Jim still lurks in the mists but I shall meet him to night Papa She stepped nearer to him so that he had to face her and his eyes were troubled as he did There may have been a trouble deep within her own but she kept their surface merry with laughter Papa Bibbs is the youngest one s name and Bibbs to the best of our information is a lunatic Roscoe is married Papa does it have to be Jim Mary missus Vertrees cried sharply You re outrageous That s a perfectly horrible way of talking Well I m close to twenty four said Mary turning to her I haven t been able to like anybody yet that s asked me to marry him and maybe I never shall Until a year or so ago I ve had everything I ever wanted in my life you and papa gave it all to me and it s about time I began to pay back Unfortunately I don t know how to do anything but something s got to be done But you needn t talk of it like THAT insisted the mother plaintively It s not it s not No it s not said Mary I know that How did they happen to ask you to dinner mister Vertrees inquired uneasily Stextrawdn ry thing Climbers hospitality Mary defined it We were so very cordial and easy I think missus Sheridan herself might have done it just as any kind old woman on a farm might ask a neighbor but it was Miss Sheridan who did it She played around it awhile you could see she wanted to she s in a dreadful hurry to get into things and I fancied she had an idea it might impress that Lamhorn boy to find us there to night It s a sort of house warming dinner and they talked about it and talked about it and then the girl got her courage up and blurted out the invitation And mamma Here Mary was once more a victim to incorrigible merriment Mamma tried to say yes and COULDN T She swallowed and squealed I mean you coughed dear And then papa she said that you and she had promised to go to a lecture at the Emerson Club to night but that her daughter would be delighted to come to the Big Show So there I am and there s mister Jim Sheridan and there s the clock Dinner s at seven thirty And she ran out of the room scooping up her fallen furs with a gesture of flying grace as she sped When she came down at twenty minutes after seven her father stood in the hall at the foot of the stairs waiting to be her escort through the dark He looked up and watched her as she descended and his gaze was fond and proud and profoundly disturbed But she smiled and nodded gaily and when she reached the floor put a hand on his shoulder At least no one could suspect me to night she said I LOOK rich don t I papa She did She had a look that worshipful girl friends bravely called regal A head taller than her father she was as straight and jauntily poised as a boy athlete and her brown hair and her brown eyes were like her mother s but for the rest she went back to some stronger and livelier ancestor than either of her parents Don t I look too rich to be suspected she insisted You look everything beautiful Mary he said huskily And my dress She threw open her dark velvet cloak showing a splendor of white and silver Anything better at Nice next winter do you think She laughed shrouding her glittering figure in the cloak again

none	none	old and no one would dream it I did it over You can do anything Mary There was a curious humility in his tone and something more a significance not veiled and yet abysmally apologetic It was as if he suggested something to her and begged her forgiveness in the same breath And upon that for the moment she became as serious as he She lifted her hand from his shoulder and then set it back more firmly so that he should feel the reassurance of its pressure Don t worry she said in a low voice and gravely I know exactly what you want me to do CHAPTER VI It was a brave and lustrous banquet and a noisy one too because there was an orchestra among some plants at one end of the long dining room and after a preliminary stiffness the guests were impelled to converse necessarily at the tops of their voices The whole company of fifty sat at a great oblong table improvised for the occasion by carpenters but not betraying itself as an improvisation it seemed a permanent continent of damask and lace with shores of crystal and silver running up to spreading groves of orchids and lilies and white roses an inhabited continent evidently for there were three marvelous gleaming buildings one in the center and one at each end white miracles wrought by some inspired craftsman in sculptural icing They were models in miniature and they represented the Sheridan Building the Sheridan Apartments and the Pump Works Nearly all the guests recognized them without having to be told what they were and pronounced the likenesses superb The arrangement of the table was visibly baronial At the head sat the great Thane with the flower of his family and of the guests about him then on each side came the neighbors of the old house grading down to vassals and retainers superintendents cashiers heads of departments and the like at the foot where the Thane s lady took her place as a consolation for the less important Here too among the thralls and bondmen sat Bibbs Sheridan a meek Banquo wondering how anybody could look at him and eat Nevertheless there was a vast continuous eating for these were wholesome folk who understood that dinner meant something intended for introduction into the system by means of an aperture in the face devised by nature for that express purpose And besides nobody looked at Bibbs He was better content to be left to himself his voice was not strong enough to make itself heard over the hubbub without an exhausting effort and the talk that went on about him was too fast and too fragmentary for his drawl to keep pace with it So he felt relieved when each of his neighbors in turn after a polite inquiry about his health turned to seek livelier responses in other directions For the talk went on with the eating incessantly It rose over the throbbing of the orchestra and the clatter and clinking of silver and china and glass and there was a mighty babble Yes sir Started without a dollar Yellow flounces on the overskirt I says Wilkie your department s got to go bigger this year I says Fifteen per cent turnover in thirty one weeks One of the biggest men in the biggest The wife says she ll have to let out my pants if my appetite Say did you see that statue of a Turk in the hall One of the finest things I ever Not a dollar not a nickel not one red cent do you get out o me I says and so he ups and Yes the baby makes four they ve lost now Well they got their raise and they went in big Yes sir Not a dollar to his name and look at what You

none	none	The population of this town s goin to hit the million mark before she stops Well if you can show me a bigger deal than And through the interstices of this clamoring Bibbs could hear the continual booming of his father s heavy voice and once he caught the sentence Yes young lady that s just what did it for me and that s just what ll do it for my boys they got to make two blades o grass grow where one grew before It was his familiar flourish an old story to Bibbs and now jovially declaimed for the edification of Mary Vertrees It was a great night for Sheridan the very crest of his wave He sat there knowing himself Thane and master by his own endeavor and his big smooth red face grew more and more radiant with good will and with the simplest happiest most boy like vanity He was the picture of health of good cheer and of power on a holiday He had thirty teeth none bought and showed most of them when he laughed his grizzled hair was thick and as unruly as a farm laborer s his chest was deep and big beneath its vast facade of starched white linen where little diamonds twinkled circling three large pearls his hands were stubby and strong and he used them freely in gestures of marked picturesqueness and though he had grown fat at chin and waist and wrist he had not lost the look of readiness and activity He dominated the table shouting jocular questions and railleries at every one His idea was that when people were having a good time they were noisy and his own additions to the hubbub increased his pleasure and of course met the warmest encouragement from his guests Edith had discovered that he had very foggy notions of the difference between a band and an orchestra and when it was made clear to him he had held out for a band until Edith threatened tears but the size of the orchestra they hired consoled him and he had now no regrets in the matter He kept time to the music continually with his feet or pounding on the table with his fist and sometimes with spoon or knife upon his plate or a glass without permitting these side products to interfere with the real business of eating and shouting Tell em to play Nancy Lee he would bellow down the length of the table to his wife while the musicians were in the midst of the Toreador song perhaps Ask that fellow if they don t know Nancy Lee And when the leader would shake his head apologetically in answer to an obedient shriek from missus Sheridan the Toreador continuing vehemently Sheridan would roar half remembered fragments of Nancy Lee naturally mingling some Bizet with the air of that uxorious tribute Oh there she stands and waves her hands while I m away A sail er s wife a sail er s star should be Yo ho oh oh Oh Nancy Nancy Nancy Lee Oh Na hancy Lee HAY there old lady he would bellow Tell em to play In the Gloaming In the gloaming oh my darling la la lum tee Well if they don t know that what s the matter with Larboard Watch Ahoy THAT S good music That s the kind o music I like Come on now missus Callin get em singin down in your part o the table What s the matter you folks down there anyway Larboard watch ahoy What joy he feels as ta tum dum tee dee dum steals La a r board watch ahoy No external bubbling contributed to this effervescence the Sheridans table had never borne wine and more because of timidity about it than conviction it bore none now though mineral waters were copiously poured from bottles wrapped for some reason in napkins and proved wholly satisfactory to almost all of the guests And certainly no wine could have inspired more turbulent good spirits in the host Not even Bibbs was an alloy in this night s happiness for as missus Sheridan had said he had plans for Bibbs plans which were going to straighten out some things that had gone wrong So he pounded the table and boomed his echoes of old songs and then forgetting these would renew his friendly railleries or perhaps turning to Mary Vertrees who sat near him round the corner of the table at his right he would become autobiographical Gentlemen less naive than he had paid her that tribute for she was a girl who inspired the autobiographical impulse in every man who met her it needed but the sight of her The dinner seemed somehow to center about Mary Vertrees and the jocund host as a play centers about its hero and heroine they were the rubicund king and the starry princess of this spectacle they paid court to each other and everybody paid court to them Down near the sugar Pump Works where Bibbs sat there was audible speculation and admiration Wonder who that lady is makin such a hit with the old man Must be some heiress Heiress Golly I guess I could stand it to marry rich then Edith and Sibyl were radiant at first they had watched Miss Vertrees with an almost haggard anxiety wondering what disasterous effect Sheridan s pastoral gaieties and other things would have upon her but she seemed delighted with everything and with him most of all She treated him as if he were some delicious foolish old joke that she understood perfectly laughing at him almost violently when he bragged probably his first experience of that kind in his life It enchanted him As he proclaimed to the table she had a way with her She had indeed as Roscoe Sheridan upon her right discovered just after the feast began Since his marriage three years before no lady had bestowed upon him so protracted a full view of brilliant eyes and with the look his lovely neighbor said and it was her first speech to him I hope you re very susceptible mister Sheridan Honest Roscoe was taken aback and Why was all he managed to say She repeated the look deliberately which was noted with a mystification equal to his own by his sister across the table No one reflected Edith could image Mary Vertrees the sort of girl who would really flirt with married men she was obviously the opposite of all that Edith defined her as a thoroughbred a nice girl and the look given to Roscoe was astounding Roscoe s wife saw it too and she was another whom it puzzled though not because its recipient was married Because said Mary Vertrees replying to Roscoe s monosyllable And also because we re next door neighbors at table and it s dull times ahead for both of us if we don t get along Roscoe was a literal young man all stocks and bonds and he had been brought up to believe that when a man married he married and settled down It was all right he felt for a man as old as his father to pay florid compliments to as pretty a girl as this Miss Vertrees but for himself a young married man it wouldn t do and it wouldn t even be quite moral He knew that young married people might have friendships like his wife s for Lamhorn but Sibyl and Lamhorn never flirted they were always very matter of fact with each other Roscoe would have been troubled if Sibyl had ever told Lamhorn she hoped he was susceptible Yes we re neighbors he said awkwardly Next door neighbors in houses too she added No not exactly I live across the street Why no she exclaimed and seemed startled Your mother told me this afternoon that you lived at home Yes of course I live at home I built that new house across the street But you she paused confused and then slowly a deep color came into her cheek But I understood No he said my wife and I lived with the old folks the first year but that s all Edith and Jim live with them of course I I see she said the deep color still deepening as she turned from him and saw written upon a card before the gentleman at her left the name mister James Sheridan junior And from that moment Roscoe had little enough cause for wondering what he ought to reply to her disturbing coquetries mister James Sheridan had been anxiously waiting for the dazzling visitor to get through with old Roscoe as he thought of it and give a bachelor a chance Old Roscoe was the younger but he had always been the steady wheel horse of the family Jim was steady enough but was considered livelier than Roscoe which in truth is not saying much for Jim s liveliness As their father habitually boasted both brothers were capable hard working young business men and the principal difference between them was merely that which resulted from Jim s being still a bachelor Physically they were of the same type dark of eyes and of hair fresh colored and thick set and though Roscoe was several inches taller than Jim neither was of the height breadth or depth of the father Both wore young business men s mustaches and either could have sat for the tailor shop lithographs of young business men wearing rich suitings in dark mixtures Jim approving warmly of his neighbor s profile perceived her access of color which increased his approbation What s that old Roscoe saying to you Miss Vertrees he asked These young married men are mighty forward nowadays but you mustn t let em make you blush Am I blushing she said Are you sure And with that she gave him ample opportunity to make sure repeating with interest the look wasted upon Roscoe I think you must be mistaken she continued I think it s your brother who is blushing I ve thrown him into confusion How She laughed and then leaning to him a little said in a tone as confidential as she could make it under cover of the uproar By trying to begin with him a courtship

none	none	for YOU This might well be a style new to Jim and it was He supposed it a nonsensical form of badinage and yet it took his breath He realized that he wished what she said to be the literal truth and he was instantly snared by that realization By George he said I guess you re the kind of girl that can say anything yes and get away with it too She laughed again in her way so that he could not tell whether she was laughing at him or at herself or at the nonsense she was talking and she said But you see I don t care whether I get away with it or not I wish you d tell me frankly if you think I ve got a change to get away with YOU More like if you ve got a chance to get away FROM me Jim was inspired to reply Not one in the world especially after beginning by making fun of me like that I mightn t be so much in fun as you think she said regarding him with sudden gravity Well said Jim in simple honesty you re a funny girl Her gravity continued an instant longer I may not turn out to be funny for YOU So long as you turn out to be anything at all for me I expect I can manage to be satisfied And with that to his own surprise it was his turn to blush whereupon she laughed again Yes he said plaintively not wholly lacking intuition I can see you re the sort of girl that would laugh the minute you see a man really means anything Laugh she cried gaily Why it might be a matter of life and death But if you want tragedy I d better put the question at once considering the mistake I made with your brother Jim was dazed She seemed to be playing a little game of mockery and nonsense with him but he had glimpses of a flashing danger in it he was but too sensible of being outclassed and had somewhere a consciousness that he could never quite know this giddy and alluring lady no matter how long it pleased her to play with him But he mightily wanted her to keep on playing with him Put what question he said breathlessly As you are a new neighbor of mine and of my family she returned speaking slowly and with a cross examiner s severity I think it would be well for me to know at once whether you are already walking out with any young lady or not mister Sheridan think well Are you spoken for Not yet he gasped Are you

none	none	and with that they both laughed again and the pastime proceeded increasing both in its gaiety and in its gravity Observing its continuance mister Robert Lamhorn opposite turned from a lively conversation with Edith and remarked covertly to Sibyl that Miss Vertrees was starting rather picturesquely with Jim And he added languidly Do you suppose she WOULD For the moment Sibyl gave no sign of having heard him but seemed interested in the clasp of a long rope of pearls a loop of which she was allowing to swing from her fingers resting her elbow upon the table and following with her eyes the twinkle of diamonds and platinum in the clasp at the end of the loop She wore many jewels She was pretty but hers was not the kind of prettiness to be loaded with too sumptuous accessories and jeweled head dresses are dangerous they may emphasize the wrongness of the wearer I said Miss Vertrees seems to be starting pretty strong with Jim repeated mister Lamhorn I heard you There was a latent discontent always somewhere in her eyes no matter what she threw upon the surface of cover it and just now she did not care to cover it she looked sullen Starting any stronger than you did with Edith she inquired Oh keep the peace he said crossly That s off of course You haven t been making her see it this evening precisely said Sibyl looking at him steadily You ve talked to her for For Heaven s sake he begged keep the peace Well what have you just been doing SH he said Listen to your father in law Sheridan was booming and braying louder than ever the orchestra having begun to play The Rosary to his vast content I COUNT THEM OVER LA LA TUM TEE DUM he roared beating the measures with his fork EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL TEE DUM TUM DUM What s the matter with all you folks Why n t you SING Miss Vertrees I bet a thousand dollars YOU sing Why n t mister Sheridan she said turning cheerfully from the ardent Jim you don t know what you interrupted Your son isn t used to my rough ways and my soldier s wooing frightens him but I think he was about to say something important I ll say something important to him if he doesn t the father threatened more delighted with her than ever By gosh if I was his age or a widower right NOW Oh wait cried Mary If they d only make less noise I want missus Sheridan to hear She d say the same he shouted She d tell me I was mighty slow if I couldn t get ahead o Jim Why when I was his age You must listen to your father Mary interrupted turning to Jim who had grown red again He s going to tell us how when he was your age he made those two blades of grass grow out of a teacup and you could see for yourself he didn t get them out of his sleeve At that Sheridan pounded the table till it jumped Look here young lady he roared Some o these days I m either goin to slap you or I m goin to kiss you Edith looked aghast she was afraid this was indeed too awful but Mary Vertrees burst into ringing laughter Both she cried Both The one to make me forget the other But which he began and then suddenly gave forth such stentorian trumpetings of mirth that for once the whole table stopped to listen Jim he roared if you don t propose to that girl to night I ll send you back to the machine shop with Bibbs And Bibbs down among the retainers by the sugar Pump Works and watching Mary Vertrees as a ragged boy in the street might watch a rich little girl in a garden Bibbs heard He heard and he knew what his father s plans were now CHAPTER VII missus Vertrees sat up for her daughter mister Vertrees having retired after a restless evening not much soothed by the society of his Landseers Mary had taken a key insisting that he should not come for her and seeming confident that she would not lack for escort nor did the sequel prove her confidence unwarranted But missus Vertrees had a long vigil of it She was not the woman to make herself easy no servant had ever seen her in a wrapper and with her hair and dress and her shoes just what they had been when she returned from the afternoon s call she sat through the slow night hours in a stiff little chair under the gaslight in her own room which was directly over the front hall There book in hand she employed the time in her own reminiscences though it was her belief that she was reading Madame de Remusat s Her thoughts went backward into her life and into her husband s and the deeper into the past they went the brighter the pictures they brought her and there is tragedy Like her husband she thought backward because she did not dare think forward definitely What thinking forward this troubled couple ventured took the form of a slender hope which neither of them could have borne to hear put in words and yet they had talked it over day after day from the very hour when they heard Sheridan was to build his New House next door For so quickly does any ideal of human behavior become an antique their youth was of the innocent old days so dead of breeding and gentility and no craft had been more straitly trained upon them than that of talking about things without mentioning them Herein was marked the most vital difference between mister and missus Vertrees and their big new neighbor Sheridan though his youth was of the same epoch knew nothing of such matters He had been chopping wood for the morning fire in the country grocery while they were still dancing It was after one o clock when missus Vertrees heard steps and the delicate clinking of the key in the lock and then with the opening of the door Mary s laugh and Yes if you aren t afraid to morrow The door closed and she rushed up stairs bringing with her a breath of cold and bracing air into her mother s room Yes she said before missus Vertrees could speak he brought me home She let her cloak fall upon the bed and drawing an old red velvet rocking chair forward sat beside her mother after giving her a light pat upon the shoulder and a hearty kiss upon the cheek Mamma Mary exclaimed when missus Vertrees had expressed a hope that she had enjoyed the evening and had not caught cold Why don t you ask me This inquiry obviously made her mother uncomfortable I don t she faltered Ask you what Mary How I got along and what he s like Mary Oh it isn t distressing said Mary And I got along so fast She broke off to laugh continuing then But that s the way I went at it of course We ARE in a hurry aren t we I don t know what you mean missus Vertrees insisted shaking her head plaintively Yes said Mary I m going out in his car with him to morrow afternoon and to the theater the next night but I stopped it there You see after you give the first push you must leave it to them while YOU pretend to run away My dear I don t know what to What to make of anything Mary finished for her So that s all right Now I ll tell you all about it It was gorgeous and deafening and tee total We could have lived a year on it I m not good at figures but I calculated that if we lived six months on poor old Charlie and Ned and the station wagon and the Victoria we could manage at least twice as long on the cost of the house warming I think the orchids alone would have lasted us a couple of months There they were before me 
3982_178459_000056_000020	train-clean-100	but I couldn t 
none	none	steal em and sell em and so well so I did what I could She leaned back and laughed reassuringly to her troubled mother It seemed to be a success what I could she said clasping her hands behind her neck and stirring the rocker to motion as a rhythmic accompaniment to her narrative The girl Edith and her sister in law missus Roscoe Sheridan were too anxious about the effect of things on me The father s worth a bushel of both of them if they knew it He s what he is I like him She paused reflectively continuing Edith s interested in that Lamhorn boy he s good looking and not stupid but I think he s She interrupted herself with a cheery outcry Oh I mustn t be calling him names If he s trying to make Edith like him I ought to respect him as a colleague I don t understand a thing you re talking about missus Vertrees complained All the better Well he s a bad lot that Lamhorn boy everybody s always known that but the Sheridans don t know the everybodies that know He sat between Edith and missus Roscoe Sheridan SHE S like those people you wondered about at the theater the last time we went dressed in ball gowns bound to show their clothes and jewels SOMEwhere She flatters the father and so did I for that matter but not that way I treated him outrageously Mary That s what flattered him After dinner he made the whole regiment of us follow him all over the house while he lectured like a guide on the Palatine He gave dimensions and costs and the whole b ilin of em listened as if they thought he intended to make them a present of the house What he was proudest of was the plumbing and that Bay of Naples panorama in the hall He made us look at all the plumbing bath rooms and everywhere else and then he made us look at the Bay of Naples He said it was a hundred and eleven feet long but I think it s more And he led us all into the ready made library to see a poem Edith had taken a prize with at school They d had it printed in gold letters and framed in mother of pearl But the poem itself was rather simple and wistful and nice he read it to us though Edith tried to stop him She was modest about it and said she d never written anything else And then after a while missus Roscoe Sheridan asked me to come across the street to her house with them her husband and Edith and mister Lamhorn and Jim Sheridan missus Vertrees was shocked Jim she exclaimed Mary PLEASE Of course said Mary I ll make it as easy for you as I can mamma mister James Sheridan Junior We went over there and missus Roscoe explained that the men were all dying for a drink though I noticed that mister Lamhorn was the only one near death s door on that account Edith and missus Roscoe said they knew I d been bored at the dinner They were objectionably apologetic about it and they seemed to think NOW we were going to have a good time to make up for it But I hadn t been bored at the dinner I d been amused and the good time at missus Roscoe s was horribly horribly stupid But Mary her mother began is is And she seemed unable to complete the question Never mind mamma I ll say it Is mister James Sheridan Junior stupid I m sure he s not at all stupid about business Otherwise Oh what right have I to be calling people stupid because they re not exactly my kind On the big dinner table they had enormous icing models of the Sheridan Building Oh no missus Vertrees cried Surely not Yes and two other things of that kind I don t know what But after all I wondered if they were so bad If I d been at a dinner at a palace in Italy and a relief or inscription on one of the old silver pieces had referred to some great deed or achievement of the family I shouldn t have felt superior I d have thought it picturesque and stately I d have been impressed And what s the real difference The icing is temporary and that s much more modest isn t it And why is it vulgar to feel important more on account of something you ve done yourself than because of something one of your ancestors did Besides if we go back a few generations we ve all got such hundreds of ancestors it seems idiotic to go picking out one or two to be proud of ourselves about Well then mamma I managed not to feel superior to mister James Sheridan Junior because he didn t see anything out of place in the Sheridan Building in sugar missus Vertrees s expression had lost none of its anxiety pending the conclusion of this lively bit of analysis and she shook her head gravely My dear dear child she said it seems to me It looks I m afraid Say as much of it as you can mamma said Mary encouragingly I can get it if you ll just give me one key word Everything you say missus Vertrees began timidly seems to have the air of it is as if you were seeking to to make yourself Oh I see You mean I sound as if I were trying to force myself to like him Not exactly Mary That wasn t quite what I meant said missus Vertrees speaking direct untruth with perfect unconsciousness But you said that that you found the latter part of the evening at young missus Sheridan s unentertaining And as mister James Sheridan was there and I saw more of him than at dinner and had a horribly stupid time in spite of that you think I And then it was Mary who left the deduction unfinished missus Vertrees nodded and though both the mother and the daughter understood Mary felt it better to make the understanding definite Well she asked gravely is there anything else I can do You and papa don t want me to do anything that distresses me and so as this is the only thing to be done it seems it s up to me not to let it distress me That s all there is about it isn t it But nothing MUST distress you the mother cried That s what I say said Mary cheerfully And so it doesn t It s all right She rose and took her cloak over her arm as if to go to her own room But on the way to the door she stopped and stood leaning against the foot of the bed contemplating a threadbare rug at her feet Mother you ve told me a thousand times that it doesn t really matter whom a girl marries No no missus Vertrees protested I never said such a No not in words I mean what you MEANT It s true isn t it that marriage really is not a bed of roses but a field of battle To get right down to it a girl could fight it out with anybody couldn t she One man as well as another Oh my dear I m sure your father and I Yes yes said Mary indulgently I don t mean you and papa But isn t it propinquity that makes marriages So many people say so there must be something in it Mary I can t bear for you to talk like that And missus Vertrees lifted pleading eyes to her daughter eyes that begged to be spared It sounds almost reckless Mary caught the appeal came to her and kissed her gaily Never fret dear I m not likely to do anything I don t want to do I ve always been too thorough going a little pig And if it IS propinquity that does our choosing for us well at least no girl in the world could ask for more than THAT How could there be any more propinquity than the very house next door She gave her mother a final kiss and went gaily all the way to the door this time pausing for her postscript with her hand on the knob Oh the one that caught me looking in the window mamma the youngest one Did he speak of it missus Vertrees asked apprehensively No He didn t speak at all that I saw to any one I didn t meet him But he isn t insane I m sure or if he is he has long intervals when he s not mister James Sheridan mentioned that he lived at home when he was well enough and it may be he s only an invalid He looks dreadfully ill but he has pleasant eyes and it struck me that if if one were in the Sheridan family she laughed a little ruefully he might be interesting to talk to sometimes when there was too much stocks and bonds I didn t see him after dinner There must be something wrong with him said missus Vertrees They d have introduced him if there wasn t I don t know He s been ill so much and away so much sometimes people like that just don t seem to count in a family His father spoke of sending him back to a machine shop or some sort I suppose he meant when the poor thing gets better I glanced at him just then when mister Sheridan mentioned him and he happened to be looking straight at me and he was pathetic looking enough before that but the most tragic change came over him He seemed just to die right there at the table You mean when his father spoke of sending him to the shop place Yes mister Sheridan must be very unfeeling No said Mary thoughtfully I don t think he is but he might be uncomprehending and certainly he s the kind of man to do anything he once sets out to do But I wish I hadn t been looking at that poor boy just then I m afraid I ll keep remembering I wouldn t missus Vertrees smiled faintly and in her smile there was the remotest ghost of a genteel roguishness I d keep my mind on pleasanter things Mary Mary laughed and nodded Yes indeed Plenty pleasant enough and probably if all were known too good even for me And when she had gone missus Vertrees drew a long breath as if a burden were off her mind and smiling began to undress in a gentle reverie CHAPTER VIII Edith glancing casually into the ready made library stopped abruptly seeing Bibbs there alone He was standing before the pearl framed and golden lettered poem musingly inspecting it He read it FUGITIVE I will forget the things that sting The lashing look the barbed word I know the very hands that fling The stones at me had never stirred To anger but for their own scars They ve suffered so that s why they strike I ll keep my heart among the stars Where none shall hunt it out Oh like These wounded ones I must not be For wounded I might strike in turn So none shall hurt me Far and free Where my heart flies no one shall learn Bibbs Edith s voice was angry and her color deepened suddenly as she came into the room preceded by a scent of violets much more powerful than that warranted by the actual bunch of them upon the lapel of her coat Bibbs did not turn his head but wagged it solemnly seeming depressed by the poem Pretty young isn t it he said There must have been something about your looks that got the prize Edith I can t believe the poem did it She glanced hurriedly over her shoulder and spoke sharply but in a low voice I don t think it s very nice of you to bring it up at all Bibbs I d like a chance to forget the whole silly business I didn t want them to frame it and I wish to goodness papa d quit talking about it but here that night after the dinner didn t he go and read it aloud to the whole crowd of em And then they all wanted to know what other poems I d written and why I didn t keep it up and write some more and if I didn t why didn t I and why this and why that till I thought I d die of shame You could tell em you had writer s cramp Bibbs suggested I couldn t tell em anything I just choke with mortification every time anybody speaks of the thing Bibbs looked grieved The poem isn t THAT bad Edith You see you were only seventeen when you wrote it Oh hush up she snapped I wish it had burnt my fingers the first time I touched it Then I might have had sense enough to leave it where it was I had no business to take it and I ve been ashamed No no he said comfortingly It was the very most flattering thing ever happen to me It was almost my last flight before I went to the machine shop and it s pleasant to think somebody liked it enough to But I DON T like it she exclaimed I don t even understand it and papa made so much fuss over its getting the prize I just hate it The truth is I never dreamed it d get the prize Maybe they expected father to endow the school Bibbs murmured Well I had to have something to turn in and I couldn t write a LINE I hate poetry anyhow and Bobby Lamhorn s always teasing me about how I keep my heart among the stars He makes it seem such a mushy kind of thing the way he says it I hate it You ll have to live it down Edith Perhaps abroad and under another name you might find Oh hush up I ll hire some one to steal it and burn it the first chance I get She turned away petulantly moving to the door I d like to think I could hope to hear the last of it before I die Edith he called as she went into the hall What s the matter I want to ask you Do I really look better or have you just got used to me What on earth do you mean she said coming back as far as the threshold When I first came

none	none	in his impersonal way But I ve noticed you look at me lately I wondered if I d It s because you look so much better she told him cheerfully This month you ve been here s done you no end of good It s the change Yes that s what they said at the sanitarium the change You look worse than most anybody I ever saw said Edith with supreme candor But I don t know much about it I ve never seen a corpse in my life and I ve never even seen anybody that was terribly sick so you mustn t judge by me I only know you do look better I m glad to say But you re right about my not being able to look at you at first You had a kind of whiteness that Well you re almost as thin I suppose but you ve got more just ordinarily pale not that ghastly look Anybody could look at you now Bibbs and no not get Sick Well almost that she laughed And you re getting a better color every day Bibbs you really are You re getting along splendidly I I m afraid so he said ruefully Afraid so Well if you aren t the queerest I suppose you mean father might send you back to the machine shop if you get well enough I heard him say something about it the night of the The jingle of a distant bell interrupted her and she glanced at her watch Bobby Lamhorn I m going to motor him out to look at a place in the country Afternoon Bibbs When she had gone Bibbs mooned pessimistically from shelf to shelf his eye wandering among the titles of the books The library consisted almost entirely of handsome uniform editions Irving Poe Cooper Goldsmith Scott Byron Burns Longfellow Tennyson Hume Gibbon Prescott Thackeray Dickens De Musset Balzac Gautier Flaubert Goethe Schiller Dante and Tasso There were shelves and shelves of encyclopedias of anthologies of famous classics of Oriental masterpieces of masterpieces of oratory and more shelves of selected libraries of literature of the drama and of modern science They made an effective decoration for the room all these big expensive books with a glossy binding here and there twinkling a reflection of the flames that crackled in the splendid Gothic fireplace but Bibbs had an impression that the bookseller who selected them considered them a relief and that white jacket considered them a burden of dust and that nobody else considered them at all Himself he disturbed not one There came a chime of bells from a clock in another part of the house and white jacket appeared beamingly in the doorway bearing furs Awready Mist Bibbs he announced You ma say wrap up wawm f you ride an she cain go with you to day an not f git go see you pa at fo clock Aw ready suh He equipped Bibbs for the daily drive doctor Gurney had commanded and in the manner of a master of ceremonies unctuously led the way In the hall they passed the Moor and Bibbs paused before it while white jacket opened the door with a flourish and waved condescendingly to the chauffeur in the car which stood waiting in the driveway It seems to me I asked you what you thought about this statue when I first came home George said Bibbs thoughtfully What did you tell me Yessuh George chuckled perfectly understanding that for some unknown reason Bibbs enjoyed hearing him repeat his opinion of the Moor You ast me when you firs come home an you ast me nex day an mighty near ev y day all time you been here an las Sunday you ast me twicet He shook his head solemnly Look to me mus be somep m might lamiDAL bout at statue Mighty what Mighty lamiDAL George burst out laughing What DO at word mean Mist Bibbs It s new to me George Where did you hear it I nev DID hear it said George I uz dess sittin thinkum to myse f an she pop in my head lamiDAL dess like at An she soun so good seem like she GOTTA mean somep m Come to think of it I believe she does mean something Why yes Do she cried George WHAT she mean It s exactly the word for the statue said Bibbs with conviction as he climbed into the car It s a lamiDAL statue Hiyi George exulted Man Man Listen Well suh she mighty lamiDAL statue but lamiDAL statue heap o trouble to dus I expect she is said Bibbs as the engine began to churn and a moment later he was swept from sight George turned to Mist Jackson who had been listening benevolently in the hallway Same he aw ways say Mist Jackson I expec she is Ev y day he try t git me talk bout at lamiDAL statue an aw ways las thing HE say I expec she is You know Mist Jackson if he git well at young man go be pride o the family Mist Jackson Yes suh right now I pick im fo firs money Look out with all at money George Jackson warned the enthusiast White folks n is house know im heap longer n you You the on y man bettin on im I risk it cried George merrily I put her all on now ev y cent At boy s go be flower o the flock This singular prophecy founded somewhat recklessly upon gratitude for the meaning of lamiDAL differed radically from another prediction concerning Bibbs set forth for the benefit of a fair auditor some twenty minutes later Jim Sheridan skirting the edges of the town with Mary Vertrees beside him in his own swift machine encountered the invalid upon the highroad The two cars were going in opposite directions and the occupants of Jim s had only a swaying glimpse of Bibbs sitting alone on the back seat his white face startlingly white against cap and collar of black fur but he flashed into recognition as Mary bowed to him Jim waved his left hand carelessly It s Bibbs taking his constitutional he explained Yes I know said Mary I bowed to him too though I ve never met him In fact I ve only seen him once no twice I hope he won t think I m very bold bowing to him I doubt if he noticed it said honest Jim Oh no she cried What s the trouble I m almost sure people notice it when I bow to them Oh I see said Jim Of course they would ordinarily but Bibbs is funny Is he How she asked He strikes me as anything but funny Well I m his brother Jim said deprecatingly but I don t know what he s like and to tell the truth I ve never felt exactly like I WAS his brother the way

talking about the weather all the way I said that I do not believe I shall ever care for any man and that is true I doubt the existence of the kind of caring we hear about in poems and plays and

fields and sun flecked groves of gray trees to breathe the rushing clean air beneath a glorious sky that sky so despised in the city and so maltreated there that from early October to mid May it was impossible for men to remember that blue is the rightful color overhead Upon each of Bibbs s cheeks there was a hint of something almost resembling a pinkishness not actual color but undeniably its phantom How largely this apparition may have been the work of the wind upon his face it is difficult to calculate for beyond a doubt it was partly the result of a lady s bowing to him upon no more formal introduction than the circumstance of his having caught her looking into his window a month before She had bowed definitely she had bowed charmingly And it seemed to Bibbs that she must have meant to convey her forgiveness There had been something in her recognition of him unfamiliar to his experience and he rode the warmer for it Nor did he lack the impression that he would long remember her as he had just seen her her veil tumultuously blowing back her face glowing in the wind and that look of gay friendliness tossed to him like a fresh rose in carnival By and by upon a rising ground the driver halted the car then backed and tacked and sent it forward again with its nose to the south and the smoke Far before him Bibbs saw the great smudge upon the horizon that nest of cloud in which the city strove and panted like an engine shrouded in its own steam But to Bibbs who had now to go to the very heart of it for a commanded interview with his father the distant cloud was like an implacable genius issuing thunderously in smoke from his enchanted bottle and irresistibly drawing Bibbs nearer and nearer They passed from the farm lands and came in the amber light of November late afternoon to the farthermost outskirts of the city and here the sky shimmered upon the verge of change from blue to gray the smoke did not visibly permeate the air but it was there nevertheless impalpable thin no more than the dust of smoke And then as the car drove on the chimneys and stacks of factories came swimming up into view like miles of steamers advancing abreast every funnel with its vast plume savage and black sweeping to the horizon dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation over league on league already rich and vile with grime The sky had become only a dingy thickening of the soiled air and a roar and clangor of metals beat deafeningly on Bibbs s ears And now the car passed two great blocks of long brick buildings hideous in all ways possible to make them hideous doorways showing dark one moment and lurid the next with the leap of some virulent interior flame revealing blackened giants half naked in passionate action struggling with formless things in the hot illumination And big as these shops were they were growing bigger spreading over a third block where two new structures were mushrooming to completion in some hasty cement process of a stability not over reassuring Bibbs pulled the rug closer about him and not even the phantom of color was left upon his cheeks as he passed this place for he knew it too well Across the face of one of the buildings there was an enormous sign Sheridan Automatic Pump company Inc Thence they went through streets of wooden houses all grimed and adding their own grime from many a sooty chimney flimsey wooden houses of a thousand flimsy whimsies in the fashioning built on narrow lots and nudging one another crossly shutting out the stingy sunlight from one another bad neighbors who would destroy one another root and branch some night when the right wind blew They were only waiting for that wind and a cigarette and then they would all be gone together a pinch of incense burned upon the tripod of the god Along these streets there were skinny shade trees and here and there a forest elm or walnut had been left but these were dying Some people said it was the scale some said it was the smoke and some were sure that asphalt and improving the streets did it but Bigness was in too Big a hurry to bother much about trees He had telegraph poles and telephone poles and electric light poles and trolley poles by the thousand to take their places So he let the trees die and put up his poles They were hideous but nobody minded that and sometimes the wires fell and killed people but not often enough to matter at all Thence onward the car bore Bibbs through the older parts of the town where the few solid old houses not already demolished were in transition some with their fronts torn away were being made into segments of apartment buildings others had gone uproariously into trade brazenly putting forth show windows on their first floors seeming to mean it for a joke one or two with unaltered facades peeped humorously over the tops of temporary office buildings of one story erected in the old front yards Altogether the town here was like a boarding house hash the Sunday after Thanksgiving the old ingredients were discernible This was the fringe of Bigness s own sanctuary and now Bibbs reached the roaring holy of holies itself The car must stop at every crossing while the dark garbed crowds enveloped in maelstroms of dust hurried before it Magnificent new buildings already dingy loomed hundreds of feet above him newer ones more magnificent were rising beside them rising higher old buildings were coming down middle aged buildings were coming down the streets were laid open to their entrails and men worked underground between palisades and overhead in metal cobwebs like spiders in the sky Trolley cars and long interurban cars built to split the wind like torpedo boats clanged and shrieked their way round swarming corners motor cars of every kind and shape known to man babbled frightful warnings and frantic demands hospital ambulances clamored wildly for passage steam whistles signaled the swinging of titanic tentacle and claw riveters rattled like machine guns the ground shook to the thunder of gigantic trucks and the conglomerate sound of it all was the sound of earthquake playing accompaniments for battle and sudden death On one of the new steel buildings no work was being done that afternoon The building had killed a man in the morning and the steel workers always stop for the day when that happens And in the hurrying crowds swirling and sifting through the brobdingnagian camp of iron and steel one saw the camp followers and the pagan women there would be work to day and dancing to night For the Puritan s dry voice is but the crackling of a leaf underfoot in the rush and roar of the coming of the new Egypt Bibbs was on time He knew it must be to the minute or his father would consider it an outrage and the big chronometer in Sheridan s office marked four precisely when Bibbs walked in Coincidentally with his entrance five people who had been at work in the office under Sheridan s direction walked out They departed upon no visible or audible suggestion and with a promptness that seemed ominous to the new comer As the massive door clicked softly behind the elderly stenographer the last of the procession Bibbs had a feeling that they all understood that he was a failure as a great man s son a disappointment the queer one of the family and that he had been summoned to judgment a well founded impression for that was exactly what they understood Sit down said Sheridan It is frequently an advantage for deans school masters and worried fathers to place delinquents in the sitting posture Bibbs sat Sheridan standing gazed enigmatically upon his son for a period of silence then walked slowly to a window and stood looking out of it his big hands loosely hooked together by the thumbs behind his back They were soiled as were all other hands down town except such as might be still damp from a basin Well Bibbs he said at last not altering his attitude do you know what I m goin to do with you Bibbs leaning back in his chair fixed his eyes contemplatively upon the ceiling I heard you tell Jim he began in his slow way You said you d send him to the machine shop with me if he didn t propose to Miss Vertrees So I suppose that must be your plan for me But But what said Sheridan irritably as the son paused Isn t there somebody you d let ME propose to That brought his father sharply round to face him You beat the devil Bibbs

none	none	do Sir What do you WANT to do I said Taken by surprise Bibbs stammered What what do I what If I d let you do exactly what you had the whim for what would you do Bibbs looked startled then timidity overwhelmed him a profound shyness He bent his head and fixed his lowered eyes upon the toe of his shoe which he moved to and fro upon the rug like a culprit called to the desk in school What would you do Loaf No sir Bibbs s voice was almost inaudible and what little sound it made was unquestionably a guilty sound I suppose I d I d Well I suppose I d try to to write Write what Nothing important just poems and essays perhaps That all Yes sir I see said his father breathing quickly with the restraint he was putting upon himself That is you want to write but you don t want to write anything of any account You think Sheridan got up again I take my hat off to the man that can write a good ad he said emphatically The best writin talent in this country is right spang in the ad business to day You buy a magazine for good writin look on the back of it Let me tell you I pay money for that kind o writin Maybe you think it s easy Just try it I ve tried it and I can t do it I tell you an ad s got to be written so it makes people do the hardest thing in this world to GET em to do it s got to make em give up their MONEY You talk about poems and essays I tell you when it comes to the actual skill o puttin words together so as to make things HAPPEN R T Bloss right here in this city knows more in a minute than George Waldo Emerson ever knew in his whole life You you may be Bibbs said indistinctly the last word smothered in a cough Of COURSE I m right And if it ain t just like you to want to take up with the most out o date kind o writin there is Poems and essays My Lord Bibbs that s WOMEN S work You can t pick up a newspaper without havin to see where missus Rumskididle read a paper on Jane Eyre or East Lynne at the God Knows What Club And poetry Why look at Edith I expect that poem o hers would set a pretty high water mark for you young man and it s the only one she s ever managed to write in her whole LIFE When I wanted her to go on and write some more she said it took too much time Said it took months and months And Edith s a smart girl she s got more energy in her little finger than you ever give me a chance to see in your whole body Bibbs Now look at the facts say she could turn out four or five poems a year and you could turn out maybe two That medal she got was worth about fifteen dollars so there s your income thirty dollars a year That s a fine success to make of your life I m not sayin a word against poetry I wouldn t take ten thousand dollars right now for that poem of Edith s and poetry s all right enough in its place but you leave it to the girls A man s got to do a man s work in this world He seated himself in a chair at his son s side and leaning over tapped Bibbs confidentially on the knee This city s got the greatest future in America and if my sons behave right by me and by themselves they re goin to have a mighty fair share of it a mighty fair share I love this town It s God s own footstool and it s made money for me every day right along I don t know how many years I love it like I do my own business and I d fight for it as quick as I d fight for my own family It s a beautiful town Look at our wholesale district look at any district you want to look at the park system we re puttin through and the boulevards and the public statuary And she grows God how she grows He had become intensely grave he spoke with solemnity Now Bibbs I can t take any of it nor any gold or silver nor buildings nor bonds away with me in my shroud when I have to go But I want to leave my share in it to my boys I ve worked for it I ve been a builder and a maker and two blades of grass have grown where one grew before whenever I laid my hand on the ground and willed em to grow I ve built big and I want the buildin to go on And when my last hour comes

none	none	that my boys are ready to take charge that they re fit to take charge and go ON with it Bibbs when that hour comes I want to know that my boys are big men ready and fit to hold of big things Bibbs when I m up above I want to know that the big share I ve made mine here below is growin bigger and bigger in the charge of my boys He leaned back deeply moved There he said huskily I ve never spoken more what was in my heart in my life I do it because I want you to understand and not think me a mean father I never had to talk that way to Jim and Roscoe They understood without any talk Bibbs I see said Bibbs At least I think I do But Wait a minute Sheridan raised his hand If you see the least bit in the world then you understand how it feels to me to have my son set here and talk about poems and essays and such like fooleries And you must understand too what it meant to start one o my boys and have him come back on me the way you did and have to be sent to a sanitarium because he couldn t stand work Now let s get right down to it Bibbs I ve had a whole lot o talk with ole Doc Gurney about you one time another and I reckon I understand your case just about as well as he does anyway Now here I ll be frank with you I started you in harder than what I did the other boys and that was for your own good because I saw you needed to be shook up more n they did You were always kind of moody and mopish and you needed work that d keep you on the jump Now why did it make you sick instead of brace you up and make a man of you the way it ought of done I pinned ole Gurney down to it I says Look here ain t it really because he just plain hated it Yes he says that s it If he d enjoyed it it wouldn t a hurt him He loathes it and that affects his nervous system The more he tries it the more he hates it and the more he hates it the more injury it does him That ain t quite his words but it s what he meant And that s about the way it is Yes said Bibbs that s about the way it is Well then I reckon it s up to me not only to make you do it but to make you like it Bibbs shivered And he turned upon his father a look that was almost ghostly I can t he said in a low voice I can t Can t go back to the shop No Can t like it I can t Sheridan jumped up his patience gone To his own view he had reasoned exhaustively had explained fully and had pleaded more than a father should only to be met in the end with the unreasoning and mysterious stubbornness which had been Bibbs s baffling characteristic from childhood By George you will he cried You ll go back there and you ll like it Gurney says it won t hurt you if you like it and he says it ll kill you if you go back and hate it so it looks as if it was about up to you not to hate it Well Gurney s a fool Hatin work doesn t kill anybody and this isn t goin to kill you whether you hate it or not I ve never made a mistake in a serious matter in my life and it wasn t a mistake my sendin you there in the first place And I m goin to prove it I m goin to send you back there and vindicate my judgment Gurney says it s all mental attitude Well you re goin to learn the right one He says in a couple more months this fool thing that s been the matter with you ll be disappeared completely and you ll be back in as good or better condition than you were before you ever went into the shop And right then is when you begin over right in that same shop Nobody can call me a hard man or a mean father I do the best I can for my chuldern and I take full responsibility for bringin my sons up to be men Now so far I ve failed with you But I m not goin to keep ON failin I never tackled a job YET I didn t put through and I m not goin to begin with my own son I m goin to make a MAN of you By God I am Bibbs rose and went slowly to the door where he turned You say you give me a couple of months he said Sheridan pushed a bell button on his desk Gurney said two months more would put you back where you were You go home and begin to get yourself in the right mental attitude before those two months are up Good by Good by sir said Bibbs meekly CHAPTER X Bibbs s room that neat apartment for transients to which the lamidal George had shown him upon his return still bore the appearance of temporary quarters possibly because Bibbs had no clear conception of himself as a permanent incumbent However he had set upon the mantelpiece the two photographs that he owned one a group twenty years old his father and mother with Jim and Roscoe as boys and the other a cabinet of Edith at sixteen And upon a table were the books he had taken from his trunk Sartor Resartus Virginibus Puerisque Huckleberry Finn and Afterwhiles There were some other books in the trunk a large one which remained unremoved at the foot of the bed adding to the general impression of transiency It contained nearly all the possessions as well as the secret life of Bibbs Sheridan and Bibbs sat beside it the day after his interview with his father raking over a small collection of manuscripts in the top tray Some of these he glanced through dubiously finding little comfort in them but one made him smile Then he shook his head ruefully indeed and ruefully began to read it It was written on paper stamped Hood Sanitarium and bore the title Leisure A man may keep a quiet heart at seventy miles an hour but not if he is running the train Nor is the habit of contemplation a useful quality in the stoker of a foundry furnace it will not be found to recommend him to the approbation of his superiors For a profession adapted solely to the pursuit of happiness in thinking I would choose that of an invalid his money is time and he may spend it on Olympus It will not suffice to be an amateur invalid To my way of thinking the perfect practitioner must be to all outward purposes already dead if he is to begin the perfect enjoyment of life His serenity must not be disturbed by rumors of recovery he must lie serene in his long chair in the sunshine The world must be on the other side of the wall and the wall must be so thick and so high that he cannot hear the roaring of the furnace fires and the screaming of the whistles Peace Having read so far as the word peace Bibbs suffered an interruption interesting as a coincidence of contrast High voices sounded in the hall just outside his door and it became evident that a woman s quarrel was in progress the parties to it having begun it in Edith s room and continuing it vehemently as they came out into the hall Yes you BETTER go home Bibbs heard his sister vociferating shrilly You better go home and keep your mind a little more on your HUSBAND Edie Edie he heard his mother remonstrating as peacemaker You see here This was Sibyl and her voice was both acrid and tremulous Don t you talk to me that way I came here to tell Mother Sheridan what I d heard and to let her tell Father Sheridan if she thought she ought to and I did it for your own good Yes you did And Edith s gibing laughter tooted loudly Yes you did YOU didn t have any other reason OH no YOU don t want to break it up between Bobby Lamhorn and me because Edie Edie Now now Oh hush up mamma I d like to know then if she says her new friends tell her he s got such a reputation that he oughtn t to come here what about his not going to HER house How I ve explained that to Mother Sheridan Sibyl s voice indicated that she was descending the stairs Married people are not the same Some things that should be shielded from a young girl This seemed to have no very soothing effect upon Edith Shielded from a young girl she shrilled You seem pretty willing to be the shield You look out Roscoe doesn t notice what kind of a shield you are Sibyl s answer was inaudible but missus Sheridan s flurried attempts at pacification were renewed Now Edie Edie she means it for your good and you d oughtn t to Oh hush up mamma and let me alone If you dare tell papa Now now I m not going to tell him to day and maybe You ve got to promise NEVER to tell him the girl cried passionately Well we ll see You just come back in your own room and we ll No I WON T talk it over Stop pulling me Let me ALONE And Edith flinging herself violently upon Bibbs s door jerked it open swung round it into the room slammed the door behind her and threw herself face down upon the bed in such a riot of emotion that she had no perception of Bibbs s presence in the room Gasping and sobbing in a passion of tears she beat the coverlet and pillows with her clenched fists Sneak she babbled aloud Sneak Snake in the grass Cat Bibbs saw that she did not know he was there and he went softly toward the door hoping to get away before she became aware of him but some sound of his movement reached her and she sat up startled facing him Bibbs I thought I saw you go out awhile ago Yes I came back though I m sorry Did you hear me quarreling with Sibyl Only what you said in the hall You lie down again Edith I m going out No don t go She applied a handkerchief to her eyes emitted a sob and repeated her request Don t go I don t mind you you re quiet anyhow Mamma s so fussy and never gets anywhere I don t mind you at all but I wish you d sit down All right And he returned to his chair beside the trunk Go ahead and cry all you want Edith he said No harm in that Sibyl told mamma OH she began choking Mary Vertrees had mamma and Sibyl and I to tea one afternoon two weeks or so ago and she had some women there that Sibyl s been crazy to get in with and she just laid herself out to make a hit with em and she s been running after em ever since and now she comes over here and says THEY say Bobby Lamhorn is so bad that even though they like his family none of the nice people in town would let him in their houses In the first place it s a falsehood and I don t believe a word of it and in the second place I know the reason she did it and what s more she KNOWS I know it I won t SAY what it is not yet because papa and all of you would think I m as crazy as she is snaky and Roscoe s such a fool he d probably quit speaking to me But it s true Just you watch her that s all I ask Just you watch that woman You ll see As it happened Bibbs was literally watching that woman Glancing from the window he saw Sibyl pause upon the pavement in front of the old house next door She stood a moment in deep thought then walked quickly up the path to the door undoubtedly with the intention of calling But he did not mention this to his sister who after delivering herself of a rather vague jeremiad upon the subject of her sister in law s treacheries departed to her own chamber leaving him to his speculations The chief of these concerned the social elasticities of women Sibyl had just been a participant in a violent scene she had suffered hot insult of a kind that could not fail to set her quivering with resentment and yet she elected to betake herself to the presence of people whom she knew no more than formally Bibbs marveled Surely he reflected some traces of emotion must linger upon Sibyl s face or in her manner she could not have ironed it all quite out in the three or four minutes it took her to reach the Vertreeses door And in this he was not mistaken for Mary Vertrees was at that moment wondering what internal excitement missus Roscoe Sheridan was striving to master But Sibyl had no idea that she was allowing herself to exhibit anything except the gaiety which she conceived proper to the manner of a casual caller She was wholly intent upon fulfilling the sudden purpose that brought her and she was no more self conscious than she was finely intelligent For Sibyl Sheridan belonged to a type Scriptural in its antiquity She was merely the idle and half educated intriguer who may and does delude men of course and the best and dullest of her own sex as well finding invariably strong supporters among these latter It is a type that has wrought some damage in the world and would have wrought greater save for the check put upon its power by intelligent women and by its own lack of perspective for it is a type that never sees itself Sibyl followed her impulses with no reflection or question it was like a hound on the gallop after a master on horseback She had not even the instinct to stop and consider her effect If she wished to make a certain impression she believed that she made it She believed that she was believed My mother asked me to say that she was sorry she couldn t come down Mary said when they were seated Sibyl ran the scale of a cooing simulance of laughter which she had been brought up to consider the polite thing to do after a remark addressed to her by any person with whom she was not on familiar terms It was intended partly as a courtesy and partly as the foundation for an impression of sweetness Just thought I d fly in a minute she said continuing the cooing to relieve the last doubt of her gentiality I thought I d just behave like REAL country neighbors We are almost out in the country so far from down town aren t we And it seemed such a LOVELY day I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed meeting those nice people at tea that afternoon You see coming here a bride and never having lived here before I ve had to depend on my husband s friends almost entirely and I really ve known scarcely anybody mister Sheridan has been so engrossed in business ever since he was a mere boy why of course She paused with the air of having completed an explanation Of course said Mary sympathetically accepting it Yes I ve been seeing quite a lot of the Kittersbys since that afternoon Sibyl went on They re really delightful people Indeed they are Yes She stopped with unconscious abruptness her mind plainly wandering to another matter and Mary perceived that she had come upon a definite errand Moreover a tensing of Sibyl s eyelids in that moment of abstraction as she looked aside from her hostess indicated that the errand was a serious one for the caller and easily to be connected with the slight but perceptible agitation underlying her assumption of cheerful ease There was a restlessness of breathing a restlessness of hands missus Kittersby and her daughter were chatting about some to the people here in town the other day said Sibyl repeating the cooing and protracting it They said something that took ME by surprise We were talking about our mutual friend mister Robert Lamhorn Mary interrupted her promptly Do you mean mutual to include my mother and me she asked Why yes the Kittersbys and you and all of us Sheridans I mean No said Mary We shouldn t consider mister Robert Lamhorn a friend of ours To her surprise Sibyl nodded eagerly as if greatly pleased That s just the way missus Kittersby talked she cried with a vehemence that made Mary stare Yes and I hear that s the way ALL you old families here speak of him Mary looked aside but otherwise she was able to maintain her composure I had the impression he was a friend of yours she said adding hastily and your husband s Oh yes said the caller absently He is certainly A man s reputation for a little gaiety oughtn t to make a great difference to married people of course It s where young girls are in question THEN it may be very very dangerous There are a great many things safe and proper for married people that might be awf ly imprudent for a young girl Don t you agree Miss Vertrees I don t know returned the frank Mary Do you mean that you intend to remain a friend of mister Lamhorn s but disapprove of Miss Sheridan s doing so That s it exactly was the naive and ardent response of Sibyl What I feel about it is that a man with his reputation isn t at all suitable for Edith and the family ought to be made to understand it I tell you she cried with a sudden access of vehemence her father ought to put his foot down Her eyes flashed with a green spark something seemed to leap out and then retreat but not before Mary had caught a glimpse of it as one might catch a glimpse of a thing darting forth and then scuttling back into hiding under a bush Of course said Sibyl much more composedly I hardly need say that it s entirely on Edith s account that I m worried about this I m as fond of Edith as if she was really my sister and I can t help fretting about it It would break my heart to have Edith s life spoiled This tune was off the key to Mary s ear Sibyl tried to sing with pathos but she flatted And when a lady receives a call from another who suffers under the stress of some feeling which she wishes to conceal there is not uncommonly developed a phenomenon of duality comparable to the effect obtained by placing two mirrors opposite each other one clear and the other flawed In this case particularly Sibyl had an imperfect consciousness of Mary The Mary Vertrees that she saw was merely something to be cozened to her own frantic purpose a Mary Vertrees who was incapable of penetrating that purpose Sibyl sat there believing that she was projecting the image of herself that she desired to project never dreaming that with every word every look and every gesture she was more and more fully disclosing the pitiable truth to the clear eyes of Mary And the Sibyl that Mary saw was an overdressed woman in manner half rustic and in mind as shallow as a pan but possessed by emotions that appeared to be strong perhaps even violent What those emotions were Mary had not guessed but she began to suspect And Edith s life WOULD be spoiled Sibyl continued It would be a dreadful thing for the whole family She s the very apple of Father Sheridan s eye and he s as proud of her as he is of Jim and Roscoe It would be a horrible thing for him to have her marry a man like Robert Lamhorn but he doesn t KNOW anything about him and if somebody doesn t tell him what I m most afraid of is that Edith might get his consent and hurry on the wedding before he finds out and then it would be too late You see Miss Vertrees it s very difficult for me to decide just what it s my duty to do I see said Mary looking at her thoughtfully Does Miss Sheridan seem to to care very much about him He s deliberately fascinated her returned the visitor beginning to breathe quickly and heavily Oh she wasn t difficult She knew she wasn t in right in this town and she was crazy to meet the people that were and she thought he was one of em But that was only the start that made it easy for him and he didn t need it He could have done it anyway Sibyl was launched now her eyes were furious and her voice shook He went after her deliberately the way he does everything he s as cold blooded as a fish All he cares about is his own pleasure and lately he s decided it would be pleasant to get hold of a piece of real money and there was Edith And he ll marry her Nothing on earth can stop him unless he finds out she won t HAVE any money if she marries him and the only person that could make him understand that is Father Sheridan Somehow that s got to be managed because Lamhorn is going to hurry it on as fast as he can He told me so last night He said he was going to marry her the first minute he could persuade her to it and little Edith s all ready to be persuaded Sibyl s eyes flashed green again And he swore he d do it she panted He swore he d marry Edith Sheridan and nothing on earth could stop him And then Mary understood Her lips parted and she stared at the babbling creature incredulously a sudden vivid picture in her mind a canvas of unconscious Sibyl s painting Mary beheld it with pity and horror she saw Sibyl clinging to Robert Lamhorn raging in a whisper perhaps for Roscoe might have been in the house or servants might have heard She saw Sibyl entreating beseeching threatening despairingly and Lamhorn tired of her first evasive then brutally letting her have the truth and at last infuriated swearing to marry her rival If Sibyl had not babbled out the word swore it might have been less plain The poor woman blundered on wholly unaware of what she had confessed You see she said more quietly whatever s going to be done ought to be done right away I went over and told Mother Sheridan what I d heard about Lamhorn oh I was open and aboveboard I told her right before Edith I think it ought all to be done with perfect frankness because nobody can say it isn t for the girl s own good and what her best friend would do But Mother Sheridan s under Edith s thumb and she s afraid to ever come right out with anything Father Sheridan s different Edith can get anything she wants out of him in the way of money or ordinary indulgence but when it comes to a matter like this he d be a steel rock If it s a question of his will against anybody else s he d make his will rule if it killed em both Now he d never in the world let Lamhorn come near the house again if he knew his reputation So you see somebody s got to tell him It isn t a very easy position for me is it Miss Vertrees No said Mary gravely Well to be frank said Sibyl smiling that s why I ve come to you To ME Mary frowned Sibyl rippled and cooed again There isn t ANYBODY ever made such a hit with Father Sheridan in his life as you have And of course we ALL hope you re not going to be exactly an outsider in the affairs of the family This sally with another and louder effect of laughter And if it s MY duty why in a way I think it might be thought yours too No no exclaimed Mary sharply Listen said Sibyl Now suppose I go to Father Sheridan with this story and Edith says it s not true suppose she says Lamhorn has a good reputation and that I m repeating irresponsible gossip or suppose what s most likely she loses her temper and says I invented it then what am I going to do Father Sheridan doesn t know missus Kittersby and her daughter and they re out of the question anyway But suppose I could say All right if you want proof ask Miss Vertrees She came with me and she s waiting in the next room right now to No no said Mary quickly You mustn t Listen just a minute more Sibyl urged confidingly She was on easy ground now to her own mind and had no doubt of her success You naturally don t want to begin by taking part in a family quarrel but if YOU take part in it it won t be one You don t know yourself what weight you carry over there and no one would have the right to say you did it except out of the purest kindness

none	none	that Jim and his father would admire you all the more for it Miss Vertrees listen Don t you see we OUGHT to do it you and I Do you suppose Robert Lamhorn cares a snap of his finger for her Do you suppose a man like him would LOOK at Edith Sheridan if it wasn t for the money And again Sibyl s emotion rose to the surface I tell you he s after nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old man s money pile over there next door He d marry ANYBODY to do it Marry Edith she cried I tell you he d marry their nigger cook for THAT She stopped afraid at the wrong time that she had been too vehement but a glance at Mary reassured her and Sibyl decided that she had produced the effect she wished Mary was not looking at her she was staring straight before her at the wall her eyes wide and shining She became visibly a little paler as Sibyl looked at her After nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old man s money pile over there next door The voice was vulgar the words were vulgar and the plain truth was vulgar How it rang in Mary Vertrees s ears The clear mirror had caught its own image clearly in the flawed one at last Sibyl put forth her best bid to clench the matter She offered her bargain Now don t you worry she said sunnily about this setting Edith against you She ll get over it after a while anyway but if she tried to be spiteful and make it uncomfortable for you when you drop in over there or managed so as to sort of leave you out why I ve got a house and Jim likes to come there I don t THINK Edith WOULD be that way she s too crazy to have you take her around with the smart crowd but if she DID you needn t worry And another thing I guess you won t mind Jim s own sister in law speaking of it Of course I don t know just how matters stand between you and Jim but Jim and Roscoe are about as much alike as two brothers can be and Roscoe was very slow making up his mind sometimes I used to think he actually never WOULD Now what I mean is sisters in law can do lots of things to help matters on like that There s lots of little things can be said and lots She stopped puzzled Mary Vertrees had gone from pale to scarlet and now still scarlet indeed she rose without a word of explanation or any other kind of word and walked slowly to the open door and out of the room Sibyl was a little taken aback She supposed Mary had remembered something neglected and necessary for the instruction of a servant and that she would return in a moment but it was rather a rude excess of absent mindedness not to have excused herself especially as her guest was talking And Mary s return being delayed Sibyl found time to think this unprefaced exit odder and ruder than she had first considered it There might have been more excuse for it she thought had she been speaking of matters less important offering to do the girl all the kindness in her power too Sibyl yawned and swung her muff impatiently she examined the sole of her shoe she decided on a new shape of heel she made an inventory of the furniture of the room of the rugs of the wall paper and engravings Then she looked at her watch and frowned went to a window and stood looking out upon the brown lawn then came back to the chair she had abandoned and sat again There was no sound in the house A strange expression began imperceptibly to alter the planes of her face and slowly she grew as scarlet as Mary scarlet to the ears She looked at her watch again and twenty five minutes had elapsed since she had looked at it before She went into the hall glanced over her shoulder oddly then she let herself softly out of the front door and went across the street to her own house Roscoe met her upon the threshold gloomily Saw you from the window he explained You must find a lot to say to that old lady What old lady missus Vertrees I been waiting for you a long time and I saw the daughter come out fifteen minutes ago and post a letter and then walk on up the street Don t stand out on the porch he said crossly Come in here There s something it s come time I ll have to talk to you about Come in But as she was moving to obey he glanced across at his father s house and started He lifted his hand to shield his eyes from the setting sun staring fixedly Something s the matter over there he muttered and then more loudly as alarm came into his voice he said What s the matter over there Bibbs dashed out of the gate in an automobile set at its highest speed and as he saw Roscoe he made a gesture singularly eloquent of calamity and was lost at once in a cloud of dust down the street Edith had followed part of the way down the drive and it could be seen that she was crying bitterly She lifted both arms to Roscoe summoning him By George gasped Roscoe I believe somebody s dead And he started for the New House at a run CHAPTER XI Sheridan had decided to conclude his day s work early that afternoon and at about two o clock he left his office with a man of affairs from foreign parts who had traveled far for a business conference with Sheridan and his colleagues Herr Favre in spite of his French name was a gentleman of Bavaria It was his first visit to our country and Sheridan took pleasure in showing him the sights of the country s finest city They got into an open car at the main entrance of the Sheridan Building and were driven first slowly and momentously through the wholesale district and the retail district then more rapidly they inspected the packing houses and the stock yards then skirmished over the park system and boulevards and after that whizzed through the residence section on their way to the factories and foundries All cray observed Herr Favre smilingly Cray echoed Sheridan I don t know what you mean Cray No white said Herr Favre with a wave of his hand toward the long rows of houses on both sides of the street No white lace window curtains all cray lace window curtains Oh I see Sheridan laughed indulgently You mean GRAY No they ain t they re white I never saw any gray ones Herr Favre shook his head much amused There are NO white ones he said There is no white ANYTHING in your city no white window curtains no white house no white peeble He pointed upward Smoke Then he sniffed the air and clasped his nose between forefinger and thumb Smoke Smoke ef rywhere Smoke in your insites He tapped his chest Smoke in your lunks Oh SMOKE Sheridan cried with gusto drawing in a deep breath and patently finding it delicious You BET we got smoke Exbensif said Herr Favre Ruins foliage ruins fabrics Maybe in summer it iss not so bad but I wonder your wifes will bear it Sheridan laughed uproariously They know it means new spring hats for em They must need many too said the visitor New hats new all things but nothing white In Munchen we could not do it we are a safing peeble Where s that In Munchen You say Munich Well I never been to Munich but I took in the Mediterranean trip and I tell you outside o some right good scenery all I saw was mighty dirty and mighty shiftless and mighty run down at the heel Now comin right down TO it mister Farver wouldn t you rather live here in this town than in Munich I know you got more enterprise up there than the part of the old country I saw and I know YOU RE a live business man and you re associated with others like you but when it comes to LIVIN in a place wouldn t you heap rather be here than over there For me said Herr Favre no Here I should not think I was living It would be like the miner who goes into the mine to work nothing else We got a good many good citizens here from your part o the world THEY like it Oh yes And Herr Favre laughed deprecatingly The first generation they bring their Germany with them then after that they are Americans like you He tapped his host s big knee genially You are patriot so are they Well I reckon you must be a pretty hot little patriot yourself mister Farver Sheridan exclaimed gaily You certainly stand up for your own town if you stick to sayin you d rather live there than you would here Yes SIR You sure are some patriot to say THAT after you ve seen our city It ain t reasonable in you but I must say I kind of admire you for it every man ought to stick up for his own even when he sees the other fellow s got the goods on him Yet I expect way down deep in your heart mister Farver you d rather live right here than any place else in the world if you had your choice Man alive this is God s country mister Farver and a blind man couldn t help seein it You couldn t stand where you do in a business way and NOT see it Soho boy Here we are This is the big works and I ll show you something now that ll make your eyes stick out They had arrived at the Pump Works and for an hour mister Favre was personally conducted and personally instructed by the founder and president the buzzing queen bee of those buzzing hives Now I ll take you for a spin in the country said Sheridan when at last they came out to the car again We ll take a breezer But with his foot on the step he paused to hail a neat young man who came out of the office smiling a greeting Hello young fellow Sheridan said heartily On the job are you Jimmie Ha They don t catch you OFF of it very often I guess though I do hear you go automobile ridin in the country sometimes with a mighty fine lookin girl settin up beside you He roared with laughter clapping his son upon the shoulder That s all right with me if it is with HER So Jimmie Well when we goin to move into your new warehouses Monday Sunday if you want to said Jim No cried his father delighted Don t tell me you re goin to keep your word about dates That s no way to do contractin Never heard of a contractor yet didn t want more time They ll be all ready for you on the minute said Jim I m going over both of em now with Links and Sherman from foundation to roof I guess they ll pass inspection too Well then when you get through with that said his father you go and take your girl out ridin By George you ve earned it You tell her you stand high with ME He stepped into the car waving a waggish farewell and when the wheels were in motion again he turned upon his companion a broad face literally shining with pride That s my boy Jimmie he said Fine young man yes said Herr Favre I got two o the finest boys said Sheridan I got two o the finest boys God ever made and that s a fact mister Farver Jim s the oldest and I tell you they got to get up the day before if they expect to catch HIM in bed My other boy Roscoe he s always to the good too but Jim s a wizard You saw them two new process warehouses just about finished Well JIM built em I ll tell you about that mister Farver And he recited this history describing the new process at length in fact he had such pride in Jim s achievement that he told Herr Favre all about it more than once Fine young man yes repeated the good Munchner three quarters of an hour later They were many miles out in the open country by this time He is that said Sheridan adding as if confidentially I got a fine family mister Farver fine chuldern I got a daughter now you take her and put her anywhere you please and she ll shine up with ANY of em There s culture and refinement and society in this town by the car load and here lately she s been gettin right in the thick of it her and my daughter in law both I got a mighty fine daughter in law mister Farver I m goin to get you up for a meal with us before you leave town and you ll see and well sir from all I hear the two of em been holdin their own with the best Myself I and the wife never had time for much o that kind o doin s but it s all right and good for the chuldern and my daughter she s always kind of taken to it I ll read you a poem she wrote when I get you up at the house She wrote it in school and took the first prize for poetry with it I tell you they don t make em any smarter n that girl mister Farver Yes sir take us all round we re a pretty happy family yes sir Roscoe hasn t got any chuldern yet and I haven t ever spoke to him and his wife about it it s kind of a delicate matter but it s about time the wife and I saw some gran chuldern growin up around us I certainly do hanker for about four or five little curly headed rascals to take on my knee Boys I hope o course that s only natural Jim s got his eye on a mighty splendid lookin girl lives right next door to us I expect you heard me joshin him about it back yonder She s one of the ole blue bloods here and I guess it was a mighty good stock to raise HER She s one these girls that stand right up and look at you And pretty She s the prettiest thing you ever saw Good size too good health and good sense Jim ll be just right if he gets her I must say it tickles ME to think o the way that boy took ahold o that job back yonder Four months and a half Yes sir He expanded this theme once more and thus he continued to entertain the stranger throughout the long drive Darkness had fallen before they reached the city on their return and it was after five when Sheridan allowed Herr Favre to descend at the door of his hotel where boys were shrieking extra editions of the evening paper Now good night mister Farver said Sheridan leaning from the car to shake hands with his guest Don t forget I m goin to come around and take you up to Go on away boy A newsboy had thrust himself almost between them yelling Extry Secon Extry Extry all about the horrable acciDENT Extry Get out laughed Sheridan Who wants to read about accidents Get out The boy moved away philosophically Extry Extry he shrilled Three men killed Extry Millionaire killed Two other men killed Extry Extry Don t forget mister Farver Sheridan completed his interrupted farewells I ll come by to take you up to our house for dinner I ll be here for you about half past five to morrow afternoon Hope you njoyed the drive much as I have Good night good night He leaned back speaking to the chauffer Now you can take me around to the Central City barber shop boy I want to get a shave fore I go up home Extry Extry screamed the newsboys zig zagging among the crowds like bats in the dusk Extry All about the horrable acciDENT Extry It struck Sheridan that the papers sent out too many Extras they printed Extras for all sorts of petty crimes and casualties It was a mistake he decided critically Crying Wolf too often wouldn t sell the goods it was bad business The papers would make more in the long run he was sure if they published an Extra only when something of real importance happened Extry All about the hor ble AX nt Extry a boy squawked under his nose as he descended from the car Go on away said Sheridan gruffly though he smiled He liked to see the youngsters working so noisily to get on in the world But as he crossed the pavement to the brilliant glass doors of the barber shop a second newsboy grasped the arm of the one who had thus cried his wares Say Yallern said this second hoarse with awe n t chew know who that IS Who It s SHERIDAN Jeest cried the first staring insanely At about the same hour four times a week Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday Sheridan stopped at this shop to be shaved by the head barber The barbers were negroes he was their great man and it was their habit to give him a reception his entrance being always the signal for a flurry of jocular hospitality followed by general excesses of briskness and gaiety But it was not so this evening The shop was crowded Copies of the Extra were being read by men waiting and by men in the latter stages of treatment Extras lay upon vacant seats and showed from the pockets of hanging coats There was a loud chatter between the practitioners and their recumbent patients a vocal charivari which stopped abruptly as Sheridan opened the door His name seemed to fizz in the air like the last sputtering of a firework the barbers stopped shaving and clipping lathered men turned their prostrate heads to stare and there was a moment of amazing silence in the shop The head barber nearest the door stood like a barber in a tableau His left hand held stretched between thumb and forefinger an elastic section of his helpless customer s cheek while his right hand hung poised above it the razor motionless And then roused from trance by the door s closing he accepted the fact of Sheridan s presence The barber remembered that there are no circumstances in life or just after it under which a man does not need to be shaved He stepped forward profoundly grave I be through with this man in the chair one minute Mist Sheridan he said in a hushed tone Yessuh And of a solemn negro youth who stood by gazing stupidly You goin RESIGN he demanded in a fierce undertone You goin take Mist Sheridan s coat He sent an angry look round the shop and the barbers taking his meaning averted their eyes and fell to work the murmur of subdued conversation buzzing from chair to chair You sit down ONE minute Mist Sheridan said the head barber gently I fix nice chair fo you to wait in Never mind said Sheridan Go on get through with your man Yessuh And he went quickly back to his chair on tiptoe followed by Sheridan s puzzled gaze Something had gone wrong in the shop evidently Sheridan did not know what to make of it Ordinarily he would have shouted a hilarious demand for the meaning of the mystery but an inexplicable silence had been imposed upon him by the hush that fell upon his entrance and by the odd look every man in the shop had bent upon him Vaguely disquieted he walked to one of the seats in the rear of the shop and looked up and down the two lines of barbers catching quickly shifted furtive glances here and there He made this brief survey after wondering if one of the barbers had died suddenly that day or the night before but there was no vacancy in either line The seat next to his was unoccupied but some one had left a copy of the Extra there and frowning he picked it up and glanced at it The first of the swollen display lines had little meaning to him Fatally Faulty New Process Roof Collapses Hurling Capitalist to Death with Inventor Seven Escape When Crash Comes Death Claims Thus far had he read when a thin hand fell upon the paper covering the print from his eyes and looking up he saw Bibbs standing before him pale and gentle immeasurably compassionate I ve come for you father said Bibbs Here s the boy with your coat and hat Put them on and come home And even then Sheridan did not understand So secure was he in the strength and bigness of everything that was his he did not know what calamity had befallen him But he was frightened Without a word he followed Bibbs heavily out throught the still shop but as they reached the pavement he stopped short and grasping his son s sleeve with shaking fingers swung him round so that they stood face to face What what His mouth could not do him the service he asked of it he was so frightened Extry screamed a newsboy straight in his face Young North Side millionaire insuntly killed Extry Not JIM said Sheridan Bibbs caught his father s hand in his own And YOU come to tell me that Sheridan did not know what he said But in those first words and in the first anguish of the big stricken face Bibbs understood the unuttered cry of accusation Why wasn t it you CHAPTER XII Standing in the black group under gaunt trees at the cemetery three days later Bibbs unwillingly let an old old thought become definite in his mind the sickly brother had buried the strong brother and Bibbs wondered how many million times that had happened since men first made a word to name the sons of one mother Almost literally he had buried his strong brother for Sheridan had gone to pieces when he saw his dead son He had nothing to help him meet the shock neither definite religion nor philosophy definite or indefinite He could only beat his forehead and beg over and over to be killed with an ax while his wife was helpless except to entreat him not to take on herself adding a continuous lamentation Edith weeping made truce with Sibyl and saw to it that the mourning garments were beyond criticism Roscoe was dazed and he shirked justifying himself curiously by saying he never had any experience in such matters So it was Bibbs the shy outsider who became during this dreadful little time the master of the house for as strange a thing as that sometimes may be the result of a death He met the relatives from out of town at the station he set the time for the funeral and the time for meals he selected the flowers and he selected Jim s coffin he did all the grim things and all the other things Jim had belonged to an order of Knights who lengthened the rites with a picturesque ceremony of their own and at first Bibbs wished to avoid this but upon reflection he offered no objection he divined that the Knights and their service would be not precisely a consolation but a satisfaction to his father So the Knights led the procession with their band playing a dirge part of the long way to the cemetery and then turned back after forming in two lines plumed hats sympathetically in hand to let the hearse and the carriages pass between Mighty fine lookin men said Sheridan brokenly They all all liked him He was His breath caught in a sob and choked him He was a Grand Supreme Herald Bibbs had divined aright Dust to dust said the minister under the gaunt trees and at that Sheridan shook convulsively from head to foot All of the black group shivered except Bibbs when it came to Dust to dust Bibbs stood passive for he was the only one of them who had known that thought as a familiar neighbor he had been close upon dust himself for a long long time and even now he could prophesy no protracted separation between himself and dust The machine shop had brought him very close and if he had to go back it would probably bring him closer still so close as doctor Gurney predicted that no one would be able to tell the difference between dust and himself And Sheridan if Bibbs read him truly would be all the more determined to make a man of him now that there was a man less in the family To Bibbs s knowledge no one and nothing had ever prevented his father from carrying through his plans once he had determined upon them and Sheridan was incapable of believing that any plan of his would not work out according to his calculations His nature unfitted him to accept failure He had the gift of terrible persistence and with unflecked confidence that his way was the only way he would hold to that way of making a man of Bibbs who understood very well in his passive and impersonal fashion that it was a way which might make not a man but dust of him But he had no shudder for the thought He had no shudder for that thought or for any other thought The truth about Bibbs was in the poem which Edith had adopted he had so thoroughly formed the over sensitive habit of hiding his feelings that no doubt he had forgotten by this time where he had put some of them especially those which concerned himself But he had not hidden his feelings about his father where they could not be found He was strange to his father but his father was not strange to him He knew that Sheridan s plans were conceived in the stubborn belief that they would bring about a good thing for Bibbs himself and whatever the result was to be the son had no bitterness Far otherwise for as he looked at the big woeful figure shaking and tortured an almost unbearable pity laid hands upon Bibbs s throat Roscoe stood blinking his lip quivering Edith wept audibly missus Sheridan leaned in half collapse against her husband but Bibbs knew that his father was the one who cared It was over Men in overalls stepped forward with their shovels and Bibbs nodded quickly to Roscoe making a slight gesture toward the line of waiting carriages Roscoe understood Bibbs would stay and see the grave filled the rest were to go The groups began to move away over the turf wheels creaked on the graveled drive and one by one the carriages filled and departed the horses setting off at a walk Bibbs gazed steadfastly at the workmen he knew that his father kept looking back as he went toward the carriage and that was a thing he did not want to see But after a little while there were no sounds of wheels or hoofs on the gravel and Bibbs glancing up saw that every one had gone A coupe had been left for him the driver dozing patiently The workmen placed the flowers and wreaths upon the mound and about it and Bibbs altered the position of one or two of these then stood looking thoughtfully at the grotesque brilliancy of that festal seeming hillock beneath the darkening November sky It s too bad he half whispered his lips forming the words and his meaning was that it was too bad that the strong brother had been the one to go For this was his last thought before he walked to the coupe and saw Mary Vertrees standing all alone on the other side of the drive She had just emerged from a grove of leafless trees that grew on a slope where the tombs were many and behind her rose a multitude of the barbaric and classic shapes we so strangely strew about our graveyards urn crowned columns and stone draped obelisks shop carved angels and shop carved children poising on pillars and shafts all lifting in unthought pathos their blind stoniness toward the sky Against such a background Bibbs was not incongruous with his figure in black so long and slender and his face so long and thin and white nor was the undertaker s coupe out of keeping with the shabby driver dozing on the box and the shaggy horses standing patiently in attitudes without hope and without regret But for Mary Vertrees here was a grotesque setting she was a vivid living creature of a beautiful world And a graveyard is not the place for people to look charming She also looked startled and confused but not more startled and confused than Bibbs In Edith s poem he had declared his intention of hiding his heart among the stars and in his boyhood one day he had successfully hidden his body in the coal pile He had been no comrade of other boys or of girls and his acquaintances of a recent period were only a few fellow invalids and the nurses at the Hood Sanitarium All his life Bibbs had kept himself to himself he was but a shy onlooker in the world Nevertheless the startled gaze he bent upon the unexpected lady before him had causes other than his shyness and her unexpectedness For Mary Vertrees had been a shining figure in the little world of late given to the view of this humble and elusive outsider and spectators sometimes find their hearts beating faster than those of the actors in the spectacle Thus with Bibbs now He started and stared he lifted his hat with incredible awkwardness his fingers fumbling at his forehead before they found the brim mister Sheridan said Mary I m afraid you ll have to take me home with you I She stopped not lacking a momentary awkwardness of her own Why why yes Bibbs stammered I ll I ll be de Won t you get in In that manner and in that place they exchanged their first words Then Mary without more ado got into the coupe and Bibbs followed closing the door You re very kind she said somewhat breathlessly I should have had to walk and it s beginning to get dark It s three miles I think Yes said Bibbs It it is beginning to get dark I I noticed that I ought to tell you I Mary began confusedly She bit her lip sat silent a moment then spoke with composure It must seem odd my No no Bibbs protested earnestly Not in the in the least It does though said Mary I had not intended to come to the cemetery mister Sheridan but one of the men in charge at the house came and whispered to me that the family wished me to I think your sister sent him So I came But when we reached here I oh I felt that perhaps I Bibbs nodded gravely Yes yes he murmured I got out on the opposite side of the carriage she continued I mean opposite from from where all of you were And I wandered off over in the other direction and I didn t realize how little time it takes From where I was I couldn t see the carriages leaving at least I didn t notice them So when I got back just now you were the only one here I didn t know the other people in the carriage I came in and of course they didn t think to wait for me That s why Yes said Bibbs I And that seemed all he had to say just then Mary looked out through the dusty window I think we d better be going home if you please she said Yes Bibbs agreed not moving It will be dark before we get there She gave him a quick little glance I think you must be very tired mister Sheridan and I know you have reason to be she said gently If you ll let me I ll And without explaining her purpose she opened the door on her side of the coupe and leaned out Bibbs started in blank perplexity not knowing what she meant to do Driver she called in her clear voice loudly Driver We d like to start please Driver Stop at the house just north of mister Sheridan s please The wheels began to move and she leaned back beside Bibbs once more I noticed that he was asleep when we got in she said I suppose they have a great deal of night work Bibbs drew a long breath and waited till he could command his voice I ve never been able to apologize quickly he said with his accustomed slowness because if I try to I stammer My brother Roscoe whipped me once when we were boys for stepping on his slate pencil It took me so long to tell him it was an accident he finished before I did Mary Vertrees had never heard anything quite like the drawling gentle voice or the odd implication that his not noticing the motionless state of their vehicle was an accident She had formed a casual impression of him not without sympathy but at once she discovered that he was unlike any of her cursory and vague imaginings of him And suddenly she saw a picture he had not intended to paint for sympathy a sturdy boy hammering a smaller sickly boy and the sickly boy unresentful Not that picture alone others flashed before her Instantaneously she had a glimpse of Bibbs s life and into his life She had a queer feeling new to her experience of knowing him instantly It startled her a little and then with some surprise she realized that she was glad he had sat so long after getting into the coupe before he noticed that it had not started What she did not realize however was that she had made no response to his apology and they passed out of the cemetery gates neither having spoken again Bibbs was so content with the silence he did not know that it was silence The dusk gathering in their small inclosure was filled with a rich presence for him and presently it was so dark that neither of the two could see the other nor did even their garments touch But neither had any sense of being alone The wheels creaked steadily rumbling presently on paved streets there were the sounds as from a distance of the plod plod of the horses and sometimes the driver became audible coughing asthmatically or saying You JOE with a spiritless flap of the whip upon an unresponsive back Oblongs of light from the lamps at street corners came swimming into the interior of the coupe and thinning rapidly to lances passed utterly leaving greater darkness And yet neither of these two last attendants at Jim Sheridan s funeral broke the silence It was Mary who preceived the strangeness of it too late Abruptly she realized that for an indefinite interval she had been thinking of her companion and not talking to him mister Sheridan she began not knowing what she was going to say but impelled to say anything as she realized the queerness of this drive mister Sheridan I The coupe stopped You JOE said the driver reproachfully and climbed down and opened the door What s the trouble Bibbs inquired Lady said stop at the first house north of mister Sheridan s sir Mary was incredulous she felt that it couldn t be true and that it mustn t be true that they had driven all the way without speaking What Bibbs demanded We re there sir said the driver sympathetically Next house north of mister Sheridan s Bibbs descended to the curb Why yes he said Yes you seem to be right And while he stood staring at the dimly illuminated front windows of mister Vertrees s house Mary got out unassisted Let me help you said Bibbs stepping toward her mechanically and she was several feet from the coupe when he spoke Oh no she murmured I think I can She meant that she could get out of the coupe without help but perceiving that she had already accomplished this feat she decided not to complete the sentence You JOE cried the driver angrily climbing to his box And he rumbled away at his team s best pace a snail s Thank you for bringing me home mister Sheridan said Mary stiffly She did not offer her hand Good night Good night Bibbs said in response and turning with her walked beside her to the door Mary made that a short walk she almost ran Realization of the queerness of their drive was growing upon her beginning to shock her she stepped aside from the light that fell through the glass panels of the door and withheld her hand as it touched the old fashioned bell handle I m quite safe thank you she said with a little emphasis Good night Good night said Bibbs and went obediently When he reached the street he looked back but she had vanished within the house Moving slowly away he caromed against two people who were turning out from the pavement to cross the street They were Roscoe and his wife Where are your eyes Bibbs demanded Roscoe Sleep walking as usual But Sibyl took the wanderer by the arm Come over to our house for a little while Bibbs she urged I want to No I d better Yes I want you to Your father s gone to bed and they re all quiet over there all worn out Just come for a minute He yielded and when they were in the house she repeated herself with real feeling All worn out Well if anybody is YOU are Bibbs And I don t wonder you ve done every bit of the work of it You mustn t get down sick again I m going to make you take a little brandy He let her have her own way following her into the dining room and was grateful when she brought him a tiny glass filled from one of the decanters on the sideboard Roscoe gloomily poured for himself a much heavier libation in a larger glass and the two men sat while Sibyl leaned against the sideboard reviewing the episodes of the day and recalling the names of the donors of flowers and wreaths She pressed Bibbs to remain longer when he rose to go and then as he persisted she went with him to the front door He opened it and she said Bibbs you were coming out of the Vertreeses house when we met you How did you happen to be there I had only been to the door he said Good night Sibyl Wait she insisted We saw you coming out I wasn t he explained moving to depart I d just brought Miss Vertrees home What she cried Yes he said and stepped out upon the porch that was it Good night Sibyl
3982_178459_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Wait she said 
none	none	following him across the threshold How did that happen I thought you were going to wait while those men filled the the She paused but moved nearer him insistently I did wait Miss Vertrees was there he said reluctantly She had walked away for a while and didn t notice that the carriages were leaving When she came back the coupe waiting for me was the only one left Sibyl regarded him with dilating eyes She spoke with a slow breathlessness And she drove home from Jim s funeral with you Without warning she burst into laughter clapped her hand ineffectually over her mouth and ran back uproariously into the house hurling the door shut behind her CHAPTER XIII Bibbs went home pondering He did not understand why Sibyl had laughed The laughter itself had been spontaneous and beyond suspicion but it seemed to him that she had only affected the effort to suppress it and that she wished it to be significant Significant of what And why had she wished to impress upon him the fact of her overwhelming amusement He found no answer but she had succeeded in disturbing him and he wished that he had not encountered her At home uncles aunts and cousins from out of town were wandering about the house several mournfully admiring the Bay of Naples and others occupied with the Moor and the plumbing while they waited for trains Edith and her mother had retired to some upper fastness but Bibbs interviewed Jackson and had the various groups of relatives summoned to the dining room for food One great uncle old Gideon Sheridan from Boonville could not be found and Bibbs went in search of him He ransacked the house discovering the missing antique at last by accident Passing his father s closed door on tiptoe Bibbs heard a murmurous sound and paused to listen The sound proved to be a quavering and rickety voice monotonously bleating The Lo ord givuth and the Lo ord takuth away We got to remember that we got to remember that I m a gittin along James I m a gittin along and I ve seen a many of em go two daughters and a son the Lord give me and He has taken all away For the Lo ord givuth and the Lo ord takuth away Remember the words of Bildad the Shuhite James Bildad the Shuhite says He shall have neither son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings Bildad the Shuhite Bibbs opened the door softly His father was lying upon the bed in his underclothes face downward and Uncle Gideon sat near by swinging backward and forward in a rocking chair stroking his long white beard and gazing at the ceiling as he talked Bibbs beckoned him urgently but Uncle Gideon paid no attention Bildad the Shuhite spake and his says If thy children have sinned against Him and He have cast them away There was a muffled explosion beneath the floor and the windows rattled The figure lying face downward on the bed did not move but Uncle Gideon leaped from his chair My God he cried What s that There came a second explosion and Uncle Gideon ran out into the hall Bibbs went to the head of the great staircase and looking down discovered the source of the disturbance Gideon s grandson a boy of fourteen had brought his camera to the funeral and was taking flash lights of the Moor Uncle Gideon reassured by Bibbs s explanation would have returned to finish his quotation from Bildad the Shuhite but Bibbs detained him and after a little argument persuaded him to descend to the dining room whither Bibbs followed after closing the door of his father s room He kept his eye on Gideon after dinner diplomatically preventing several attempts on the part of that comforter to reascend the stairs and it was a relief to Bibbs when George announced that an automobile was waiting to convey the ancient man and his grandson to their train They were the last to leave and when they had gone Bibbs went sighing to his own room He stretched himself wearily upon the bed but presently rose went to the window and looked for a long time at the darkened house where Mary Vertrees lived Then he opened his trunk took therefrom a small note book half filled with fragmentary scribblings and began to write Laughter after a funeral In this reaction people will laugh at anything and at nothing The band plays a dirge on the way to the cemetery but when it turns back and the mourning carriages are out of hearing it strikes up Darktown is Out To night That is natural but there are women whose laughter is like the whirring of whips Why is it that certain kinds of laughter seem to spoil something hidden away from the laughers If they do not know of it and have never seen it how can their laughter hurt it Yet it does Beauty is not out of place among grave stones It is not out of place anywhere But a woman who has been betrothed to a man would not look beautiful at his funeral A woman might look beautiful though at the funeral of a man whom she had known and liked And in that case too she would probably not want to talk if she drove home from the cemetery with his brother nor would she want the brother to talk Silence is usually either stupid or timid But for a man who stammers if he tries to talk fast and drawls so slowly when he doesn t stammer that nobody has time to listen to him silence is advisable Nevertheless too much silence is open to suspicion It may be reticence or it may be a vacuum It may be dignity or it may be false teeth Sometimes an imperceptible odor will become perceptible in a small inclosure such as a closed carriage The ghost of gasoline rising from a lady s glove might be sweeter to the man riding beside her than all the scents of Arcady in spring It depends on the lady but there ARE Three miles may be three hundred miles or it may be three feet When it is three feet you have not time to say a great deal before you reach the end of it Still it may be that one should begin to speak No one could help wishing to stay in a world that holds some of the people that are in this world There are some so wonderful

none	none	understand how the dead COULD die How could they let themselves A falling building does not care who falls with it It does not choose who shall be upon its roof and who shall not Silence CAN be golden Yes But perhaps if a woman of the world should find herself by accident sitting beside a man for the length of time it must necessarily take two slow old horses to jog three miles she might expect that man to say something of some sort Even if she thought him a feeble hypochondriac even if she had heard from others that he was a disappointment to his own people even if she had seen for herself that he was a useless and irritating encumbrance everywhere she might expect him at least to speak she might expect him to open his mouth and try to make sounds if he only barked If he did not even try but sat every step of the way as dumb as a frozen fish she might THINK him a frozen fish And she might be right She might be right if she thought him about as pleasant a companion as as Bildad the Shuhite Bibbs closed his note book replacing it in his trunk Then after a period of melancholy contemplation he undressed put on a dressing gown and slippers and went softly out into the hall to his father s door Upon the floor was a tray which Bibbs had sent George earlier in the evening to place upon a table in Sheridan s room but the food was untouched Bibbs stood listening outside the door for several minutes There came no sound from within and he went back to his own room and to bed In the morning he woke to a state of being hitherto unknown in his experience Sometimes in the process of waking there is a little pause sleep has gone but coherent thought has not begun It is a curious half void a glimpse of aphasia and although the person experiencing it may not know for that instant his own name or age or sex he may be acutely conscious of depression or elation It is the moment as we say before we remember and for the first time in Bibbs s life it came to him bringing a vague happiness He woke to a sense of new riches he had the feeling of a boy waking to a birthday But when the next moment brought him his memory he found nothing that could explain his exhilaration On the contrary under the circumstances it seemed grotesquely unwarranted However it was a brief visitation and was gone before he had finished dressing It left a little trail the pleased recollection of it and the puzzle of it which remained unsolved And in fact waking happily in the morning is not usually the result of a drive home from a funeral No wonder the sequence evaded Bibbs Sheridan His father had gone when he came down stairs Went on down to s office jes same Jackson informed him Came sat breakfas table all by mself eat nothin George bring nice breakfas but he di n eat a thing Yessuh went on down town jes same he yoosta do Yessuh I reckon putty much ev y thing goin go on same as it yoosta do It struck Bibbs that Jackson was right The day passed as other days had passed missus Sheridan and Edith were in black and missus Sheridan cried a little now and then but no other external difference was to be seen Edith was quiet but not noticeably depressed and at lunch proved herself able to argue with her mother upon the propriety of receiving calls in the earliest stages of mourning Lunch was as usual for Jim and his father had always lunched down town and the afternoon was as usual Bibbs went for his drive and his mother went with him as she sometimes did when the weather was pleasant Altogether the usualness of things was rather startling to Bibbs During the drive missus Sheridan talked fragmentarily of Jim s childhood But you wouldn t remember about that she said after narrating an episode You were too little He was always a good boy just like that And he d save whatever papa gave him and put it in the bank I reckon it ll just about kill your father to put somebody in his place as president of the Realty Company Bibbs I know he can t move Roscoe over he told me last week he d already put as much on Roscoe as any one man could handle and not go crazy Oh it s a pity She stopped to wipe her eyes It s a pity you didn t run more with Jim Bibbs and kind o pick up his ways Think what it d meant to papa now You never did run with either Roscoe or Jim any even before you got sick Of course you were younger but it always DID seem queer and you three bein brothers like that I don t believe I ever saw you and Jim sit down together for a good talk in my life Mother I ve been away so long Bibbs returned gently And since I came home I Oh I ain t reproachin you Bibbs she said Jim ain t been home much of an evening since you got back what with his work and callin and goin to the theater and places and often not even at the house for dinner Right the evening before he got hurt he had his dinner at some miser ble rest rant down by the Pump Works he was so set on overseein the night work and gettin everything finished up right to the minute he told papa he would I reckon you might a put in more time with Jim if there d been more opportunity Bibbs I expect you feel almost as if you scarcely really knew him right well I suppose I really didn t mother He was busy you see and I hadn t much to say about the things that interested him because I don t know much about them It s a pity Oh it s a pity she moaned And you ll have to learn to know about em NOW Bibbs I haven t said much to you because I felt it was all between your father and you but I honestly do believe it will just kill him if he has to have any more trouble on top of all this You mustn t LET him Bibbs you mustn t You don t know how he s grieved over you and now he can t stand any more he just can t Whatever he says for you to do you DO it Bibbs you DO it I want you to promise me you will I would if I could he said sorrowfully No no Why can t you she cried clutching his arm He wants you to go back to the machine shop and And like it said Bibbs Yes that s it to go in a cheerful spirit doctor Gurney said it wouldn t hurt you if you went in a cheerful spirit the doctor said that himself Bibbs So why can t you do it Can t you do that much for your father You ought to think what he s done for YOU You got a beautiful house to live in you got automobiles to ride in you got fur coats and warm clothes you been taken care of all your life And you don t KNOW how he worked for the money to give all these things to you You don t DREAM what he had to go through and what he risked when we were startin out in life and you never WILL know And now this blow has fallen on him out of a clear sky and you make it out to be a hardship to do like he wants you to And all on earth he asks is for you to go back to the work in a cheerful spirit so it won t hurt you That s all he asks Look Bibbs we re gettin back near home but before we get there I want you to promise me that you ll do what he asks you to Promise me In her earnestness she cleared away her black veil that she might see him better and it blew out on the smoky wind He readjusted it for her before he spoke I ll go back in as cheerful a spirit as I can mother he said There she exclaimed satisfied That s a good boy That s all I wanted you to say Don t give me any credit he said ruefully There isn t anything else for me to do Now don t begin talkin THAT way No no he soothed her We ll have to begin to make the spirit a cheerful one We may They were turning into their own driveway as he spoke and he glanced at the old house next door Mary Vertrees was visible in the twilight standing upon the front steps bareheaded the door open behind her She bowed gravely We may what asked missus Sheridan with a slight impatience What is it mother You said We may and didn t finish what you were sayin Did I said Bibbs blankly Well what WERE we saying Of all the queer boys she cried You always were Always You haven t forgot what you just promised me have you No he answered as the car stopped No the spirit will be as cheerful as the flesh will let it mother It won t do to behave like His voice was low and in her movement to descend from the car she failed to here his final words Behave like who Bibbs Nothing But she was fretful in her grief You said it wouldn t do to behave like SOMEBODY Behave like WHO It was just nonsense he explained turning to go in An obscure person I don t think much of lately Behave like WHO she repeated and upon his yielding to her petulant insistence she made up her mind that the only thing to do was to tell doctor Gurney about it Like Bildad the Shuhite was what Bibbs said CHAPTER XIV The outward usualness of things continued after dinner It was Sheridan s custom to read the evening paper beside the fire in the library while his wife sitting near by either sewed from old habit or allowed herself to be repeatedly baffled by one of the simpler forms of solitaire To night she did neither but sat in her customary chair gazing at the fire while Sheridan let the unfolded paper rest upon his lap though now and then he lifted it as if to read and let it fall back upon his knees again Bibbs came in noiselessly and sat in a corner doing nothing and from a reception room across the hall an indistinct vocal murmur became just audible at intervals Once when this murmur grew louder under stress of some irrepressible merriment Edith s voice could be heard Bobby aren t you awful and Sheridan glanced across at his wife appealingly She rose at once and went into the reception room there was a flurry of whispering and the sound of tiptoeing in the hall Edith and her suitor changing quarters to a more distant room missus Sheridan returned to her chair in the library They won t bother you any more papa she said in a comforting voice She told me at lunch he d phoned he wanted to come up this evening and I said I thought he d better wait a few days but she said she d already told him he could She paused then added rather guiltily I got kind of a notion maybe Roscoe don t like him as much as he used to Maybe maybe you better ask Roscoe papa And as Sheridan nodded solemnly she concluded in haste Don t say I said to I might be wrong about it anyway 
2573_178449_000048_000000	train-clean-360	He nodded 
none	none	again and they sat for some time in a silence which missus Sheridan broke with a little sniff having fallen into a reverie that brought tears That Miss Vertrees was a good girl she said SHE was all right Her husband evidently had no difficulty in following her train of thought for he nodded once more affirmatively Did you How did you fix it about the the Realty Company she faltered Did you He rose heavily helping himself to his feet by the arms of his chair I fixed it he said in a husky voice I moved Cantwell up and put Johnston in Cantwell s place and split up Johnston s work among the four men with salaries high enough to take it He went to her put his hand upon her shoulder and drew a long audible tremulous breath It s my bedtime mamma I m goin up He dropped the hand from her shoulder and moved slowly away but when he reached the door he stopped and spoke again without turning to look at her The Realty Company ll go right on just the same he said It s like it s like sand mamma It puts me in mind of chuldern playin in a sand pile One of em sticks his finger in the sand and makes a hole and another of em ll pat the place with his hand and all the little grains of sand run in and fill it up and settle against one another and then right away it s flat on top again and you can t tell there ever was a hole there The Realty Company ll go on all right mamma There ain t anything anywhere I reckon that wouldn t go right on just the same And he passed out slowly into the hall then they heard his heavy tread upon the stairs missus Sheridan rising to follow him turned a piteous face to her son It s so forlone she said chokingly That s the first time he spoke since he came in the house this evening I know it must a hurt him to hear Edith laughin with that Lamhorn She d oughtn t to let him come right the very first evening this way she d oughtn t to done it She just seems to lose her head over him and it scares me You heard what Sibyl said the other day and and you heard what what What Edith said to Sibyl Bibbs finished the sentence for her We CAN T have any trouble o THAT kind she wailed Oh it looks as if movin up to this New House had brought us awful bad luck It scares me She put both her hands over her face Oh Bibbs Bibbs if you only wasn t so QUEER If you could only been a kind of dependable son I don t know what we re all comin to And weeping she followed her husband Bibbs gazed for a while at the fire then he rose abruptly like a man who has come to a decision and briskly sought the room it was called the smoking room where Edith sat with mister Lamhorn They looked up in no welcoming manner at Bibbs s entrance and moved their chairs to a less conspicuous adjacency Good evening said Bibbs pleasantly and he seated himself in a leather easy chair near them What is it asked Edith plainly astonished Nothing he returned smiling She frowned Did you want something she asked Nothing in the world Father and mother have gone up stairs I sha n t be going up for several hours and there didn t seem to be anybody left for me to chat with except you and mister Lamhorn CHAT with she echoed incredulously I can talk about almost anything said Bibbs with an air of genial politeness It doesn t matter to ME I don t know much about business if that s what you happened to be talking about But you aren t in business are you mister Lamhorn Not now returned Lamhorn shortly I m not either said Bibbs It was getting cloudier than usual I noticed just before dark and there was wind from the southwest Rain to morrow I shouldn t be surprised He seemed to feel that he had begun a conversation the support of which had now become the pleasurable duty of other parties and he sat expectantly looking first at his sister then at Lamhorn as if implying that it was their turn to speak Edith returned his gaze with a mixture of astonishment and increasing anger while mister Lamhorn was obviously disturbed though Bibbs had been as considerate as possible in presenting the weather as a topic Bibbs had perceived that Lamhorn had nothing in his mind at any time except personalities he could talk about people and he could make love Bibbs wishing to be courteous offered the weather Lamhorn refused it and concluded from Bibbs s luxurious attitude in the leather chair that this half crazy brother was a permanent fixture for the rest of the evening There was not reason to hope that he would move and Lamhorn found himself in danger of looking silly I was just going he said rising Oh NO Edith cried sharply Yes Good night I think I Too bad said Bibbs genially walking to the door with the visitor while Edith stood staring as the two disappeared in the hall She heard Bibbs offering to help Lamhorn with his overcoat and the latter rather curtly declining assistance these episodes of departure being followed by the closing of the outer door She ran into the hall What s the matter with you she cried furiously What do you MEAN How did you dare come in there when you knew Her voice broke she made a gesture of rage and despair and ran up the stairs sobbing She fled to her mother s room and when Bibbs came up a few minutes later missus Sheridan met him at his door Oh Bibbs she said shaking her head woefully you d oughtn t to distress your sister She says you drove that young man right out of the house You d ought to been more considerate Bibbs smiled faintly noting that Edith s door was open with Edith s naive shadow motionless across its threshold Yes he said He doesn t appear to be much of a man s man He ran at just a glimpse of one Edith s shadow moved her voice came quavering You call yourself one No no he answered I said just a glimpse of one I didn t claim But her door slammed angrily and he turned to his mother There he said sighing That s almost the first time in my life I ever tried to be a man of action mother and I succeeded perfectly in what I tried to do As a consequence I feel like a horse thief You hurt her feelin s she groaned You must a gone at it too rough Bibbs He looked upon her wanly That s my trouble mother he murmured I m a plain blunt fellow I have rough ways and I m a rough man For once she perceived some meaning in his queerness Hush your nonsense she said good naturedly the astral of a troubled smile appearing You go to bed He kissed her and obeyed Edith gave him a cold greeting the next morning at the breakfast table You mustn t do that under a misapprehension he warned her when they were alone in the dining room Do what under a what she asked Speak to me I came into the smoking room last night on purpose he told her gravely I have a prejudice against that young man She laughed I guess you think it means a great deal who you have prejudices against In mockery she adopted the manner of one who implores Bibbs for pity s sake PROMISE me DON T use YOUR influence with papa against him And she laughed louder Listen he said with peculiar earnestness I ll tell you now because because I ve decided I m one of the family And then as if the earnestness were too heavy for him to carry it further he continued in his usual tone I m drunk with power Edith What do you want to tell me she demanded brusquely Lamhorn made love to Sibyl he said Edith hooted SHE did to HIM And because you overheard that spat between us the other day when I the same as accused her of it and said something like that to you afterward No he said gravely I KNOW How I was there one day a week ago with Roscoe and I heard Sibyl and Lamhorn Edith screamed with laughter You were with ROSCOE and you heard Lamhorn making love to Sibyl No I heard them quarreling You re funnier than ever
3982_178459_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Bibbs she cried 
none	none	You say he made love to her because you heard them quarreling That s it If you want to know what s between people you can by the way they quarrel You ll kill me Bibbs What were they quarreling about Nothing That s how I knew People who quarrel over nothing it s always certain Edith stopped laughing abruptly but continued her mockery You ought to know You ve had so much experience yourself I haven t any Edith he said My life has been about as exciting as an incubator chicken s But I look out through the glass at things Well then she said if you look out through the glass you must know what effect such stuff would have upon ME She rose visibly agitated What if it WAS true she demanded bitterly What if it was true a hundred times over You sit there with your silly face half ready to giggle and half ready to sniffle and tell me stories like that about Sibyl picking on Bobby Lamhorn and worrying him to death and you think it matters to ME What if I already KNEW all about their quarreling What if I understood WHY she She broke off with a violent gesture a sweep of her arm extended at full length as if she hurled something to the ground Do you think a girl that really cared for a man would pay any attention to THAT Or to YOU Bibbs Sheridan He looked at her steadily and his gaze was as keen as it was steady She met it with unwavering pride Finally he nodded slowly as if she had spoken and he meant to agree with what she said Ah yes he said I won t come into the smoking room again I m sorry Edith Nobody can make you see anything now You ll never see until you see for yourself The rest of us will do better to keep out of it especially me That s sensible she responded curtly You re most surprising of all when you re sensible Bibbs Yes he sighed I m a dull dog Shake hands and forgive me Edith Thawing so far as to smile she underwent this brief ceremony and George appeared summoning Bibbs to the library doctor Gurney was waiting there he announced And Bibbs gave his sister a shy but friendly touch upon the shoulder as a complement to the handshaking and left her doctor Gurney was sitting by the log fire alone in the room and he merely glanced over his shoulder when his patient came in He was not over fifty in spite of Sheridan s habitual ole Doc Gurney He was gray however almost as thin as Bibbs and nearly always he looked drowsy Your father telephoned me yesterday afternoon Bibbs he said not rising Wants me to look you over again Come around here in front of me between me and the fire I want to see if I can see through you You mean you re too sleepy to move returned Bibbs complying I think you ll notice that I m getting worse Taken on about twelve pounds said Gurney Thirteen maybe Twelve Well it won t do The doctor rubbed his eyelids You re so much better I ll have to use some machinery on you before we can know just where you are You come down to my place this afternoon Walk down all the way I suppose you know why your father wants to know Bibbs nodded Machine shop Still hate it Bibbs nodded again Don t blame you the doctor grunted Yes I expect it ll make a lump in your gizzard again Well what do you say Shall I tell him you ve got the old lump there yet You still want to write do you What s the use Bibbs said smiling ruefully My kind of writing Yes the doctor agreed I suppose it you broke away and lived on roots and berries until you began to attract the favorable attention of editors you might be able to hope for an income of four or five hundred dollars a year by the time you re fifty That s about it Bibbs murmured Of course I know what you want to do said Gurney drowsily You don t hate the machine shop only you hate the whole show the noise and jar and dirt the scramble the whole bloomin craze to get on You d like to go somewhere in Algiers or to Taormina perhaps and bask on a balcony smelling flowers and writing sonnets You d grow fat on it and have a delicate little life all to yourself Well what do you say I can lie like sixty Bibbs Shall I tell your father he ll lose another of his boys if you don t go to Sicily I don t want to go to Sicily said Bibbs I want to stay right here The doctor s drowsiness disappeared for a moment and he gave his patient a sharp glance It s a risk he said I think we ll find you re so much better he ll send you back to the shop pretty quick Something s got hold of you lately you re not quite so lackadaisical as you used to be But I warn you I think the shop will knock you just as it did before and perhaps even harder Bibbs He rose shook himself and rubbed his eyelids Well when we go over you this afternoon what are we going to say about it Tell him 
2573_178450_000001_000004	train-clean-360	I m ready 
none	none	said Bibbs looking at the floor Oh no Gurney laughed Not quite yet but you may be almost We ll see Don t forget I said to walk down And when the examination was concluded that afternoon the doctor informed Bibbs that the result was much too satisfactory to be pleasing Here s a new situation for a one act farce he said gloomily to his next patient when Bibbs had gone Doctor tells a man he s well and that s his death sentence likely Dam funny world Bibbs decided to walk home though Gurney had not instructed him upon this point In fact Gurney seemed to have no more instructions on any point so discouraging was the young man s improvement It was a dingy afternoon and the smoke was evident not only to Bibbs s sight but to his nostrils though most of the pedestrians were so saturated with the smell they could no longer detect it Nearly all of them walked hurriedly too intent upon their destinations to be more than half aware of the wayside they wore the expressions of people under a vague yet constant strain They were all lightly powdered inside and out with fine dust and grit from the hard paved streets and they were unaware of that also They did not even notice that they saw the smoke though the thickened air was like a shrouding mist And when Bibbs passed the new Sheridan Apartments now almost completed he observed that the marble of the vestibule was already streaky with soot like his gloves which were new That recalled to him the faint odor of gasolene in the coupe on the way from his brother s funeral and this incited a train of thought which continued till he reached the vicinity of his home His route was by a street parallel to that on which the New House fronted and in his preoccupation he walked a block farther than he intended so that having crossed to his own street he approached the New House from the north and as he came to the corner of mister Vertrees s lot mister Vertrees s daughter emerged from the front door and walked thoughtfully down the path to the old picket gate She was unconscious of the approach of the pedestrian from the north and did not see him until she had opened the gate and he was almost beside her Then she looked up and as she saw him she started visibly And if this thing had happened to Robert Lamhorn he would have had a thought far beyond the horizon of faint hearted Bibbs s thoughts Lamhorn indeed would have spoken his thought He would have said You jumped because you were thinking of me CHAPTER XV Mary was the picture of a lady flustered She stood with one hand closing the gate behind her and she had turned to go in the direction Bibbs was walking There appeared to be nothing for it but that they should walk together at least as far as the New House But Bibbs had paused in his slow stride and there elapsed an instant before either spoke or moved it was no longer than that and yet it sufficed for each to seem to say by look and attitude Why it s YOU Then they both spoke at once each hurriedly pronouncing the other s name as if about to deliver a message of importance Then both came to a stop simultaneously but Bibbs made a heroic effort and as they began to walk on together he contrived to find his voice I I hate a frozen fish myself he said I think three miles was too long for you to put up with one Good gracious she cried turning to him a glowing face from which restraint and embarrassment had suddenly fled mister Sheridan you re lovely to put it that way But it s always the girl s place to say it s turning cooler I ought to have been the one to show that we didn t know each other well enough not to say SOMETHING It was an imposition for me to have made you bring me home and after I went into the house I decided I should have walked Besides it wasn t three miles to the car line I never thought of it No said Bibbs earnestly I didn t either I might have said something if I d thought of anything I m talking now though I must remember that and not worry about it later I think I m talking though it doesn t sound intelligent even to me I made up my mind that if I ever met you again I d turn on my voice and keep it going no mater what it said I She interrupted him with laughter and Mary Vertrees s laugh was one which Bibbs s father had declared after the house warming a cripple would crawl five miles to hear And at the merry lilting of it Bibbs s father s son took heart to forget some of his trepidation I ll be any kind of idiot he said if you ll laugh at me some more It won t be difficult for me She did and Bibbs s cheeks showed a little actual color which Mary perceived It recalled to her by contrast her careless and irritated description of him to her mother just after she had seen him for the first time Rather tragic and altogether impossible It seemed to her now that she must have been blind They had passed the New House without either of them showing or possessing any consciousness that it had been the destination of one of them I ll keep on talking Bibbs continued cheerfully and you keep on laughing I m amounting to something in the world this afternoon I m making a noise and that makes you make music Don t be bothered by my bleating out such things as that I m really frightened and that makes me bleat anything I m frightened about two things I m afraid of what I ll think of myself later if I don t keep talking talking now I mean and I m afraid of what I ll think of myself if I do And besides these two things I m frightened anyhow I don t remember talking as much as this more than once or twice in my life I suppose it was always in me to do it though the first time I met any one who didn t know me well enough not to listen But you re not really talking to me said Mary You re just thinking aloud No he returned gravely I m not thinking at all I m only making vocal sounds because I believe it s more mannerly I seem to be the subject of what little meaning they possess and I d like to change it but I don t know how I haven t any experience in talking and I don t know how to manage it You needn t change the subject on my account mister Sheridan she said Not even if you really talked about yourself She turned her face toward him as she spoke and Bibbs caught his breath he was pathetically amazed by the look she gave him It was a glowing look warmly friendly and understanding and what almost shocked him it was an eagerly interested look Bibbs was not accustomed to anything like that I you I I m he stammered and the faint color in his cheeks grew almost vivid She was still looking at him and she saw the strange radiance that came into his face There was something about him too that explained how queer many people might think him but he did not seem queer to Mary Vertrees he seemed the most quaintly natural person she had ever met 
2573_178450_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He waited 
none	none	and became coherent YOU say something now he said I don t even belong in the chorus and here I am trying to sing the funny man s solo You No she interrupted I d rather play your accompaniment I ll stop and listen to it then Perhaps she began but after pausing thoughtfully she made a gesture with her muff indicating a large brick church which they were approaching Do you see that church mister Sheridan I suppose I could he answered in simple truthfulness looking at her But I don t want to Once when I was ill the nurse told me I d better say anything that was on my mind and I got the habit The other reason I don t want to see the church is that I have a feeling it s where you re going and where I ll be sent back She shook her head in cheery negation Not unless you want to be Would you like to come with me Why why yes he said Anywhere And again it was apparent that he spoke in simple truthfulness Then come if you care for organ music The organist is an old friend of mine and sometimes he plays for me He s a dear old man He had a degree from Bonn and was a professor afterward but he gave up everything for music That s he waiting in the doorway He looks like Beethoven doesn t he I think he knows that perhaps and enjoys it a little I hope so Yes said Bibbs as they reached the church steps I think Beethoven would like it too It must be pleasant to look like other people I haven t kept you Mary said to the organist No no he answered heartily I would not mind so only you should shooer come This is mister Sheridan doctor Kraft He has come to listen with me The organist looked bluntly surprised Iss that SO he exclaimed Well I am glad if you wish him and if he can stant my liddle playink He iss musician himself then of course No said Bibbs as the three entered the church together I I played the I tried to play Fortunately he checked himself he had been about to offer the information that he had failed to master the jews harp in his boyhood No I m not a musician he contented himself with saying What doctor Kraft s surprise increased Young man you are fortunate I play for Miss Vertrees she comes always alone You are the first You are the first one EVER They had reached the head of the central aisle and as the organist finished speaking Bibbs stopped short turning to look at Mary Vertrees in a dazed way that was not of her perceiving for though she stopped as he did her gaze followed the organist who was walking away from them toward the front of the church shaking his white Beethovian mane roguishly It s false pretenses on my part Bibbs said You mean to be kind to the sick but I m not an invalid any more I m so well I m going back to work in a few days I d better leave before he begins to play hadn t I No said Mary beginning to walk forward Not unless you don t like great music He followed her to a seat about half way up the aisle while doctor Kraft ascended to the organ It was an enormous one the procession of pipes ranging from long starveling whistles to thundering fat guns they covered all the rear wall of the church and the organist s figure reaching its high perch looked like that of some Lilliputian magician ludicrously daring the attempt to control a monster certain to overwhelm him This afternoon some Handel he turned to shout Mary nodded Will you like that she asked Bibbs I don t know I never heard any except Largo I don t know anything about music I don t even know how to pretend I do If I knew enough to pretend I would No said Mary looking at him and smiling faintly you wouldn t She turned away as a great sound began to swim and tremble in the air the huge empty space of the church filled with it and the two people listening filled with it the universe seemed to fill and thrill with it The two sat intensely still the great sound all round about them while the church grew dusky and only the organist s lamp made a tiny star of light His white head moved from side to side beneath it rhythmically or lunged and recovered with the fierceness of a duelist thrusting but he was magnificently the master of his giant and it sang to his magic as he bade it Bibbs was swept away upon that mighty singing Such a thing was wholly unknown to him there had been no music in his meager life Unlike the tale it was the Princess Bedrulbudour who had brought him to the enchanted cave and that for Bibbs was what made its magic dazing It seemed to him a long long time since he had been walking home drearily from doctor Gurney s office it seemed to him that he had set out upon a happy journey since then and that he had reached another planet where Mary Vertrees and he sat alone together listening to a vast choiring of invisible soldiers and holy angels There were armies of voices about them singing praise and thanksgiving and yet they were alone It was incredible that the walls of the church were not the boundaries of the universe to remain so for ever incredible that there was a smoky street just yonder where housemaids were bringing in evening papers from front steps and where children were taking their last spins on roller skates before being haled indoors for dinner He had a curious sense of communication with his new friend He knew it could not be so and yet he felt as if all the time he spoke to her saying You hear this strain You hear that strain You know the dream that these sounds bring to me And it seemed to him as though she answered continually I hear I hear that strain and I hear the new one that you are hearing now I know the dream that these sounds bring to you Yes yes I hear it all We hear together And though the church grew so dim that all was mysterious shadow except the vague planes of the windows and the organist s light with the white head moving beneath it Bibbs had no consciousness that the girl sitting beside him had grown shadowy he seemed to see her as plainly as ever in the darkness though he did not look at her And all the mighty chanting of the organ s multitudinous voices that afternoon seemed to Bibbs to be chorusing of her and interpreting her singing her thoughts and singing for him the world of humble gratitude that was in his heart because she was so kind to him It all meant Mary CHAPTER XVI But when she asked him what it meant on their homeward way he was silent They had come a few paces from the church without speaking walking slowly I ll tell you what it meant to me she said as he did not immediately reply Almost any music of Handel s always means one thing above all others to me courage That s it It makes cowardice of whining seem so infinitesimal it makes MOST things in our hustling little lives seem infinitesimal Yes he said It seems odd doesn t it that people down town are hurrying to trains and hanging to straps in trolley cars weltering every way to get home and feed and sleep so they can get down town to morrow And yet there isn t anything down there worth getting to They re like servants drudging to keep the house going and believing the drudgery itself is the great thing They make so much noise and fuss and dirt they forget that the house was meant to live in The housework has to be done but the people who do it have been so overpaid that they re confused and worship the housework They re overpaid and yet poor things they haven t anything that a chicken can t have Of course when the world gets to paying its wages sensibly that will be different Do you mean communism she asked and she made their slow pace a little slower they had only three blocks to go Whatever the word is I only mean that things don t look very sensible now especially to a man that wants to keep out of em and can t Communism Well at least any decent sport would say it s fair for all the strong runners to start from the same mark and give the weak ones a fair distance ahead so that all can run something like even on the stretch And wouldn t it be pleasant really if they could all cross the winning line together Who really enjoys beating anybody if he sees the beaten man s face The only way we can enjoy getting ahead of other people nowadays is by forgetting what the other people feel And that he added is nothing of what the music meant to me You see if I keep talking about what it didn t mean I can keep from telling you what it did mean Didn t it mean courage to you too a little she asked Triumph and praise were in it and somehow those things mean courage to me Yes they were all there Bibbs said I don t know the name of what he played but I shouldn t think it would matter much The man that makes the music must leave it to you what it can mean to you and the name he puts to it can t make much difference except to himself and people very much like him I suppose I suppose that s true though I d never thought of it like that I imagine music must make feelings and paint pictures in the minds of the people who hear it Bibbs went on musingly according to their own natures as much as according to the music itself The musician might compose something and play it wanting you to think of the Holy Grail and some people who heard it would think of a prayer meeting and some would think of how good they were themselves and a boy might think of himself at the head of a solemn procession carrying a banner and riding a white horse And then if there were some jubilant passages in the music he d think of a circus They had reached her gate and she set her hand upon it but did not open it Bibbs felt that this was almost the kindest of her kindnesses not to be prompt in leaving him After all she said you didn t tell me whether you liked it No I didn t need to No that s true and I didn t need to ask I knew But you said you were trying to keep from telling me what it did mean I can t keep from telling it any longer he said The music meant to me it meant the kindness of of you Kindness How You thought I was a sort of lonely tramp and sick No she said decidedly I thought perhaps you d like to hear doctor Kraft play And you did It s curious sometimes it seemed to me that it was you who were playing Mary laughed I I strum Piano A little Chopin Grieg Chaminade You wouldn t listen Bibbs drew a deep breath I m frightened again he said in an unsteady voice I m afraid you ll think I m pushing but He paused and the words sank to a murmur Oh if you want ME to play for you she said Yes gladly It will be merely absurd after what you heard this afternoon I play like a hundred thousand other girls and I like it I m glad when any one s willing to listen and if you She stopped checked by a sudden recollection and laughed ruefully But my piano won t be here after to night I I m sending it away to morrow I m afraid that if you d like me to play to you you d have to come this evening You ll let me he cried Certainly if you care to If I could play he said wistfully if I could play like that old man in the church I could thank you Ah but you haven t heard me play I KNOW you liked this afternoon but Yes said Bibbs It was the greatest happiness I ve ever known It was too dark to see his face but his voice held such plain honesty and he spoke with such complete unconsciousness of saying anything especially significant that she knew it was the truth For a moment she was nonplussed then she opened the gate and went in You ll come after dinner then Yes he said not moving Would you mind if I stood here until time to come in She had reached the steps and at that she turned offering him the response of laughter and a gay gesture of her muff toward the lighted windows of the New House as though bidding him to run home to his dinner That night Bibbs sat writing in his note book Music can come into a blank life and fill it Everything that is beautiful is music if you can listen There is no gracefulness like that of a graceful woman at a grand piano There is a swimming loveliness of line that seems to merge with the running of the sound and you seem as you watch her to see what you are hearing and to hear what you are seeing There are women who make you think of pine woods coming down to a sparkling sea The air about such a woman is bracing and when she is near you you feel strong and ambitious you forget that the world doesn t like you You think that perhaps you are a great fellow after all Then you come away and feel like a boy who has fallen in love with his Sunday school teacher You ll be whipped for it and ought to be There are women who make you think of Diana crowned with the moon But they do not have the Greek profile I do not believe Helen of Troy had a Greek profile they would not have fought about her if her nose had been quite that long The Greek nose is not the adorable nose The adorable nose is about an eighth of an inch shorter Much of the music of Wagner it appears is not suitable to the piano Wagner was a composer who could interpret into music such things as the primitive impulses of humanity he could have made a machine shop into music But not if he had to work in it Wagner was always dealing in immensities a machine shop would have put a majestic lump in so grand a gizzard as that There is a mystery about pianos it seems Sometimes they have to be sent away That is how some people speak of the penitentiary Sent away is a euphuism for sent to prison But pianos are not sent to prison and they are not sent to the tuner the tuner is sent to them Why are pianos sent away and where Sometimes a glorious day shines into the most ordinary and useless life Happiness and beauty come caroling out of the air into the gloomy house of that life as if some stray angel just happened to perch on the roof tree resting and singing And the night after such a day is lustrous and splendid with the memory of it Music and beauty and kindness those are the three greatest things God can give us To bring them all in one day to one who expected nothing ah the heart that received them should be as humble as it is thankful But it is hard to be humble when one is so rich with new memories It is impossible to be humble after a day of glory Yes the adorable nose is more than an eighth of an inch shorter than the Greek nose It is a full quarter of an inch shorter There are women who will be kinder to a sick tramp than to a conquering hero But the sick tramp had better remember that s what he is Take care take care Humble s the word CHAPTER XVII That mystery about pianos which troubled Bibbs had been a mystery to mister Vertrees and it was being explained to him at about the time Bibbs scribbled the reference to it in his notes Mary had gone up stairs upon Bibbs s departure at ten o clock and mister and missus Vertrees sat until after midnight in the library talking And in all that time they found not one cheerful topic but became more depressed with everything and with every phase of everything that they discussed no extraordinary state of affairs in a family which has always held up its head only to arrive in the end at a point where all it can do is to look on helplessly at the processes of its own financial dissolution For that was the point which this despairing couple had reached they could do nothing except look on and talk about it They were only vaporing and they knew it She needn t to have done that about her piano vapored mister Vertrees We could have managed somehow without it At least she ought to have consulted me and if she insisted I could have arranged the details with the the dealer She thought that it might be annoying for you missus Vertrees explained Really she planned for you not to know about it until they had removed until after to morrow that is but I decided to to mention it You see she didn t even tell me about it until this morning She has another idea too I m afraid It s it s Well he urged as she found it difficult to go on Her other idea is that is it was I think it can be avoided of course it was about her furs No he exclaimed quickly I won t have it You must see to that I d rather not talk to her about it but you mustn t let her I ll try not his wife promised Of course they re very handsome All the more reason for her to keep them he returned irritably We re not THAT far gone I think Perhaps not yet missus Vertrees said She seems to be troubled about the the coal matter and about Tilly Of course the piano will take care of some things like those for a while and I don t like it I gave her the piano to play on not to You mustn t be distressed about it in ONE way she said comfortingly She arranged with the with the purchaser that the men will come for it about half after five in the afternoon The days are so short now it s really quite winter Oh yes he agreed moodily So far as that goes people have a right to move a piece of furniture without stirring up the neighbors I suppose even by daylight I don t suppose OUR neighbors are paying much attention just now though I hear Sheridan was back in his office early the morning after the funeral missus Vertrees made a little sound of commiseration I don t believe that was because he wasn t suffering though I m sure it was only because he felt his business was so important Mary told me he seemed wrapped up in his son s succeeding and that was what he bragged about most He isn t vulgar in his boasting I understand he doesn t talk a great deal about his his actual money though there was something about blades of grass that I didn t comprehend I think he meant something about his energy but perhaps not No his bragging usually seemed to be not so much a personal vainglory as about his family and the greatness of this city Greatness of this city mister Vertrees echoed with dull bitterness It s nothing but a coal hole I suppose it looks great to the man who has the luck to make it work for him I suppose it looks great to any YOUNG man too starting out to make his fortune out of it The fellows that get what they want out of it say it s great and everybody else gets the habit But you have a different point of view if it s the city that got what it wanted out of you Of course Sheridan says it s great missus Vertrees seemed unaware of this unusual outburst I believe she began timidly he doesn t boast of that is I understand he has never seemed so interested in the the other one Her husband s face was dark but at that a heavier shadow fell upon it he looked more haggard than before The other one he repeated averting his eyes You mean you mean the third son the one that was here this evening Yes the the youngest she returned her voice so feeble it was almost a whisper And then neither of them spoke for several long minutes Nor did either look at the other during that silence At last mister Vertrees contrived to cough but not convincingly What ah what was it Mary said about him out in the hall when she came in this afternoon I heard you asking her something about him but she answered in such a low voice I didn t ah happen to catch it She she didn t say much All she said was this I asked her if she had enjoyed her walk with him and she said He s the most wistful creature I ve ever known Well That was all He IS wistful looking and so fragile though he doesn t seem quite so much so lately I was watching Mary from the window when she went out to day and he joined her and if I hadn t known about him I d have thought he had quite an interesting face If you hadn t known about him Known what Oh nothing of course she said hurriedly Nothing definite that is Mary said decidely long ago that he s not at all insane as we thought at first It s only well of course it IS odd their attitude about him I suppose it s some nervous trouble that makes him perhaps a little queer at times so that he can t apply himself to anything or perhaps does odd things But after all of course we only have an impression about it We don t know that is positively I She paused then went on I didn t know just how to ask that is I didn t mention it to Mary I didn t I The poor lady floundered pitifully concluding with a mumble So soon after after the the shock I don t think I ve caught more than a glimpse of him said mister Vertrees I wouldn t know him if I saw him but your impression of him is He broke off suddenly springing to his feet in agitation I can t imagine her oh NO he gasped And he began to pace the floor A half witted epileptic No no she cried He may be all right We Oh it s horrible I can t He threw himself back into his chair again sweeping his hands across his face then letting them fall limply at his sides missus Vertrees was tremulous You mustn t give way so she said inspired for once almost to direct discourse Whatever Mary might think of doing it wouldn t be on her own account it would be on ours But if WE should should consider it that wouldn t be on OUR own account It isn t because we think of ourselves Oh God no he groaned Not for us We can go to the poorhouse but Mary can t be a stenographer Sighing missus Vertrees resumed her obliqueness Of course she murmured it all seems very premature speculating about such things but I had a queer sort of feeling that she seemed quite interested in this She had almost said in this one but checked herself In this young man It s natural of course she is always so strong and well and he is he seems to be that is rather appealing to the the sympathies Yes he agreed bitterly Precisely The sympathies Perhaps she faltered perhaps you might feel easier if I could have a little talk with some one With whom I had thought of not going about it too brusquely of course but perhaps just waiting for his name to be mentioned if I happened to be talking with somebody that knew the family and then I might find a chance to say that I was sorry to hear he d been ill so much and Something of that kind perhaps You don t know anybody that knows the family Yes That is well in a way of course one OF the family That missus Roscoe Sheridan is not a that is she s rather a pleasant faced little woman I think and of course rather ordinary I think she is interested about that is of course she d be anxious to be more intimate with Mary naturally She s always looking over here from her house she was looking out the window this afternoon when Mary went out I noticed though I don t think Mary saw her I m sure she wouldn t think it out of place to to be frank about matters She called the other day and Mary must rather like her she said that evening that the call had done her good Don t you think it might be wise Wise I don t know I feel the whole matter is impossible Yes so do I she returned promptly It isn t really a thing we should be considering seriously of course Still I should say not But possibly Thus they skirmished up and down the field but before they turned the lights out and went up stairs it was thoroughly understood between them that missus Vertrees should seek the earliest opportunity to obtain definite information from Sibyl Sheridan concerning the mental and physical status of Bibbs And if he were subject to attacks of lunacy the unhappy pair decided to prevent the sacrifice they supposed their daughter intended to make of herself Altogether if there were spiteful ghosts in the old house that night eavesdropping upon the woeful comedy they must have died anew of laughter missus Vertrees s opportunity occurred the very next afternoon Darkness had fallen and the piano movers had come They were carrying the piano down the front steps and missus Vertrees was standing in the open doorway behind them preparing to withdraw when she heard a sharp exclamation and missus Roscoe Sheridan bareheaded emerged from the shadow into the light of the doorway Good gracious she cried It did give me a fright It s missus Sheridan isn t it missus Vertrees was perplexed by this informal appearance but she reflected that it might be providential Won t you come in No Oh no thank you Sibyl panted pressing her hand to her side You don t know what a fright you ve given me And it was nothing but your piano She laughed shrilly You know since our tragedy coming so suddenly the other day you have no idea how upset I ve been almost hysterical And I just glanced out of the window a minute or so ago and saw your door wide open and black figures of men against the light carrying something heavy and I almost fainted You see it was just the way it looked when I saw them bringing my poor brother in law in next door only such a few short days ago And I thought I d seen your daughter start for a drive with Bibbs Sheridan in a car about three o clock and They aren t back yet are they No Good heavens And the only thing I could think of was that something must have happened to them and I just dashed over and it was only your PIANO She broke into laughter again I suppose you re just sending it somewhere to be repaired aren t you It s it s being taken down town said missus Vertrees Won t you come in and make me a little visit I was SO sorry the other day that I was ah She stopped inconsequently then repeated her invitation Won t you come in I d really Thank you but I must be running back My husband usually gets home about this time and I make a little point of it always to be there That s very sweet missus Vertrees descended the steps and walked toward the street with Sibyl It s quite balmy for so late in November isn t it Almost like a May evening I m afraid Miss Vertrees will miss her piano said Sibyl watching the instrument disappear into the big van at the curb She plays wonderfully missus Kittersby tells me Yes she plays very well One of your relatives came to hear her yesterday after dinner and I think she played all evening for him You mean Bibbs asked Sibyl The the youngest mister Sheridan Yes He s very musical isn t he I never heard of it But I shouldn t think it would matter much whether he was or not if he could get Miss Vertrees to play to him Does your daughter expect the piano back soon I I believe not immediately mister Sheridan came last evening to hear her play because she had arranged with the that is it was to be removed this afternoon He seems almost well again Yes Sibyl nodded His father s going to try to start him to work He seems very delicate said missus Vertrees I shouldn t think he would be able to stand a great deal either physically or She paused and then added glowing with the sense of her own adroitness or mentally Oh mentally Bibbs is all right said Sibyl in an odd voice Entirely missus Vertrees asked breathlessly Yes entirely But has he ALWAYS been This question came with the same anxious eagerness Certainly He had a long siege of nervous dyspepsia but he s over it And you think Bibbs is all right You needn t wor Sibyl choked and pressed her handkerchief to her mouth Good night missus Vertrees she said hurriedly as the head lights of an automobile swung round the corner above sending a brightening glare toward the edge of the pavement where the two ladies were standing Won t you come in urged missus Vertrees cordially hearing the sound of a cheerful voice out of the darkness beyond the approaching glare Do There s Mary now and she But Sibyl was half way across the street No thanks she called I hope she won t miss her piano And she ran into her own house and plunged headlong upon a leather divan in the hall holding her handkerchief over her mouth The noise of her tumultuous entrance was evidently startling in the quiet house for upon the bang of the door there followed the crash of a decanter dropped upon the floor of the dining room at the end of the hall and after a rumble of indistinct profanity Roscoe came forth holding a dripping napkin in his hand What s your excitement he demanded What do you find to go into hysterics over Another death in the family Oh it s funny she gasped Those old frost bitten people I guess THEY RE getting their come uppance Lying prone she elevated her feet in the air clapped her heels together repeatedly in an ecstasy Come through come through said her husband crossly What you been up to Me she cried dropping her feet and swinging around to face him Nothing It s them Those Vertreeses She wiped her eyes They ve had to sell their piano Well what of it That missus Kittersby told me all about em a week ago said Sibyl They ve been hard up for a long time and she says as long ago as last winter she knew that girl got a pair of walking shoes re soled and patched because she got it done the same place missus Kittersby s cook had HERS And the night of the house warming I kind of got suspicious myself She didn t have one single piece of any kind of real jewelry and you could see her dress was an old one done over Men can t tell those things and you all made a big fuss over her but I thought she looked a sight myself Of course EDITH was crazy to have her and Well well he urged impatiently Well I m TELLING you missus Kittersby says they haven t got a THING Just absolutely NOTHING and they don t know anywhere to turn The family s all died out but them and all the relatives they got are very distant and live East and scarcely know em She says the whole town s been wondering what WOULD become of em The girl had plenty chances to marry up to a year or so ago but she was so indifferent she scared the men off and the ones that had wanted to went and married other girls Gracious they were lucky Marry HER The man that found himself tied up to THAT girl Terrible funny terrible funny said Roscoe with sarcasm It s so funny I broke a cut glass decanter and spilled a quart of Wait she begged You ll see I was sitting by the window a little while ago and I saw a big wagon drive up across the street and some men go into the house It was too dark to make out much and for a minute I got the idea they were moving out the house has been foreclosed on missus Kittersby says It seemed funny too because I knew that girl was out riding with Bibbs Well I thought I d see so I slipped over and it was their PIANO They d sold it and were trying to sneak it out after dark so nobody d catch on Again she gave way to her enjoyment but resumed as her husband seemed about to interrupt the narrative Wait a minute can t you The old lady was superintending and she gave it all away I sized her up for one of those old churchy people that tell all kinds of lies except when it comes to so many words and then they can t She might just as well told me outright Yes they d sold it and I hope they ll pay some of their debts They owe everybody and last week a coal dealer made an awful fuss at the door with mister Vertrees Their cook told our upstairs girl and she said she didn t know WHEN she d seen any money herself Did you ever hear of such a case as that girl in your LIFE What girl Their cook That Vertrees girl Don t you see they looked on our coming up into this neighborhood as their last chance They were just going down and out and here bobs up the green rich Sheridan family So they doll the girl up in her old things made over and send her out to get a Sheridan she s GOT to get one And she just goes in blind and she tries it on first with YOU You remember she just plain TOLD you she was going to mash you and then she found out you were the married one and turned right square around to Jim and carried him off his feet Oh Jim was landed there s no doubt about THAT But Jim was lucky he didn t live to STAY landed and it s a good thing for him Sibyl s mirth had vanished and she spoke with virulent rapidity Well she couldn t get you because you were married and she couldn t get Jim because Jim died And there they were dead broke Do you know what she did Do you know what she s DOING No I don t said Roscoe gruffly Sibyl s voice rose and culminated in a scream of renewed hilarity BIBBS She waited in the grave yard and drove home with him from JIM S FUNERAL Never spoke to him before Jim wasn t COLD She rocked herself back and forth upon the divan Bibbs she shrieked Bibbs Roscoe THINK of it BIBBS He stared unsympathetically but her mirth was unabated for all that And yesterday she continued between paroxysms yesterday she came out of the house just as he was passing She must have been looking out waiting for the chance I saw the old lady watching at the window And she got him there last night to PLAY to him the old lady gave that away And to day she made him take her out in a machine And the cream of it is that they didn t even know whether he was INSANE or not they thought maybe he was but she went after him just the same The old lady set herself to pump me about it to day BIBBS Oh my Lord BIBBS But Roscoe looked grim So it s funny to you is it It sounds kind of pitiful to me I should think it would to a woman too Oh it might she returned sobering It might if those people weren t such frozen faced smart Alecks If they d had the decency to come down off the perch a little I probably wouldn t think it was funny but to see em sit up on their pedestal all the time they re eating dirt well I think it s funny That girl sits up as if she was Queen Elizabeth and expects people to wallow on the ground before her until they get near enough for her to give em a good kick with her old patched shoes oh she d do THAT all right and then she powders up and goes out to mash BIBBS SHERIDAN Look here said Roscoe heavily I don t care about that one way or another If you re through I got something I want to talk to you about I was going to that day just before we heard about Jim At this Sibyl stiffened quickly her eyes became intensely bright What is it Well he began frowning what I was going to say then He broke off and becoming conscious that he was still holding the wet napkin in his hand threw it pettishly into a corner I never expected I d have to say anything like this to anybody I MARRIED but I was going to ask you what was the matter between you and Lamhorn Sibyl uttered a sharp monosyllable Well I felt the time had come for me to know about it he went on You never told me anything You never asked she interposed curtly Well we d got in a way of not talking much said Roscoe It looks to me now as if we d pretty much lost the run of each other the way a good many people do I don t say it wasn t my fault I was up early and down to work all day and I d come home tired at night and want to go to bed soon as I d got the paper read unless there was some good musical show in town Well you seemed all right until here lately the last month or so I began to see something was wrong I couldn t help seeing it Wrong she said What like You changed you didn t look the same You were all strung up and excited and fidgety you got to looking peakid and run down Now then Lamhorn had been going with us a good while but I noticed that not long ago you got to picking on him about every little thing he did you got to quarreling with him when I was there and when I wasn t I could see you d been quarreling whenever I came in and he was here Do you object to that asked Sibyl breathing quickly Yes when it injures my wife s health he returned with a quick lift of his eyes to hers You began to run down just about the time you began falling out with him He stepped close to her See here Sibyl I m going to know what it means Oh you ARE she snapped You re trembling he said gravely Yes I m angry enough to do more than tremble you ll find Go on That was all I was going to say the other day he said I was going to ask you Yes that was all you were going to say THE OTHER DAY Yes What else have you to say to night To night he replied with grim swiftness I want to know why you keep telephoning him you want to see him since he stopped coming here She made a long low sound of comprehension before she said And what else did Edith want you to ask me I want to know what you say over the telephone to Lamhorn he said fiercely Is that all Edith told you to ask me You saw her when you stopped in there on your way home this evening didn t you Didn t she tell you then what I said over the telephone to mister Lamhorn No she didn t he vociferated his voice growing louder She said You tell your wife to stop telephoning Robert Lamhorn to come and see her because he isn t going to do it That s what she said And I want to know what it means I intend A maid appeared at the lower end of the hall Dinner is ready she said and giving the troubled pair one glance went demurely into the dining room Roscoe disregarded the interruption I intend to know exactly what has been going on he declared I mean to know just what Sibyl jumped up almost touching him standing face to face with him Oh you DO she cried shrilly You mean to know just what s what do you You listen to your sister insinuating ugly things about your wife and then you come home making a scene before the servants and humiliating me in their presence Do you suppose that Irish girl didn t hear every word you said You go in there and eat your dinner alone Go on Go and eat your dinner alone because I won t eat with you And she broke away from the detaining grasp he sought to fasten upon her and dashed up the stairway panting He heard the door of her room slam overhead and the sharp click of the key in the lock CHAPTER XVIII At seven o clock on the last morning of that month Sheridan passing through the upper hall on his way to descend the stairs for breakfast found a couple of scribbled sheets of note paper lying on the floor A window had been open in Bibbs s room the evening before he had left his note book on the sill and the sheets were loose The door was open and when Bibbs came in and closed it he did not notice that the two sheets had blown out into the hall Sheridan recognized the handwriting and put the sheets in his coat pocket intending to give them to George or Jackson for return to the owner but he forgot and carried them down town with him At noon he found himself alone in his office and having a little leisure remembered the bits of manuscript took them out and glanced at them A glance was enough to reveal that they were not epistolary Sheridan would not have read a private letter that came into his possession in that way though in a matter of business he might have felt it his duty to take advantage of an opportunity afforded in any manner whatsoever Having satisfied himself that Bibbs s scribblings were only a sample of the kind of writing his son preferred to the machine shop he decided innocently enough that he would be justified in reading them It appears that a lady will nod pleasantly upon some windy generalization of a companion and will wear the most agreeable expression of accepting it as the law and then days afterward when the thing is a mummy to its promulgator she will inquire out of a clear sky WHY did you say that the people down town have nothing in life that a chicken hasn t What did you mean And she may say it in a manner that makes a sensible reply very difficult you will be so full of wonder that she remembered so seriously Yet what does the rooster lack He has food and shelter he is warm in winter his wives raise not one fine family for him but dozens He has a clear sky over him he breathes sweet air he walks in his April orchard under a roof of flowers He must die violently perhaps but quickly Is Midas s cancer a better way The rooster s wives and children must die Are those of Midas immortal His life is shorter than the life of Midas but Midas s life is only a sixth as long as that of the Galapagos tortoise The worthy money worker takes his vacation so that he may refresh himself anew for the hard work of getting nothing that the rooster doesn t get The office building has an elevator the rooster flies up to the bough Midas has a machine to take him to his work the rooster finds his worm underfoot The business man feels a pressure sometimes without knowing why and sits late at wine after the day s labor next morning he curses his head because it interferes with the work he swears never to relieve that pressure again The rooster has no pressure and no wine this difference is in his favor The rooster is a dependent he depends upon the farmer and the weather Midas is a dependent he depends upon the farmer and the weather The rooster thinks only of the moment Midas provides for to morrow What does he provide for to morrow Nothing that the rooster will not have without providing The rooster and the prosperous worker they are born they grub they love they grub and love grubbing they grub and they die Neither knows beauty neither knows knowledge And after all when Midas dies and the rooster dies there is one thing Midas has had and rooster has not Midas has had the excitement of accumulating what he has grubbed and that has been his life and his love and his god He cannot take that god with him when he dies I wonder if the worthy gods are those we can take with us Midas must teach all to be as Midas the young must be raised in his religion The manuscript ended there and Sheridan was not anxious for more He crumpled the sheets into a ball depositing it with vigor in a waste basket beside him then rising he consulted a Cyclopedia of Names which a book agent had somehow sold to him years before a volume now first put to use for the location of Midas Having read the legend Sheridan walked up and down the spacious office exhaling the breath of contempt Dam fool he mumbled But this was no new thought nor was the contrariness of Bibbs s notes a surpise to him and presently he dismissed the matter from his mind He felt very lonely and this was daily his hardest hour For a long time he and Jim had lunched together habitually Roscoe preferred a club luncheon but Jim and his father almost always went to a small restaurant near the Sheridan Building where they spent twenty minutes in the consumption of food and twenty in talk with cigars Jim came for his father every day at five minutes after twelve and Sheridan was again in his office at five minutes before one But now that Jim no longer came Sheridan remained alone in his office he had not gone out to lunch since Jim s death nor did he have anything sent to him he fasted until evening It was the time he missed Jim personally the most the voice and eyes and handshake all brisk and alert all business like But these things were not the keenest in Sheridan s grief his sense of loss went far deeper Roscoe was dependable a steady old wheel horse and that was a great comfort but it was in Jim that Sheridan had most happily perceived his own likeness Jim was the one who would have been surest to keep the great property growing greater year by year Sheridan had fallen asleep night after night picturing what the growth would be under Jim He had believed that Jim was absolutely certain to be one of the biggest men in the country Well it was all up to Roscoe now That reminded him of a question he had in mind to ask Roscoe It was a question Sheridan considered of no present importance but his wife had suggested it though vaguely and he had meant to speak to Roscoe about it However Roscoe had not come into his father s office for several days and when Sheridan had seen his son at home there had been no opportunity He waited until the greater part of his day s work was over toward four o clock and then went down to Roscoe s office which was on a lower floor He found several men waiting for business interviews in an outer room of the series Roscoe occupied and he supposed that he would find his son busy with others and that his question would have to be postponed but when he entered the door marked R C Sheridan Private Roscoe was there alone He was sitting with his back to the door his feet on a window sill and he did not turn as his father opened the door Some pretty good men out there waitin to see you my boy said Sheridan What s the matter Nothing Roscoe answered indistinctly not moving Well I guess that s all right too I let em wait sometimes myself I just wanted to ask you a question but I expect it ll keep if you re workin something out in your mind Roscoe made no reply and his father who had turned to the door paused with his hand on the knob staring curiously at the motionless figure in the chair Usually the son seemed pleased and eager when he came to the office You re all right ain t you said Sheridan Not sick are you No Sheridan was puzzled then abruptly he decided to ask his question I wanted to talk to you about that young Lamhorn he said I guess your mother thinks he s comin to see Edith pretty often and you known him longer n any of us so I won t said Roscoe thickly I won t say a dam thing about him Sheridan uttered an exclamation and walked quickly to a position near the window where he could see his son s face Roscoe s eyes were bloodshot and vacuous his hair was disordered his mouth was distorted and he was deathly pale The father stood aghast By George he muttered ROSCOE My name said Roscoe Can help that ROSCOE Blank astonishment was Sheridan s first sensation Probably nothing in the world could have more amazed his than to find Roscoe the steady old wheel horse in this condition How d you GET this way he demanded You caught cold and took too much for it For reply Roscoe laughed hoarsely Yeuh Cold I been drinkun all time lately Firs you notice it By George cried Sheridan I THOUGHT I d smelt it on you a good deal lately but I wouldn t a believed you d take more n was good for you Boh To see you like a common hog Roscoe chuckled and threw out his right arm in a meaningless gesture Hog he repeated chuckling Yes a hog said Sheridan angrily In business hours I don t object to anybody s takin a drink if you wants to out o business hours nor if a man keeps his work right up to the scratch I wouldn t be the one to baste him if he got good an drunk once in two three years maybe It ain t MY way I let it alone but I never believed in forcin my way on a grown up son in moral matters I guess I was wrong You think them men out there are waitin to talk business with a drunkard You think you can come to your office and do business drunk By George I wonder how often this has been happening and me not on to it I ll have a look over your books to morrow and I ll Roscoe stumbled to his feet laughing wildly and stood swaying contriving to hold himself in position by clutching the back of the heavy chair in which he had been sitting Hoo hoorah he cried S my principles too Be drunkard all you want to outside business hours Don for Gossake le n thing innerfere business hours Business Thassit You re right father Drink Die L everything go to hell but DON let innerfere business Sheridan had seized the telephone upon Roscoe s desk and was calling his own office overhead Abercrombie Come down to my son Roscoe s suite and get rid of some gentlemen that are waitin there to see him in room two fourteen There s Maples and Schirmer and a couple o fellows on the Kinsey business Tell em something s come up I have to go over with Roscoe and tell em to come back day after to morrow at two You needn t come in to let me know they re gone we don t want to be disturbed Tell Pauly to call my house and send Claus down here with a closed car We may have to go out Tell him to hustle and call me at Roscoe s room as soon as the car gets here T s all Roscoe had laughed bitterly throughout this monologue Drunk in business hours Thass awf l Mus n do such thing Mus n get drunk mus n gamble

your tradegy keep em ALL for home use If you got die go on die t home don die round th office Might innerfere business Sheridan picked up a newspaper from Roscoe s desk and sat down with his back to his son affecting to read Roscoe seemed to be unaware of his father s significant posture You know wh I think he went on I think Bibbs only one the fam ly any telligence at all Won work an di n get married Jim worked an he got killed I worked an I got married Look at me Jus look at me I ask you Fine dustriss young business man Look whass happen to me Fine He lifted his hand from the sustaining chair in a deplorable gesture and immediately losing his balance fell across the chair and caromed to the floor with a crash remaining prostrate for several minutes during which Sheridan did not relax his apparent attention to the newspaper He did not even look round at the sound of Roscoe s fall Roscoe slowly climbed to an upright position pulling himself up by holding to the chair He was slightly sobered outwardly having progressed in the prostrate interval to a state of befuddlement less volatile He rubbed his dazed eyes with the back of his left hand What what you ask me while ago he said Nothin Yes you did What what was it Nothin You better sit down You ask me what I thought about Lamhorn You did ask me that Well I won t tell you I won t say dam word bout him The telephone bell tinkled Sheridan placed the receiver to his ear and said Right down Then he got Roscoe s coat and hat from a closet and brought them to his son Get into this coat he said You re goin home All ri Roscoe murmured obediently They went out into the main hall by a side door not passing through the outer office and Sheridan waited for an empty elevator stopped it and told the operator to take on no more passengers until they reached the ground floor Roscoe walked out of the building and got into the automobile without lurching and twenty minutes later walked into his own house in the same manner neither he nor his father having spoken a word in the interval Sheridan did not go in with him he went home and to his own room without meeting any of his family But as he passed Bibbs s door he heard from within the sound of a cheerful young voice humming jubilant fragments of song WHO looks a mustang in the eye With a leap from the ground To the saddle in a bound And away and away Hi yay It was the first time in Sheridan s life that he had ever detected any musical symptom whatever in Bibbs he had never even heard him whistle and it seemed the last touch of irony that the useless fool should be merry to day To Sheridan it was Tom o Bedlam singing while the house burned and he did not tarry to enjoy the melody but went into his own room and locked the door

none	none	 He emerged only upon a second summons to dinner two hours later and came to the table so white and silent that his wife made her anxiety manifest and was but partially reassured by his explanation that his lunch had disagreed with him a little 
2573_178449_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Presently however he spoke effectively 
none	none	Bibbs whose appetite had become hearty was helping himself to a second breast of capon from white jacket s salver
2573_178449_000003_000002	train-clean-360	 Here s another difference between Midas and chicken Sheridan remarked grimly 
2573_178449_000003_000003	train-clean-360	 Midas can eat rooster but rooster can t eat Midas 
none	none	I reckon you overlooked that 
2573_178449_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Midas looks to me like he had the advantage there 
2573_178449_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Bibbs retained enough presence of mind to transfer the capon breast to his plate without dropping it and to respond Yes he crows over it 
2573_178449_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Having returned his antagonists s fire in this fashion he blushed for he could blush distinctly now and his mother looked upon him with pleasure thought the reference to Midas and roosters was of course jargon to her 
2573_178449_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you ever see anybody improve the way that child has she exclaimed 
2573_178449_000005_000002	train-clean-360	 I declare Bibbs sometimes lately you look right handsome 
2573_178449_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 He s got to be such a gadabout Edith giggled 
2573_178449_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I found something of his on the floor up stairs this morning before anybody was up said Sheridan 
2573_178449_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I reckon if people lose things in this house and expect to get em back they better get up as soon as I do 
2573_178449_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 What was it he lost asked Edith 
none	none	He knows her father returned
2573_178449_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 Seems to me like I forgot to bring it home with me 
2573_178449_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I looked it over thought probably it was something pretty important belongin to a busy man like him He affected to search his pockets 
2573_178449_000009_000003	train-clean-360	 What DID I do with it now 
none	none	Oh yes Seems to me like I remember leavin it down at the office in the waste basket Good place for it Bibbs murmured still red 
2573_178449_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Sheridan gave him a grin 
2573_178449_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps pretty soon you ll be gettin up early enough to find things before I do 
none	none	It was a threat and Bibbs repeated the substance of it later in the evening to Mary Vertrees they had come to know each other that well My time s here at last he said as they sat together in the melancholy gas light of the room which had been denuded of its piano That removal had left an emptiness so distressing to mister and missus Vertrees that neither of them had crossed the threshold since the dark day but the gas light though from a single jet shed no melancholy upon Bibbs nor could any room seem bare that knew the glowing presence of Mary 
2573_178449_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He spoke lightly not sadly 
2573_178449_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes it s come 
2573_178449_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I ve shirked and put off but I can t shirk and put off any longer 
2573_178449_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It s really my part to go to him at least it would save my face 
2573_178449_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He means what he says and the time s come to serve my sentence Hard labor for life I think 
2573_178449_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Mary shook her head 
2573_178449_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t think so 
2573_178449_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He s too kind 
2573_178449_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 You think my father s KIND And Bibbs stared at her 
none	none	Yes 
2573_178449_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I m sure of it 
none	none	I ve felt that he has a great brave heart 
2573_178449_000017_000003	train-clean-360	It s only that he has to be kind in his own way because he can t understand any other way 
none	none	Ah yes said Bibbs
2573_178449_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 If that s what you mean by kind 
2573_178449_000019_000000	train-clean-360	She looked at him gravely earnest concern in her friendly eyes 
2573_178449_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 It s going to be pretty hard for you isn t it 
none	none	Oh self pity he returned smiling
2573_178449_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 This has been just the last flicker of revolt 
none	none	Nobody minds work if he likes the kind of work There d be no loafers in the world if each man found the thing that he could do best but the only work I happen to want to do is useless so I have to give it up 
2573_178449_000020_000003	train-clean-360	To morrow I ll be a day laborer 
2573_178449_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it like exactly 
2573_178449_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I get up at six he said 
2573_178449_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 I have a lunch basket to carry with me which is aristocratic and no advantage 
2573_178449_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The other workmen have tin buckets and tin buckets are better 
2573_178449_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I leave the house at six thirty and I m at work in my overalls at seven 
none	none	I have an hour off at noon and work again from one till five
2573_178449_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 But the work itself 
2573_178449_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 It wasn t muscularly exhausting not at all 
2573_178449_000024_000001	train-clean-360	They couldn t give me a heavier job because I wasn t good enough 
2573_178449_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But what will you do 
none	none	I want to know When I left said Bibbs I was on what they call over there a clipping machine in one of the by products departments and that s what I ll be sent back to
2573_178449_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But what is it she insisted 
none	none	Bibbs explained
2573_178449_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 It s very simple and very easy 
2573_178449_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I feed long strips of zinc into a pair of steel jaws and the jaws bite the zinc into little circles 
none	none	All I have to do is to see that the strip goes into the jaws at a certain angle and yet I was a very bad hand at it 
2573_178449_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He had kept his voice cheerful as he spoke but he had grown a shade paler and there was a latent anguish deep in his eyes 
2573_178449_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He may have known it and wished her not to see it for he turned away 
none	none	You do that all day long she asked and as he nodded It seems incredible she exclaimed YOU feeding a strip of zinc into a machine nine hours a day No wonder 
2573_178449_000030_000003	train-clean-360	She broke off and then after a keen glance at his face she said I should think you WOULD have been a bad hand at it 
2573_178449_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He laughed ruefully 
2573_178449_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 I think it s the noise though I m ashamed to say it 
none	none	You see it s a very powerful machine and there s a sort of rhythmical crashing a crash every time the jaws bite off a circle
2573_178449_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 How often is that 
2573_178449_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 The thing should make about sixty eight disks a minute a little more than one a second 
2573_178449_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 And you re close to it 
2573_178449_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh the workman has to sit in its lap he said turning to her more gaily 
2573_178449_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 The others don t mind 
none	none	You see it s something wrong with me 
2573_178449_000035_000003	train-clean-360	I have an idiotic way of flinching from the confounded thing I flinch and duck a little every time the crash comes and I couldn t get over it 
2573_178449_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I was a treat to the other workmen in that room they ll be glad to see me back 
none	none	They used to laugh at me all day long Mary s gaze was averted from Bibbs now she sat with her elbow resting on the arm of the chair her lifted hand pressed against her cheek 
2573_178449_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She was staring at the wall and her eyes had a burning brightness in them 
2573_178449_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 It doesn t seem possible any one could do that to you she said in a low voice 
none	none	No 
2573_178449_000037_000002	train-clean-360	He s not kind 
2573_178449_000037_000003	train-clean-360	He ought to be proud to help you to the leisure to write books it should be his greatest privilege to have them published for you 
2573_178449_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t you SEE him Bibbs interrupted a faint ripple of hilarity in his voice 
2573_178449_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 If he could understand what you re saying and if you can imagine his taking such a notion he d have had R T Bloss put up posters all over the country Read B Sheridan 
2573_178449_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Read the Poet with a Punch No 
2573_178449_000038_000003	train-clean-360	It s just as well he never got the But what s the use 
2573_178449_000038_000004	train-clean-360	I ve never written anything worth printing and I never shall 
2573_178449_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 You could she said 
2573_178449_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 That s because you ve never seen the poor little things I ve tried to do 
2573_178449_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 You wouldn t let me but I KNOW you could 
none	none	Ah it s a pity
2573_178449_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t said BIBBS honestly 
none	none	I never could but you re the kindest lady in this world Miss Vertrees 
2573_178449_000043_000000	train-clean-360	She gave him a flashing glance and it was as kind as he said she was That sounds wrong she said impulsively 
none	none	I mean Miss Vertrees I ve thought of you by your first name ever since I met you 
2573_178449_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Wouldn t you rather call me Mary 
2573_178449_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Bibbs was dazzled he drew a long deep breath and did not speak 
2573_178449_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Wouldn t you she asked without a trace of coquetry 
2573_178449_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 If I CAN he said in a low voice 
2573_178449_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah that s very pretty she laughed 
2573_178449_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 You re such an honest person it s pleasant to have you gallant sometimes by way of variety She became grave again immediately 
2573_178449_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 I hear myself laughing as if it were some one else 
2573_178449_000047_000003	train-clean-360	It sounds like laughter on the eve of a great calamity She got up restlessly crossed the room and leaned against the wall facing him 
2573_178449_000047_000004	train-clean-360	 You ve GOT to go back to that place 
none	none	He nodded
2573_178449_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 And the other time you did it 
2573_178449_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Just over it said Bibbs 
none	none	Two years But I don t mind the prospect of a repetition so much as So much as what she prompted as he stopped Bibbs looked up at her shyly
2573_178449_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I want to say it but but I come to a dead balk when I try 
none	none	I Go on 
2573_178449_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Say it whatever it is she bade him 
2573_178449_000053_000002	train-clean-360	 You wouldn t know how to say anything I shouldn t like 
2573_178449_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I doubt if you d either like or dislike what I want to say he returned moving uncomfortably in his chair and looking at his feet he seemed to feel awkward thoroughly 
2573_178449_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 You see all my life until I met you if I ever felt like saying anything I wrote it instead 
2573_178449_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Saying things is a new trick for me and this well it s just this I used to feel as if I hadn t ever had any sort of a life at all 
none	none	I d never been of use to anything or anybody and I d never had anything myself except a kind of haphazard thinking 
2573_178449_000054_000004	train-clean-360	But now it s different I m still of no use to anybody and I don t see any prospect of being useful but I have had something for myself 
none	none	I ve had a beautiful and happy experience and it makes my life seem to be I mean I m glad I ve lived it 
2573_178449_000054_000006	train-clean-360	That s all it s your letting me be near you sometimes as you have this strange beautiful happy little while 
none	none	He did not once look up and reached silence at the end of what he had to say with his eyes still awkwardly regarding his feet 
2573_178449_000055_000001	train-clean-360	She did not speak but a soft rustling of her garments let him know that she had gone back to her chair again 
2573_178449_000055_000002	train-clean-360	The house was still the shabby old room was so quiet that the sound of a creaking in the wall seemed sharp and loud 
2573_178449_000056_000000	train-clean-360	And yet when Mary spoke at last her voice was barely audible 
2573_178449_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 If you think it has been happy to be friends with me you d want to to make it last 
2573_178449_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Bibbs as faintly 
2573_178449_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 You d want to go on being my friend as long as we live wouldn t you 
2573_178449_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he gulped 
2573_178449_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 But you make that kind of speech to me because you think it s over 
2573_178449_000061_000000	train-clean-360	He tried to evade her 
2573_178449_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh a day laborer can t come in his overalls 
2573_178449_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 No she interrupted with a sudden sharpness 
2573_178449_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 You said what you did because you think the shop s going to kill you 
none	none	No no
2573_178449_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes you do think that She rose to her feet again and came and stood before him 
2573_178449_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Or you think it s going to send you back to the sanitarium Don t deny it Bibbs 
none	none	There See how easily I call you that 
2573_178449_000064_000004	train-clean-360	You see I m a friend or I couldn t do it 
2573_178449_000064_000005	train-clean-360	Well if you meant what you said and you did mean it I know it you re not going to go back to the sanitarium The shop sha n t hurt you 
none	none	It sha n t 
2573_178449_000065_000000	train-clean-360	And now Bibbs looked up 
2573_178449_000065_000001	train-clean-360	She stood before him straight and tall splendid in generous strength her eyes shining and wet 
2573_178449_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 If I mean THAT much to you she cried they can t harm you 
2573_178449_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Go back to the shop but come to me when your day s work is done 
none	none	Let the machines crash their sixty eight times a minute but remember each crash that deafens you is that much nearer the evening and me He stumbled to his feet
2573_178449_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 You say he gasped 
2573_178449_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Every evening dear Bibbs 
2573_178449_000069_000000	train-clean-360	He could only stare bewildered 
none	none	EVERY evening I want you They sha n t hurt you again And she held out her hand to him it was strong and warm in his tremulous clasp
2573_178449_000070_000003	train-clean-360	 If I could I d go and feed the strips of zinc to the machine with you she said 
2573_178449_000070_000004	train-clean-360	 But all day long I ll send my thoughts to you 
2573_178449_000070_000005	train-clean-360	You must keep remembering that your friend stands beside you 
2573_178449_000070_000006	train-clean-360	And when the work is done won t the night make up for the day 
2573_178449_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Light seemed to glow from her he was blinded by that radiance of kindness 
2573_178449_000071_000001	train-clean-360	But all he could say was huskily To think you re there with me standing beside the old zinc eater 
2573_178449_000072_000000	train-clean-360	And they laughed and looked at each other and at last Bibbs found what it meant not to be alone in the world 
none	none	He had a friend 
2573_178450_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XX
none	none	 When he came into the New House a few minutes later he found his father sitting alone by the library fire 
2573_178450_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Bibbs went in and stood before him 
2573_178450_000001_000002	train-clean-360	 I m cured father he said 
2573_178450_000001_000003	train-clean-360	 When do I go back to the shop 
none	none	I m ready 
2573_178450_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The desolate and grim old man did not relax 
2573_178450_000002_000001	train-clean-360	 I was sittin up to give you a last chance to say something like that 
2573_178450_000002_000002	train-clean-360	I reckon it s about time I just wanted to see if you d have manhood enough not to make me take you over there by the collar 
2573_178450_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Last night I made up my mind I d give you just one more day 
2573_178450_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Well you got to it before I did pretty close to the eleventh hour

2573_178450_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Six o clock Bibbs responded briskly 
none	none	And I want to tell you I m going in a cheerful spirit As you said I ll go and I ll like it
2573_178450_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 That s YOUR lookout his father grunted 
2573_178450_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 They ll put you back on the clippin machine 
2573_178450_000004_000002	train-clean-360	You get nine dollars a week 
none	none	More than I m worth too said Bibbs cheerily
2573_178450_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 That reminds me I didn t mean YOU by Midas in that nonsense I d been writing 
none	none	I meant Makes a hell of a lot o difference what you meant
2573_178450_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I just wanted you to know 
2573_178450_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Good night father 
2573_178450_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 G night 
2573_178450_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The sound of the young man s footsteps ascending the stairs became inaudible and the house was quiet 
2573_178450_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But presently as Sheridan sat staring angrily at the fire the shuffling of a pair of slippers could be heard descending and missus Sheridan made her appearance her oblique expression and the state of her toilette being those of a person who after trying unsuccessfully to sleep on one side has got up to look for burglars 
2573_178450_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa she exclaimed drowsily 
2573_178450_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Why n t you go to bed 
none	none	It must be goin on leven o clock She yawned and seated herself near him stretching out her hands to the fire
2573_178450_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 What s the matter she asked sleep and anxiety striving sluggishly with each other in her voice 
none	none	I knew you were worried all dinner time 
2573_178450_000011_000003	train-clean-360	You got something new on your mind besides Jim s bein taken away like he was 
2573_178450_000011_000004	train-clean-360	What s worryin you now papa 
none	none	Nothin 
2573_178450_000013_000000	train-clean-360	She jeered feebly 
none	none	N tell ME that You sat up to see Bibbs didn t you He starts in at the shop again to morrow morning said Sheridan
2573_178450_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Just the same as he did before 
none	none	Just pre CISELY How how long you goin to keep him at it papa she asked timidly
2573_178450_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Until he KNOWS something 
none	none	The unhappy man struck his palms together then got to his feet and began to pace the room as was his wont when he talked
2573_178450_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 He ll go back to the machine he couldn t learn to tend properly in the six months he was there and he ll stick to it till he DOES learn it 
2573_178450_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Do you suppose that lummix ever asked himself WHY I want him to learn it 
none	none	No 
2573_178450_000018_000005	train-clean-360	And I ain t a goin to tell him either 
none	none	When he went there I had em set him on the simplest machine we got and he stuck there How much prospect would there be of his learnin to run the whole business if he can t run the easiest machine in it 
2573_178450_000018_000008	train-clean-360	I sent him there to make him THOROUGH 
none	none	And what happened 
2573_178450_000018_000010	train-clean-360	He didn t LIKE it 
none	none	That boy s whole life there s been a settin up o something mulish that s against everything I want him to do 
2573_178450_000018_000012	train-clean-360	I don t know what it is but it s got to be worked out of him 
2573_178450_000018_000013	train-clean-360	Now labor ain t any more a simple question than what it was when we were young 
none	none	My idea is that outside o union troubles the man that can manage workin men is the man that s been one himself Well I set Bibbs to learn the men and to learn the business and HE set himself to balk on the first job 
2573_178450_000018_000015	train-clean-360	That s what he did and the balk s lasted close on to three years 
none	none	If he balks again I m just done with him Sometimes I feel like I was pretty near done with everything anyhow
2573_178450_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I knew there was something else said missus Sheridan blinking over a yawn 
none	none	You better let it go till to morrow and get to bed now less you ll tell me
2573_178450_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Suppose something happened to Roscoe he said 
2573_178450_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 THEN what d I have to look forward to 
2573_178450_000020_000002	train-clean-360	THEN what could I depend on to hold things together 
2573_178450_000020_000003	train-clean-360	A lummix 
2573_178450_000020_000004	train-clean-360	A lummix that hasn t learned how to push a strip o zinc along a groove 
none	none	Roscoe she yawned
2573_178450_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 You needn t worry about Roscoe papa 
2573_178450_000021_000002	train-clean-360	He s the strongest child we had 
2573_178450_000021_000003	train-clean-360	I never did know anybody keep better health than he does 
2573_178450_000021_000004	train-clean-360	I don t believe he s even had a cold in five years 
2573_178450_000021_000005	train-clean-360	You better go up to bed papa 
none	none	Suppose something DID happen to him though 
2573_178450_000022_000001	train-clean-360	You don t know what it means keepin property together these days just keepin it ALIVE let alone makin it grow the way I do 
2573_178450_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I ve seen too many estates hacked away in chunks big and little 
none	none	I tell you when a man dies the wolves come out o the woods pack after pack to see what they can tear off for themselves and if that dead man s chuldern ain t on the job night and day everything he built ll get 
2573_178450_000022_000004	train-clean-360	carried off 
none	none	Carried off 
2573_178450_000022_000005	train-clean-360	I ve seen a big fortune behave like an ash barrel in a cyclone there wasn t even a dust heap left to tell where it stood 
none	none	I ve seen it time and again My Lord when I think o such things comin to ME It don t seem like I deserved it no man ever tried harder to raise his boys right than I have I planned and planned and planned how to bring em up to be guards to drive the wolves off and how to be builders to build and build bigger 
2573_178450_000022_000009	train-clean-360	I tell you this business life is no fool s job nowadays a man s got to have eyes in the back of his head 
none	none	You hear talk sometimes d make you think the millennium had come but right the next breath you ll hear somebody hollerin about the great unrest You BET there s a great unrest There ain t any man alive smart enough to see what it s goin to do to us in the end nor what day it s got set to bust loose but it s frothin and bubblin in the boiler 
2573_178450_000022_000012	train-clean-360	This country s been fillin up with it from all over the world for a good many years and the old camp meetin days are dead and done with 
2573_178450_000022_000013	train-clean-360	Church ain t what it used to be 
none	none	Nothin s what it used to be everything s turned up from the bottom and the growth is so big the roots stick out in the air 
2573_178450_000022_000015	train-clean-360	There s an awful ruction goin on and you got to keep hoppin if you re goin to keep your balance on the top of it 
none	none	And the schemers 
2573_178450_000022_000017	train-clean-360	They run like bugs on the bottom of a board after any piece o money they hear is loose 
none	none	Fool schemes and crooked schemes the fool ones are the most and the worst 
2573_178450_000022_000019	train-clean-360	You got to FIGHT to keep your money after you ve made it 
none	none	And the woods are full o mighty industrious men that s got only one motto Get the other fellow s money before he gets yours And when a man s built as I have when he s built good and strong and made good things grow and prosper THOSE are the fellows that lay for the chance to slide in and sneak the benefit of it and put their names to it And what s the use of my havin ever been born if such a thing as that is goin to happen What s the use of my havin worked my life and soul into my business if it s all goin to be dispersed and scattered soon as I m in the ground 
2573_178450_000023_000000	train-clean-360	He strode up and down the long room gesticulating little regarding the troubled and drowsy figure by the fireside 
2573_178450_000023_000001	train-clean-360	His throat rumbled thunderously the words came with stormy bitterness 
none	none	You think this is a time for young men to be lyin on beds of ease 
2573_178450_000023_000003	train-clean-360	I tell you there never was such a time before there never was such opportunity 
2573_178450_000023_000004	train-clean-360	The sluggard is despoiled while he sleeps yes by George if a man lays down they ll eat him before he wakes but the live man can build straight up till he touches the sky 
2573_178450_000023_000005	train-clean-360	This is the business man s day it used to be the soldier s day and the statesman s day but this is OURS 
none	none	And it ain t a Sunday to go fishin it s turmoil turmoil and you got to go out and live it and breathe it and MAKE it yourself or you ll only be a dead man walkin around dreamin you re alive 
2573_178450_000023_000008	train-clean-360	And that s what my son Bibbs has been doin all his life and what he d rather do now than go out and do his part by me 
2573_178450_000023_000009	train-clean-360	And if anything happens to Roscoe 
2573_178450_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh do stop worryin over such nonsense missus Sheridan interrupted irritated into sharp wakefulness for the moment 
none	none	There isn t anything goin to happen to Roscoe and you re just tormentin yourself about nothin 
2573_178450_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Aren t you EVER goin to bed 
2573_178450_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Sheridan halted 
2573_178450_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 All right mamma he said with a vast sigh 
2573_178450_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 Let s go up And he snapped off the electric light leaving only the rosy glow of the fire 
2573_178450_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you speak to Roscoe she yawned rising lopsidedly in her drowsiness 
none	none	Did you mention about what I told you the other evening No 
2573_178450_000027_000001	train-clean-360	I will to morrow 
none	none	But Roscoe did not come down town the next day nor the next nor did Sheridan see fit to enter his son s house He waited 
2573_178450_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Then on the fourth day of the month Roscoe walked into his father s office at nine in the morning when Sheridan happened to be alone 
2573_178450_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 They told me down stairs you d left word you wanted to see me 
2573_178450_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Sit down said Sheridan rising 
2573_178450_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Roscoe sat 
2573_178450_000031_000001	train-clean-360	His father walked close to him sniffed suspiciously and then walked away smiling bitterly 
none	none	Boh he exclaimed
2573_178450_000031_000003	train-clean-360	 Still at it 
2573_178450_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Roscoe 
none	none	I ve had a couple of drinks this morning 
2573_178450_000032_000002	train-clean-360	What about it 
2573_178450_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I reckon I better adopt some decent young man his father returned I d bring Bibbs up here and put him in your place if he was fit 
none	none	I would
2573_178450_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Better do it Roscoe assented sullenly 
2573_178450_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 When d you begin this thing 
2573_178450_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I always did drink a little 
2573_178450_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Ever since I grew up that is 
2573_178450_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Leave that talk out 
none	none	You know what I mean
2573_178450_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I don t know as I ever had too much in office hours until the other day 
2573_178450_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Sheridan began cutting 
none	none	It s a lie 
2573_178450_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I ve had Ray Wills up from your office 
2573_178450_000039_000003	train-clean-360	He didn t want to give you away but I put the hooks into him and he came through 
2573_178450_000039_000004	train-clean-360	You were drunk twice before and couldn t work 
2573_178450_000039_000005	train-clean-360	You been leavin your office for drinks every few hours for the last three weeks 
none	none	I been over your books 
2573_178450_000039_000007	train-clean-360	Your office is way behind 
2573_178450_000039_000008	train-clean-360	You haven t done any work to count in a month 
2573_178450_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Roscoe drooping under the torture 
2573_178450_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 It s all true 
none	none	What you goin to do about it 
2573_178450_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Roscoe s head was sunk between his shoulders 
2573_178450_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t stand very much talk about it father he said pleadingly 
2573_178450_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 No Sheridan cried 
none	none	Neither can I What do you think it means to ME He dropped into the chair at his big desk groaning I can t stand to talk about it any more n you can to listen but I m goin to find out what s the matter with you and I m goin to straighten you out 
2573_178450_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Roscoe shook his head helplessly 
2573_178450_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 You can t straighten me out 
2573_178450_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 See here said Sheridan 
none	none	Can you go back to your office and stay sober to day while I get my work done or will I have to hire a couple o huskies to follow you around and knock the whiskey out o your hand if they see you tryin to take it
2573_178450_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 You needn t worry about that said Roscoe looking up with a faint resentment 
2573_178450_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I m not drinking because I ve got a thirst 
2573_178450_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what have you got 
none	none	Nothing 
2573_178450_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Nothing you can do anything about 
2573_178450_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing I tell you 
2573_178450_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll see about that said Sheridan harshly 
none	none	Now I can t fool with you to day and you get up out o that chair and get out o my office 
2573_178450_000050_000002	train-clean-360	You bring your wife to dinner to morrow

2573_178450_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 TOLD him And Sheridan laughed hideously 
none	none	Do you suppose there s an elevator boy in the whole dam building that ain t on to you Roscoe settled his hat down over his eyes and went out CHAPTER XXI WHO looks a mustang in the eye Changety chang chang Bash Crash BANG So sang Bibbs his musical gaieties inaudible to his fellow workmen because of the noise of the machinery He had discovered long ago that the uproar was rhythmical and it had been intolerable but now on the afternoon of the fourth day of his return he was accompanying the swing and clash of the metals with jubilant vaquero fragments mingling improvisations of his own among them and mocking the zinc eater s crash with vocal imitations Fearless and bold Chang Bash Behold With a leap from the ground To the saddle in a bound And away and away Hi YAY WHO looks a chang chang bash crash bang WHO cares a dash how you bash and you crash NIGHT S on the way EACH time I say Hi YAY Crash chang Bash chang Chang bang BANG The long room was ceaselessly thundering with metallic sound the air was thick with the smell of oil the floor trembled perpetually everything was implacably in motion nowhere was there a rest for the dizzied eye The first time he had entered the place Bibbs had become dizzy instantly and six months of it had only added increasing nausea to faintness But he felt neither now ALL DAY LONG I LL SEND MY THOUGHTS TO YOU YOU MUST KEEP REMEMBERING THAT YOUR FRIEND STANDS BESIDE YOU He saw her there beside him and the greasy roaring place became suffused with radiance The poet was happy in his machine shop he was still a poet there And he fed his old zinc eater and sang Away and away Hi YAY Crash bash crash bash CHANG Wild are his eyes Fiercely he dies Hi YAH Crash bash bang Bash CHANG Ready to fling Our gloves in the ring He was unaware of a sensation that passed along the lines of workmen Their great master had come among them and they grinned to see him standing with doctor Gurney behind the unconscious Bibbs Sheridan nodded to those nearest him he had personal acquaintance with nearly all of them but he kept his attention upon his son Bibbs worked steadily never turning from his machine Now and then he varied his musical programme with remarks addressed to the zinc eater Go on you old crash basher Chew it up It s good for you if you don t try to bolt your vittles Fletcherize you pig That s right YOU LL never get a lump in your gizzard Want some more Here s a nice shiny one The words were indistinguishable but Sheridan inclined his head to Gurney s ear and shouted fiercely Talkin to himself By George Gurney laughed reassuringly and shook his head Bibbs returned to song Chang Chang bash chang It s I WHO looks a mustang in the eye Fearless and bo His father grasped him by the arm Here he shouted Let ME show you how to run a strip through there The foreman says you re some better n you used to be but that s no way to handle Get out the way and let me show you once Better be careful Bibbs warned him stepping to one side Careful Boh Sheridan seized a strip of zinc from the box What you talkin to yourself about Tryin to make yourself think you re so abused you re goin wrong in the head Abused No shouted Bibbs I was SINGING because I like it I told you I d come back and like it Sheridan may not have understood At all events he made no reply but began to run the strip of zinc through the machine He did it awkwardly and with bad results Here he shouted This is the way Watch how I do it There s nothin to it if you put your mind on it By his own showing then his mind was not upon it He continued to talk All you got to look out for is to keep it pressed over to Don t run your hand up with it Bibbs vociferated leaning toward him Run nothin You GOT to Look out shouted Bibbs and Gurney together and they both sprang forward But Sheridan s right hand had followed the strip too far and the zinc eater had bitten off the tips of the first and second fingers He swore vehemently and wrung his hand sending a shower of red drops over himself and Bibbs but Gurney grasped his wrist and said sharply Come out of here Come over to the lavatory in the office Bibbs fetch my bag It s in my machine outside And when Bibbs brought the bag to the washroom he found the doctor still grasping Sheridan s wrist holding the injured hand over a basin Sheridan had lost color and temper too He glared over his shoulder at his son as the latter handed the bag to Gurney You go on back to your work he said I ve had worse snips than that from a pencil sharpener Oh no you haven t said Gurney I have too Sheridan retorted angrily Bibbs you go on back to your work There s no reason to stand around here watchin ole Doc Gurney tryin to keep himself awake workin on a scratch that only needs a little court plaster I slipped or it wouldn t happened You get back on your job All right said Bibbs HERE Sheridan bellowed as his son was passing out of the door You watch out when you re runnin that machine You hear what I say I slipped or I wouldn t got scratched but you YOU RE liable to get your whole hand cut off You keep your eyes open Yes sir And Bibbs returned to the zinc eater thoughtfully Half an hour later Gurney touched him on the shoulder and beckoned him outside where conversation was possible I sent him home Bibbs He ll have to be careful of that hand Go get your overalls off I ll take you for a drive and leave you at home Can t said Bibbs Got to stick to my job till the whistle blows No you don t the doctor returned smothering a yawn He wants me to take you down to my office and give you an overhauling to see how much harm these four days on the machine have done you I guess you folks have got that old man pretty thoroughly upset between you up at your house But I don t need to go over you I can see with my eyes half shut Yes Bibbs interrupted that s what they are I say I can see you re starting out at least in good shape What s made the difference I like the machine said Bibbs I ve made a friend of it I serenade it and talk to it and then it talks back to me Indeed indeed What does it say What I want to hear Well well The doctor stretched himself and stamped his foot repeatedly Better come along and take a drive with me You can take the time off that he allowed for the examination and Not at all said Bibbs I m going to stand by my old zinc eater till five o clock I tell you I LIKE it Then I suppose that s the end of your wanting to write I don t know about that Bibbs said thoughtfully but the zinc eater doesn t interfere with my thinking at least It s better than being in business I m sure of that I don t want anything to change I d be content to lead just the life I m leading now to the end of my days You do beat the devil exclaimed Gurney Your father s right when he tells me you re a mystery Perhaps the Almighty knew what He was doing when He made you but it takes a lot of faith to believe it Well I m off Go on back to your murdering old machine He climbed into his car which he operated himself but he refrained from setting it immediately in motion Well I rubbed it in on the old man that you had warned him not to slide his hand along too far and that he got hurt because he didn t pay attention to your warning and because he was trying to show you how to do something you were already doing a great deal better than he could You tell him I ll be around to look at it and change the dressing to morrow morning Good by But when he paid the promised visit the next morning he did more than change the dressing upon the damaged hand The injury was severe of its kind and Gurney spent a long time over it though Sheridan was rebellious and scornful being brought to a degree of tractability only by means of horrible threats and talk of amputation However he appeared at the dinner table with his hand supported in a sling which he seemed to regard as an indignity while the natural inquiries upon the subject evidently struck him as deliberate insults missus Sheridan having been unable to contain her solicitude several times during the day and having been checked each time in a manner that blanched her cheek hastened to warn Roscoe and Sibyl upon their arrival at five to omit any reference to the injury and to avoid even looking at the sling if they possibly could The Sheridans dined on Sundays at five Sibyl had taken pains not to arrive either before or after the hand was precisely on the hour and the members of the family were all seated at the table within two minutes after she and Roscoe had entered the house It was a glum gathering overhung with portents The air seemed charged awaiting any tiny ignition to explode and missus Sheridan s expression as she sat with her eyes fixed almost continually upon her husband was that of a person engaged in prayer Edith was pale and intent Roscoe looked ill Sibyl looked ill and Sheridan looked both ill and explosive Bibbs had more color than any of these and there was a strange brightness like a light upon his face It was curious to see anything so happy in the tense gloom of that household Edith ate little but gazed nearly all the time at her plate She never once looked at Sibyl though Sibyl now and then gave her a quick glance heavily charged and then looked away Roscoe ate nothing and like Edith kept his eyes upon his plate and made believe to occupy himself with the viands thereon loading his fork frequently but not lifting it to his mouth He did not once look at his father though his father gazed heavily at him most of the time And between Edith and Sibyl and between Roscoe and his father some bitter wireless communication seemed continually to be taking place throughout the long silences prevailing during this enlivening ceremony of Sabbath refection Didn t you go to church this morning Bibbs his mother asked in the effort to break up one of those ghastly intervals What did you say mother Didn t you go to church this morning I think so he answered as from a roseate trance You THINK so Don t you know Oh yes Yes I went to church Which one Just down the street It s brick What was the sermon about What mother Can t you hear me she cried I asked you what the sermon was about He roused himself I think it was about He frowned seeming to concentrate his will to recollect I think it was about something in the Bible White jacket George was glad of an opportunity to leave the room and lean upon Mist Jackson s shoulder in the pantry He don t know they WAS any suhmon he concluded having narrated the dining room dialogue All he know is he was with at lady lives nex do George was right Did you go to church all by yourself Bibbs Sibyl asked No he answered No I didn t go alone Oh Sibyl gave the ejaculation an upward twist as of mocking inquiry and followed it by another expressive of hilarious comprehension OH Bibbs looked at her studiously but she spoke no further And that completed the conversation at the lugubrious feast Coffee came finally was disposed of quickly and the party dispersed to other parts of the house Bibbs followed his father and Roscoe into the library but was not well received YOU go and listen to the phonograph with the women folks Sheridan commanded Bibbs retreated Sometimes you do seem to be a hard sort of man he said However he went obediently to the gilt and brocade room in which his mother and his sister and his sister in law had helplessly withdrawn according to their Sabbatical custom Edith sat in a corner tapping her feet together and looking at them Sibyl sat in the center of the room examining a brooch which she had detached from her throat and missus Sheridan was looking over a collection of records consisting exclusively of Caruso and rag time She selected one of the latter remarking that she thought it right pretty and followed it with one of the former and the same remark As the second reached its conclusion George appeared in the broad doorway seeming to have an errand there but he did not speak Instead he favored Edith with a benevolent smile and she immediately left the room George stepping aside for her to precede him and then disappearing after her in the hall with an air of successful diplomacy He made it perfectly clear that Edith had given him secret instructions and that it had been his pride and pleasure to fulfil them to the letter Sibyl stiffened in her chair her lips parted and she watched with curious eyes the vanishing back of the white jacket What s that she asked in a low voice but sharply Here s another right pretty record said missus Sheridan affecting with patent nervousness not to hear And she unloosed the music Sibyl bit her lip and began to tap her chin with the brooch After a little while she turned to Bibbs who reposed at half length in a gold chair with his eyes closed Where did Edith go she asked curiously Edith he repeated opening his eyes blankly Is she gone Sibyl got up and stood in the doorway She leaned against the casing still tapping her chin with the brooch Her eyes were dilating she was suddenly at high tension and her expression had become one of sharp excitement She listened intently When the record was spun out she could hear Sheridan rumbling in the library during the ensuing silence and Roscoe s voice querulous and husky I won t say anything at all I tell you you might just as well let me alone But there were other sounds a rustling and murmur whispering low protesting cadences in a male voice And as missus Sheridan started another record a sudden vital resolve leaped like fire in the eyes of Sibyl She walked down the hall and straight into the smoking room Lamhorn and Edith both sprang to their feet separating Edith became instantly deathly white with a rage that set her shaking from head to foot and Lamhorn stuttered as he tried to speak But Edith s shaking was not so violent as Sibyl s nor was her face so white At sight of them and of their embrace all possible consequences became nothing to Sibyl She courtesied holding up her skirts and contorting her lips to the semblance of a smile Sit just as you were both of you she said And then to Edith Did you tell my husband I had been telephoning to Lamhorn You march out of here said Edith fiercely March straight out of here Sibyl leveled a forefinger at Lamhorn Did you tell her I d been telephoning you I wanted you to come Oh good God Lamhorn said Hush You knew she d tell my husband DIDN T you she cried You knew that HUSH he begged panic stricken That was a MANLY thing to do Oh it was like a gentleman You wouldn t come you wouldn t even come for five minutes to hear what I had to say You were TIRED of what I had to say You d heard it all a thousand times before and you wouldn t come

none	none	she stormed You wouldn t even come for five minutes but you could tell that little cat And SHE told my husband You re a MAN Edith saw in a flash that the consequences of battle would be ruinous to Sibyl and the furious girl needed no further temptation to give way to her feelings Get out of this house she shrieked This is my father s house Don t you dare speak to Robert like that No No I mustn t SPEAK Don t you DARE Edith and Sibyl began to scream insults at each other simultaneously fronting each other their furious faces close Their voices shrilled and rose and cracked they screeched They could be heard over the noise of the phonograph which was playing a brass band selection They could be heard all over the house They were heard in the kitchen they could have been heard in the cellar Neither of them cared for that You told my husband screamed Sibyl bringing her face still closer to Edith s You told my husband This man put THAT in your hands to strike me with HE did I ll tell your husband again I ll tell him everything I know It s TIME your husband They were swept asunder by a bandaged hand Do you want the neighbors in Sheridan thundered There fell a shocking silence Frenzied Sibyl saw her husband and his mother in the doorway and she understood what she had done She moved slowly toward the door then suddenly she began to run She ran into the hall and through it and out of the house Roscoe followed her heavily his eyes on the ground NOW THEN said Sheridan to Lamhorn The words were indefinite but the voice was not Neither was the vicious gesture of the bandaged hand which concluded its orbit in the direction of the door in a manner sufficient for the swift dispersal of George and Jackson and several female servants who hovered behind missus Sheridan They fled lightly Papa papa wailed missus Sheridan Look at your hand You d oughtn t to been so rough with Edie you hurt your hand on her shoulder Look There was in fact a spreading red stain upon the bandages at the tips of the fingers and Sheridan put his hand back in the sling Now then he repeated You goin to leave my house He will NOT sobbed Edith Don t you DARE order him out Don t you bother dear said Lamhorn quietly He doesn t understand YOU mustn t be troubled Pallor was becoming to him he looked very handsome and as he left the room he seemed in the girl s distraught eyes a persecuted noble indifferent to the rabble yawping insult at his heels the rabble being enacted by her father Don t come back either said Sheridan realistic in this impersonation Keep off the premises he called savagely into the hall This family s through with you It is NOT Edith cried breaking from her mother You ll SEE about that You ll find out You ll find out what ll happen What s HE done I guess if I can stand it it s none of YOUR business is it What s HE done I d like to know You don t know anything about it Don t you s pose he told ME She was crazy about him soon as he began going there and he flirted with her a little That s everything he did and it was before he met ME After that he wouldn t and it wasn t anything anyway he never was serious a minute about it SHE wanted it to be serious and she was bound she wouldn t give him up He told her long ago he cared about me but she kept persecuting him and Yes said Sheridan sternly that s HIS side of it That ll do He doesn t come in this house again You look out Edith cried Yes I ll look out I d a told you to day he wasn t to be allowed on the premises but I had other things on my mind I had Abercrombie look up this young man privately and he s no count He s no count on earth He s no good He s NOTHIN But it wouldn t matter if he was George Washington after what s happened and what I ve heard to night But papa missus Sheridan began if Edie says it was all Sibyl s fault makin up to him and he never encouraged her much nor S enough he roared He keeps off these premises And if any of you so much as ever speak his name to me again But Edith screamed clapping her hands over her ears to shut out the sound of his voice and ran up stairs sobbing loudly followed by her mother However missus Sheridan descended a few minutes later and joined her husband in the library Bibbs still sitting in his gold chair saw her pass roused himself from reverie and strolled in after her She locked her door said missus Sheridan shaking her head woefully She wouldn t even answer me They wasn t a sound from her room Well said her husband she can settle her mind to it She never speaks to that fellow again and if he tries to telephone her to morrow Here You tell the help if he calls up to ring off and say it s my orders No you needn t I ll tell em myself Better not said Bibbs gently His father glared at him It s no good said Bibbs Mother when you were in love with father My goodness she cried You ain t a goin to compare your father to that Edith feels about him just what you did about father said Bibbs And if YOUR father had told you I won t LISTEN to such silly talk she declared angrily So you re handin out your advice are you Bibbs said Sheridan What is it Let her see him all she wants You re a Sheridan gave it up I don t know what to call you Let her see him all she wants Bibbs repeated thoughtfully You re up against something too strong for you If Edith were a weakling you d have a chance this way but she isn t She s got a lot of your determination father and with what s going on inside of her she ll beat you You can t keep her from seeing him as long as she feels about him the way she does now You can t make her think less of him either Nobody can Your only chance is that she ll do it for herself and if you give her time and go easy she probably will Marriage would do it for her quickest but that s just what you don t want and as you DON T want it you d better I can t stand any more Sheridan burst out If it s come to BIBBS advisin me how to run this house I better resign Mamma where s that nigger George Maybe HE S got some plan how I better manage my family Bibbs for God s sake go and lay down Let her see him all she wants Oh Lord here s wisdom here s Bibbs said missus Sheridan if you haven t got anything to do you might step over and take Sibyl s wraps home she left em in the hall I don t think you seem to quiet your poor father very much just now All right And Bibbs bore Sibyl s wraps across the street and delivered them to Roscoe who met him at the door Bibbs said only Forgot these and Good night Roscoe cordially and cheerfully and returned to the New House His mother and father were still talking in the library but with discretion he passed rapidly on and upward to his own room and there he proceeded to write in his note book CHAPTER XXII There seems to be another curious thing about Love Bibbs wrote Love is blind while it lives and only opens its eyes and becomes very wide awake when it dies Let it alone until then You cannot reason with love or with any other passion The wise will not wish for love nor for ambition These are passions and bring others in their train hatreds and jealousies all blind Friendship and a quiet heart for the wise What a turbulence is love It is dangerous for a blind thing to be turbulent there are precipices in life One would not cross a mountain pass with a thick cloth over his eyes Lovers do Friendship walks gently and with open eyes To walk to church with a friend To sit beside her there To rise when she rises and to touch with one s thumb and fingers the other half of the hymn book that she holds What lover with his fierce ways could know this transcendent happiness Friendship brings everything that heaven could bring There is no labor that cannot become a living rapture if you know that a friend is thinking of you as you labor So you sing at your work For the work is part of the thoughts of your friend so you love it Love is demanding and claiming and insistent Friendship is all kindness it makes the world glorious with kindness What color you see when you walk with a friend You see that the gray sky is brilliant and shimmering you see that the smoke has warm browns and is marvelously sculptured the air becomes iridescent You see the gold in brown hair Light floods everything When you walk to church with a friend you know that life can give you nothing richer You pray that there will be no change in anything for ever What an adorable thing it is to discover a little foible in your friend a bit of vanity that gives you one thing more about her to adore On a cold morning she will perhaps walk to church with you without her furs and she will blush and return an evasive answer when you ask her why she does not wear them You will say no more because you understand She looks beautiful in her furs you love their darkness against her cheek but you comprehend that they conceal the loveliness of her throat and the fine line of her chin and that she also has comprehended this and wishing to look still more bewitching discards her furs at the risk of taking cold So you hold your peace and try to look as if you had not thought it out This theory is satisfactory except that it does not account for the absence of the muff Ah well there must always be a mystery somewhere Mystery is a part of enchantment Manual labor is best Your heart can sing and your mind can dream while your hands are working You could not have a singing heart and a dreaming mind all day if you had to scheme out dollars or if you had to add columns of figures Those things take your attention You cannot be thinking of your friend while you write letters beginning Yours of the seventeenth inst rec d and contents duly noted But to work with your hands all day thinking and singing and then after nightfall to hear the ineffable kindness of your friend s greeting always there for you Who would wake from such a dream as this Dawn and the sea music in moonlit gardens nightingales serenading through almond groves in bloom what could bring such things into the city s turmoil Yet they are here and roses blossom in the soot That is what it means not to be alone That is what a friend gives you Having thus demonstrated that he was about twenty five and had formed a somewhat indefinite definition of friendship but one entirely his own and perhaps Mary s Bibbs went to bed and was the only Sheridan to sleep soundly through the night and to wake at dawn with a light heart His cheerfulness was vaguely diminished by the troublous state of affairs of his family He had recognized his condition when he wrote Who would wake from such a dream as this Bibbs was a sympathetic person easily touched but he was indeed living in a dream and all things outside of it were veiled and remote for that is the way of youth in a dream And Bibbs who had never before been of any age either old or young had come to his youth at last He went whistling from the house before even his father had come down stairs There was a fog outdoors saturated with a fine powder of soot and though Bibbs noticed absently the dim shape of an automobile at the curb before Roscoe s house he did not recognize it as doctor Gurney s but went cheerily on his way through the dingy mist And when he was once more installed beside his faithful zinc eater he whistled and sang to it as other workmen did to their own machines sometimes when things went well His comrades in the shop glanced at him amusedly now and then They liked him and he ate his lunch at noon with a group of Socialists who approved of his ideas and talked of electing him to their association The short days of the year had come and it was dark before the whistles blew When the signal came Bibbs went to the office where he divested himself of his overalls his single divergence from the routine of his fellow workmen and after that he used soap and water copiously This was his transformation scene he passed into the office a rather frail young working man noticeably begrimed and passed out of it to the pavement a cheerfully pre occupied sample of gentry fastidious to the point of elegance The sidewalk was crowded with the bearers of dinner pails men and boys and women and girls from the work rooms that closed at five Many hurried and some loitered they went both east and west jostling one another and Bibbs turning his face homeward was forced to go slowly Coming toward him as slowly through the crowd a tall girl caught sight of his long thin figure and stood still until he had almost passed her for in the thick crowd and the thicker gloom he did not recognize her though his shoulder actually touched hers He would have gone by but she laughed delightedly and he stopped short startled Two boys one chasing the other swept between them and Bibbs stood still peering about him in deep perplexity She leaned toward him I knew YOU she said Good heavens cried Bibbs I thought it was your voice coming out of a star There s only smoke overhead said Mary and laughed again There aren t any stars Oh yes there were when you laughed She took his arm and they went on I ve come to walk home with you Bibbs I wanted to But were you here in the In the dark Yes Waiting Yes Bibbs was radiant he felt suffocated with happiness He began to scold her But it s not safe and I m not worth it You shouldn t have you ought to know better What did I only waited about twelve seconds she laughed I d just got here But to come all this way and to this part of town in the dark you I was in this part of town already she said At least I was only seven or eight blocks away and it was dark when I came out and I d have had to go home alone and I preferred going home with you It s pretty beautiful for me said Bibbs with a deep breath You ll never know what it was to hear your laugh in the darkness and then to to see you standing there Oh it was like it was like how can I TELL you what it was like They had passed beyond the crowd now and a crossing lamp shone upon them which revealed the fact that again she was without her furs Here was a puzzle Why did that adorable little vanity of hers bring her out without them in the DARK But of course she had gone out long before dark For undefinable reasons this explanation was not quite satisfactory however allowing it to stand his solicitude for her took another turn I think you ought to have a car he said especially when you want to be out after dark You need one in winter anyhow Have you ever asked your father for one No said Mary I don t think I d care for one particularly I wish you would Bibbs s tone was earnest and troubled I think in winter you No no she interrupted lightly I don t need But my mother tried to insist on sending one over here every afternoon for me I wouldn t let her because I like the walk but a girl A girl likes to walk too said Mary Let me tell you where I ve been this afternoon and how I happened to be near enough to make you take me home I ve been to see a little old man who makes pictures of the smoke He has a sort of warehouse for a studio and he lives there with his mother and his wife and their seven children and he s gloriously happy I d seen one of his pictures at an exhibition and I wanted to see more of them so he showed them to me He has almost everthing he ever painted I don t suppose he s sold more than four or five pictures in his life He gives drawing lessons to keep alive How do you mean he paints the smoke Bibbs asked Literally He paints from his studio window and from the street anywhere He just paints what s around him and it s beautiful The smoke Wonderful He sees the sky through it somehow He does the ugly roofs of cheap houses through a haze of smoke and he does smoky sunsets and smoky sunrises and he has other things with the heavy solid slow columns of smoke going far out and growing more ethereal and mixing with the hazy light in the distance and he has others with the broken sky line of down town all misted with the smoke and puffs and jets of vapor that have colors like an orchard in mid April I m going to take you there some Sunday afternoon Bibbs You re showing me the town he said I didn t know what was in it at all There are workers in beauty here she told him gently There are other painters more prosperous than my friend There are all sorts of things I didn t know No Since the town began growing so great that it called itself greater one could live here all one s life and know only the side of it that shows The beauty workers seem buried very deep said Bibbs And I imagine that your friend who makes the smoke beautiful must be buried deepest of all My father loves the smoke but I can t imagine his buying one of your friend s pictures He d buy the Bay of Naples but he wouldn t get one of those He d think smoke in a picture was horrible unless he could use it for an advertisement Yes she said thoughtfully And really he s the town They ARE buried pretty deep it seems sometimes Bibbs And yet it s all wonderful he said It s wonderful to me You mean the town is wonderful to you Yes because everything is since you called me your friend The city is only a rumble on the horizon for me It can t come any closer than the horizon so long as you let me see you standing by my old zinc eater all day long helping me Mary He stopped with a gasp That s the first time I ve called you Mary Yes She laughed a little tremuously Though I wanted you to I said it without thinking It must be because you came there to walk home with me That must be it Women like to have things said Mary informed him her tremulous laughter continuing Were you glad I came for you No not glad I felt as if I were being carried straight up and up and up over the clouds I feel like that still I think I m that way most of the time I wonder what I was like before I knew you The person I was then seems to have been somebody else not Bibbs Sheridan at all It seems long long ago I was gloomy and sickly somebody else somebody I don t understand now a coward afraid of shadows afraid of things that didn t exist afraid of my old zinc eater And now I m only afraid of what might change anything She was silent a moment and then You re happy Bibbs she asked Ah don t you see he cried I want it to last for a thousand thousand years just as it is You ve made me so rich I m a miser I wouldn t have one thing different nothing nothing Dear Bibbs she said and laughed happily CHAPTER XXIII Bibbs continued to live in the shelter of his dream He had told Edith after his ineffective effort to be useful in her affairs that he had decided that he was a member of the family but he appeared to have relapsed to the retired list after that one attempt at participancy he was far enough detached from membership now These were turbulent days in the New House but Bibbs had no part whatever in the turbulence he seemed an absent minded stranger present by accident and not wholly aware that he was present He would sit faintly smiling over pleasant imaginings and dear reminiscences of his own while battle raged between Edith and her father or while Sheridan unloosed jeremiads upon the sullen Roscoe who drank heavily to endure them The happy dreamer wandered into storm areas like a somnambulist and wandered out again unawakened He was sorry for his father and for Roscoe and for Edith and for Sibyl but their sufferings and outcries seemed far away Sibyl was under Gurney s care Roscoe had sent for him on Sunday night not long after Bibbs returned the abandoned wraps and during the first days of Sibyl s illness the doctor found it necessary to be with her frequently and to install a muscular nurse And whether he would or no Gurney received from his hysterical patient a variety of pungent information which would have staggered anybody but a family physician Among other things he was given to comprehend the change in Bibbs and why the zinc eater was not putting a lump in the operator s gizzard as of yore Sibyl was not delirious she was a thin little ego writhing and shrieking in pain Life had hurt her and had driven her into hurting herself her condition was only the adult s terrible exaggeration of that of a child after a bad bruise there must be screaming and telling mother all about the hurt and how it happened Sibyl babbled herself hoarse when Gurney withheld morphine She went from the beginning to the end in a breath No protest stopped her nothing stopped her You ought to let me die she wailed It s cruel not to let me die What harm have I ever done to anybody that you want to keep me alive Just look at my life I only married Roscoe to get away from home and look what that got me into look where I am now He brought me to this town and what did I have in my life but his FAMILY And they didn t even know the right crowd If they had it might have been SOMETHING I had nothing nothing nothing in the world I wanted to have a good time and how could I Where s any good time among these Sheridans They never even had wine on the table I thought I was marrying into a rich family where I d meet attractive people I d read about and travel and go to dances and oh my Lord all I got was these Sheridans I did the best I could I did indeed Oh I DID I just tried to live Every woman s got a right to live some time in her life I guess Things were just beginning to look brighter we d moved up here and that frozen crowd across the street were after Jim for their daughter and they d have started us with the right people and then I saw how Edith was getting him away from me She did it too She got him A girl with money can do that to a married woman yes she can every time And what could I do What can any woman do in my fix I couldn t do ANYTHING but try to stand it and I couldn t stand it I went to that icicle that Vertrees girl and she could have helped me a little and it wouldn t have hurt her It wouldn t have done her any harm to help me THAT little She treated me as if I d been dirt that she wouldn t even take the trouble to sweep out of her house Let her WAIT Sibyl s voice hoarse from babbling became no more than a husky whisper though she strove to make it louder She struggled half upright and the nurse restrained her I d get up out of this bed to show her she can t do such things to me I was absolutely ladylike and she walked out and left me there alone She ll SEE She started after Bibbs before Jim s casket was fairly underground and she thinks she s landed that poor loon but she ll see She ll see If I m ever able to walk across the street again I ll show her how to treat a woman in trouble that comes to her for help It wouldn t have hurt her any it wouldn t it wouldn t And Edith needn t have told what she told Roscoe it wouldn t have hurt her to let me alone And HE told her I bored him telephoning him I wanted to see him He needn t have done it He needn t needn t Her voice grew fainter for that while with exhaustion though she would go over it all again as soon as her strength returned She lay panting Then seeing her husband standing disheveled in the doorway Don t come in Roscoe she murmured I don t want to see you And as he turned away she added I m kind of sorry for you Roscoe Her antagonist Edith was not more coherent in her own wailings and she had the advantage of a mother for listener She had also the disadvantage of a mother for duenna and missus Sheridan under her husband s sharp tutelage proved an effective one Edith was reduced to telephoning Lamhorn from shops whenever she could juggle her mother into a momentary distraction over a counter Edith was incomparably more in love than before Lamhorn s expulsion Her whole being was nothing but the determination to hurdle everything that separated her from him She was in a state that could be altered by only the lightest and most delicate diplomacy of suggestion but Sheridan like legions of other parents intensified her passion and fed it hourly fuel by opposing to it an intolerable force He swore she should cool and thus set her on fire Edith planned neatly She fought hard every other evening with her father and kept her bed betweentimes to let him see what his violence had done to her Then when the mere sight of her set him to breathing fast she said pitiably that she might bear her trouble better if she went away it was impossible to be in the same town with Lamhorn and not think always of him Perhaps in New York she might forget a little She had written to a school friend established quietly with an aunt in apartments and a month or so of theaters and restaurants might bring peace Sheridan shouted with relief he gave her a copious cheque and she left upon a Monday morning wearing violets with her mourning and having kissed everybody good by except Sibyl and Bibbs She might have kissed Bibbs but he failed to realize that the day of her departure had arrived and was surprised on returning from his zinc eater that evening to find her gone I suppose they ll be maried there he said casually Sheridan seated warming his stockinged feet at the fire jumped up fuming Either you go out o here or I will Bibbs he snorted I don t want to be in the same room with the particular kind of idiot you are She s through with that riff raff all she needed was to be kept away from him a few weeks and I KEPT her away and it did the business For Heaven s sake go on out o here Bibbs obeyed the gesture of a hand still bandaged And the black silk sling was still round Sheridan s neck but no word of Gurney s and no excruciating twinge of pain could keep Sheridan s hand in the sling The wounds slight enough originally had become infected the first time he had dislodged the bandages and healing was long delayed Sheridan had the habit of gesture he could not take time to remember he said that he must be careful and he had also a curious indignation with his hurt he refused to pay it the compliment of admitting its existence The Saturday following Edith s departure Gurney came to the Sheridan Building to dress the wounds and to have a talk with Sheridan which the doctor felt had become necessary But he was a little before the appointed time and was obliged to wait a few minutes in an anteroom there was a directors meeting of some sort in Sheridan s office The door was slightly ajar leaking cigar smoke and oratory the latter all Sheridan s and Gurney listened No sir no sir no sir he heard the big voice rumbling and then breaking into thunder I tell you NO Some o you men make me sick You d lose your confidence in Almighty God if a doodle bug flipped his hind leg at you You say money s tight all over the country Well what if it is There s no reason for it to be tight and it s not goin to keep OUR money tight You re always runnin to the woodshed to hide your nickels in a crack because some fool newspaper says the market s a little skeery You listen to every street corner croaker and then come and set here and try to scare ME out of a big thing We re IN on this understand I tell you there never WAS better times These are good times and big times and I won t stand for any other kind o talk This country s on its feet as it never was before and this city s on its feet and goin to stay there And Gurney heard a series of whacks and thumps upon the desk Bad times Sheridan vociferated with accompanying thumps Rabbit talk These times are glorious I tell you We re in the promised land and we re goin to STAY there That s all gentlemen The loan goes The directors came forth flushed and murmurous and Gurney hastened in His guess was correct Sheridan had been thumping the desk with his right hand The physician scolded wearily making good the fresh damage as best he might and then he said what he had to say on the subject of Roscoe and Sibyl his opinion meeting as he expected a warmly hostile reception But the result of this conversation was that by telephonic command Roscoe awaited his father an hour later in the library at the New House Gurney says your wife s able to travel Sheridan said brusquely as he came in Yes Roscoe occupied a deep chair and sat in the dejected attitude which had become his habit Yes she is Edith had to leave town and so Sibyl thinks she ll have to too Oh I wouldn t put it that way Roscoe protested drearily No I hear YOU wouldn t There was a bitter gibe in the father s voice and he added It s a good thing she s goin abroad if she ll stay there I shouldn t think any of us want her here any more you least of all It s no use your talking that way said Roscoe You won t do any good Well when are you comin back to your office Sheridan used a brisker kinder tone Three weeks since you showed up there at all When you goin to be ready to cut out whiskey and all the rest o the foolishness and start in again You ought to be able to make up for a lot o lost time and a lot o spilt milk when that woman takes herself out o the way and lets you and all the rest of us alone It s no use father I tell you I know what Gurney was going to say to you I m not going back to the office I m DONE Wait a minute before you talk that way Sheridan began his sentry go up and down the room I suppose you know it s taken two pretty good men about sixteen hours a day to set things straight and get em runnin right again down in your office They must be good men Roscoe nodded indifferently I thought I was doing about eight men s work I m glad you found two that could handle it Look here If I worked you it was for your own good There are plenty men drive harder n I do and Yes There are some that break down all the other men that work with em They either die or go crazy or have to quit and are no use the rest of their lives The last s my case I guess complicated by domestic difficulties You set there and tell me you give up Sheridan s voice shook and so did the gesticulating hand which he extended appealingly toward the despondent figure Don t do it Roscoe Don t say it Say you ll come down there again and be a man This woman ain t goin to trouble you any more The work ain t goin to hurt you if you haven t got her to worry you and you can get shut o this nasty whiskey guzzlin it ain t fastened on you yet Don t say It s no use on earth Roscoe mumbled No use on earth Look here If you want another month s vacation I know Gurney told you so what s the use talking about vacations Gurney Sheridan vociferated the name savagely It s Gurney Gurney Gurney Always Gurney I don t know what the world s comin to with everybody runnin around squealin The doctor says this and The doctor says that It makes me sick How s this country expect to get its Work done if Gurney and all the other old nanny goats keep up this blattin Oh oh Don t lift that stick o wood you ll ruin your NERVES So he says you got nervous exhaustion induced by overwork and emotional strain They always got to stick the Work in if they see a chance I reckon you did have the emotional strain and that s all s the matter with you You ll be over it soon s this woman s gone and Work s the very thing to make you quit frettin about her Did Gurney tell you I was fit to work Shut up Sheridan bellowed I m so sick o that man s name I feel like shootin anybody that says it to me He fumed and chafed swearing indistinctly then came and stood before his son Look here do you think you re doin the square thing by me Do you How much you worth I ve got between seven and eight thousand a year clear of my own outside the salary That much is mine whether I work or not It is You could a pulled it out without me I suppose you think at your age No But it s mine and it s enough My Lord It s about what a Congressman gets and you want to quit there I suppose you think you ll get the rest when I kick the bucket and all you have to do is lay back and wait You let me tell you right here you ll never see one cent of it You go out o business now and what would you know about handlin it five or ten or twenty years from now Because I intend to STAY here a little while yet my boy They d either get it away from you or you d sell for a nickel and let it be split up and He whirled about marched to the other end of the room and stood silent a moment Then he said solemnly Listen If you go out now you leave me in the lurch with nothin on God s green earth to depend on but your brother and you know what he is I ve depended on you for it ALL since Jim died Now you ve listened to that dam doctor and he says maybe you won t ever be as good a man as you were and that certainly you won t be for a year or so probably more Now that s all a lie Men don t break down that way at your age Look at ME And I tell you you can shake this thing off All you need is a little GET up and a little gumption Men don t go away for YEARS and then come back into MOVING businesses like ours they lose the strings And if you could I won t let you if you lay down on me now I won t and that s because if you lay down you prove you ain t the man I thought you were He cleared his throat and finished quietly Roscoe will you take a month s vacation and come back and go to it No said Roscoe listlessly I m through All right said Sheridan He picked up the evening paper from a table went to a chair by the fire and sat down his back to his son Good by Roscoe rose his head hanging but there was a dull relief in his eyes Best I can do he muttered seeming about to depart yet lingering I figure it out a good deal like this he said I didn t KNOW my job was any strain and I managed all right but from what Gur from what I hear I was just up to the limit of my nerves from overwork and the the trouble at home was the extra strain that s fixed me the way I am I tried to brace so I could stand the work and the trouble too on whiskey and that put the finish to me I I m not hitting it as hard as I was for a while and I reckon pretty soon if I can get to feeling a little more energy I better try to quit entirely I don t know I m all in and the doctor says so I thought I was running along fine up to a few months ago but all the time I was ready to bust and didn t know it Now then I don t want you to blame Sibyl and if I were you I wouldn t speak of her as that woman because she s your daughter in law and going to stay that way She didn t do anything wicked It was a shock to me and I don t deny it to find what she had done encouraging that fellow to hang around her after he began trying to flirt with her and losing her head over him the way she did I don t deny it was a shock and that it ll always be a hurt inside of me I ll never get over But it was my fault I didn t understand a woman s nature Poor Roscoe spoke in the most profound and desolate earnest A woman craves society and gaiety and meeting attractive people and traveling Well I can t give her the other things but I can give her the traveling real traveling not just going to Atlantic City or New Orleans the way she has two three times A woman has to have something in her life besides a business man And that s ALL I was I never understood till I heard her talking when she was so sick and I believe if you d heard her then you wouldn t speak so hard heartedly about her I believe you might have forgiven her like I have That s all I never cared anything for any girl but her in my life but I was so busy with business I put it ahead of her I never THOUGHT about her I was so busy thinking business Well this is where it s brought us to and now when you talk about business to me I feel the way you do when anybody talks about Gurney to you The word business makes me dizzy it makes me honestly sick at the stomach I believe if I had to go down town and step inside that office door I d fall down on the floor deathly sick You talk about a month s vacation and I get just as sick I m rattled I can t plan I haven t got any plans can t make any except to take my girl and get just as far away from that office as I can and stay We re going to Japan first and if we His father rustled the paper I said good by Roscoe Good by said Roscoe listlessly CHAPTER XXIV Sheridan waited until he heard the sound of the outer door closing then he rose and pushed a tiny disk set in the wall Jackson appeared Has Bibbs got home from work Mist Bibbs No suh Tell him I want to see him soon as he comes Yessuh Sheridan returned to his chair and fixed his attention fiercely upon the newspaper He found it difficult to pursue the items beyond their explanatory rubrics there was nothing unusual or startling to concentrate his attention Motorman Puts Blame on Brakes Three Killed when Car Slides Burglars Make Big Haul Board Works Approve Big Car line Extension Hold up Men Injure Two Man Found in Alley Skull Fractured Sickening Story Told in Divorce Court Plan New Eighteen story Structure School girl Meets Death under Automobile Negro Cuts Three One Dead Life Crushed Out Third Elevator

Trusted Man Kills Self with Drug Found Frozen Family Without Food or Fuel Baby Dead when Parents Return Home from Seeking Work Minister Returned from Trip Abroad Lectures on Big Future of Our City Sees Big Improvement during Short Absence Says No European City Holds Candle Sheridan nodded approvingly here Bibbs came through the hall whistling and entered the room briskly Well father did you want me Yes Sit down Sheridan got up and Bibbs took a seat by the fire holding out his hands to the crackling blaze for it was cold outdoors I came within seven of the shop record to day he said I handled more strips than any other workman has any day this month The nearest to me is sixteen behind There exclaimed his father greatly pleased What d I tell you I d like to hear Gurney hint again that I wasn t right in sending you there I would just like to hear him And you ain t you ashamed of makin such a fuss about it Ain t you I didn t go at it in the right spirit the other time Bibbs said smiling brightly his face ruddy in the cheerful firelight I didn t know the difference it meant to like a thing Well I guess I ve pretty thoroughly vindicated my judgement I guess I HAVE I said the shop d be good for you and it was I said it wouldn t hurt you and it hasn t It s been just exactly what I said it would be Ain t that so Looks like it Bibbs agreed gaily Well I d like to know any place I been wrong first and last Instead o hurting you it s been the makin of you physically You re a good inch taller n what I am and you d be a bigger man than what I am if you d get some flesh on your bones and you ARE gettin a little Physically it s started you out to be the huskiest one o the whole family Now then mentally that s different I don t say it unkindly Bibbs but you got to do something for yourself mentally just like what s begun physically And I m goin to help you Sheridan decided to sit down again He brought his chair close to his son s and leaning over tapped Bibbs s knee confidentially I got plans for you Bibbs he said Bibbs instantly looked thoroughly alarmed He drew back I I m all right now father Listen Sheridan settled himself in his chair and spoke in the tone of a reasonable man reasoning Listen here Bibbs I had another blow to day and it was a hard one and right in the face though I HAVE been expectin it some little time back Well it s got to be met Now I ll be frank with you As I said a minute ago mentally I couldn t ever called you exactly strong You been a little weak both ways most of your life Not but what I think you GOT a mentality if you d learn to use it You got will power I ll say that for you I never knew boy or man that could be stubborner never one in my life Now then you ve showed you could learn to run that machine best of any man in the shop in no time at all That looks to me like you could learn to do other things I don t deny but what it s an encouragin sign I don t deny that at all Well that helps me to think the case ain t so hopeless as it looks You re all I got to meet this blow with but maybe you ain t as poor material as I thought Your tellin me about comin within seven strips of the shop s record to day looks to me like encouragin information brought in at just about the right time Now then I m goin to give you a raise I wanted to send you straight on up through the shops a year or two maybe but I can t do it I lost Jim and now I ve lost Roscoe He s quit He s laid down on me If he ever comes back at all he ll be a long time pickin up the strings and anyway he ain t the man I thought he was I can t count on him I got to have SOMEBODY I KNOW I can count on And I m down to this you re my last chance Bibbs I got to learn you to use what brains you got and see if we can t develop em a little Who knows And I m goin to put my time in on it I m goin to take you right down town with ME and I won t be hard on you if you re a little slow at first And I m goin to do the big thing for you I m goin to make you feel you got to do the big thing for me in return I ve vindicated my policy with you about the shop and now I m goin to turn right around and swing you way over ahead of where the other boys started and I m goin to make an appeal to your ambition that ll make you dizzy He tapped his son on the knee again Bibbs I m goin to start you off this way I m goin to make you a director in the Pump Works Company I m goin to make you vice president of the Realty Company and a vice president of the Trust Company Bibbs jumped to his feet blanched Oh no he cried Sheridan took his dismay to be the excitement of sudden joy Yes sir And there s some pretty fat little salaries goes with those vice presidencies and a pinch o stock in the Pump Company with the directorship You thought I was pretty mean about the shop oh I know you did but you see the old man can play it both ways And so right now the minute you ve begun to make good the way I wanted you to I deal from the new deck And I ll keep on handin it out bigger and bigger every time you show me you re big enough to play the hand I deal you I m startin you with a pretty big one my boy But I don t I don t I don t want it Bibbs stammered What d you say Sheridan thought he had not heard aright I don t want it father I thank you I do thank you Sheridan looked perplexed What s the matter with you Didn t you understand what I was tellin you Yes You sure I reckon you didn t I offered I know I know But I can t take it What s the matter with you Sheridan was half amazed half suspicious Your head feel funny I ve never been quite so sane in my life said Bibbs as I have lately And I ve got just what I want I m living exactly the right life I m earning my daily bread and I m happy in doing it My wages are enough I don t want any more money and I don t deserve any Damnation Sheridan sprang up You ve turned Socialist You been listening to those fellows down there and you No sir I think there s a great deal in what they say but that isn t it Sheridan tried to restrain his growing fury and succeeded partially Then what is it What s the matter Nothing his son returned nervously Nothing except that I m content I don t want to change anything Why not Bibbs had the incredible folly to try to explain I ll tell you father if I can I know it may be hard to understand Yes I think it may be said Sheridan grimly What you say usually is a LITTLE that way Go on Perturbed and distressed Bibbs rose instinctively he felt himself at every possible disadvantage He was a sleeper clinging to a dream a rough hand stretched to shake him and waken him He went to a table and made vague drawings upon it with a finger and as he spoke he kept his eyes lowered You weren t altogether right about the shop that is in one way you weren t father He glanced up apprehensively Sheridan stood facing him expressionless and made no attempt to interrupt That s difficult to explain Bibbs continued lowering his eyes again to follow the tracings of his finger I I believe the shop might have done for me this time if I hadn t if something hadn t helped me to oh not only to bear it but to be happy in it Well I AM happy in it I want to go on just as I am And of all things on earth that I don t want I don t want to live a business life I don t want to be drawn into it I don t think it IS living and now I AM living I have the healthful toil and I can think In business as important as yours I couldn t think anything but business I don t I don t think making money is worth while Go on said Sheridan curtly as Bibbs paused timidly It hasn t seemed to get anywhere that I can see said Bibbs You think this city is rich and powerful but what s the use of its being rich and powerful They don t teach the children any more in the schools because the city is rich and powerful They teach them more than they used to because some people not rich and powerful people have thought the thoughts to teach the children And yet when you ve been reading the paper I ve heard you objecting to the children being taught anything except what would help them to make money You said it was wasting the taxes You want them taught to make a living but not to live When I was a little boy this wasn t an ugly town now it s hideous What s the use of being big just to be hideous I mean I don t think all this has meant really going ahead it s just been getting bigger and dirtier and noisier Wasn t the whole country happier and in many ways wiser when it was smaller and cleaner and quieter and kinder I know you think I m an utter fool father but after all though aren t business and politics just the housekeeping part of life And wouldn t you despise a woman that not only made her housekeeping her ambition but did it so noisily and dirtily that the whole neighborhood was in a continual turmoil over it And suppose she talked and thought about her housekeeping all the time and was always having additions built to her house when she couldn t keep clean what she already had and suppose with it all she made the house altogether unpeaceful and unlivable Just one minute Sheridan interrupted adding with terrible courtesy If you will permit me Have you ever been right about anything I don t quite I ask the simple question Have you ever been right about anything whatever in the course of your life Have you ever been right upon any subject or question you ve thought about and talked about Can you mention one single time when you were proved to be right He was flourishing the bandaged hand as he spoke but Bibbs said only If I ve always been wrong before surely there s more chance that I m right about this It seems reasonable to suppose something would be due to bring up my average Yes I thought you wouldn t see the point And there s another you probably couldn t see but I ll take the liberty to mention it You been balkin all your life Pretty much everything I ever wanted you to do you d let out SOME kind of a holler like you are now and yet I can t seem to remember once when you didn t have to lay down and do what I said But go on with your remarks about our city and the business of this country Go on I don t want to be a part of it said Bibbs with unwonted decision I want to keep to myself and I m doing it now I couldn t if I went down there with you I d be swallowed into it I don t care for money enough to No his father interrupted still dangerously quiet You ve never had to earn a living Anybody could tell that by what you say Now let me remind you you re sleepin in a pretty good bed you re eatin pretty fair food you re wearin pretty fine clothes Just suppose one o these noisy housekeepers me for instance decided to let you do your own housekeepin May I ask what your proposition would be I m earning nine dollars a week said Bibbs sturdily It s enough I shouldn t mind at all Who s payin you that nine dollars a week My work Bibbs answered And I ve done so well on that clipping machine I believe I could work up to fifteen or even twenty a week at another job I could be a fair plumber in a few months I m sure I d rather have a trade than be in business I should infinitely You better set about learnin one pretty dam quick But Sheridan struggled with his temper and again was partially successful in controlling it You better learn a trade over Sunday because you re either goin down with me to my office Monday morning or you can go to plumbing All right said Bibbs gently I can get along Sheridan raised his hands sardonically as in prayer O God he said this boy was crazy enough before he began to earn his nine dollars a week and now his money s gone to his head Can t You do nothin for him Then he flung his hands apart palms outward in a furious gesture of dismissal Get out o this room You got a skull that s thicker n a whale s thigh bone but it s cracked spang all the way across You hated the machine shop so bad when I sent you there you went and stayed sick for over two years and now when I offer to take you out of it and give you the mint you holler for the shop like a calf for its mammy You re cracked Oh but I got a fine layout here One son died one quit and one s a loon The loon s all I got left H P Ellersly s wife had a crazy brother and they undertook to keep him at the house First morning he was there he walked straight though a ten dollar plate glass window out into the yard He says Oh look at the pretty dandelion That s what you re doin You want to spend your life sayin Oh look at the pretty dandelion and you don t care a tinker s dam what you bust Well mister loon or no loon cracked and crazy or whatever you are I ll take you with me Monday morning and I ll work you and learn you yes and I ll lam you if I got to until I ve made something out of you that s fit to be called a business man I ll keep at you while I m able to stand and if I have to lay down to die I ll be whisperin at you till they get the embalmin fluid into me Now go on and don t let me hear from you again till you can come and tell me you ve waked up you poor pitiful dandelion pickin SLEEP WALKER Bibbs gave him a queer look There was something like reproach in it for once but there was more than that he seemed to be startled by his father s last word CHAPTER XXV There was sleet that evening with a whopping wind but neither this storm nor that other which so imminently threatened him held place in the consciousness of Bibbs Sheridan when he came once more to the presence of Mary All was right in his world as he sat with her reading Maurice Maeterlinck s Alladine and Palomides The sorrowful light of the gas jet might have been May morning sunshine flashing amber and rose through the glowing windows of the Sainte Chapelle it was so bright for Bibbs And while the zinc eater held out to bring him such golden nights as these all the king s horses and all the king s men might not serve to break the spell Bibbs read slowly but in a reasonable manner as if he were talking and Mary looking at him steadily from beneath her curved fingers appeared to discover no fault It had grown to be her habit to look at him whenever there was an opportunity It may be said in truth that while they were together and it was light she looked at him all the time When he came to the end of Alladine and Palomides they were silent a little while considering together then he turned back the pages and said There s something I want to read over This You would think I threw a window open on the dawn She has a soul that can be seen around her that takes you in its arms like an ailing child and without saying anything to you consoles you for everything I shall never understand it all I do not know how it can all be but my knees bend in spite of me when I speak of it He stopped and looked at her You boy said Mary not very clearly Oh yes he returned But it s true especially my knees You boy she murmured again blushing charmingly You might read another line over The first time I ever saw you Bibbs you were looking into a mirror Do it again But you needn t read it I can give it to you A little Greek slave that came from the heart of Arcady I I m one of the hands at the Pump Works and going to stay one unless I have to decide to study plumbing No She shook her head You love and want what s beautiful and delicate and serene it s really art that you want in your life and have always wanted You seemed to me from the first the most wistful person I had ever known and that s what you were wistful for Bibbs looked doubtful and more wistful than ever but after a moment or two the matter seemed to clarify itself to him Why no he said I wanted something else more than that I wanted you And here I am she laughed completely understanding I think we re like those two in The Cloister and the Hearth I m just the rough Burgundian cross bow man Denys who followed that gentle Gerard and told everybody that the devil was dead He isn t though said Bibbs as a hoarse little bell in the next room began a series of snappings which proved to be ten upon count He gets into the clock whenever I m with you And sighing deeply he rose to go You re always very prompt about leaving me I I try to be he said It isn t easy to be careful not to risk everything by giving myself a little more at a time If I ever saw you look tired Have you ever Not yet You always look you always look How Care free That s it Except when you feel sorry for me about something you always have that splendid look It puts courage into people to see it If I had a struggle to face I d keep remembering that look and I d never give up It s a brave look too as though gaiety might be a kind of gallantry on your part and yet I don t quite understand why it should be either He smiled quizzically looking down upon her Mary you haven t a secret sorrow have you For answer she only laughed No he said I can t imagine you with a care in the world I think that s why you were so kind to me you have nothing but happiness in your own life and so you could spare time to make my troubles turn to happiness too But there s one little time in the twenty four hours when I m not happy It s now when I have to say good night I feel dismal every time it comes and then when I ve left the house there s a bad little blankness a black void as though I were temporarily dead and it lasts until I get it established in my mind that I m really beginning another day that s to end with YOU again Then I cheer up But now s the bad time and I must go through it and so good night And he added with a pungent vehemence of which he was little aware I hate it Do you she said rising to go to the door with him But he stood motionless gazing at her wonderingly Mary Your eyes are so He stopped Yes But she looked quickly away I don t know he said I thought just then What did you think I don t know it seemed to me that there was something I ought to understand and didn t She laughed and met his wondering gaze again frankly My eyes are pleased she said I m glad that you miss me a little after you go But to morrow s coming faster than other days if you ll let it he said She inclined her head Yes I ll let it Going to church said Bibbs It IS going to church when I go with you She went to the front door with him she always went that far They had formed a little code of leave taking by habit neither of them ever speaking of it but it was always the same She always stood in the doorway until he reached the sidewalk and there he always turned and looked back and she waved her hand to him Then he went on halfway to the New House and looked back again and Mary was not in the doorway but the door was open and the light shone It was as if she meant to tell him that she would never shut him out he could always see that friendly light of the open doorway as if it were open for him to come back if he would He could see it until a wing of the New House came between when he went up the path The open doorway seemed to him the beautiful symbol of her friendship of her thought of him a symbol of herself and of her ineffable kindness And she kept the door open even to night though the sleet and fine snow swept in upon her bare throat and arms and her brown hair was strewn with tiny white stars His heart leaped as he turned and saw that she was there waving her hand to him as if she did not know that the storm touched her When he had gone on Mary did as she always did she went into an unlit room across the hall from that in which they had spent the evening and looking from the window watched him until he was out of sight The storm made that difficult to night but she caught a glimpse of him under the street lamp that stood between the two houses and saw that he turned to look back again Then and not before she looked at the upper windows of Roscoe s house across the street They were dark Mary waited but after a little while she closed the front door and returned to her window A moment later two of the upper windows of Roscoe s house flashed into light and a hand lowered the shade of one of them Mary felt the cold then it was the third night she had seen those windows lighted and the shade lowered just after Bibbs had gone But Bibbs had no glance to spare for Roscoe s windows He stopped for his last look back at the open door and with a thin mantle of white already upon his shoulders made his way gasping in the wind to the lee of the sheltering wing of the New House A stricken George muttering hoarsely admitted him and Bibbs became aware of a paroxysm within the house Terrible sounds came from the library Sheridan cursing as never before his wife sobbing her voice rising to an agonized squeal of protest upon each of a series of muffled detonations the outrageous thumping of a bandaged hand upon wood then Gurney sharply imperious Keep your hand in that sling Keep your hand in that sling I say LOOK George gasped delighted to play herald for so important a tragedy and he renewed upon his face the ghastly expression with which he had first beheld the ruins his calamitous gesture laid before the eyes of Bibbs Look at at lamidal statue Gazing down the hall Bibbs saw heroic wreckage seemingly Byzantine painted colossal fragments of the shattered torso appallingly human and gilded and silvered heaps of magnificence strewn among ruinous palms like the spoil of a barbarians battle There had been a massacre in the oasis the Moor had been hurled headlong from his pedestal He hit at ole lamidal statue said George POW My father YESsuh POW he hit er An you ma run tell me git doctuh quick s I kin telefoam she sho you pa goin bus a blood vessel He ain t takin on tall NOW He ain t nothin tall to what he was while ago You done miss it Mist Bibbs Doctuh

better am happiest woman in world are leaving for Florida will wire address when settled will remain till spring love to all father will like him too when knows him like I do he is just ideal Edith Lamhorn CHAPTER XXVI George departed and Bibbs was left gazing upon chaos and listening to thunder He could not reach the stairway without passing the open doors of the library and he was convinced that the mere glimpse of him just then would prove nothing less than insufferable for his father For that reason he was about to make his escape into the gold and brocade room intending to keep out of sight when he heard Sheridan vociferously demanding his presence Tell him to come in here He s out there I heard George just let him in Now you ll SEE And tear stained missus Sheridan looking out into the hall beckoned to her son Bibbs went as far as the doorway Gurney sat winding a strip of white cotton his black bag open upon a chair near by and Sheridan was striding up and down his hand so heavily wrapped in fresh bandages that he seemed to be wearing a small boxing glove His eyes were bloodshot his forehead was heavily bedewed one side of his collar had broken loose and there were blood stains upon his right cuff THERE S our little sunshine he cried as Bibbs appeared THERE S the hope o the family my lifelong pride and joy I want Keep you hand in that sling said Gurney sharply Sheridan turned upon him uttering a sound like a howl For God s sake sing another tune he cried You said you came as a doctor but stay as a friend and in that capacity you undertake to sit up and criticize ME Oh talk sense said the doctor and yawned intentionally What do you want Bibbs to say You were sittin up there tellin me I got hysterical hysterical oh Lord You sat up there and told me I got hysterical over nothin You sat up there tellin me I didn t have as heavy burdens as many another man you knew I just want you to hear THIS Now listen He swung toward the quiet figure waiting in the doorway Bibbs will you come down town with me Monday morning and let me start you with two vice presidencies a directorship stock and salaries I ask you No father said Bibbs gently Sheridan looked at Gurney and then faced his son once more Bibbs you want to stay in the shop do you at nine dollars a week instead of takin up my offer Yes sir And I d like the doctor to hear What ll you do if I decide you re too high priced a workin man either to live in my house or work in my shop Find other work said Bibbs There You hear him for yourself Sheridan cried You hear what Keep you hand in that sling Yes I hear him Sheridan leaned over Gurney and shouted in a voice that cracked and broke piping into falsetto He thinks of bein a PLUMBER He wants to be a PLUMBER He told me he couldn t THINK if he went into business he wants to be a plumber so he can THINK He fell back a step wiping his forhead with the back of his left hand There That s my son That s the only son I got now That s my chance to live he cried with a bitterness that seemed to leave ashes in his throat That s my one chance to live that thing you see in the doorway yonder doctor Gurney thoughtfully regarded the bandage strip he had been winding and tossed it into the open bag What s the matter with giving Bibbs a chance to live he said coolly I would if I were you You ve had TWO that went into business Sheridan s mouth moved grotesquely before he could speak Joe Gurney he said when he could command himself so far are you accusin me of the responsibility for the death of my son James I accuse you of nothing said the doctor But just once I d like to have it out with you on the question of Bibbs and while he s here too He got up walked to the fire and stood warming his hands behind his back and smiling Look here old fellow let s be reasonable he said You were bound Bibbs should go to the shop again and I gave you and him both to understand pretty plainly that if he went it was at the risk of his life Well what did he do He said he wanted to go And he did go and he s made good there Now see Isn t that enough Can t you let him off now He wants to write and how do you know that he couldn t do it if you gave him a chance How do you know he hasn t some message something to say that might make the world just a little bit happier or wiser He MIGHT in time it s a possibility not to be denied Now he can t deliver any message if he goes down there with you and he won t HAVE any to deliver I don t say going down with you is likely to injure his health as I thought the shop would and as the shop did the first time I m not speaking as doctor now anyhow But I tell you one thing I know if you take him down there you ll kill something that I feel is in him and it s finer I think than his physical body and you ll kill it deader than a door nail And so why not let it live You ve about come to the end of your string old fellow Why not stop this perpetual devilish fighting and give Bibbs his chance Sheridan stood looking at him fixedly What fighting Yours with nature Gurney sustained the daunting gaze of his fierce antagonist equably You don t seem to understand that you ve been struggling against actual law What law Natural law said Gurney What do you think beat you with Edith Did Edith herself beat you Didn t she obey without question something powerful that was against you EDITH wasn t against you and you weren t against HER but you set yourself against the power that had her in its grip and it shot out a spurt of flame and won in a walk What s taken Roscoe from you Timbers bear just so much strain old man but YOU wanted to send the load across the broken bridge and you thought you could bully or coax the cracked thing into standing Well you couldn t Now here s Bibbs There are thousands of men fit for the life you want him to lead and so is he It wouldn t take half of Bibbs s brains to be twice as good a business man as Jim and Roscoe put together WHAT Sheridan goggled at him like a zany Your son Bibbs said the doctor composedly Bibbs Sheridan has the kind and quantity of gray matter that will make him a success in anything if he ever wakes up Personally I should prefer him to remain asleep I like him that way But the thousands of men fit for the life you want him to lead aren t fit to do much with the life he OUGHT to lead Blindly he s been fighting for the chance to lead it he s obeying something that begs to stay alive within him and blindly he knows you ll crush it out You ve set your will to do it Let me tell you something more You don t know what you ve become since Jim s going thwarted you and that s what was uppermost a bafflement stronger than your normal grief You re half mad with a consuming fury against the very self of the law for it was the very self of the law that took Jim from you That was a law concerning the cohesion of molecules The very self of the law took Roscoe from you and gave Edith the certainty of beating you and the very self of the law makes Bibbs deny you to night The LAW beats you Haven t you been whipped enough But you want to whip the law you ve set yourself against it to bend it to your own ends to wield it and twist it The voice broke from Sheridan s heaving chest in a shout Yes And by God I will So Ajax defied the lightning said Gurney I ve heard that dam fool story too Sheridan retorted fiercely That s for chuldern and niggers It ain t twentieth century let me tell you Defied the lightning did he the jackass If he d been half a man he d a got away with it WE don t go showin off defyin the lightning we hitch it up and make it work for us like a black steer A man nowadays would just as soon think o defyin a wood shed Well what about Bibbs said Gurney Will you be a really big man now and Gurney you know a lot about bigness Sheridan began to walk to and fro again and the doctor returned gloomily to his chair He had shot his bolt the moment he judged its chance to strike center was best but the target seemed unaware of the marksman I m tryin to make a big man out o that poor truck yonder Sheridan went on and you step in beggin me to let him be Lord knows what I don t I suppose you figure it out that now I got a SON IN LAW I mightn t need a son Yes I got a son in law now a spender Oh put your hand back said Gurney wearily There was a bronze inkstand upon the table Sheridan put his right hand in the sling but with his left he swept the inkstand from the table and half way across the room a comet with a destroying black tail missus Sheridan shrieked and sprang toward it Let it lay he shouted fiercely Let it lay And weeping she obeyed Yes sir he went on in a voice the more ominous for the sudden hush he put upon it I got a spender for a son in law It s wonderful where property goes sometimes There was ole man Tracy you remember him Doc J R Tracy solid banker He went into the bank as messenger seventeen years old he was president at forty three and he built that bank with his life for forty years more He was down there from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon the day before he died over eighty Gilt edge that bank It was diamond edge He used to eat a bag o peanuts and an apple for lunch but he wasn t stingy he was just livin in his business He didn t care for pie or automobiles he had his bank It was an institution and it come pretty near bein the beatin heart o this town in its time Well that ole man used to pass one o these here turned up nose and turned up pants cigarette boys on the streets Never spoke to him Tracy didn t Speak to him God he wouldn t a coughed on him He wouldn t a let him clean the cuspidors at the bank Why if he d a just seen him standin in FRONT the bank he d a had him run off the street And yet all Tracy was doin every day of his life was workin for that cigarette boy Tracy thought it was for the bank he thought he was givin his life and his life blood and the blood of his brain for the bank but he wasn t It was every bit from the time he went in at seventeen till he died in harness at eighty three it was every last lick of it just slavin for that turned up nose turned up pants cigarette boy AND TRACY DIDN T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME He died not ever havin heard it though he chased him off the front steps of his house once The day after Tracy died his old maid daughter married the cigarette and there AIN T any Tracy bank any more And now his voice rose again and now I got a cigarette son in law Gurney pointed to the flourishing right hand without speaking and Sheridan once more returned it to the sling My son in law likes Florida this winter Sheridan went on That s good and my son in law better enjoy it because I don t think he ll be there next winter They got twelve thousand dollars to spend and I hear it can be done in Florida by rich sons in law When Roscoe s woman got me to spend that much on a porch for their new house Edith wouldn t give me a minute s rest till I turned over the same to her And she s got it besides what I gave her to go East on It ll be gone long before this time next year and when she comes home and leaves the cigarette behind for good she ll get some more MY name ain t Tracy and there ain t goin to be any Tracy business in the Sheridan family And there ain t goin to be any college foundin and endowin and trusteein nor God knows what to keep my property alive when I m gone Edith ll be back and she ll get a girl s share when she s through with that cigarette but By the way interposed Gurney didn t missus Sheridan tell me that Bibbs warned you Edith would marry Lamhorn in New York Sheridan went completely to pieces he swore while his wife screamed and stopped her ears And as he swore he pounded the table with his wounded hand and when the doctor after storming at him ineffectively sprang to catch and protect that hand Sheridan wrenched it away tearing the bandage He hammered the table till it leaped Fool he panted choking If he s shown gumption enough to guess right the first time in his life it s enough for me to begin learnin him on And struggling with the doctor he leaned toward Bibbs thrusting forward his convulsed face which was deathly pale My name ain t Tracy I tell you he screamed hoarsely You give in you stubborn fool I ve had my way with you before and I ll have my way with you now Bibbs s face was as white as his father s but he kept remembering that splendid look of Mary s which he had told her would give him courage in a struggle so that he would never give up No You can t have your way he said And then obeying a significant motion of Gurney s head he went out quickly leaving them struggling CHAPTER XXVII missus Sheridan in a wrapper noiselessly opened the door of her husband s room at daybreak the next morning and peered within the darkened chamber At the old house they had shared a room but the architect had chosen to separate them at the New and they had not known how to formulate an objection although to both of them something seemed vaguely reprehensible in the new arrangement Sheridan did not stir and she was withdrawing her head from the aperture when he spoke Oh I m AWAKE Come in if you want to and shut the door She came and sat by the bed I woke up thinkin about it she explained And the more I thought about it the surer I got I must be right and I knew you d be tormentin yourself if you was awake so well you got plenty other troubles but I m just sure you ain t goin to have the worry with Bibbs it looks like You BET I ain t he grunted Look how biddable he was about goin back to the Works she continued He s a right good hearted boy really and sometimes I honestly have to say he seems right smart too Now and then he ll say something sounds right bright Course most always it doesn t and a good deal of the time when he says things why I have to feel glad we haven t got company because they d think he didn t have any gumption at all Yet look at the way he did when Jim when Jim got hurt He took right hold o things Course he d been sick himself so much and all and the rest of us never had much and we were kind o green about what to do in that kind o trouble still he did take hold and everything went off all right you ll have to say that much papa And doctor Gurney says he s got brains and you can t deny but what the doctor s right considerable of a man He acts sleepy but that s only because he s got such a large practice he s a pretty wide awake kind of a man some ways Well what he says last night about Bibbs himself bein asleep and how much he d amount to if he ever woke up that s what I got to thinkin about You heard him papa he says Bibbs ll be a bigger business man than what Jim and Roscoe was put together if he ever wakes up he says Wasn t that exactly what he says I suppose so said Sheridan without exhibiting any interest Gurney s crazier n Bibbs but if he wasn t if what he says was true what of it Listen papa Just suppose Bibbs took it into his mind to get married You know where he goes all the time Oh Lord yes Sheridan turned over in the bed his face to the wall leaving visible of himself only the thick grizzle of his hair You better go back to sleep He runs over there every minute she ll let him I suppose Go back to bed There s nothin in it WHY ain t there she urged I know better there is too You wait and see There s just one thing in the world that ll wake the sleepiest young man alive up yes and make him JUMP up and I don t care who he is or how sound asleep it looks like he is That s when he takes it into his head to pick out some girl and settle down and have a home and chuldern of his own THEN I guess he ll go out after the money You ll see I ve known dozens o cases and so ve you moony no count young men all notions and talk goin to be ministers maybe or something and there s just this one thing takes it out of em and brings em right down to business Well I never could make out just what it is Bibbs wants to be really doesn t seem he wants to be a minister exactly he s so far away you can t tell and he never SAYS but I know this is goin to get him right down to common sense Now I don t say that Bibbs has got the idea in his head yet r else he wouldn t be talkin that fool talk about nine dollars a week bein good enough for him to live on But it s COMIN papa and he ll JUMP for whatever you want to hand him out He will And I can tell you this much too he ll want all the salary and stock he can get hold of and he ll hustle to keep gettin more That girl s the kind that a young husband just goes crazy to give things to She s pretty and fine lookin and things look nice on her and I guess she d like to have em about as well as the next And I guess she isn t gettin many these days either and she ll be pretty ready for the change I saw her with her sleeves rolled up at the kitchen window the other day and Jackson told me yesterday their cook left two weeks ago and they haven t tried to hire another one He says her and her mother been doin the housework a good while and now they re doin the cookin too Course Bibbs wouldn t know that unless she s told him and I reckon she wouldn t she s kind o stiffish lookin and Bibbs is too up in the clouds to notice anything like that for himself They ve never asked him to a meal in the house but he wouldn t notice that either he s kind of innocent Now I was thinkin you know I don t suppose we ve hardly mentioned the girl s name at table since Jim went but it seems to me maybe if Sheridan flung out his arms uttering a sound half groan half yawn You re barkin up the wrong tree Go on back to bed mamma Why am I she demanded crossly Why am I barkin up the wrong tree Because you are There s nothin in it I ll bet you she said rising I ll bet you he goes to church with her this morning What you want to bet Go back to bed he commanded I KNOW what I m talkin about there s nothin in it I tell you She shook her head perplexedly You think because because Jim was runnin so much with her it wouldn t look right No Nothin to do with it Then do you know something about it that you ain t told me Yes I do he grunted Now go on Maybe I can get a little sleep I ain t had any yet Well She went to the door her expression downcast I thought maybe but She coughed prefatorily Oh papa something else I wanted to tell you I was talkin to Roscoe over the phone last night when the telegram came so I forgot to tell you but well Sibyl wants to come over this afternoon Roscoe says she has something she wants to say to us It ll be the first time she s been out since she was able to sit up and I reckon she wants to tell us she s sorry for what happened They expect to get off by the end o the week and I reckon she wants to feel she s done what she could to kind o make up Anyway that s what he said I phoned him again about Edith and he said it wouldn t disturb Sibyl because she d been expectin it she was sure all along it was goin to happen and besides I guess she s got all that foolishness pretty much out of her bein so sick But what I thought was no use bein rough with her papa I expect she s suffered a good deal and I don t think we d ought to be on Roscoe s account You ll you ll be kind o polite to her won t you papa He mumbled something which was smothered under the coverlet he had pulled over his head What she said timidly I was just sayin I hoped you d treat Sibyl all right when she comes this afternoon You will won t you papa He threw the coverlet off furiously I presume so he roared She departed guiltily But if he had accepted her proffered wager that Bibbs would go to church with Mary Vertrees that morning missus Sheridan would have lost Nevertheless Bibbs and Mary did certainly set out from mister Vertrees s house with the purpose of going to church That was their intention and they had no other They meant to go to church But it happened that they were attentively preoccupied in a conversation as they came to the church and though Mary was looking to the right and Bibbs was looking to the left Bibbs s leftward glance converged with Mary s rightward glance and neither was looking far beyond the other at this time It also happened that though they were a little jostled among groups of people in the vicinity of the church they passed this somewhat prominent edifice without being aware of their proximity to it and they had gone an incredible number of blocks beyond it before they discovered their error However feeling that they might be embarrassingly late if they returned they decided that a walk would make them as good It was a windless winter morning with an inch of crisp snow over the ground So they walked and for the most part they were silent but on their way home after they had turned back at noon they began to be talkative again Mary said Bibbs after a time am I a sleep walker She laughed a little then looked grave Does your father say you are Yes when he s in a mood to flatter me Other times other names He has quite a list You mustn t mind she said gently He s been getting some pretty severe shocks What you ve told me makes me pretty sorry for him Bibbs I ve always been sure he s very big Yes Big and blind He s like a Hercules without eyes and without any consciousness except that of his strength and of his purpose to grow stronger Stronger for what For nothing Are you sure Bibbs It CAN T be for nothing it must be stronger for something even though he doesn t know what it is Perhaps what he and his kind are struggling for is something so great they COULDN T see it so great none of us could see it No he s just like some blind unconscious thing heaving underground Till he breaks through and leaps out into the daylight she finished for him cheerily Into the smoke said Bibbs Look at the powder of coal dust already dirtying the decent snow even though it s Sunday That s from the little pigs the big ones aren t so bad on Sunday There s a fleck of soot on your cheek Some pig sent it out into the air he might as well have thrown it on you It would have been braver for then he d have taken his chance of my whipping him for it if I could IS there soot on my cheek Bibbs or were you only saying so rhetorically IS there Is there There ARE soot on your cheeks Mary a fleck on each One landed since I mentioned the first She halted immediately giving him her handkerchief and he succeeded in transferring most of the black from her face to the cambric They were entirely matter of course about it An elderly couple it chanced had been walking behind Bibbs and Mary for the last block or so and passed ahead during the removal of the soot There said the elderly wife You re always wrong when you begin guessing about strangers Those two young people aren t honeymooners at all they ve been married for years A blind man could see that I wish I did know who threw that soot on you said Bibbs looking up at the neighboring chimneys as they went on They arrest children for throwing snowballs at the street cars but But they don t arrest the street cars for shaking all the pictures in the houses crooked every time they go by Nor for the uproar they make I wonder what s the cost in nerves for the noise of the city each year Yes we pay the price for living in a growing town whether we have money to pay or none Who is it gets the pay said Bibbs Not I she laughed Nobody gets it There isn t any pay there s only money And only some of the men down town get much of that That s what my father wants me to get Yes she said smiling to him and nodding And you don t want it and you don t need it But you don t think I m a sleep walker Mary He had told her of his father s new plans for him though he had not described the vigor and picturesqueness of their setting forth You think I m right A thousand times she cried There aren t so many happy people in this world I think and you say you ve found what makes you happy If it s a dream keep it The thought of going down there into the money shuffle I hate it as I never hated the shop he said I hate it And the city itself the city that the money shuffle has made just look at it Look at it in winter The snow s tried hard to make the ugliness bearable but the ugliness is winning it s making the snow hideous the snow s getting dirty on top and it s foul underneath with the dirt and disease of the unclean street And the dirt and the ugliness and the rush and the noise aren t the worst of it it s what the dirt and ugliness and rush and noise MEAN that s the worst The outward things are insufferable but they re only the expression of a spirit a blind embryo of a spirit not yet a soul oh just greed And this go ahead nonsense Oughtn t it all to be a fellowship I shouldn t want to get ahead if I could I d want to help the other fellow to keep up with me I read something the other day and remembered it for you said Mary It was something Burne Jones said of a picture he was going to paint In the first picture I shall make a man walking in the street of a great city full of all kinds of happy life children and lovers walking and ladies leaning from the windows all down great lengths of a street leading to the city walls and there the gates are wide open letting in a space of green field and cornfield in harvest and all round his head a great rain of swirling autumn leaves blowing from a little walled graveyard And if I painted Bibbs returned I d paint a lady walking in the street of a great city full of all kinds of uproarious and futile life children being taught only how to make money and lovers hurrying to get richer and ladies who d given up trying to wash their windows clean and the gates of the city wide open letting in slums and slaughter houses and freight yards and all round this lady s head a great rain of swirling soot He paused adding thoughtfully And yet I believe I m glad that soot got on your cheek It was just as if I were your brother the way you gave me your handkerchief to rub it off for you Still Edith never Didn t she said Mary as he paused again No And I He contented himself with shaking his head instead of offering more definite information Then he realized that they were passing the New House and he sighed profoundly Mary our walk s almost over She looked as blank So it is Bibbs They said no more until they came to her gate As they drifted slowly to a stop the door of Roscoe s house opened and Roscoe came out with Sibyl who was startlingly pale She seemed little enfeebled by her illness however walking rather quickly at her husband s side and not taking his arm The two crossed the street without appearing to see Mary and her companion and entering the New House were lost to sight Mary gazed after them gravely but Bibbs looking at Mary did not see them Mary he said you seem very serious Is anything bothering you No Bibbs And she gave him a bright quick look that made him instantly unreasonably happy I know you want to go in he began No I don t want to I mustn t keep you standing here and I mustn t go in with you but I just wanted to say I ve seemed very stupid to myself this morning grumbling about soot and all that while all the time I Mary I think it s been the very happiest of all the hours you ve given me I do And I don t know just why but it s seemed to me that it was one I d always remember And you he added falteringly you look so so beautiful to day It must have been the soot on my cheek Bibbs Mary will you tell me something he asked I think I will It s something I ve had a lot of theories about but none of them ever just fits You used to wear furs in the fall but now it s so much colder you don t you never wear them at all any more Why don t you Her eyes fell for a moment and she grew red Then she looked up gaily Bibbs if I tell you the answer will you promise not to ask any more questions Yes Why did you stop wearing them Because I found I d be warmer without them She caught his hand quickly in her own for an instant laughed into his eyes and ran into the house CHAPTER XXVIII It is the consoling attribute of unused books that their decorative warmth will so often make even a ready made library the actual living room of a family to whom the shelved volumes are indeed sealed Thus it was with Sheridan who read nothing except newspapers business letters and figures who looked upon books as he looked upon bric a brac or crocheting when he was at home and not abed or eating he was in the library He stood in the many colored light of the stained glass window at the far end of the long room when Roscoe and his wife came in and he exhaled a solemnity His deference to the Sabbath was manifest as always in the length of his coat and the closeness of his Saturday night shave and his expression to match this religious pomp was more than Sabbatical but the most dismaying of his demonstrations was his keeping his hand in his sling Sibyl advanced to the middle of the room and halted there not looking at him but down at her muff in which it could be seen her hands were nervously moving Roscoe went to a chair in another part of the room There was a deadly silence But Sibyl found a shaky voice after an interval of gulping though she was unable to lift her eyes and the darkling lids continued to veil them She spoke hurriedly like an ungifted child reciting something committed to memory but her sincerity was none the less evident for that Father Sheridan you and mother Sheridan have always been so kind to me and I would hate to have you think I don t appreciate it from the way I acted I ve come to tell you I am sorry for the way I did that night and to say I know as well as anybody the way I behaved and it will never happen again because it s been a pretty hard lesson and when we come back some day I hope you ll see that you ve got a daughter in law you never need to be ashamed of again I want to ask you to excuse me for the way I did and I can say I haven t any feelings toward Edith now but only wish her happiness and good in her new life I thank you for all your kindness to me and I know I made a poor return for it but if you can overlook the way I behaved I know I would feel a good deal happier and I know Roscoe would too I wish to promise not to be as foolish in the future and the same error would never occur again to make us all so unhappy if you can be charitable enought to excuse it this time He looked steadily at her without replying and she stood before him never lifting her eyes motionless save where the moving fur proved the agitation of her hands within the muff All right he said at last She looked up then with vast relief though there was a revelation of heavy tears when the eyelids lifted Thank you she said There s something else about something different I want to say to you but I want mother Sheridan to hear it too She s up stairs in her room said Sheridan Roscoe Sibyl interrupted She had just seen Bibbs pass through the hall and begin to ascend the stairs and in a flash she instinctively perceived the chance for precisely the effect she wanted No let me go she said I want to speak to her a minute first anyway And she went away quickly gaining the top of the stairs in time to see Bibbs enter his room and close the door Sibyl knew that Bibbs in his room had overheard her quarrel with Edith in the hall outside for bitter Edith thinking the more to shame her had subsequently informed her of the circumstance Sibyl had just remembered this and with the recollection there had flashed the thought out of her own experience that people are often much more deeply impressed by words they overhear than by words directly addressed to them Sibyl intended to make it impossible for Bibbs not to overhear She did not hesitate her heart was hot with the old sore and she believed wholly in the justice of her cause and in the truth of what she was going to say Fate was virtuous at times it had delivered into her hands the girl who had affronted her missus Sheridan was in her own room The approach of Sibyl and Roscoe had driven her from the library for she had miscalculated her husband s mood and she felt that if he used his injured hand as a mark of emphasis again in her presence she would as she thought of it have a fit right there She heard Sibyl s step and pretended to be putting a touch to her hair before a mirror I was just coming down she said as the door opened Yes he wants you to said Sibyl It s all right mother Sheridan He s forgiven me missus Sheridan sniffed instantly tears appeared She kissed her daughter in law s cheek then in silence regarded the mirror afresh wiped her eyes and applied powder And I hope Edith will be happy Sibyl added inciting more applications of missus Sheridan s handkerchief and powder Yes yes murmured the good woman We mustn t make the worst of things Well there was something else I had to say and he wants you to hear it too said Sibyl We better go down mother Sheridan She led the way missus Sheridan following obediently but when they came to a spot close by Bibbs s door Sibyl stopped I want to tell you about it first she said abruptly It isn t a secret of course in any way it s something the whole family has to know and the sooner the whole family knows it the better It s something it wouldn t be RIGHT for us ALL not to understand and of course father Sheridan most of all But I want to just kind of go over it first with you it ll kind of help me to see I got it all straight I haven t got any reason for saying it except the good of the family and it s nothing to me one way or the other of course except for that I oughtn t to ve behaved the way I did that night and it seems to me if there s anything I can do to help the family I ought to because it would help show I felt the right way Well what I want to do is to tell this so s to keep the family from being made a fool of I don t want to see the family just made use of and twisted around her finger by somebody that s got no more heart than so much ice and just as sure to bring troubles in the long run as as Edith s mistake is Well then this is the way it is I ll just tell you how it looks to me and see if it don t strike you the same way Within the room Bibbs much annoyed tapped his ear with his pencil He wished they wouldn t stand talking near his door when he was trying to write He had just taken from his trunk the manuscript of a poem begun the preceding Sunday afternoon and he had some ideas he wanted to fix upon paper before they maliciously seized the first opportunity to vanish for they were but gossamer Bibbs was pleased with the beginnings of his poem and if he could carry it through he meant to dare greatly with it he would venture it upon an editor For he had his plan of life now his day would be of manual labor and thinking he could think of his friend and he could think in cadences for poems to the crashing of the strong machine and if his father turned him out of home and out of the Works he would work elsewhere and live elsewhere His father had the right and it mattered very little to Bibbs he faced the prospect of a working man s lodging house without trepidation He could find a washstand to write upon he thought and every evening when he left Mary he would write a little and he would write on holidays and on Sundays on Sundays in the afternoon In a lodging house at least he wouldn t be interrupted by his sister in law s choosing the immediate vicinity of his door for conversations evidently important to herself but merely disturbing to him He frowned plaintively wishing he could think of some polite way of asking her to go away But as she went on he started violently dropping manuscript and pencil upon the floor I don t know whether you heard it mother Sheridan she said but this old Vertrees house next door had been sold on foreclosure and all THEY got out of it was an agreement that let s em live there a little longer Roscoe told me and he says he heard mister Vertrees has been up and down the streets more n two years tryin to get a job he could call a position and couldn t land it You heard anything about it mother Sheridan Well I DID know they been doin their own house work a good while back said missus Sheridan And now they re doin the cookin too Sibyl sent forth a little titter with a sharp edge I hope they find something to cook She sold her piano mighty quick after Jim died Bibbs jumped up He was trembling from head to foot and he was dizzy of all the real things he could never have dreamed in his dream the last would have been what he heard now He felt that something incredible was happening and that he was powerless to stop it It seemed to him that heavy blows were falling on his head and upon Mary s it seemed to him that he and Mary were being struck and beaten physically and that something hideous impended He wanted to shout to Sibyl to be silent but he could not he could only stand swallowing and trembling What I think the whole family ought to understand is just this said Sibyl sharply Those people were so hard up that this Miss Vertrees started after Bibbs before they knew whether he was INSANE or not They d got a notion he might be from his being in a sanitarium and missus Vertrees ASKED me if he was insane the very first day Bibbs took the daughter out auto riding She paused a moment looking at missus Sheridan but listening intently There was no sound from within the room No exclaimed missus Sheridan It s the truth Sibyl declared loudly Oh of course we were all crazy about that girl at first We were pretty green when we moved up here and we thought she d get us IN but it didn t take ME long to read her Her family were down and out when it came to money and they had to go after it one way or another SOMEHOW So she started for Roscoe but she found out pretty quick he was married and she turned right around to Jim and she landed him There s no doubt about it she had Jim and if he d lived you d had another daughter in law before this as sure as I stand here telling you the God s truth about it Well when Jim was left in the cemetery she was waiting out there to drive home with Bibbs Jim wasn t COLD and she didn t know whether Bibbs was insane or not but he was the only one of the rich Sheridan boys left She had to get him The texture of what was the truth made an even fabric with what was not in Sibyl s mind she believed every word that she uttered and she spoke with the rapidity and vehemence of fierce conviction What I feel about it is she said it oughtn t to be allowed to go on It s too mean I like poor Bibbs and I don t want to see him made such a fool of and I don t want to see the family made such a fool of I like poor Bibbs but if he d only stop to think a minute himself he d have to realize he isn t the kind of man ANY girl would be apt to fall in love with He s better looking lately maybe but you know how he WAS just kind of a long white rag in good clothes And girls like men with some SO to em SOME sort of dashingness anyhow Nobody ever looked at poor Bibbs before and neither d she no SIR not till she d tried both Roscoe and Jim first It was only when her and her family got desperate that she Bibbs whiter than when he came from the sanitarium opened the door He stepped across its threshold and stook looking at her Both women screamed Oh good heavens cried Sibyl Were you in THERE Oh I wouldn t She seized missus Sheridan s arm pulling her toward the stairway Come on mother Sheridan she urged and as the befuddled and confused lady obeyed Sibyl left a trail of noisy exclamations Good gracious Oh I wouldn t too bad I didn t DREAM he was there I wouldn t hurt his feelings Not for the world Of course he had to know SOME time But good heavens She heard his door close as she and missus Sheridan reached the top of the stairs and she glanced over her shoulder quickly but Bibbs was not following he had gone back into his room He he looked oh terrible bad stammered missus Sheridan I I wish Still it s a good deal better he knows about it said Sibyl I shouldn t wonder it might turn out the very best thing could happened Come on And completing their descent to the library the two made their appearance to Roscoe and his father Sibyl at once gave a full and truthful account of what had taken place repeating her own remarks and omitting only the fact that it was through her design that Bibbs had overheard them But as I told mother Sheridan she said in conclusion it might turn out for the very best that he did hear just that way Don t you think so father Sheridan He merely grunted in reply and sat rubbing the thick hair on the top of his head with his left hand and looking at the fire He had given no sign of being impressed in any manner by her exposure of Mary Vertrees s character but his impassivity did not dismay Sibyl it was Bibbs whom she desired to impress and she was content in that matter I m sure it was all for the best she said It s over now and he knows what she is In one way I think it was lucky because just hearing a thing that way a person can tell it s SO and he knows I haven t got any ax to grind except his own good and the good of the family missus Sheridan went nervously to the door and stood there looking toward the stairway I wish I wish I knew what he was doin she said He did look terrible bad It was like something had been done to him that was I don t know what I never saw anybody look like he did He looked so queer It was like you d She called down the hall George Yes m Were you up in mister Bibbs s room just now Yes m He ring bell tole me make him fiah in his grate I done buil him nice fiah I reckon he ain feelin so well Yes m He departed What do you expect he wants a fire for she asked turning toward her husband The house is warm as can be I do wish I Oh quit frettin said Sheridan Well I I kind o wish you hadn t said anything Sibyl I know you meant it for the best and all but I don t believe it would been so much harm if Mother Sheridan you don t mean you WANT that kind of a girl in the family Why she I don t know I don t know the troubled woman quavered If he liked her it seems kind of a pity to spoil it He s so queer and he hasn t ever taken much enjoyment And besides I believe the way it was there was more chance of him bein willin to do what papa wants him to If she wants to marry him Sheridan interrupted her with a hooting laugh She don t he said You re barkin up the wrong tree Sibyl She ain t that kind of a girl But father Sheridan didn t she He cut her short That s enough You may mean all right but you guess wrong So do you mamma Sibyl cried out Oh But just LOOK how she ran after Jim She did not he said curtly She wouldn t take Jim She turned him down cold But that s impossi It s not I KNOW she did Sibyl looked flatly incredulous And YOU needn t worry he said turning to his wife This won t have any effect on your idea because there wasn t any sense to it anyhow D you think she d be very likely to take Bibbs after she wouldn t take JIM She s a good hearted girl and she lets Bibbs come to see her but if she d ever given him one sign of encouragement the way you women think he wouldn t of acted the stubborn fool he has he d a been at me long ago beggin me for some kind of a job he could support a wife on There s nothin in it and I ve got the same old fight with him on my hands I ve had all his life and the Lord knows what he won t do to balk me What s happened now ll probably only make him twice as stubborn but SH missus Sheridan still in the doorway lifted her hand That s his step he s comin down stairs She shrank away from the door as if she feared to have Bibbs see her I I wonder she said almost in a whisper I wonder what he d goin to do Her timorousness had its effect upon the others Sheridan rose frowning but remained standing beside his chair and Roscoe moved toward Sibyl who stared uneasily at the open doorway They listened as the slow steps descended the stairs and came toward the library Bibbs stopped upon the threshold and with sick and haggard eyes looked slowly from one to the other until at last his gaze rested upon his father Then he came and stood before him I m sorry you ve had so much trouble with me he said gently You won t any more I ll take the job you offered me Sheridan did not speak he stared astounded and incredulous and Bibbs had left the room before any of its occupants uttered a sound though he went as slowly as he came missus Sheridan was the first to move She went nervously back to the doorway and then out into the hall Bibbs had gone from the house Bibbs s mother had a feeling about him then that she had never known before it was indefinite and vague but very poignant something in her mourned for him uncomprehendingly She felt that an awful thing had been done to him though she did not know what it was She went up to his room The fire George had built for him was almost smothered under thick charred ashes of paper The lid of his trunk stood open and the large upper tray which she remembered to have seen full of papers and note books was empty And somehow she understood that Bibbs had given up the mysterious vocation he had hoped to follow and that he had given it up for ever She thought it was the wisest thing he could have done and yet for an unknown reason she sat upon the bed and wept a little before she went down stairs So Sheridan had his way with Bibbs all through

3982_178459_000002_000000	train-clean-100	As Bibbs came out of the New House a Sunday trio was in course of passage upon the sidewalk an ample young woman placid of face a black clad thin young man whose expression was one of habitual anxiety habitual wariness and habitual eagerness 
3982_178459_000002_000001	train-clean-100	He propelled a perambulator containing the third and all three were newly cleaned Sundayfied and made fit to dine with the wife s relatives 
3982_178459_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 How d you like for me to be THAT young fella mamma the husband whispered 
3982_178459_000003_000001	train-clean-100	 He s one of the sons and there ain t but two left now 
3982_178459_000004_000000	train-clean-100	The wife stared curiously at Bibbs 
none	none	Well I don t know she returned He looks to me like he had his own troubles I expect he has like anybody else said the young husband but I guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money Well maybe if you keep on the way you been baby ll be as well fixed as the Sheridans You can t tell She glanced back at Bibbs who had turned north
3982_178459_000006_000002	train-clean-100	 He walks kind of slow and stooped over like 
none	none	So much money in his pockets it makes him sag I guess said the young husband with bitter admiration 
3982_178459_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Mary happening to glance from a window saw Bibbs coming and she started clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm 
3982_178459_000008_000001	train-clean-100	She met him at the door 
none	none	Bibbs she cried What is the matter 
3982_178459_000009_000002	train-clean-100	I saw something was terribly wrong when I You look She paused and he came in not lifting his eyes to hers 
3982_178459_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Always when he crossed that threshold he had come with his head up and his wistful gaze seeking hers 
3982_178459_000009_000004	train-clean-100	 Ah poor boy she said with a gesture of understanding and pity 
none	none	I know what it is 
3982_178459_000010_000000	train-clean-100	He followed her into the room where they always sat and sank into a chair 
3982_178459_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 You needn t tell me she said 
none	none	They ve made you give up 
3982_178459_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Your father s won you re going to do what he wants 
3982_178459_000011_000003	train-clean-100	You ve given up 
3982_178459_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Still without looking at her he inclined his head in affirmation 
none	none	She gave a little cry of compassion and came and sat near him Bibbs she said
3982_178459_000013_000002	train-clean-100	 I can be glad of one thing though it s selfish 
3982_178459_000013_000003	train-clean-100	I can be glad you came straight to me 
3982_178459_000013_000004	train-clean-100	It s more to me than even if you d come because you were happy She did not speak again for a little while then she said Bibbs dear could you tell me about it 
none	none	Do you want to 
3982_178459_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Still he did not look up but in a voice shaken and husky he asked her a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood his words 
none	none	Mary he said could you marry me
3982_178459_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 What did you say Bibbs she asked quietly 
3982_178459_000017_000000	train-clean-100	His tone and attitude did not change 
none	none	Will you marry me 
3982_178459_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Both of her hands leaped to her cheeks she grew red and then white She rose slowly and moved backward from him staring at him at first incredulously then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous in her wide eyes it was like a spoken question 
3982_178459_000018_000001	train-clean-100	The room filled with strangeness in the long silence the two were so strange to each other At last she said 
3982_178459_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 What made you say that 
3982_178459_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 What made you say that 
none	none	He did not answer
3982_178459_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Bibbs look at me Her voice was loud and clear 
none	none	What made you say that Look at me 
3982_178459_000022_000000	train-clean-100	He could not look at her and he could not speak 
3982_178459_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 What was it that made you she said 
3982_178459_000023_000001	train-clean-100	 I want you to tell me 
none	none	She went closer to him her eyes ever brighter and wider with that intensity of wonder
3982_178459_000024_000001	train-clean-100	 You ve given up to your father she said slowly and then you came to ask me She broke off 
3982_178459_000024_000002	train-clean-100	 Bibbs do you want me to marry you 
3982_178459_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes he said just audibly 
none	none	No she cried You do not 
3982_178459_000026_000002	train-clean-100	Then what made you ask me 
3982_178459_000026_000003	train-clean-100	What is it that s happened 
none	none	Nothing Wait she said
3982_178459_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 Let me think 
3982_178459_000028_000002	train-clean-100	It s something that happened since our walk this morning yes since you left me at noon 
3982_178459_000028_000003	train-clean-100	Something happened that She stopped abruptly with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension 
3982_178459_000028_000004	train-clean-100	She remembered that Sibyl had gone to the New House 
3982_178459_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say I do I do want you to marry me if if you could 
3982_178459_000030_000000	train-clean-100	She looked at him and slowly shook her head 
3982_178459_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 Bibbs do you Her voice was as unsteady as his little more than a whisper 
3982_178459_000030_000002	train-clean-100	 Do you think I m in love with you 
none	none	No he said 
3982_178459_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word it did not seem to come from Mary s parted lips but he was aware of it Why 
3982_178459_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve had nothing but dreams Bibbs said desolately but they weren t like that 
none	none	Sibyl said no girl could care about me He smiled faintly though still he did not look at Mary And when I first came home Edith told me Sibyl was so anxious to marry that she d have married ME 
3982_178459_000033_000003	train-clean-100	She meant it to express Sibyl s extremity you see 
3982_178459_000033_000004	train-clean-100	But I hardly needed either of them to tell me 
3982_178459_000033_000005	train-clean-100	I hadn t thought of myself as well not as particularly captivating 
3982_178459_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Oddly enough Mary s pallor changed to an angry flush 
3982_178459_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 Those two she exclaimed sharply and then with thoroughgoing contempt Lamhorn That s like them She turned away went to the bare little black mantel and stood leaning upon it 
none	none	Presently she asked WHEN did missus Roscoe Sheridan say that no girl could care about you To day 
3982_178459_000036_000000	train-clean-100	Mary drew a deep breath 
3982_178459_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 I think I m beginning to understand a little She bit her lip there was anger in good truth in her eyes and in her voice 
none	none	Answer me once more she said
3982_178459_000036_000003	train-clean-100	 Bibbs do you know now why I stopped wearing my furs 
none	none	Yes
3982_178459_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 I thought so 
3982_178459_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Your sister in law told you didn t she 
3982_178459_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 I I heard her say 
3982_178459_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 I think I know what happened now Mary s breath came fast and her voice shook but she spoke rapidly 
3982_178459_000040_000001	train-clean-100	 You heard her say more than that You heard her say that we were bitterly poor and on that account I tried first to marry your brother and then But now she faltered and it was only after a convulsive effort that she was able to go on 
3982_178459_000040_000002	train-clean-100	 And then that I tried to marry you 
none	none	You heard her say that and you believe that I don t care for you and that no girl could care for you but you think I am in such an extremity as Sibyl was that you And so not wanting me and believing that I could not want you except for my extremity you took your father s offer and then came to ask me to marry you 
3982_178459_000040_000004	train-clean-100	What had I shown you of myself that could make you 
none	none	Suddenly she sank down kneeling with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of a chair tears overwhelming her
3982_178459_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Mary Mary he cried helplessly 
3982_178459_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh NO you you don t understand 
3982_178459_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 I do though she sobbed 
none	none	I do 
3982_178459_000044_000000	train-clean-100	He came and stood beside her 
3982_178459_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 You kill me he said 
3982_178459_000044_000002	train-clean-100	 I can t make it plain 
none	none	From the first of your loveliness to me I was all self 
3982_178459_000044_000004	train-clean-100	It was always you that gave and I that took 
3982_178459_000044_000005	train-clean-100	I was the dependent I did nothing but lean on you 
3982_178459_000044_000006	train-clean-100	We always talked of me not of you 
3982_178459_000044_000007	train-clean-100	It was all about my idiotic distresses and troubles 
3982_178459_000044_000008	train-clean-100	I thought of you as a kind of wonderful being that had no mortal or human suffering except by sympathy 
3982_178459_000044_000009	train-clean-100	You seemed to lean down out of a rosy cloud to be kind to me 
3982_178459_000044_000010	train-clean-100	I never dreamed I could do anything for YOU 
3982_178459_000044_000011	train-clean-100	I never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody 
none	none	And to day I heard that that you You heard that I needed to marry some one anybody with money she sobbed
3982_178459_000045_000001	train-clean-100	 And you thought we were so so desperate you believed that I had 
3982_178459_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 No he said quickly 
3982_178459_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 I didn t believe you d done one kind thing for me for that 
none	none	No no no I knew you d NEVER thought of me except generously to give 
3982_178459_000046_000003	train-clean-100	I said I couldn t make it plain he cried despairingly 
none	none	Wait She lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously like a child
3982_178459_000047_000002	train-clean-100	 Help me up Bibbs Then when she was once more upon her feet she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly but reassuringly as if to tell him in that way that she knew he had not meant to hurt her 
3982_178459_000047_000003	train-clean-100	And that smile of hers so lamentable but so faithfully friendly misted his own eyes for his shamefacedness lowered them no more 
3982_178459_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Let me tell you what you want to tell me she said 
3982_178459_000048_000001	train-clean-100	 You can t because you can t put it into words they are too humiliating for me and you re too gentle to say them 
3982_178459_000048_000002	train-clean-100	Tell me though isn t it true 
3982_178459_000048_000003	train-clean-100	You didn t believe that I d tried to make you fall in love with me 
none	none	Never 
3982_178459_000049_000001	train-clean-100	Never for an instant 
none	none	You didn t believe I d tried to make you want to marry me No no no
3982_178459_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 I believe it Bibbs 
3982_178459_000052_000001	train-clean-100	You thought that I was fond of you you knew I cared for you but you didn t think I might be in love with you But you thought that I might marry you without being in love with you because you did believe I had tried to marry your brother and 
none	none	Mary I only knew for the first time that you that you were
3982_178459_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Were desperately poor she said 
none	none	You can t even say that 
3982_178459_000054_000002	train-clean-100	Bibbs it was true I did try to make Jim want to marry me 
3982_178459_000054_000003	train-clean-100	I did And she sank down into the chair weeping bitterly again 
3982_178459_000054_000004	train-clean-100	Bibbs was agonized 
3982_178459_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Mary he groaned I didn t know you COULD cry 
3982_178459_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Listen she said 
3982_178459_000056_000001	train-clean-100	 Listen till I get through I want you to understand 
3982_178459_000056_000002	train-clean-100	We were poor and we weren t fitted to be 
3982_178459_000056_000003	train-clean-100	We never had been and we didn t know what to do 
none	none	We d been almost rich there was plenty but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town he wanted to be richer but instead well just about the time your father finished building next door we found we hadn t anything People say that sometimes meaning that they haven t anything in comparison with other people of their own kind but we really hadn t anything we hadn t anything at all Bibbs 
3982_178459_000056_000005	train-clean-100	And we couldn t DO anything You might wonder why I didn t try to be a stenographer and I wonder myself why when a family loses its money people always say the daughters ought to go and be stenographers It s curious as if a wave of the hand made you into a stenographer 
none	none	No I d been raised to be either married comfortably or a well to do old maid if I chose not to marry 
3982_178459_000056_000007	train-clean-100	The poverty came on slowly Bibbs but at last it was all there and I didn t know how to be a stenographer 
3982_178459_000056_000008	train-clean-100	I didn t know how to be anything except a well to do old maid or somebody s wife and I couldn t be a well to do old maid 
3982_178459_000056_000009	train-clean-100	Then Bibbs I did what I d been raised to know how to do 
none	none	I went out to be fascinating and be married 
3982_178459_000056_000011	train-clean-100	I did it openly at least and with a kind of decent honesty 
none	none	I told your brother I had meant to fascinate him and that I was not in love with him but I let him think that perhaps I meant to marry him 
3982_178459_000056_000013	train-clean-100	I think I did mean to marry him 
3982_178459_000056_000014	train-clean-100	I had never cared for anybody and I thought it might be there really WASN T anything more than a kind of excited fondness 
none	none	I can t be sure but I think that though I did mean to marry him I never should have done it because that sort of a marriage is it s sacrilege something would have stopped me 
3982_178459_000056_000016	train-clean-100	Something did stop me it was your sister in law Sibyl 
3982_178459_000056_000017	train-clean-100	She meant no harm but she was horrible and she put what I was doing into such horrible words and they were the truth oh 
3982_178459_000056_000018	train-clean-100	I SAW myself 
none	none	She was proposing a miserable compact with me and I couldn t breathe the air of the same room with her though I d so cheapened myself she had a right to assume that I WOULD But I couldn t 
3982_178459_000056_000021	train-clean-100	I left her and I wrote to your brother just a quick scrawl 
3982_178459_000056_000022	train-clean-100	I told him just what I d done I asked his pardon and I said I would not marry him 
3982_178459_000056_000023	train-clean-100	I posted the letter but he never got it That was the afternoon he was killed 
3982_178459_000056_000024	train-clean-100	That s all Bibbs 
3982_178459_000056_000025	train-clean-100	Now you know what I did and you know ME She pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes leaning far forward her head bowed before him 
3982_178459_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Bibbs had forgotten himself long ago his heart broke for her 
3982_178459_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 Couldn t you Isn t there Won t you he stammered 
3982_178459_000057_000002	train-clean-100	 Mary I m going with father 
3982_178459_000057_000003	train-clean-100	Isn t there some way you could use the money without without 
3982_178459_000058_000000	train-clean-100	She gave a choked little laugh 
3982_178459_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 You gave me something to live for he said 
none	none	You kept me alive I think and I ve hurt you like this
3982_178459_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 Not you oh no 
3982_178459_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 You could forgive me Mary 
3982_178459_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh a thousand times Her right hand went out in a faltering gesture and just touched his own for an instant 
3982_178459_000062_000001	train-clean-100	 But there s nothing to forgive 
3982_178459_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 And you can t you can t 
3982_178459_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Can t what Bibbs 
none	none	You couldn t Marry you she said for him Yes No no no She sprang up facing him and without knowing what she did she set her hands upon his breast pushing him back from her a little
3982_178459_000068_000001	train-clean-100	 I can t I can t 
none	none	Don t you SEE Mary
3982_178459_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 No no And you must go now Bibbs I can t bear any more please 
none	none	MARY
3982_178459_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 Never never never she cried in a passion of tears 
3982_178459_000072_000003	train-clean-100	Never never never 
none	none	she cried in a passion of tears
3982_178459_000072_000001	train-clean-100	 You mustn t come any more 
3982_178459_000072_000002	train-clean-100	I can t see you dear 
none	none	Never never never Somehow in helpless stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture he got himself to the door and out of the house CHAPTER XXX Sibyl and Roscoe were upon the point of leaving when Bibbs returned to the New House He went straight to Sibyl and spoke to her quietly but so that the others might hear When you said that if I d stop to think I d realize that no one would be apt to care enough about me to marry me you were right he said I thought perhaps you weren t and so I asked Miss Vertrees to marry me It proved what you said of me and disproved what you said of her She refused And having thus spoken he quitted the room as straightforwardly as he had entered it He s SO queer missus Sheridan gasped Who on earth would thought of his doin THAT I told you said her husband grimly You didn t tell us he d go over there and I told you she wouldn t have him I told you she wouldn t have JIM didn t I Sibyl was altogether taken aback Do you supose it s true Do you suppose she WOULDN T He didn t look exactly like a young man that had just got things fixed up fine with his girl said Sheridan Not to me he didn t But why would I told you he interrupted angrily she ain t that kind of a girl If you got to have proof well I ll tell you and get it over with though I d pretty near just as soon not have to talk a whole lot about my dead boy s private affairs She wrote to Jim she couldn t take him and it was a good straight letter too It came to Jim s office he never saw it She wrote it the afternoon he was hurt I remember I saw her put a letter in the mail box that afternoon said Roscoe Don t you remember Sibyl I told you about it I was waiting for you while you were in there so long talking to her mother It was just before we saw that something was wrong over here and Edith came and called me Sibyl shook her head but she remembered And she was not cast down for although some remnants of perplexity were left in her eyes they were dimmed by an increasing glow of triumph and she departed after some further fragmentary discourse visibly elated After all the guilty had not been exalted and she perceived vaguely but none the less surely that her injury had been copiously avenged She bestowed a contented glance upon the old house with the cupola as she and Roscoe crossed the street When they had gone missus Sheridan indulged in reverie but after a while she said uneasily Papa you think it would be any use to tell Bibbs about that letter I don t know he answered walking moodily to the window I been thinkin about it He came to a decision I reckon I will And he went up to Bibbs s room Well you goin back on what you said he inquired brusquely as he opened the door You goin to take it back and lay down on me again No said Bibbs Well perhaps I didn t have any call to accuse you of that I don t know as you ever did go back on anything you said exactly though the Lord knows you ve laid down on me enough You certainly have Sheridan was baffled This was not what he wished to say but his words were unmanageable he found himself unable to control them and his querulous abuse went on in spite of him I can t say I expect much of you not from the way you always been up to now unless you turn over a new leaf and I don t see any encouragement to think you re goin to do THAT If you go down there and show a spark o real GIT up I reckon the whole office ll fall in a faint But if you re ever goin to show any you better begin right at the beginning and begin to show it to morrow Yes I ll try You better if it s in you Sheridan was sheerly nonplussed He had always been able to say whatever he wished to say but his tongue seemed bewitched He had come to tell Bibbs about Mary s letter and to his own angry astonishment he found it impossible to do anything except to scold like a drudge driver You better come down there with your mind made up to hustle harder than the hardest workin man that s under you or you ll not get on very good with me I tell you The way to get ahead and you better set it down in your books the way to get ahead is to do ten times the work of the hardest worker that works FOR you But you don t know what work is yet All you ve ever done was just stand around and feed a machine a child could handle and then come home and take a bath and go callin I tell you you re up against a mighty different proposition now and if you re worth your salt and you never showed any signs of it yet not any signs that stuck out enough to bang somebody on the head and make em sit up and take notice well I want to say right here and now and you better listen because I want to say just what I DO say I say He meandered to a full stop His mouth hung open and his mind was a hopeless blank Bibbs looked up patiently an old old look Yes father I m listening That s all said Sheridan frowning heavily That s all I came to say and you better see t you remember it He shook his head warningly and went out closing the door behind him with a crash However no sound of footsteps indicated his departure He stopped just outside the door and stood there a minute or more Then abruptly he turned the knob and exhibited to his son a forehead liberally covered with perspiration Look here he said crossly That girl over yonder wrote Jim a letter I know said Bibbs She told me Well I thought you needn t feel so much upset about it The door closed on his voice as he withdrew but the conclusion of the sentence was nevertheless audible if you knew she wouldn t have Jim either And he stamped his way down stairs to tell his wife to quit her frettin and not bother him with any more fool s errands She was about to inquire what Bibbs said but after a second thought she decided not to speak at all She merely murmured a wordless assent and verbal communication was given over between them for the rest of that afternoon Bibbs and his father were gone when missus Sheridan woke the next morning and she had a dreary day She missed Edith woefully and she worried about what might be taking place in the Sheridan Building She felt that everything depended on how Bibbs took hold and upon her husband s return in the evening she seized upon the first opportunity to ask him how things had gone He was non committal What could anybody tell by the first day He d seen plenty go at things well enough right at the start and then blow up Pretty near anybody could show up fair the first day or so There was a big job ahead This material such as it was Bibbs in fact had to be broken in to handling the work Roscoe had done and then at least as an overseer he must take Jim s position in the Realty Company as well He told her to ask him again in a month But during the course of dinner she gathered from some disjointed remarks of his that he and Bibbs had lunched together at the small restaurant where it had been Sheridan s custom to lunch with Jim and she took this to be an encouraging sign Bibbs went to his room as soon as they left the table and her husband was not communicative after reading his paper She became an anxious spectator of Bibbs s progress as a man of business although it was a progress she could glimpse but dimly and only in the evening through his remarks and his father s at dinner Usually Bibbs was silent except when directly addressed but on the first evening of the third week of his new career he offered an opinion which had apparently been the subject of previous argument I d like you to understand just what I meant about those storage rooms father he said as Jackson placed his coffee before him Abercrombie agreed with me but you wouldn t listen to him You can talk if you want to and I ll listen Sheridan returned but you can t show me that Jim ever took up with a bad thing The roof fell because it hadn t had time to settle and on account of weather conditions I want that building put just the way Jim planned it You can t have it said Bibbs You can t because Jim planned for the building to stand up and it won t do it The other one the one that didn t fall is so shot with cracks we haven t dared use it for storage It won t stand weight There s only one thing to do get both buildings down as quickly as we can and build over Brick s the best and cheapest in the long run for that type Sheridan looked sarcastic Fine What we goin to do for storage rooms while we re waitin for those few bricks to be laid Rent Bibbs returned promptly We ll lose money if we don t rent anyhow they were waiting so long for you to give the warehouse matter your attention after the roof fell You don t know what an amount of stuff they ve got piled up on us over there We d have to rent until we could patch up those process perils and the Krivitch Manufacturing Company s plant is empty right across the street I took an option on it for us this morning Sheridan s expression was queer Look here he said sharply Did you go and do that without consulting me It didn t cost anything said Bibbs It s only until to morrow afternoon at two o clock I undertook to convince you before then Oh you did Sheridan s tone was sardonic Well just suppose you couldn t convince me I can though and I intend to said Bibbs quietly I don t think you understand the condition of those buildings you want patched up Now see here said Sheridan with slow emphasis suppose I had my mind set about this JIM thought they d stand and suppose it was well kind of a matter of sentiment with me to prove he was right Bibbs looked at him compassionately I m sorry if you have a sentiment about it father he said But whether you have or not can t make a difference You ll get other people hurt if you trust that process and that won t do And if you want a monument to Jim at least you want one that will stand Besides I don t think you can reasonably defend sentiment in this particular kind of affair Oh you don t No but I m sorry you didn t tell me you felt it Sheridan was puzzled by his son s tone Why are you sorry he asked curiously Because I had the building inspector up there this noon said Bibbs and I had him condemn both those buildings What He d been afraid to do it before until he heard from us afraid you d see he lost his job But he can t un condemn them they ve got to come down now Sheridan gave him a long and piercing stare from beneath lowered brows Finally he said How long did they give you on that option to convince me Until two o clock to morrow afternoon All right said Sheridan not relaxing I m convinced Bibbs jumped up I thought you would be I ll telephone the Krivitch agent He gave me the option until to morrow but I told him I d settle it this evening Sheridan gazed after him as he left the room and then though his expression did not alter in the slightest a sound came from him that startled his wife It had been a long time since she had heard anything resembling a chuckle from him and this sound although it was grim and dry bore that resemblance She brightened eagerly Looks like he was startin right well don t it papa Startin Lord He got me on the hip Why HE knew what I wanted that s why he had the inspector up there so t he d have me beat before we even started to talk about it And did you hear him Can t reasonably defend SENTIMENT And the way he says Us Took an option for Us Stuff piled up on Us There was always an alloy for missus sheridan I don t just like the way he looks though papa Oh there s got to be something Only one chick left at home so you start to frettin about IT No He s changed There s kind of a settish look to his face and I guess that s the common sense comin out on him then said Sheridan You ll see symptoms like that in a good many business men I expect Well and he don t have as good color as he was gettin before And he d begun to fill out some but Sheridan gave forth another dry chuckle and going round the table to her patted her upon the shoulder with his left hand his right being still heavily bandaged though he no longer wore a sling That s the way it is with you mamma got to take your frettin out one way if you don t another No He don t look well It ain t exactly the way he looked when he begun to get sick that time but he kind o seems to be losin some way Yes he may a lost something said Sheridan I expect he s lost a whole lot o foolishness besides his God forsaken notions about writin poetry and No his wife persisted I mean he looks right peakid And yesterday when he was settin with us he kept lookin out the window He wasn t readin Well why shouldn t he look out the window He was lookin over there He never read a word all afternoon I don t believe Look here said Sheridan Bibbs might a kept goin on over there the rest of his life moonin on and on but what he heard Sibyl say did one big thing anyway It woke him up out of his trance Well he had to go and bust clean out with a bang and that stopped his goin over there and it stopped his poetry but I reckon he s begun to get pretty fair pay for what he lost I guess a good many young men have had to get over worries like his they got to lose SOMETHING if they re goin to keep ahead o the procession nowadays and it kind o looks to me mamma like Bibbs might keep quite a considerable long way ahead Why a year from now I ll bet you he won t know there ever WAS such a thing as poetry And ain t he funny He wanted to stick to the shop so s he could think What he meant was think about something useless Well I guess he s keepin his mind pretty occupied the other way these days Yes sir it took a pretty fair sized shock to get him out of his trance but it certainly did the business He patted his wife s shoulder again and then without any prefatory symptoms broke into a boisterous laugh Honest mamma he works like a gorilla CHAPTER XXI And so Bibbs sat in the porch of the temple with the money changers But no one came to scourge him forth for this was the temple of Bigness and the changing of money was holy worship and true religion The priests wore that settish look Bibbs s mother had seen beginning to develop about his mouth and eyes a wary look which she could not define but it comes with service at the temple and it was the more marked upon Bibbs for his sharp awakening to the necessities of that service He did as little useless thinking as possible giving himself no time for it He worked continuously keeping his thoughts still on his work when he came home at night and he talked of nothing whatever except his work But he did not sing at it He was often in the streets and people were not allowed to sing in the streets They might make any manner of hideous uproar they could shake buildings they could out thunder the thunder deafen the deaf and kill the sick with noise or they could walk the streets or drive through them bawling squawking or screeching as they chose if the noise was traceably connected with business though street musicians were not tolerated being considered a nuisance and an interference A man or woman who went singing for pleasure through the streets like a crazy Neopolitan would have been stopped and belike locked up for Freedom does not mean that a citizen is allowed to do every outrageous thing that comes into his head The streets were dangerous enough in all conscience without any singing and the Motor Federation issued public warnings declaring that the pedestrian s life was in his own hands and giving directions how to proceed with the least peril However Bibbs Sheridan had no desire to sing in the streets or anywhere He had gone to his work with an energy that for the start at least was bitter and there was no song left in him He began to know his active fellow citizens Here and there among them he found a leisurely kind soul a relic of the old period of neighborliness pioneer stock usually and there were men particularly among the merchants and manufacturers so honest they leaned backward reputations sometimes attested by stories of heroic sacrifices to honor nor were there lacking some instances of generosity even nobler Here and there too were book men in their little leisure and among the Germans music men And these with the others worshiped Bigness and the growth each man serving for his own sake and for what he could get out of it but all united in their faith in the beneficence and glory of their god To almost all alike that service stood as the most important thing in life except on occasion of some such vital brief interregnum as the dangerous illness of a wife or child In the way of relaxation some of the servers took golf some took fishing some took shows a mixture of infantile and negroid humor stockings and tin music some took an occasional debauch some took trips some took cards and some took nothing The high priests were vigilant to watch that no relaxation should affect the service When a man attended to anything outside his business eyes were upon him his credit was in danger that is his life was in danger And the old priests were as ardent as the young ones the million was as eager to be bigger as the thousand seventy was as busy as seventeen They strove mightily against one another and the old priests were the most wary the most plausible and the most dangerous Bibbs learned he must walk charily among these he must wear a thousand eyes and beware of spiders indeed And outside the temple itself were the pretenders the swarming thieves and sharpers and fleecers the sly rascals and the open rascals but these were feeble folk not dangerous once he knew them and he had a good guide to point them out to him They were useful sometimes he learned and many of them served as go betweens in matters where business must touch politics He learned also how breweries and traction companies and banks and other institutions fought one another for the political control of the city The newspapers he discovered had lost their ancient political influence especially with the knowing who looked upon them with a skeptical humor believing the journals either to be retained partisans like lawyers or else striving to forward the personal ambitions of their owners The control of the city lay not with them but was usually obtained by giving the hordes of negroes gin money and by other largesses The revenues of the people were then distributed as fairly as possible among a great number of men who had assisted the winning side Names and titles of offices went with many of the prizes and most of these title holders were expected to present a busy appearance at times and indeed some among them did work honestly and faithfully Bibbs had been very ignorant All these simple things so well known and customary astonished him at first and once in a brief moment of forgetting that he was done with writing he thought that if he had known them and written of them how like a satire the plainest relation of them must have seemed Strangest of all to him was the vehement and sincere patriotism On every side he heard it it was a permeation the newest school child caught it though just from Hungary and learning to stammer a few words of the local language Everywhere the people shouted of the power the size the riches and the growth of their city Not only that they said that the people of their city were the greatest the finest the strongest the Biggest people on earth They cited no authorities and felt the need of none being themselves the people thus celebrated And if the thing was questioned or if it was hinted that there might be one small virtue in which they were not perfect and supreme they wasted no time examining themselves to see if what the critic said was true but fell upon him and hooted him and cursed him for they were sensitive So Bibbs learning their ways and walking with them harkened to the voice of the people and served Bigness with them For the voice of the people is the voice of their god Sheridan had made the room next to his own into an office for Bibbs and the door between the two rooms usually stood open the father had established that intimacy One morning in February when Bibbs was alone Sheridan came in some sheets of typewritten memoranda in his hand Bibbs he said I don t like to butt in very often this way and when I do I usually wish I hadn t but for Heaven s sake what have you been buying that ole busted inter traction stock for Bibbs leaned back from his desk For eleven hundred and fifty five dollars That s all it cost Well it ain t worth eleven hundred and fifty five cents You ought to know that I don t get your idea That stuff s deader n Adam s cat It might be worth something some day How It mightn t be so dead not if we went into it said Bibbs coolly Oh Sheridan considered this musingly then he said Who d you buy it from A broker Fansmith Well he must a got it from one o the crowd o poor ninnies that was soaked with it Don t you know who owned it Yes I do Ain t sayin though That it What s the matter It belonged to mister Vertrees said Bibbs shortly applying himself to his desk So Sheridan gazed down at his son s thin face Excuse me he said Your business And he went back to his own room But presently he looked in again I reckon you won t mind lunchin alone to day he was shuffling himself into his overcoat because I just thought I d go up to the house and get THIS over with mamma He glanced apologetically toward his right hand as it emerged from the sleeve of the overcoat The bandages had been removed finally that morning revealing but three fingers the forefinger and the finger next to it had been amputated She s bound to make an awful fuss and better to spoil her lunch than her dinner I ll be back about two But he calculated the time of his arrival at the New House so accurately that missus Sheridan s lunch was not disturbed and she was rising from the lonely table when he came into the dining room He had left his overcoat in the hall but he kept his hands in his trousers pockets What s the matter papa she asked quickly Has anything gone wrong You ain t sick Me He laughed loudly Me SICK You had lunch Didn t want any to day You can give me a cup o coffee though She rang and told George to have coffee made and when he had withdrawn she said querulously I just know there s something wrong Nothin in the world he responded heartily taking a seat at the head of the table I thought I d talk over a notion o mine with you that s all It s more women folks business than what it is man s anyhow What about Why ole Doc Gurney was up at the office this morning awhile To look at your hand How s he say it s doin Fine Well he went in and sat around with Bibbs awhile missus Sheridan nodded pessimistically I guess it s time you had him too I KNEW Bibbs Now mamma hold your horses I wanted him to look Bibbs over BEFORE anything s the matter You don t suppose I m goin to take any chances with BIBBS do you Well afterwards I shut the door and I an ole Gurney had a talk He s a mighty disagreeable man he rubbed it in on me what he said about Bibbs havin brains if he ever woke up Then I thought he must want to get something out o me he go so flattering for a minute Bibbs couldn t help havin business brains he says bein YOUR son Don t be surprised he says don t be surprised at his makin a success he says He couldn t get over his heredity he couldn t HELP bein a business success once you got him into it It s in his blood Yes sir he says it doesn t need MUCH brains he says an only third rate brains at that he says but it does need a special KIND o brains he says to be a millionaire I mean he says when a man s given a start If nobody gives him a start why course he s got to have luck AND the right kind o brains The only miracle about Bibbs he says is where he got the OTHER kind o brains the brains you made him quit usin and throw away But what d he say about his health missus Sheridan demanded impatiently as George placed a cup of coffee before her husband Sheridan helped himself to cream and sugar and began to sip the coffee I m comin to that he returned placidly See how easy I manage this cup with my left hand mamma You been doin that all winter What did It s wonderful he interrupted admiringly what a fellow can do with his left hand I can sign my name with mine now well s I ever could with my right It came a little hard at first but now honest I believe I RATHER sign with my left That s all I ever have to write anyway just the signature Rest s all dictatin He blew across the top of the cup unctuously Good coffee mamma Well about Bibbs Ole Gurney says he believes if Bibbs could somehow get back to the state o mind he was in about the machine shop that is if he could some way get to feelin about business the way he felt about the shop not the poetry and writin part but He paused supplementing his remarks with a motion of his head toward the old house next door He says Bibbs is older and harder n what he was when he broke down that time and besides he ain t the kind o dreamy way he was then and I should say he AIN T I d like em to show ME anybody his age that s any wider awake But he says Bibbs s health never need bother us again if missus Sheridan shook her head I don t see any help THAT way You know yourself she wouldn t have Jim Who s talkin about her havin anybody But my Lord she might let him LOOK at her She needn t a got so mad just because he asked her that she won t let him come in the house any more He s a mighty funny boy and some ways I reckon he s pretty near as hard to understand as the Bible but Gurney kind o got me in the way o thinkin that if she d let him come back and set around with her an evening or two sometimes not reg lar I don t mean why Well I just thought I d see what YOU D think of it There ain t any way to talk about it to Bibbs himself I don t suppose he d let you anyhow but I thought maybe you could kind o slip over there some day and sort o fix up to have a little talk with her and kind o hint around till you see how the land lays and ask her ME missus Sheridan looked both helpless and frightened No She shook her head decidedly It wouldn t do any good You won t try it I won t risk her turnin me out o the house Some way that s what I believe she did to Sibyl from what Roscoe said once No I CAN T and what s more it d only make things worse If people find out you re runnin after em they think you re cheap and then they won t do as much for you as if you let em alone I don t believe it s any use and I couldn t do it if it was He sighed with resignation All right mamma That s all Then in a livelier tone he said Ole Gurney took the bandages off my hand this morning All healed up Says I don t need em any more Why that s splendid papa she cried beaming I was afraid Let s see She came toward him but he rose still keeping his hand in his pocket Wait a minute he said smiling Now it may give you just a teeny bit of a shock but the fact is well you remember that Sunday when Sibyl came over here and made all that fuss about nothin it was the day after I got tired o that statue when Edith s telegram came Let me see your hand she cried Now wait he said laughing and pushing her away with his left hand The truth is mamma that I kind o slipped out on you that morning when you wasn t lookin and went down to ole Gurney s office he d told me to you see and well it doesn t AMOUNT to anything And he held out for her inspection the mutilated hand You see these days when it s all dictatin anyhow nobody d mind just a couple o He had to jump for her she went over backward For the second time in her life missus Sheridan fainted CHAPTER XXXII It was a full hour later when he left her lying upon a couch in her own room still lamenting intermittently though he assured her with heat that the fuss she was making irked him far more than his physical loss He permitted her to think that he meant to return directly to his office but when he came out to the open air he told the chauffeur in attendance to await him in front of mister Vertrees s house whither he himself proceeded on foot mister Vertrees had taken the sale of half of his worthless stock as manna in the wilderness it came from heaven by what agency he did not particularly question The broker informed him that parties were interested in getting hold of the stock and that later there might be a possible increase in the value of the large amount retained by his client It might go quite a ways up within a year or so he said and he advised sitting tight with it mister Vertrees went home and prayed He rose from his knees feeling that he was surely coming into his own again It was more than a mere gasp of temporary relief with him and his wife shared his optimism but Mary would not let him buy back her piano and as for furs spring was on the way she said But they paid the butcher the baker and the candlestick maker and hired a cook once more It was this servitress who opened the door for Sheridan and presently assured him that Miss Vertrees would be down He was not the man to conceal admiration when he felt it and he flushed and beamed as Mary made her appearance almost upon the heels of the cook She had a look of apprehension for the first fraction of a second but it vanished at the sight of him and its place was taken in her eyes by a soft brilliance while color rushed in her cheeks Don t be surprised he said Truth is in a way it s sort of on business I looked in here It ll only take a minute I expect I m sorry said Mary I hoped you d come because we re neighbors He chuckled Neighbors Sometimes people don t see so much o their neighbors as they used to That is I hear so lately You ll stay long enough to sit down won t you I guess I could manage that much And they sat down facing each other and not far apart Of course it couldn t be called business exactly he said more gravely Not at all I expect But there s something o yours it seemed to me I ought to give you and I just thought it was better to bring it myself and explain how I happened to have it It s this this letter you wrote my boy He extended the letter to her solemnly in his left hand and she took it gently from him It was in his mail after he was hurt You knew he never got it I expect Yes she said in a low voice He sighed I m glad he didn t Not he added quickly not but what you did just right to send it You did You couldn t acted any other way when it came right down TO it There ain t any blame comin to you you were above board all through Mary said Thank you almost in a whisper and with her head bowed low You ll have to excuse me for readin it I had to take charge of all his mail and everything I didn t know the handwritin and I read it all once I got started I m glad you did Well he leaned forward as if to rise I guess that s about all I just thought you ought to have it Thank you for bringing it He looked at her hopefully as if he thought and wished that she might have something more to say But she seemed not to be aware of this glance and sat with her eyes fixed sorrowfully upon the floor Well I expect I better be gettin back to the office he said rising desperately I told I told my partner I d be back at two o clock and I guess he ll think I m a poor business man if he catches me behind time I got to walk the chalk a mighty straight line these days with THAT fellow keepin tabs on me Mary rose with him I ve always heard YOU were the hard driver He guffawed derisively Me I m nothin to that partner o mine You couldn t guess to save your life how he keeps after me to hold up my end o the job I shouldn t be surprised he d give me the grand bounce some day and run the whole circus by himself You know how he is once he goes AT a thing No she smiled I didn t know you had a partner I d always heard He laughed looking away from her It s just my way o speakin o that boy o mine Bibbs He stood then expectant staring out into the hall with an air of careless geniality He felt that she certainly must at least say How IS Bibbs but she said nothing at all though he waited until the silence became embarrassing Well I guess I better be gettin down there he said at last He might worry Good by and thank you said Mary For what For the letter Oh he said blankly You re welcome Good by Mary put out her hand Good by You ll have to excuse my left hand he said I had a little accident to the other one She gave a pitying cry as she saw Oh poor mister Sheridan Nothin at all Dictate everything nowadays anyhow He laughed jovially Did anybody tell you how it happened I heard you hurt your hand but no not just how It was this way he began and both as if unconsciously sat down again You may not know it but I used to worry a good deal about the youngest o my boys the one that used to come to see you sometimes after Jim that is I mean Bibbs He s the one I spoke of as my partner and the truth is that s what it s just about goin to amount to one o these days if his health holds out Well you remember I expect I had him on a machine over at a plant o mine and sometimes I d kind o sneak in there and see how he was gettin along Take a doctor with me sometimes because Bibbs never WAS so robust you might say Ole Doc Gurney I guess maybe you know him Tall thin man acts sleepy Yes Well one day I an ole Doc Gurney we were in there and I undertook to show Bibbs how to run his machine He told me to look out but I wouldn t listen and I didn t look out and that s how I got my hand hurt tryin to show Bibbs how to do something he knew how to do and I didn t Made me so mad I just wouldn t even admit to myself it WAS hurt and so by and by ole Doc Gurney had to take kind o radical measures with me He s a right good doctor too Don t you think so Miss Vertrees Yes Yes he is so Sheridan now had the air of a rambling talker and gossip with all day on his hands Take him on Bibbs s case I was talkin about Bibbs s case with him this morning Well you d laugh to hear the way ole Gurney talks about THAT Course he IS just as much a friend as he is doctor and he takes as much interest in Bibbs as if he was in the family He says Bibbs isn t anyways bad off YET and he thinks he could stand the pace and get fat on it if well this is what d made YOU laugh if you d been there Miss Vertrees honest it would He paused to chuckle and stole a glance at her She was gazing straight before her at the wall her lips were parted and visibly she was breathing heavily and quickly He feared that she was growing furiously angry but he had led to what he wanted to say and he went on determined now to say it all He leaned forward and altered his voice to one of confidential friendliness though in it he still maintained a tone which indicated that ole Doc Gurney s opinion was only a joke he shared with her Yes sir you certainly would a laughed Why that ole man thinks YOU got something to do with it You ll have to blame it on him young lady if it makes you feel like startin out to whip somebody He s actually got THIS theory he says Bibbs got to gettin better while he worked over there at the shop because you kept him cheered up and feelin good And he says if you could manage to just stand him hangin around a little maybe not much but just SOMEtimes again he believed it d do Bibbs a mighty lot o good Course that s only what the doctor said Me I don t know anything about that but I can say this much I never saw any such a MENTAL improvement in anybody in my life as I have lately in Bibbs I expect you d find him a good deal more entertaining than what he used to be and I know it s a kind of embarrassing thing to suggest after the way he piled in over here that day to ask you to stand up before the preacher with him but accordin to ole Doc GURNEY he s got you on his brain so bad Mary jumped mister Sheridan she exclaimed He sighed profoundly There I noticed you were gettin mad I didn t No no no she cried But I don t understand and I think you don t What is it you want me to do He sighed again but this time with relief Well well he said You re right It ll be easier to talk plain I ought to known I could with you all the time I just hoped you d let that boy come and see you sometimes once more Could you You don t understand She clasped her hands together in a sorrowful gesture Yes we must talk plain Bibbs heard that I d tried to make your oldest son care for me because I was poor and so Bibbs came and asked me to marry him because he was sorry for me And I CAN T see him any more she cried in distress I CAN T Sheridan cleared his throat uncomfortably You mean because he thought that about you No no What he thought was TRUE Well you mean he was so much in you mean he thought so much of you The words were inconceivably awkward upon Sheridan s tongue he seemed to be in doubt even about pronouncing them but after a ghastly pause he bravely repeated them You mean he thought so much of you that you just couldn t stand him around NO He was sorry for me He cared for me he was fond of me and he d respected me too much In the finest way he loved me if you like and he d have done anything on earth for me as I would for him and as he knew I would It was beautiful mister Sheridan she said But the cheap bad things one has done seem always to come back they wait and pull you down when you re happiest Bibbs found me out you see and he wasn t in love with me at all He wasn t Well it seems to me he gave up everything he wanted to do it was fool stuff but he certainly wanted it mighty bad he just threw it away and walked right up and took the job he swore he never would just for you And it looks to me as if a man that d do that must think quite a heap o the girl he does it for You say it was only because he was sorry but let me tell you there s only ONE girl he could feel THAT sorry for Yes sir No no she said Bibbs isn t like other men he would do anything for anybody Sheridan grinned Perhaps not so much as you think nowadays he said For instance I got kind of a suspicion he doesn t believe in sentiment in business But that s neither here nor there What he wanted was just plain and simple for you to marry him Well I was afraid his thinkin so much OF you had kind o sickened you of him the way it does sometimes But from the way you talk I understand that ain t the trouble He coughed and his voice trembled a little Now here Miss Vertrees I don t have to tell you because you see things easy I know I got no business comin to you like this but I had to make Bibbs go my way instead of his own I had to do it for the sake o my business and on his own account too and I expect you got some idea how it hurt him to give up Well he s made good He didn t come in half hearted or mean he came in all the way But there isn t anything in it to him you can see he s just shut his teeth on it and goin ahead with dust in his mouth You see one way of lookin at it he s got nothin to work FOR And it seems to me like it cost him your friendship and I believe honest that s what hurt him the worst Now you said we d talk plain Why can t you let him come back She covered her face desperately with her hands I can t He rose defeated and looking it Well I mustn t press you he said gently At that she cried out and dropped her hands and let him see her face Ah He was only sorry for me He gazed at her intently Mary was proud but she had a fatal honesty and it confessed the truth of her now she was helpless It was so clear that even Sheridan marveling and amazed was able to see it Then a change came over him gloom fell from him and he grew radiant Don t Don t she cried You mustn t I won t tell him said Sheridan from the doorway I won t tell anybody anything CHAPTER XXXIII There was a heavy town fog that afternoon a smoke mist densest in the sanctuary of the temple The people went about in it busy and dirty thickening their outside and inside linings of coal tar asphalt sulphurous acid oil of vitriol and the other familiar things the men liked to breathe and to have upon their skins and garments and upon their wives and babies and sweethearts The growth of the city was visible in the smoke and the noise and the rush There was more smoke than there had been this day of February a year earlier there was more noise and the crowds were thicker yet quicker in spite of that The traffic policeman had a hard time for the people were independent they retained some habits of the old market town period and would cross the street anywhere and anyhow which not only got them killed more frequently than if they clung to the legal crossings but kept the motormen the chauffeurs and the truck drivers in a stew of profane nervousness So the traffic policemen led harried lives they themselves were killed of course with a certain periodicity but their main trouble was that they could not make the citizens realize that it was actually and mortally perilous to go about their city It was strange for there were probably no citizens of any length of residence who had not personally known either some one who had been killed or injured in an accident or some one who had accidentally killed or injured others And yet perhaps it was not strange seeing the sharp preoccupation of the faces the people had something on their minds they could not stop to bother about dirt and danger Mary Vertrees was not often down town she had never seen an accident until this afternoon She had come upon errands for her mother connected with a timorous refurbishment and as she did these in and out of the department stores she had an insistent consciousness of the Sheridan Building From the street anywhere it was almost always in sight like some monstrous geometrical shadow murk colored and rising limitlessly into the swimming heights of the smoke mist It was gaunt and grimy and repellent it had nothing but strength and size but in that consciousness of Mary s the great structure may have partaken of beauty Sheridan had made some of the things he said emphatic enough to remain with her She went over and over them and they began to seem true Only ONE girl he could feel THAT sorry for Gurney says he s got you on his brain so bad The man s clumsy talk began to sing in her heart The song was begun there when she saw the accident She was directly opposite the Sheridan Building then waiting for the traffic to thin before she crossed though other people were risking the passage darting and halting and dodging parlously Two men came from the crowd behind her talking earnestly and started across Both wore black one was tall and broad and thick and the other was taller but noticeably slender And Mary caught her breath for they were Bibbs and his father They did not see her and she caught a phrase in Bibbs s mellow voice which had taken a crisper ring Sixty eight thousand dollars Not sixty eight thousand buttons It startled her queerly and as there was a glimpse of his profile she saw for the first time a resemblance to his father She watched them In the middle of the street Bibbs had to step ahead of his father and the two were separated But the reckless passing of a truck beyond the second line of rails frightened a group of country women who were in course of passage they were just in front of Bibbs and shoved backward upon him violently To extricate himself from them he stepped back directly in front of a moving trolley car no place for absent mindedness but Bibbs was still absorbed in thoughts concerned with what he had been saying to his father There were shrieks and yells Bibbs looked the wrong way and then Mary saw the heavy figure of Sheridan plunge straight forward in front of the car With absolute disregard of his own life he hurled himself at Bibbs like a football player shunting off an opponent and to Mary it seemed that they both went down together But that was all she could see automobiles trucks and wagons closed in between She made out that the trolley car stopped jerkily and she saw a policeman breaking his way through the instantly condensing crowd while the traffic came to a standstill and people stood up in automobiles or climbed upon the hubs and tires of wheels not to miss a chance of seeing anything horrible Mary tried to get through it was impossible Other policemen came to help the first and in a minute or two the traffic was in motion again The crowd became pliant dispersing there was no figure upon the ground and no ambulance came But one of the policemen was detained by the clinging and beseeching of a gloved hand What IS the matter lady Where are they Mary cried Who Ole man Sheridan I reckon HE wasn t much hurt His SON Was that who the other one was I seen him knock him oh he s not bad off I guess lady The ole man got him out of the way all right The fender shoved the ole man around some but I reckon he only got shook up They both went on in the Sheridan Building without any help Excuse me lady Sheridan and Bibbs in fact were at that moment in the elevator ascending Whisk broom up in the office Sheridan was saying You got to look out on those corners nowadays I tell you I don t know I got any call to blow though because I tried to cross after you did That s how I happened to run into you Well you want to remember to look out after this We were talkin about Murtrie s askin sixty eight thousand flat for that ninety nine year lease It s his lookout if he d rather take it that way and I don t know but No said Bibbs emphatically as the elevator stopped he won t get it Not from us he won t and I ll show you why I can convince you in five minutes He followed his father into the office anteroom and convinced him Then having been diligently brushed by a youth of color Bibbs went into his own room and closed the door He was more shaken than he had allowed his father to perceive and his side was sore where Sheridan had struck him He desired to be alone he wanted to rub himself and for once to do some useless thinking again He knew that his father had not happened to run into him he knew that Sheridan had instantly and instinctively proved that he held his own life of no account whatever compared to that of his son and heir Bibbs had been unable to speak of that or to seem to know it for Sheridan just as instinctively had swept the matter aside as of no importance since all was well reverting immediately to business Bibbs began to think intently of his father He perceived as he had never perceived before the shadowing of something enormous and indomitable and lawless not to be daunted by the will of nature s very self laughing at the lightning and at wounds and mutilation conquering irresistible and blindly noble For the first time in his life Bibbs began to understand the meaning of being truly this man s son He would be the more truly his son henceforth though as Sheridan said Bibbs had not come down town with him meanly or half heartedly He had given his word because he had wanted the money simply for Mary Vertrees in her need And he shivered with horror of himself thinking how he had gone to her to offer it asking her to marry him with his head on his breast in shameful fear that she would accept him He had not known her the knowing had lost her to him and this had been his real awakening for he knew now how deep had been that slumber wherein he dreamily celebrated the superiority of friendship The sleep walker had wakened to bitter knowledge of love and life finding himself a failure in both He had made a burnt offering of his dreams and the sacrifice had been an unforgivable hurt to Mary All that was left for him was the work he had not chosen but at least he would not fail in that though it was indeed no more than dust in his mouth If there had been anything to work for He went to the window raised it and let in the uproar of the streets below He looked down at the blurred hurrying swarms and he looked across over the roofs with their panting jets of vapor into the vast foggy heart of the smoke Dizzy traceries of steel were rising dimly against it chattering with steel on steel and screeching in steam while tiny figures of men walked on threads in the dull sky Buildings would overtop the Sheridan Bigness was being served But what for The old question came to Bibbs with a new despair Here where his eyes fell had once been green fields and running brooks and how had the kind earth been despoiled and disfigured The pioneers had begun the work but in their old age their orators had said for them that they had toiled and risked and sacrificed that their posterity might live in peace and wisdom enjoying the fruits of the earth Well their posterity was here and there was only turmoil Where was the promised land It had been promised by the soldiers of all the wars it had been promised to this generation by the pioneers but here was the very posterity to whom it had been promised toiling and risking and sacrificing in turn for what The harsh roar of the city came in through the open window continuously beating upon Bibbs s ear until he began to distinguish a pulsation in it a broken and irregular cadence It seemed to him that it was like a titanic voice discordant hoarse rustily metallic the voice of the god Bigness And the voice summoned Bibbs as it summoned all its servants Come and work it seemed to yell Come and work for Me all men By your youth and your hope I summon you By your age and your despair I summon you to work for Me yet a little with what strength you have By your love of home I summon you By your love of woman I summon you By your hope of children I summon you You shall be blind slaves of Mine blind to everything but Me your Master and Driver For your reward you shall gaze only upon my ugliness You shall give your toil and your lives you shall go mad for love and worship of my ugliness You shall perish still worshipping Me and your children shall perish knowing no other god And then as Bibbs closed the window down tight he heard his father s voice booming in the next room he could not distinguish the words but the tone was exultant and there came the THUMP THUMP of the maimed hand Bibbs guessed that Sheridan was bragging of the city and of Bigness to some visitor from out of town And he thought how truly Sheridan was the high priest of Bigness But with the old old thought again What for Bibbs caught a glimmer of far faint light He saw that Sheridan had all his life struggled and conquered and must all his life go on struggling and inevitably conquering as part of a vast impulse not his own Sheridan served blindly but was the impulse blind Bibbs asked himself if it was not he who had been in the greater hurry after all The kiln must be fired before the vase is glazed and the Acropolis was not crowned with marble in a day Then the voice came to him again but there was a strain in it as of some high music struggling to be born of the turmoil Ugly I am it seemed to say to him but never forget that I AM a god And the voice grew in sonorousness and in dignity The highest should serve but so long as you worship me for my own sake I will not serve you It is man who makes me ugly by his worship of me If man would let me serve him I should be beautiful Looking once more from the window Bibbs sculptured for himself in the vague contortions of the smoke and fog above the roofs a gigantic figure with feet pedestaled upon the great buildings and shoulders disappearing in the clouds a colossus of steel and wholly blackened with soot But Bibbs carried his fancy further for there was still a little poet lingering in the back of his head and he thought that up over the clouds unseen from below the giant labored with his hands in the clean sunshine and Bibbs had a glimpse of what he made there perhaps for a fellowship of the children of the children that were children now a noble and joyous city unbelievably white It was the telephone that called him from his vision It rang fiercely He lifted the thing from his desk and answered and as the small voice inside it spoke he dropped the receiver with a crash He trembled violently as he picked it up but he told himself he was wrong he had been mistaken yet it was a startlingly beautiful voice startlingly kind too and ineffably like the one he hungered most to hear Who he said his own voice shaking like his hand Mary He responded with two hushed and incredulous words IS IT There was a little thrill of pathetic half laughter in the instrument Bibbs I wanted to just to see if you Yes Mary I was looking when you were so nearly run over I saw it Bibbs They said you hadn t been hurt they thought but I wanted to know for myself No no I wasn t hurt at all Mary It was father who came nearer it He saved me Yes I saw but you had fallen I couldn t get through the crowd until you had gone And I wanted to KNOW Mary would you have minded he said There was a long interval before she answered Yes Then why Yes Bibbs I don t know what to say he cried It s so wonderful to hear your voice again I m shaking Mary I I don t know I don t know anything except that I AM talking to you It IS you Mary Yes Bibbs Mary I ve seen you from my window at home only five times since I since then You looked oh how can I tell you It was like a man chained in a cave catching a glimpse of the blue sky Mary Mary won t you let me see you again near I think I could make you really forgive me you d have to I DID then No not really or you wouldn t have said you couldn t see me any more That wasn t the reason The voice was very low Mary he said even more tremulously than before I can t you COULDN T mean it was because you can t mean it was because you care There was no answer Mary he called huskily If you mean THAT you d let me see you wouldn t you And now the voice was so low he could not be sure it spoke at all but if it did the words were Yes Bibbs dear But the voice was not in the instrument it was so gentle and so light so almost nothing it seemed to be made of air and it came from the air Slowly and incredulously he turned and glory fell upon his shining eyes The door of his father s room had opened Mary stood upon the threshold THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Turmoil by Booth
