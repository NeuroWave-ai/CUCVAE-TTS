dismissed the hireling who had brought her automobile around from the garage and seated herself at the wheel It was her habit to refresh her mind and improve her health by a daily drive between the hours of two and four in the afternoon The world knows little of its greatest women and it is possible that missus Porter s name is not familiar to you If this is the case I am pained but not surprised It happens only too often that the uplifter of the public mind is baulked by a disinclination on the part of the public mind to meet him or her half way The uplifter does his share He produces the uplifting book But the public instead of standing still to be uplifted wanders off to browse on coloured supplements and magazine stories If you are ignorant of Lora Delane Porter s books that is your affair Perhaps you are more to be pitied than censured Nature probably gave you the wrong shape of forehead missus Porter herself would have put it down to some atavistic tendency or pre natal influence She put most things down to that She blamed nearly all the defects of the modern world from weak intellects to in growing toe nails on long dead ladies and gentlemen who safe in the family vault imagined that they had established their alibi She subpoenaed grandfathers and even great grandfathers to give evidence to show that the reason Twentieth Century Willie squinted or had to spend his winters in Arizona was their own shocking health way back in the days beyond recall missus Porter s mind worked backward and forward She had one eye on the past the other on the future If she was strong on heredity she was stronger on the future of the race Most of her published works dealt with this subject A careful perusal of them would have enabled the rising generation to select its ideal wife or husband with perfect ease and in the event of Heaven blessing the union her little volume entitled The Hygienic Care of the Baby which was all about germs and how to avoid them would have insured the continuance of the direct succession Unfortunately the rising generation did not seem disposed to a careful perusal of anything except the baseball scores and the beauty hints in the Sunday papers and missus Porter s public was small In fact her only real disciple as she sometimes told herself in her rare moods of discouragement was her niece Ruth Bannister daughter of John Bannister the millionaire It was not so long ago she reflected with pride that she had induced Ruth to refuse to marry Basil Milbank a considerable feat he being a young man of remarkable personal attractions and a great match in every way missus Porter s objection to him was that his father had died believing to the last that he was a teapot There is nothing evil or degrading in believing oneself a teapot but it argues a certain inaccuracy of the thought processes and missus Porter had used all her influence with Ruth to make her reject Basil It was her success that first showed her how great that influence was She had come now to look on Ruth s destiny as something for which she was personally responsible a fact which was noted and resented by others in particular Ruth s brother Bailey who regarded his aunt with a dislike and suspicion akin to that which a stray dog feels towards the boy who saunters towards him with a tin can in his hand To Bailey his strong minded relative was a perpetual menace a sort of perambulating yellow peril and the fact that she often alluded to him as a worm consolidated his distaste for her missus Porter released the clutch and set out on her drive She rarely had a settled route for these outings of hers preferring to zigzag about New York livening up the great city at random She always drove herself and having like a good suffragist a contempt for male prohibitions took an honest pleasure in exceeding a man made speed limit One hesitates to apply the term joy rider to so eminent a leader of contemporary thought as the authoress of The Dawn of Better Things Principles of Selection and What of To morrow but candour compels the admission that she was a somewhat reckless driver Perhaps it was due to some atavistic tendency One of her ancestors may have been a Roman charioteer or a coach racing maniac of the Regency days At any rate after a hard morning s work on her new book she felt that her mind needed cooling and found that the rush of air against her face effected this satisfactorily The greater the rush the quicker the cooling However as the alert inhabitants of Manhattan Island a hardy race trained from infancy to dodge taxicabs and ambulance wagons had always removed themselves from her path with their usual agility she had never yet had an accident But then she had never yet met George Pennicut And George pawn of fate was even now waiting round the corner to upset her record George man of all work to Kirk Winfield one of the youngest and least efficient of New York s artist colony was English He had been in America some little time but not long enough to accustom his rather unreceptive mind to the fact that whereas in his native land vehicles kept to the left in the country of his adoption they kept to the right and it was still his bone headed practice when stepping off the sidewalk to keep a wary look out in precisely the wrong direction The only problem with regard to such a man is who will get him first Fate had decided that it should be Lora Delane Porter To day missus Porter having circled the park in rapid time turned her car down Central Park West She was feeling much refreshed by the pleasant air She was conscious of a glow of benevolence toward her species not excluding even the young couple she had almost reduced to mincemeat in the neighbourhood of Ninety Seventh Street They had annoyed her extremely at the time of their meeting by occupying till the last possible moment a part of the road which she wanted herself On reaching Sixty First Street she found her way blocked by a lumbering delivery wagon She followed it slowly for a while then growing tired of being merely a unit in a procession tugged at the steering wheel and turned to the right George Pennicut his anxious eyes raking the middle distance as usual in the wrong direction had just stepped off the kerb He received the automobile in the small of the back uttered a yell of surprise and dismay performed a few improvised Texas Tommy steps and fell in a heap In a situation which might have stimulated another to fervid speech George Pennicut contented himself with saying Goo He was a man of few words missus Porter stopped the car From all points of the compass citizens began to assemble many swallowing their chewing gum in their excitement One a devout believer in the inscrutable ways of Providence told a friend as he ran that only two minutes before he had almost robbed himself of this spectacle by going into a moving picture palace missus Porter was annoyed She had never run over anything before except a few chickens and she regarded the incident as a blot on her escutcheon She was incensed with this idiot who had flung himself before her car not reflecting in her heat that he probably had a pre natal tendency to this sort of thing inherited from some ancestor who had played last across in front of hansom cabs in the streets of London She bent over George and passed experienced hands over his portly form For this remarkable woman was as competent at first aid as at anything else The citizens gathered silently round in a circle It was your fault she said to her victim severely I accept no liability whatever I did not run into you You ran into me I have a jolly good mind to have you arrested for attempted suicide This aspect of the affair had not struck mister Pennicut Presented to him in these simple words it checked the recriminatory speech which his mind having recovered to some extent from the first shock of the meeting he had intended to deliver He swallowed his words awed He felt dazed and helpless missus Porter had that effect upon men Some more citizens arrived No bones broken reported missus Porter concluding her examination You are exceedingly fortunate You have a few bruises and one knee is slightly wrenched Nothing to signify More frightened than hurt Where do you live There said George meekly Where Them studios No ninety Yes ma am George s voice was that of a crushed worm Are you an artist No ma am I m mister Winfield s man Whose mister Winfield s ma am Is he in Yes ma am I ll fetch him And if the policeman comes along and wants to know why you re lying there mind you tell him the truth that you ran into me Yes ma am Very well Don t forget No ma am She crossed the street and rang the bell over which was a card hearing the name of Kirk Winfield mister Pennicut watched her in silence missus Porter pressed the button a second time Somebody came at a leisurely pace down the passage whistling cheerfully The door opened It did not often happen to Lora Delane Porter to feel insignificant least of all in the presence of the opposite sex She had well defined views upon man Yet in the interval which elapsed between the opening of the door and her first words a certain sensation of smallness overcame her The man who had opened the door was not judged by any standard of regularity of features handsome He had a rather boyish face pleasant eyes set wide apart and a friendly mouth He was rather an outsize in young men and as he stood there he seemed to fill the doorway It was this sense of bigness that he conveyed his cleanness his magnificent fitness that for the moment overcame missus Porter Physical fitness was her gospel She stared at him in silent appreciation To the young man however her forceful gaze did not convey this quality She seemed to him to be looking as if she had caught him in the act of endeavouring to snatch her purse He had been thrown a little off his balance by the encounter Resource in moments of crisis is largely a matter of preparedness and a man who having opened his door in the expectation of seeing a ginger haired bow legged grinning George Pennicut is confronted by a masterful woman with eyes like gimlets may be excused for not guessing that her piercing stare is an expression of admiration and respect missus Porter broke the silence It was ever her way to come swiftly to the matter in hand mister Kirk Winfield Yes Have you in your employment a red haired congenital idiot who ambles about New York in an absent minded way as if he were on a desert island The man I refer to is a short stout Englishman clean shaven dressed in black That sounds like George Pennicut I have no doubt that that is his name I did not inquire It did not interest me My name is missus Lora Delane Porter This man of yours has just run into my automobile I beg your pardon I cannot put it more lucidly I was driving along the street when this weak minded person flung himself in front of my car He is out there now Kindly come and help him in Is he hurt More frightened than hurt I have examined him His left knee appears to be slightly wrenched Kirk Winfield passed a hand over his left forehead and followed her Like George he found missus Porter a trifle overwhelming Out in the street George Pennicut now the centre of quite a substantial section of the Four Million was causing a granite faced policeman to think that the age of miracles had returned by informing him that the accident had been his fault and no other s He greeted the relief party with a wan grin Just broke my leg sir he announced to Kirk You have done nothing of the sort said missus Porter You have wrenched your knee very slightly Have you explained to the policeman that it was entirely your fault Yes ma am That s right Always speak the truth Yes ma am mister Winfield will help you indoors Thank you ma am She turned to Kirk Now mister Winfield Kirk bent over the victim gripped him and lifted him like a baby He s got his observed one interested spectator I should worry agreed another All broken up Nothing of the kind said missus Porter severely The man is hardly hurt at all Be more accurate in your remarks She eyed the speaker sternly He wilted Yes ma am he mumbled sheepishly The policeman with that lionlike courage which makes the New York constabulary what it is endeavoured to assert himself at this point Hey he boomed missus Porter turned her gaze upon him her cold steely gaze I beg your pardon This won t do ma am I ve me report to make How did this happen You have already been informed The man ran into my automobile But I shall not charge him She turned and followed Kirk But say The policeman s voice was now almost plaintive missus Porter ignored him and disappeared into the house The policeman having gulped several times in a disconsolate way relieved his feelings by dispersing the crowd with well directed prods of his locust stick A small boy who lingered squeezing the automobile s hooter in a sort of trance he kicked The boy vanished The crowd melted The policeman walked slowly toward Ninth Avenue Peace reigned in the street Put him to bed said missus Porter as Kirk laid his burden on a couch in the studio You seem exceedingly muscular mister Winfield I noticed that you carried him without an effort He is a stout man too Grossly out of condition like ninety nine per cent of men to day I m not so young as I was ma am protested George When I was in the harmy I was a fine figure of a man The more shame to you that you have allowed yourself to deteriorate commented missus Porter Beer A grateful smile irradiated George s face Thank you ma am It s very kind of you ma am I don t mind if I do The man appears a perfect imbecile said missus Porter turning abruptly to Kirk I ask him if he attributes his physical decay to beer and he babbles I think he thought you were offering him a drink suggested Kirk As a matter of fact a little brandy wouldn t hurt him after the shock he has had On no account The worst thing possible This isn t your lucky day George said Kirk Well I guess I ll phone to the doctor Quite unnecessary I beg your pardon Entirely unnecessary I have made an examination There is practically nothing the matter with the man Put him to bed and let him sponge his knee with warm water Are you a doctor missus Porter I have studied first aid Well I think if you don t mind I should like to have your opinion confirmed This was rank mutiny missus Porter stared haughtily at Kirk He met her gaze with determination As you please she snapped Thank you said Kirk I don t want to take any risks with George I couldn t afford to lose him There aren t any more like him they ve mislaid the pattern He went to the telephone missus Porter watched him narrowly She was more than ever impressed by the perfection of his physique She appraised his voice as he spoke to the doctor It gave evidence of excellent lungs He was a wonderfully perfect physical specimen An idea concerning this young man came into her mind startling as all great ideas are at birth The older it grew the more she approved of it She decided to put a few questions to him She had a habit of questioning people and it never occurred to her that they might resent it If it had occurred to her she would have done it just the same She was like that mister Winfield Yes I should like to ask you a few questions This woman delighted Kirk Please do he said missus Porter scanned him closely You are an extraordinarily healthy man to all appearances Have you ever suffered from bad health Measles Immaterial Very unpleasant though Nothing else Mumps Unimportant Not to me I looked like a water melon Nothing besides No serious illnesses None What is your age Twenty five Are your parents living No Were they healthy Fit as fiddles And your grandparents Perfect bear cats I remember my grandfather at the age of about a hundred or something like that spanking me for breaking his pipe I thought it was a steam hammer He was a wonderfully muscular old gentleman Excellent By the way said Kirk casually my life is insured Very sensible There has been no serious illness in your family at all then as far as you know I could hunt up the records if you like but I don t think so Consumption No Cancer No As far as you are aware nothing Very satisfactory I m glad you re pleased Are you married Good Lord no At your age you should be With your magnificent physique and remarkable record of health it is your duty to the future of the race to marry I m not sure I ve been worrying much about the future of the race No man does It is the crying evil of the day men s selfish absorption in the present their utter lack of a sense of duty with regard to the future Have you read my Dawn of Better Things I m afraid I read very few novels It is not a novel It is a treatise on the need for implanting a sense of personal duty to the future of the race in the modern young man It sounds a crackerjack I must get it I will send you a copy At the same time I will send you my Principles of Selection and What of To morrow They will make you think I bet they will Thank you very much And now said missus Porter switching the conversation to the gaping George you had better put this man to bed George Pennicut s opinion of missus Porter to which he was destined to adhere on closer acquaintance may be recorded A hawful woman sir he whispered as Kirk bore him off Nonsense George said Kirk One of the most entertaining ladies I have ever met Already I love her like a son But how she escaped from Bloomingdale beats me There s been carelessness somewhere The bedrooms attached to the studio opened off the gallery that ran the length of the east wall Looking over the edge of the gallery before coming downstairs Kirk perceived his visitor engaged in a tour of the studio At that moment she was examining his masterpiece Ariadne in Naxos He had called it that because that was what it had turned into At the beginning he had had no definite opinion as to its identity It was rather a habit with his pictures to start out in a vague spirit of adventure and receive their label on completion He had an airy and a dashing way in his dealings with the goddess Art Nevertheless he had sufficient of the artist soul to resent the fact that missus Porter was standing a great deal too close to the masterpiece to get its full value You want to stand back a little he suggested over the rail missus Porter looked up Oh there you are she said Yes here I am agreed Kirk affably Is this yours It is You painted it I did It is poor It shows a certain feeling for colour but the drawing is weak said missus Porter For this wonderful woman was as competent at art criticism as at automobile driving and first aid Where did you study In Paris if you could call it studying I m afraid I was not the model pupil Kindly come down You are giving me a crick in the neck Kirk descended He found missus Porter still regarding the masterpiece with an unfavourable eye Yes she said the drawing is decidedly weak I shouldn t wonder assented Kirk The dealers to whom I ve tried to sell it have not said that in so many words but they ve all begged me with tears in their eyes to take the darned thing away so I guess you re right Do you depend for a living on the sale of your pictures Thank Heaven no I m the only artist in captivity with a private income A large income Tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve All told about five thousand iron men per annum Iron men Bones Bones I should have said dollars You should I detest slang Sorry said Kirk missus Porter resumed her tour of the studio She was interrupted by the arrival of the doctor a cheerful little old man with the bearing of one sure of his welcome He was an old friend of Kirk s Well what s the trouble I couldn t come sooner I was visiting a case I work There is no trouble said missus Porter The doctor spun round startled In the dimness of the studio he had not perceived her mister Winfield s servant has injured his knee very superficially There is practically nothing wrong with him I have made a thorough examination The doctor looked from one to the other Is the case in other hands he asked You bet it isn t said Kirk missus Porter just looked in for a family chat and a glimpse of my pictures You ll find George in bed first floor on the left upstairs and a very remarkable sight he is He is wearing red hair with purple pyjamas Why go abroad when you have not yet seen the wonders of your native land That night Lora Delane Porter wrote in the diary which with that magnificent freedom from human weakness that marked every aspect of her life she kept all the year round instead of only during the first week in January This is what she wrote Worked steadily on my book It progresses In the afternoon an annoying occurrence An imbecile with red hair placed himself in front of my automobile fortunately without serious injury to the machine though the sudden application of the brake cannot be good for the tyres Out of evil however came good for I have made the acquaintance of his employer a mister Winfield an artist mister Winfield is a man of remarkable physique I questioned him narrowly and he appears thoroughly sound As to his mental attainments I cannot speak so highly but all men are fools and mister Winfield is not more so than most I have decided that he shall marry my dear Ruth They will make a magnificent pair Chapter II Ruth States Her Intentions At about the time when Lora Delane Porter was cross examining Kirk Winfield Bailey Bannister left his club hurriedly Inside the club a sad rabbit faced young gentleman who had been unburdening his soul to Bailey was seeking further consolation in an amber drink with a cherry at the bottom of it For this young man was one of nature s cherry chasers It was the only thing he did really well His name was Grayling his height five feet three his socks pink and his income enormous So much for Grayling He is of absolutely no importance either to the world or to this narrative except in so far that the painful story he has been unfolding to Bailey Bannister has so wrought upon that exquisite as to send him galloping up Fifth Avenue at five miles an hour in search of his sister Ruth Let us now examine Bailey He is a faultlessly dressed young man of about twenty seven who takes it as a compliment when people think him older His mouth at present gaping with agitation and the unwonted exercise is as a rule primly closed His eyes peering through gold rimmed glasses protrude slightly giving him something of the dumb pathos of a codfish His hair is pale and scanty his nose sharp and narrow He is a junior partner in the firm of Bannister Son and it is his unalterable conviction that if his father would only give him a chance he could show Wall Street some high finance that would astonish it The afternoon was warm The sun beat down on the avenue Bailey had not gone two blocks before it occurred to him that swifter and more comfortable progress could be made in a taxicab than on his admirably trousered legs No more significant proof of the magnitude of his agitation could be brought forward than the fact that he had so far forgotten himself as to walk at all He hailed a cab and gave the address of a house on the upper avenue He leaned back against the cushions trying to achieve a coolness of mind and body But the heat of the day kept him unpleasantly soluble and dismay that perspiration of the soul refused to be absorbed by the pocket handkerchief of philosophy Bailey Bannister was a young man who considered the minding of other people s business a duty not to be shirked Life is a rocky road for such His motto was Let me do it He fussed about the affairs of Bannister Son he fussed about the welfare of his friends at the club especially he fussed about his only sister Ruth He looked on himself as a sort of guardian to Ruth Their mother had died when they were children and old mister Bannister was indifferently equipped with the paternal instinct He was absorbed body and soul in the business of the firm He lived practically a hermit life in the great house on Fifth Avenue and if it had not been for Bailey so Bailey considered Ruth would have been allowed to do just whatever she pleased There were those who said that this was precisely what she did despite Brother Bailey It is a hard world for a conscientious young man of twenty seven Bailey paid the cab and went into the house It was deliciously cool in the hall and for a moment peace descended on him But the distant sound of a piano in the upper regions ejected it again by reminding him of his mission He bounded up the stairs and knocked at the door of his sister s private den The piano stopped as he entered and the girl on the music stool glanced over her shoulder Well Bailey she said you look warm I am warm said Bailey in an aggrieved tone He sat down solemnly I want to speak to you Ruth Ruth shut the piano and caused the music stool to revolve till she faced him Well she said Ruth Bannister was an extraordinarily beautiful girl a daughter of the gods divinely tall and most divinely fair From her mother she had inherited the dark eyes and ivory complexion which went so well with her mass of dark hair from her father a chin of peculiar determination and perfect teeth Her body was strong and supple She radiated health To her friends Ruth was a source of perplexity It was difficult to understand her In the set in which she moved girls married young yet season followed season and Ruth remained single and this so obviously of her own free will that the usual explanation of such a state of things broke down as soon as it was tested In shoals during her first two seasons and lately with less unanimity men of every condition from a prince somewhat battered but still a prince to the Bannisters English butler a good man but at the moment under the influence of tawny port had laid their hearts at her feet One and all they had been compelled to pick them up and take them elsewhere She was generally kind on these occasions but always very firm The determined chin gave no hope that she might yield to importunity The eyes that backed up the message of the chin were pleasant but inflexible Generally it was with a feeling akin to relief that the rejected when time had begun to heal the wound contemplated their position There was something about this girl they decided which no fellow could understand she frightened them she made them feel that their hands were large and red and their minds weak and empty She was waiting for something What it was they did not know but it was plain that they were not it and off they went to live happily ever after with girls who ate candy and read best sellers And Ruth went on her way cool and watchful and mysterious waiting The room which Ruth had taken for her own gave like all rooms when intelligently considered a clue to the character of its owner It was the only room in the house furnished with any taste or simplicity The furniture was exceedingly expensive but did not look so The key note of the colour scheme was green and white All round the walls were books Except for a few prints there were no pictures and the only photograph visible stood in a silver frame on a little table It was the portrait of a woman of about fifty square jawed tight lipped who stared almost threateningly out of the frame exceedingly handsome but to the ordinary male too formidable to be attractive On this was written in a bold hand bristling with emphatic down strokes and wholly free from feminine flourish To my dear Ruth from her Aunt Lora And below the signature in what printers call quotes a line that was evidently an extract from somebody s published works Bear the torch and do not falter Bailey inspected this photograph with disfavour It always irritated him The information conveyed to him by amused friends that his Aunt Lora had once described Ruth as a jewel in a dust bin seemed to him to carry an offensive innuendo directed at himself and the rest of the dwellers in the Bannister home Also she had called him a worm Also again his actual encounters with the lady though few had been memorably unpleasant Furthermore he considered that she had far too great an influence on Ruth And lastly that infernal sentence about the torch which he found perfectly meaningless had a habit of running in his head like a catch phrase causing him the keenest annoyance He pursed his lips disapprovingly and averted his eyes Don t sniff at Aunt Lora Bailey said Ruth I ve had to speak to you about that before What s the matter What has sent you flying up here I have had a shock said Bailey I have been very greatly disturbed I have just been speaking to Clarence Grayling He eyed her accusingly through his gold rimmed glasses She remained tranquil And what had Clarence to say A great many things I gather he told you I had refused him If it were only that Ruth rapped the piano sharply Bailey she said wake up Either get to the point or go or read a book or do some tatting or talk about something else You know perfectly well that I absolutely refuse to endure your impressive manner I believe when people ask you the time you look pained and important and make a mystery of it What s troubling you I should have thought Clarence would have kept quiet about insulting me But apparently he has no sense of shame Bailey gaped Bailey was shocked and alarmed Insulting you What do you mean Clarence is a gentleman He is incapable of insulting a woman Is he He told me I was a suitable wife for a wretched dwarf with the miserably inadequate intelligence which nature gave him reduced to practically a minus quantity by alcohol At least he implied it He asked me to marry him I have just left him at the club He is very upset I should imagine so A soft smile played over Ruth s face I spoke to Clarence I explained things to him I lit up Clarence s little mind like a searchlight Bailey rose tremulous with just wrath You spoke to him in a way that I can only call outrageous and improper and er outrageous He paced the room with agitated strides Ruth watched him calmly If the overflowing emotion of a giant soul in torment makes you knock over a table or smash a chair she said I shall send the bill for repairs to you You had far better sit down and talk quietly What is worrying you Bailey Is it nothing demanded her brother that my sister should have spoken to a man as you spoke to Clarence Grayling With an impassioned gesture he sent a flower vase crashing to the floor I told you so said Ruth Pick up the bits and don t let the water spoil the carpet Use your handkerchief I should say that that would cost you about six dollars dear Why will you let yourself be so temperamental Now let me try and think what it was I said to Clarence As far as I can remember it was the mere A B C of eugenics Bailey on his knees picking up broken glass raised a flushed and accusing face Ah Eugenics You admit it I think went on Ruth placidly I asked him what sort of children he thought we were likely to have if we married A nice girl ought not to think about such things I don t think about anything else much A woman can t do a great deal even nowadays but she can have a conscience and feel that she owes something to the future of the race She can feel that it is her duty to bring fine children into the world As Aunt Lora says she can carry the torch and not falter Bailey shied like a startled horse at the hated phrase He pointed furiously at the photograph of the great thinker You re talking like that that damned woman Bailey precious You mustn t use such wicked wicked words Bailey rose pink and wrathful If you re going to break another vase said Ruth you will really have to go Ever since that that cried Bailey Ever since Aunt Lora Ruth smiled indulgently That s more like my little man she said He knows as well as I do how wrong it is to swear Be quiet Ever since Aunt Lora got hold of you I say you have become a sort of gramophone spouting her opinions But what sensible opinions It s got to stop Aunt Lora My God Who is she Just look at her record She disgraces the family by marrying a grubby newspaper fellow called Porter He has the sense to die I will say that for him She thrusts herself into public notice by a series of books and speeches on subjects of which a decent woman ought to know nothing And now she gets hold of you fills you up with her disgusting nonsense makes a sort of disciple of you gives you absurd ideas poisons your mind and er er Bailey This is positive eloquence It s got to stop It s bad enough in her but every one knows she is crazy and makes allowances But in a young girl like you He choked In a young girl like me prompted Ruth in a low tragic voice It it s not right It it s not proper He drew a long breath It s all wrong It s got to stop He s perfectly wonderful murmured Ruth He just opens his mouth and the words come out But I knew he was somebody directly I saw him by his forehead Like a dome Bailey mopped the dome Perhaps you don t know it he said but you re getting yourself talked about You go about saying perfectly impossible things to people You won t marry You have refused nearly every friend I have Ruth shuddered Your friends are awful Bailey They are all turned out on a pattern like a flock of sheep They bleat They have all got little narrow faces without chins or big fat faces without foreheads Ugh None of them good enough for you is that it Not nearly Emotion rendered Bailey for him almost vulgar I guess you hate yourself he snapped No sir beamed Ruth I think I m perfectly beautiful Bailey grunted Ruth came to him and gave him a sisterly kiss She was very fond of Bailey though she declined to reverence him Cheer up Bailey boy she said Don t you worry yourself There s a method in my madness I ll find him sooner or later and then you ll be glad I waited Him what do you mean Why him of course The ideal young man That s who or is it whom I m waiting for Bailey shall I tell you something You re so scarlet already poor boy you ought not to rush around in this hot weather that it won t make you blush It s this I m ambitious I mean to marry the finest man in the world and have the greatest little old baby you ever dreamed of By the way now I remember I told Clarence that Bailey uttered a strangled exclamation It has made you blush You turned purple Well now you know I mean my baby to be the most splendid baby that was ever born He s going to be strong and straight and clever and handsome and oh everything else you can think of That s why I m waiting for the ideal young man If I don t find him I shall die an old maid But I shall find him We may pass each other on Fifth Avenue We may sit next each other at a theatre Wherever it is I shall just reach right out and grab him and whisk him away And if he s married already he ll have to get a divorce And I shan t care who he is He may be any one I don t mind if he s a ribbon clerk or a prize fighter or a policeman or a cab driver so long as he s the right man Bailey plied the handkerchief on his streaming forehead The heat of the day and the horror of this conversation were reducing his weight at the rate of ounces a minute In his most jaundiced mood he had never imagined these frightful sentiments to be lurking in Ruth s mind You can t mean that he cried I mean every word of it said Ruth I hope for your sake he won t turn out to be a waiter or a prize fighter but it won t make any difference to me You re crazy Well just now you said Aunt Lora was If she is I am I knew it I said she had been putting these ghastly ideas into your head I d like to strangle that woman Don t you try Have you ever felt Aunt Lora s biceps It s like a man s She does dumb bells every morning I ve a good mind to speak to father Somebody s got to make you stop this insanity Just as you please But you know how father hates to be worried about things that don t concern business Bailey did His father of whom he stood in the greatest awe was very little interested in any subject except the financial affairs of the firm of Bannister Son It required greater courage than Bailey possessed to place this matter before him He had an uneasy feeling that Ruth knew it I would if it were necessary he said But I don t believe you re serious Stick to that idea as long as ever you can Bailey dear said Ruth It will comfort you Chapter III The Mates Meet Kirk Winfield was an amiable if rather weak young man with whom life for twenty five years had dealt kindly He had perfect health an income more than sufficient for his needs a profession which interested without monopolizing him a thoroughly contented disposition and the happy knack of surrounding himself with friends That he had to contribute to the support of the majority of these friends might have seemed a drawback to some men Kirk did not object to it in the least He had enough money to meet their needs and being a sociable person who enjoyed mixing with all sorts and conditions of men he found the Liberty Hall regime pleasant He liked to be a magnet attracting New York s Bohemian population If he had his preferences among the impecunious crowd who used the studio as a chapel of ease strolling in when it pleased them drinking his whisky smoking his cigarettes borrowing his money and on occasion his spare bedrooms and his pyjamas he never showed it He was fully as pleasant to Percy Shanklyn the elegant perpetually resting English actor whom he disliked as far as he was capable of disliking any one as he was to Hank Jardine the prospector and Hank s prize fighter friend Steve Dingle both of whom he liked enormously It seemed to him sometimes that he had drifted into the absolutely ideal life He lived entirely in the present The passage of time left him untouched Day followed day week followed week and nothing seemed to change He was never unhappy never ill never bored He would get up in the morning with the comfortable knowledge that the day held no definite duties George Pennicut would produce one of his excellent breakfasts The next mile stone would be the arrival of Steve Dingle Five brisk rounds with Steve a cold bath and a rub down took him pleasantly on to lunch after which it amused him to play at painting There was always something to do when he wearied of that until almost before the day had properly begun up came George with one of his celebrated dinners And then began the incursion of his friends One by one they would drop in making themselves very much at home to help their host through till bedtime And another day would slip into the past It never occurred to Kirk that he was wasting his life He had no ambitions Ambition is born of woman and no woman that he had ever met had ever stirred him deeply He had never been in love and he had come to imagine that he was incapable of anything except a mild liking for women He considered himself immune and was secretly glad of it He enjoyed his go as you please existence too much to want to have it upset He belonged in fact to the type which when the moment arrives falls in love very suddenly very violently and for all time Nothing could have convinced him of this He was like a child lighting matches in a powder magazine When the idea of marriage crossed his mind he thrust it from him with a kind of shuddering horror He could not picture to himself a woman who could compensate him for the loss of his freedom and still less of his friends His friends were men s men he could not see them fitting into a scheme of life that involved the perpetual presence of a hostess Hank Jardine for instance To Kirk the great point about Hank was that he had been everywhere seen everything and was when properly stimulated with tobacco and drink a fountain of reminiscence But he could not talk unless he had his coat off and his feet up on the back of a chair No hostess could be expected to relish that Hank was a bachelor s friend he did not belong in a married household The abstract wife could not be reconciled to him and Kirk loving Hank like a brother firmly dismissed the abstract wife He came to look upon himself as a confirmed bachelor He had thought out the question of marriage in all its aspects and decided against it He was the strong man who knew his own mind and could not be shaken Yet on the afternoon of the day following missus Lora Delane Porter s entry into his life Kirk sat in the studio feeling for the first time in recent years a vague discontent He was uneasy almost afraid The slight dislocation in the smooth working machinery of his existence caused by the compulsory retirement of George Pennicut had made him thoroughly uncomfortable With discomfort had come introspection and with introspection this uneasiness that was almost fear A man living alone without money troubles to worry him sinks inevitably into a routine Fatted ease is good for no one It sucks the soul out of a man Kirk as he sat smoking in the cool dusk of the studio was wondering almost in a panic whether all was well with himself This mild domestic calamity had upset him so infernally It could not be right that so slight a change in his habits should have such an effect upon him George had been so little hurt the doctor gave him a couple of days before complete recovery that it had not seemed worth while to Kirk to engage a substitute It was simpler to go out for his meals and make his own bed And it was the realization that this alteration in his habits had horribly disturbed and unsettled him that was making Kirk subject himself now to an examination of quite unusual severity He hated softness Physically he kept himself always in perfect condition Had he become spiritually flabby Certainly this unexpected call on his energies would appear to have found him unprepared It spoiled his whole day knowing when he got out of bed in the morning that he must hunt about and find his food instead of sitting still and having it brought to him It frightened him to think how set he had become Forty eight hours ago he would have scorned the suggestion that he coddled himself He would have produced as evidence to the contrary his cold baths his exercises his bouts with Steve Dingle To day he felt less confidence For all his baths and boxing the fact remained that he had become at the age of twenty six such a slave to habit that a very trifling deviation from settled routine had been enough to poison life for him Bachelors have these black moments and it is then that the abstract wife comes into her own To Kirk brooding in the dusk the figure of the abstract wife seemed to grow less formidable the fact that she might not get on with Hank Jardine of less importance The revolutionary thought that life was rather a bore and would become more and more of a bore as the years went on unless he had some one to share it with crept into his mind and stayed there He shivered These were unpleasant thoughts and in his hour of clear vision he knew whence they came They were entirely due to the knowledge that instead of sitting comfortably at home he would be compelled in a few short hours to go out and get dinner at some restaurant To such a pass had he come in the twenty sixth year of his life Once the gods have marked a bachelor down they give him few chances of escape It was when Kirk s mood was at its blackest and the figure of the abstract wife had ceased to be a menace and become a shining angel of salvation that Lora Delane Porter with Ruth Bannister at her side rang the studio bell Kirk went to the door He hoped it was a tradesman he feared it was a friend In his present state of mind he had no use for friends When he found himself confronting missus Porter he became momentarily incapable of speech It had not entered his mind that she would pay him a second visit Possibly it was joy that rendered him dumb Good afternoon mister Winfield said missus Porter I have come to inquire after the man Pennicut Ruth this is mister Winfield mister Winfield my niece Miss Bannister And Kirk perceived for the first time that his visitor was not alone In the shadow behind her a girl was standing He stood aside to let missus Porter pass and Ruth came into the light If there are degrees in speechlessness Kirk s aphasia became doubled and trebled at the sight of her It seemed to him that he went all to pieces as if he had received a violent blow Curious physical changes were taking place in him His legs which only that morning he had looked upon as eminently muscular he now discovered to be composed of some curiously unstable jelly He also perceived a fact which he had never before suspected that he had heart disease His lungs too were in poor condition he found it practically impossible to breathe The violent trembling fit which assailed him he attributed to general organic weakness He gaped at Ruth Ruth outwardly remained unaffected by the meeting but inwardly she was feeling precisely the same sensation of smallness which had come to missus Porter on her first meeting with Kirk If this sensation had been novel to missus Porter it was even stranger to Ruth To think humbly of herself was an experience that seldom happened to her She was perfectly aware that her beauty was remarkable even in a city of beautiful women and it was rarely that she permitted her knowledge of that fact to escape her Her beauty to her was a natural phenomenon impossible to overlook The realization of it did not obtrude itself into her mind it simply existed subconsciously Yet for an instant it ceased to exist She was staggered by a sense of inferiority It lasted but a pin point of time this riotous upheaval of her nature She recovered herself so swiftly that Kirk busy with his own emotions had no suspicion of it A moment later he too was himself again He was conscious of feeling curiously uplifted and thrilled as if the world had suddenly become charged with ozone and electricity and for some reason he felt capable of great feats of muscle and energy but the aphasia had left him and he addressed himself with a clear brain to the task of entertaining his visitors George is better to day he reported He never was bad said missus Porter succinctly He doesn t think so Possibly not He is hopelessly weak minded Ruth laughed Kirk thrilled at the sound Poor George she observed Don t waste your sympathy my dear said missus Porter That he is injured at all is his own fault For years he has allowed himself to become gross and flabby with the result that the collision did damage which it would not have done to a man in hard condition You mister Winfield she added turning abruptly to Kirk would scarcely have felt it But then you went on missus Porter are in good condition Cold baths I beg your pardon Do you take cold baths I do Do you do Swedish exercises I go through a series of evolutions every morning with the utmost loathing I started them as a boy and they have become a habit like dram drinking I would leave them off if I could but I can t Do nothing of the kind They are invaluable But undignified Let me feel your biceps mister Winfield said missus Porter She nodded approvingly Like iron She poised a finger and ran a meditative glance over his form Kirk eyed her apprehensively The finger darted forward and struck home in the region of the third waistcoat button Wonderful she exclaimed Ruth Yes aunt Prod mister Winfield where my finger is pointing He is extraordinarily muscular I say really protested Kirk He was a modest young man and this exploration of his more intimate anatomy by the finger tips of the girl he loved was not to be contemplated Just as you please said missus Porter If I were a man of your physique I should be proud of it Wouldn t you like to go up and see George asked Kirk It was hard on George but it was imperative that this woman be removed somehow Very well I have brought him a little book to read which will do him good It is called Elementary Rules for the Preservation of the Body He has learned one of them all right since yesterday said Kirk Not to walk about in front of automobiles The rules I refer to are mainly concerned with diet and wholesome exercise explained missus Porter Careful attention to them may yet save him His case is not hopeless Ruth let mister Winfield show you his pictures They are poor in many respects but not entirely without merit Ruth meanwhile had been sitting on the couch listening to the conversation without really hearing it She was in a dreamy contented mood She found herself curiously soothed by the atmosphere of the studio with its shaded lights and its atmosphere of peace That was the keynote of the place peace From outside came the rumble of an elevated train subdued and softened like faintly heard thunder Somebody passed the window whistling A barrier seemed to separate her from these noises of the city New York was very far away I believe I could be wonderfully happy in a place like this she thought She became suddenly aware in the midst of her meditations of eyes watching her intently She looked up and met Kirk s She could read the message in them as clearly as if he had spoken it and she was conscious of a little thrill of annoyance at the thought of all the tiresome formalities which must be gone through before he could speak it They seemed absurd It was all so simple He wanted her she wanted him She had known it from the moment of their meeting The man had found his woman the woman her man Nature had settled the whole affair in an instant And now civilization propriety etiquette whatever one cared to call it must needs step in with the rules and regulations and precedents The goal was there clear in sight but it must be reached by the winding road appointed She being a woman and by virtue of her sex primeval scorned the road and would have ignored it But she knew men and especially at that moment as their eyes met she knew Kirk and she understood that to him the road was a thing that could not be ignored The mere idea of doing so would seem grotesque and impossible probably even shocking to him Men were odd formal creatures slaves to precedent He must have time it was the prerogative of the male time to reveal himself to her to strut before her to go through the solemn comedy of proving to her by the exhibition of his virtues and the careful suppression of his defects what had been clear to her from the first instant that here was her mate the man nature had set apart for her He would begin by putting on a new suit of clothes and having his hair cut She smiled It was silly and tiresome but it was funny Will you show me your pictures mister Winfield she asked If you d really care to see them I m afraid they re pretty bad Exhibit A Modesty thought Ruth The journey had begun Chapter IV Troubled Waters It is not easy in this world to take any definite step without annoying somebody and Kirk in embarking on his wooing of Ruth Bannister failed signally to do so Lora Delane Porter beamed graciously upon him like a pleased Providence but the rest of his circle of acquaintances were ill at ease The statement does not include Hank Jardine for Hank was out of New York but the others Shanklyn the actor Wren the newspaper man Bryce Johnson Willis Appleton and the rest sensed impending change in the air and were uneasy like cattle before a thunder storm The fact that the visits of missus Porter and Ruth to inquire after George now of daily occurrence took place in the afternoon while they Kirk s dependents seldom or never appeared in the studio till drawn there by the scent of the evening meal it being understood that during the daytime Kirk liked to work undisturbed kept them ignorant of the new development All they knew was that during the last two weeks a subtle change had taken place in Kirk He was less genial more prone to irritability than of old He had developed fits of absent mindedness and was frequently to be found staring pensively at nothing To slap him on the back at such moments as Wren ventured to do on one occasion Wren belonging to the jovial school of thought which holds that nature gave us hands in order to slap backs was to bring forth a new and unexpected Kirk a Kirk who scowled and snarled and was hardly to be appeased with apology Stranger still this new Kirk could be summoned into existence by precisely the type of story at which but a few weeks back he would have been the first to laugh Percy Shanklyn whose conversation consisted of equal parts of autobiography and of stories of the type alluded to was the one to discover this His latest which he had counted on to set the table in a roar produced from Kirk criticism so adverse and so crisply delivered that he refrained from telling his latest but one and spent the rest of the evening wondering like his fellow visitors what had happened to Kirk and whether he was sickening for something Not one of them had the faintest suspicion that these symptoms indicated that Kirk for the first time in his easy going life was in love They had never contemplated such a prospect It was not till his conscientious and laborious courtship had been in progress for over two weeks and was nearing the stage when he felt that the possibility of revealing his state of mind to Ruth was not so remote as it had been that a chance visit of Percy Shanklyn to the studio during the afternoon solved the mystery One calls it a chance visit because Percy had not been meaning to borrow twenty dollars from Kirk that day at all The man slated for the loan was one Burrows a kindly member of the Lambs Club But fate and a telegram from a manager removed Burrows to Chicago while Percy was actually circling preparatory to the swoop and the only other man in New York who seemed to Percy good for the necessary sum at that precise moment was Kirk He flew to Kirk and found him with Ruth Kirk s utter absence of any enthusiasm at the sight of him the reluctance with which he made the introduction the glumness with which he bore his share of the three cornered conversation all these things convinced Percy that this was no ordinary visitor Many years of living by his wits had developed in Percy highly sensitive powers of observation Brief as his visit was he came away as certain that Kirk was in love with this girl and the girl was in love with Kirk as he had ever been of anything in his life As he walked slowly down town he was thinking hard The subject occupying his mind was the problem of how this thing was to be stopped Percy Shanklyn was a sleek suave unpleasant youth who had been imported by a theatrical manager two years before to play the part of an English dude in a new comedy The comedy had been what its enthusiastic backer had described in the newspaper advertisements as a rousing live wire success That is to say it had staggered along for six weeks on Broadway to extremely poor houses and after three weeks on the road had perished for all time leaving Percy out of work Since then no other English dude part having happened along he had rested living in the mysterious way in which out of work actors do live He had a number of acquaintances such as the amiable Burrows who were good for occasional loans but Kirk Winfield was the king of them all There was something princely about the careless open handedness of Kirk s methods and Percy s whole soul rose in revolt against the prospect of being deprived of this source of revenue as something possibly Ruth s determined chin told him that he would be should Kirk marry this girl He had placed Ruth at once directly he had heard her name He remembered having seen her photograph in the society section of the Sunday paper which he borrowed each week This was the daughter of old John Bannister There was no doubt about that How she had found her way to Kirk s studio he could not understand but there she certainly was and Percy was willing to bet the twenty dollars which despite the excitement of the moment he had not forgotten to extract from Kirk in a hurried conversation at the door that her presence there was not known and approved by her father The only reasonable explanation that Kirk was painting her portrait he dismissed There had been no signs of any portrait and Kirk s embarrassment had been so obvious that if there had been any such explanation he would certainly have given it No Ruth had been there for other reasons than those of art Unchaperoned too by Jove thought Percy virtuously ignorant of missus Lora Delane Porter who at the time of his call had been busily occupied in a back room instilling into George Pennicut the gospel of the fit body For George now restored to health had ceased to be a mere student of Elementary Rules for the Preservation of the Body and had become an active though unwilling practiser of its precepts Every morning missus Porter called and having shepherded him into the back room put him relentlessly through his exercises George s groans as he moved his stout limbs along the dotted lines indicated in the book s illustrated plates might have stirred a faint heart to pity But Lora Delane Porter was made of sterner stuff If George so much as bent his knees while touching his toes he heard of it instantly in no uncertain voice Thus in her decisive way did missus Porter spread light and sweetness with both hands achieving the bodily salvation of George while at the same time furthering the loves of Ruth and Kirk by leaving them alone together to make each other s better acquaintance in the romantic dimness of the studio Percy proceeded down town pondering His first impulse I regret to say was to send Ruth s father an anonymous letter This plan he abandoned from motives of fear rather than of self respect Anonymous letters are too frequently traced to their writers and the prospect of facing Kirk in such an event did not appeal to him As he could think of no other way of effecting his object he had begun to taste the bitterness of futile effort when fortune always his friend put him in a position to do what he wanted in the easiest possible way with the minimum of unpleasantness Bailey Bannister that strong keen Napoleon of finance was not above a little relaxation of an evening when his father happened to be out of town That giant mind weary with the strain of business needed refreshment And so at eleven thirty that night his father being in Albany and not expected home till next day Bailey might have been observed beautifully arrayed and discreetly jovial partaking of lobster at one of those Broadway palaces where this fish is in brisk demand He was in company with his rabbit faced friend Clarence Grayling and two members of the chorus of a neighbouring musical comedy One of the two with whom Clarence was conversing in a lively manner that showed his heart had not been irreparably broken as the result of his recent interview with Ruth we may dismiss Like Clarence she is of no importance to the story The other who not finding Bailey s measured remarks very gripping was allowing her gaze to wander idly around the room has this claim to a place in the scheme of things that she had a wordless part in the comedy in which Percy Shanklyn had appeared as the English dude and was on terms of friendship with him Consequently seeing him enter the room as he did at that moment she signalled him to approach It s a little feller who was with me in The Man from Out West she explained to Bailey as Percy made his way toward them At which Bailey s prim mouth closed with an air of disapproval The feminine element of the stage he found congenial to his business harassed brain but with the little fellers who helped them to keep the national drama sizzling he felt less in sympathy and he resented extremely his companion s tactlessness in inciting this infernal mummer to intrude upon his privacy He prepared to be cold and distant with Percy And when Bailey never a ray of sunshine deliberately tried to be chilly those with him at the time generally had the sensation that winter was once more in their midst Percy meanwhile threaded his way among the tables little knowing that fate had already solved the problem which had worried him the greater part of the day He had come to the restaurant as a relief from his thoughts If he could find some kind friend who would invite him to supper well and good If not he was feeling so tired and depressed that he was ready to take the bull by the horns and pay for his meal himself He had obeyed Miss Freda Reece s signal because it was impossible to avoid doing so but one glance at Bailey s face had convinced him that not there was his kind host Why Perce said Miss Reece I ain t saw you in years Where you been hiding yourself Percy gave a languid gesture indicative of the man of affairs whose time is not his own Percy continued Miss Reece shake hands with my friend mister Bannister I been telling him about how you made such a hit as the pin in Pinafore The name galvanized Percy like a bugle blast mister Bannister he exclaimed Any relation to mister John Bannister the millionaire Bailey favoured him with a scrutiny through the gold rimmed glasses which would have frozen his very spine My father s name is ah John and he is a millionaire Percy met the scrutiny with a suave smile By Jove he said I know your sister quite well mister Bannister I meet her frequently at the studio of my friend Kirk Winfield Very frequently She is there nearly every day Well I must be moving on Got a date with a man Goodbye Freda Glad you re going strong Good night mister Bannister Delighted to have made your acquaintance You must come round to the studio one of these days Good night He moved softly away Miss Reece watched him go with regret He s a good little feller Percy she said And so he knows your sister Well ain t that nice Bailey did not reply And to the feast of reason and flow of soul that went on at the table during the rest of the meal he contributed so little that Miss Reece in conversation that night with her friend alluded to him not without justice first as that stiff and later as a dead one If Percy Shanklyn could have seen Bailey in the small hours of that night he would have been satisfied that his words had borne fruit Like a modern Prometheus Bailey writhed sleepless on his bed till daylight appeared The discovery that Ruth was in the habit of paying clandestine visits to artists studios where she met men like the little bounder who had been thrust upon him at supper rent his haughty soul like a bomb He knew no artists but he had read novels of Bohemian life in Paris and he had gathered a general impression that they were as a class shock headed unwashed persons of no social standing whatever extremely short of money and much addicted to orgies And his sister had lowered herself by association with one of these He rose early His appearance in the mirror shocked him He looked positively haggard Dressing with unwonted haste he inquired for Ruth and was told that a telephone message had come from her late the previous evening to say that she was spending the night at the apartment of missus Lora Delane Porter The hated name increased Bailey s indignation He held missus Porter responsible for the whole trouble But for her pernicious influence Ruth would have been an ordinary sweet American girl running as Bailey held a girl should in a decent groove It increased his troubles that his father was away from New York Bailey who enjoyed the dignity of being temporary head of the firm of Bannister Son had approved of his departure But now he would have given much to have him on the spot He did not doubt his own ability to handle this matter but he felt that his father ought to know what was going on His wrath against this upstart artist who secretly entertained his sister in his studio grew with the minutes It would be his privilege very shortly to read that scrubby dauber a lesson in deportment which he would remember In the interests of the family welfare he decided to stay away from the office that day The affairs of Bannister Son would be safe for the time being in the hands of the head clerk Having telephoned to Wall Street to announce his decision he made a moody breakfast and then proceeded as was his custom of a morning to the gymnasium for his daily exercise The gymnasium was a recent addition to the Bannister home It had been established as the result of a heart to heart talk between old John Bannister and his doctor The doctor spoke earnestly of nervous prostration and stated without preamble the exact number of months which would elapse before mister Bannister living his present life would make first hand acquaintance with it He insisted on a regular routine of exercise The gymnasium came into being and mister Steve Dingle physical instructor at the New York Athletic Club took up a position in the Bannister household which he was wont to describe to his numerous friends as a soft snap Certainly his hours were not long Thirty minutes with old mister Bannister and thirty minutes with mister Bailey between eight and nine in the morning and his duties were over for the day But Steve was conscientious and checked any disposition on the part of his two clients to shirk work with a firmness which Lora Delane Porter might have envied There were moments when he positively bullied old mister Bannister It would have amazed the clerks in his Wall Street office to see the meekness with which the old man obeyed orders But John Bannister was a man who liked to get his money s worth and he knew that Steve was giving it to the last cent Steve at that time was twenty eight years old He had abandoned an active connection with the ring which had begun just after his seventeenth birthday twelve months before his entry into the Bannister home leaving behind him a record of which any boxer might have been proud He personally was exceedingly proud of it and made no secret of the fact He was a man in private life of astonishingly even temper The only thing that appeared to have the power to ruffle him to the slightest extent was the contemplation of what he described as the bunch of cheeses who pretended to fight nowadays He would have considered it a privilege it seemed to be allowed to encounter all the middle weights in the country in one ring in a single night without training But it appeared that he had promised his mother to quit and he had quit Steve s mother was an old lady who in her day had been the best washerwoman on Cherry Hill She was moreover completely lacking in all the qualities which go to make up the patroness of sport Steve had been injudicious enough to pay her a visit the day after his celebrated unpleasantness with that rugged warrior Pat O Flaherty ne Smith and though he had knocked Pat out midway through the second round he bore away from the arena a black eye of such a startling richness that old missus Dingle had refused to be comforted until he had promised never to enter the ring again Which as Steve said had come pretty hard he being a man who would rather be a water bucket in a ring than a president outside it But he had given the promise and kept it leaving the field to the above mentioned bunch of cheeses There were times when the temptation to knock the head off Battling Dick this and Fighting Jack that became almost agony but he never yielded to it All of which suggests that Steve was a man of character as indeed he was Bailey entering the gymnasium found Steve already there punching the bag with a force and precision which showed that the bunch of cheeses ought to have been highly grateful to missus Dingle for her anti pugilistic prejudices Good morning Dingle said Bailey precisely Steve nodded Bailey began to don his gymnasium costume Steve gave the ball a final punch and turned to him He was a young man who gave the impression of being in a literal sense perfectly square This was due to the breadth of his shoulders which was quite out of proportion to his height His chest was extraordinarily deep and his stomach and waist small so that to the observer seeing him for the first time in boxing trunks he seemed to begin as a big man and half way down change his mind and become a small one His arms which were unusually long and thick hung down nearly to his knees and were decorated throughout with knobs and ridges of muscle that popped up and down and in and out as he moved in a manner both fascinating and frightening His face increased the illusion of squareness for he had thick straight eyebrows a straight mouth and a chin of almost the minimum degree of roundness He inspected Bailey with a pair of brilliant brown eyes which no detail of his appearance could escape And Bailey that morning as has been said was not looking his best You re lookin kind o sick bo was Steve s comment I guess you was hittin it up with the gang last night in one of them lobster parlours Bailey objected to being addressed as bo and he was annoyed that Steve should have guessed the truth respecting his overnight movements Still more was he annoyed that Steve s material mind should attribute to a surfeit of lobster a pallor that was superinduced by a tortured soul I did ah take supper last night it is true he said But if I am a little pale to day that is not the cause Things have occurred to annoy me intensely You should worry advised Steve Catch The heavy medicine ball struck Bailey in the chest before he could bring up his hands and sent him staggering back Damn it Dingle he gasped Kindly give me warning before you do that sort of thing Steve was delighted It amused his simple honest soul to catch Bailey napping and the incident gave him a text on which to hang a lecture And next to fighting he loved best the sound of his own voice Warning Nix he said Ain t it just what I been telling you every day for weeks You gotta be ready always You seen me holding the pellet You should oughter have been saying to yourself I gotta keep an eye on that gink so s he don t soak me one with that thing when I ain t looking Then you would have caught it and whizzed it back at me and maybe if I hadn t been ready for it you might have knocked the breeze out of me I should have derived no pleasure Why say suppose a plug ugly sasshays up to you on the street to take a crack at your pearl stick pin do you reckon he s going to drop you a postal card first You gotta be ready for him See what I mean Let us spar said Bailey austerely He had begun to despair of ever making Steve show him that deference and respect which he considered due to the son of the house The more frigid he was the more genial and friendly did Steve become The thing seemed hopeless It was a pleasing sight to see Bailey spar He brought to the task the measured dignity which characterized all his actions A left jab from him had all the majesty of a formal declaration of war If he was a trifle slow in his movements for a pastime which demands a certain agility from its devotees he at least got plenty of exercise and did himself a great deal of good He was perspiring freely as he took off the gloves A shower bath followed by brisk massage at the energetic hands of Steve made him feel better than he had imagined he could feel after that night of spiritual storm and stress He was glowing as he put on his clothes and a certain high resolve which had come to him in the night watches now returned with doubled force Dingle he said how did I seem to day Fine answered Steve courteously You re gettin to be a regular terror You think I shape well Sure I am glad This morning I am going to thrash a man within an inch of his life What Steve spun round Bailey s face was set and determined You are said Steve feebly I am What s he been doing to you I am afraid I cannot tell you that But he richly deserves what he will get Steve eyed him with affectionate interest Well ain t you the wildcat he said Who d have thought it I d always had you sized up as a kind o placid guy I can be roused Gee can t I see it But say what sort of a gook is this gink anyway In what respect Well I mean is he a heavy or a middle or a welter or what It makes a kind o difference you know I cannot say I have not seen him What Not seen him Then how s there this fuss between you That is a matter into which I cannot go Well what s his name then Maybe I know him I know a few good people in this burg I have no objection to telling you that He is an artist and his name is his name is Wrinkles appeared in Bailey s forehead His eyes bulged anxiously behind their glasses I ve forgotten he said blankly For the love of Mike Know where he lives I am afraid not Steve patted him kindly on the shoulder Take my advice bo he said Let the poor fellow off this time And so it came about that Bailey instead of falling upon Kirk Winfield hailed a taxicab and drove to the apartment of missus Lora Delane Porter Chapter V Wherein Opposites Agree The maid who opened the door showed a reluctance to let Bailey in She said that missus Porter was busy with her writing and had given orders that she was not to be disturbed Nothing could have infuriated Bailey more He Bailey Bannister was to be refused admittance because this preposterous woman wished to write It was the duty of all decent citizens to stop her writing If it had not been for her and her absurd books Ruth would never have made it necessary for him to pay this visit at all Kindly take my card to missus Porter and tell her that I must see her at once on a matter of the utmost urgency he directed The domestic workers of America had not been trained to stand up against Bailey s grand manner The maid vanished meekly with the card and presently returned and requested him to step in Bailey found himself in a comfortable room more like a man s study than a woman s boudoir Books lined the walls The furniture was strong and plain At the window on a swivel chair before a roll top desk missus Porter sat writing her back to the door The gentleman ma am announced the maid Sit down said his aunt without looking round or ceasing to write The maid went out Bailey sat down The gentle squeak of the quill pen continued Bailey coughed I have called this morning The left hand of the writer rose and waggled itself irritably above her left shoulder Aunt Lora spoke Bailey sternly Shish said the authoress Only that and nothing more Bailey outraged relapsed into silence The pen squeaked on After what seemed to Bailey a considerable time the writing ceased It was succeeded by the sound of paper vigorously blotted Then with startling suddenness missus Porter whirled round on the swivel chair tilted it back and faced him Well Bailey she said She looked at Bailey Bailey looked at her Her eyes had the curious effect of driving out of his head what he had intended to say Well she said again He tried to remember the excellent opening speech which he had prepared in the cab Good gracious Bailey cried missus Porter you have not come here and ruined my morning s work for the pleasure of looking at me surely Say something Bailey found his voice I have called to see Ruth who I am informed is with you She is in her room I made her breakfast in bed Is there any message I can give her Bailey suddenly remembered the speech he had framed in the cab Aunt Lora he said I am sorry to have to intrude upon you at so early an hour but it is imperative that I see Ruth and ask her to explain the meaning of a most disturbing piece of news that has come to my ears missus Porter did not appear to have heard him A man of your height should weigh more she said What is your weight My weight beside the point Your weight is under a hundred and forty pounds and it ought to be over a hundred and sixty Eat more Avoid alcohol Keep regular hours Aunt Lora Well I wish to see my sister You will have to wait What did you wish to see her about That is a matter that concerns No I will tell you for I believe you to be responsible for the whole affair Well Last night quite by chance I found out that Ruth has for some time been paying visits to the studio of an artist missus Porter nodded Quite right mister Kirk Winfield She is going to marry him Bailey s hat fell to the floor His stick followed His mouth opened widely His glasses shot from his nose and danced madly at the end of their string What It will be a most suitable match in every way said missus Porter Bailey bounded to his feet It s incredible he shouted It s ridiculous It s abominable It s it s incredible missus Porter gazed upon his transports with about the same amount of interest which she would have bestowed upon a whirling dervish at Coney Island You have not seen mister Winfield I gather When I do he will have reason to regret it I Sit down Bailey sat down Ruth and mister Winfield are both perfect types mister Winfield is really a splendid specimen of a man As to his intelligence I say nothing I have ceased to expect intelligence in man and I am grateful for the smallest grain But physically he is magnificent I could not wish dear Ruth a better husband Bailey had pulled himself together with a supreme effort and had achieved a frozen calm Such a marriage is of course out of the question he said Why My sister cannot marry a a nobody an outsider mister Winfield is not a nobody He is an extraordinarily healthy young man Are you aware that Ruth if she had wished could have married a prince She told me A little rat of a man I understand She had far too much sense to do any such thing She has a conscience She knows what she owes to the future of the Bah cried Bailey rudely I suppose said missus Porter that like most men you care nothing for the future of the race You are not interested in eugenics Bailey quivered with fury at the word but said nothing If you have ever studied even so elementary a subject as the colour heredity of the Andalusian fowl The colour heredity of the Andalusian fowl was too much for Bailey I decline to discuss any such drivel he said rising I came here to see Ruth and And here she is said missus Porter The door opened and Ruth appeared She looked to Bailey insufferably radiant and pleased with herself Bailey she cried Whatever brings my little Bailey here when he ought to be working like a good boy in Wall Street I will tell you Bailey s demeanour was portentous He s frowning said Ruth You have been stirring his hidden depths Aunt Lora Bailey coughed Ruth Bailey don t You don t know how terrible you look when you re roused Ruth kindly answer me one question Aunt Lora informs me that you are going to marry this man Winfield Is it or is it not true Of course it s true Bailey drew in his breath He gazed coldly at Ruth bowed to missus Porter and smoothed the nap of his hat Very good he said stonily I shall now call upon this mister Winfield and thrash him With that he walked out of the room He directed his cab to the nearest hotel looked up Kirk s address in the telephone book and ten minutes later was ringing the studio bell A look of relief came into George Pennicut s eyes as he opened the door To George nowadays every ring at the bell meant a possible visit from Lora Delane Porter Is mister Kirk Winfield at home inquired Bailey Yes sir Who shall I say sir Kindly tell mister Winfield that mister Bannister wishes to speak to him Yes sir Will you step this way sir Bailey stepped that way While Bailey was driving to the studio in his taxicab Kirk in boxing trunks and a sleeveless vest was engaged on his daily sparring exercise with Steve Dingle This morning Steve seemed to be amused at something As they rested at the conclusion of their fifth and final round Kirk perceived that he was chuckling and asked the reason Why say explained Steve I was only thinking that it takes all kinds of ivory domes to make a nuttery I ran across a new brand of simp this morning Just before I came to you I m scheduled to show up at one of these Astorbilt homes t other side of the park First I mix it with the old man then son and heir blows in and I attend to him Well this morning son acts like he s all worked up He s one of these half portion Willie boys with Chippendale legs but he throws out a line of talk that would make you wonder if it s safe to let him run around loose Says his mind s made up he s going to thrash a gink within an inch of his life going to muss up his features so bad he ll have to have em replanted Why I says Never you mind says he Well who is he I asks What do you think happens then He thinks hard for a spell rolls his eyes and says Search me I ve forgotten Know where he lives I asks him Nope he says Can you beat it Seems to me if I had a kink in my coco that big I d phone to an alienist and have myself measured for a strait jacket Gee You meet all kinds going around the way I do Kirk laughed and lit a cigarette If you want to use the shower Steve he said you d better get up there now I shan t be ready yet awhile Then if this is one of your energetic mornings and you would care to give me a rub down Sure said Steve obligingly He picked up his clothes and went upstairs to the bathroom which like the bedrooms opened on to the gallery Kirk threw himself on the couch fixed his eyes on the ceiling and began to think of Ruth mister Bannister announced George Pennicut at the door Kirk was on his feet in one bound The difference to a man whose mind is far away between mister Bannister and Miss Bannister is not great and his first impression was that it was Ruth who had arrived He was acutely conscious of his costume and was quite relieved when he saw not Ruth but a severe looking young man who advanced upon him in a tight lipped pop eyed manner that suggested dislike and hostility The visitor was a complete stranger to him but his wandering wits returning to their duties he deduced that this must be one of Ruth s relatives It is a curious fact that the possibility of Ruth having other relatives than missus Porter had not occurred to him till now She herself filled his mind to such an extent that he had never speculated on any possible family that might be attached to her To him Ruth was Ruth He accepted the fact that she was missus Porter s niece That she might also be somebody s daughter or sister had not struck him The look on Bailey s face somehow brought it home to him that the world was about to step in and complicate the idyllic simplicity of his wooing Bailey meanwhile as Kirk s hundred and eighty pounds of bone and muscle detached themselves from the couch and loomed up massively before him was conscious of a weakening of his determination to inflict bodily chastisement The truth of Steve s remark that it made a difference whether one s intended victim is a heavyweight a middle or a welter came upon him with some force Kirk in a sleeveless vest that showed up his chest and shoulders was not an inviting spectacle for a man intending assault and battery Bailey decided to confine himself to words There was nothing to be gained by a vulgar brawl A dignified man of the world avoided violence mister Winfield mister Bannister It was at this point that Steve having bathed and dressed came out on the gallery The voices below halted him and the sound of Bailey s decided him to remain where he was Steve was not above human curiosity and he was anxious to know the reason for Bailey s sudden appearance That is my name It is familiar to you My sister said Bailey bitterly has made it so Won t you sit down said Kirk No thank you I will not detain you long mister Winfield My dear fellow There s no hurry Will you have a cigarette No thank you Kirk was puzzled by his visitor s manner So unseen in the shadows of the gallery was Steve I can say what I wish to say in two words mister Winfield said Bailey This marriage is quite out of the question Eh My father would naturally never consent to it As soon as he hears of what has happened he will forbid it absolutely Kindly dismiss from your mind entirely the idea that my sister will ever be permitted to marry you mister Winfield Steve in the gallery with difficulty suppressed a whoop of surprise Kirk laughed ruefully Aren t you a little premature mister Bannister Aren t you taking a good deal for granted In what way Well that Miss Bannister cares the slightest bit for me for instance that I ve one chance in a million of ever getting her to care the slightest bit for me Bailey was disgusted at this futile attempt to hide the known facts of the case from him You need not trouble to try and fool me mister Winfield he said tartly I know everything I have just seen my sister and she told me herself in so many words that she intended to marry you To his amazement he found his hand violently shaken My dear old man Kirk was stammering in his delight My dear old sport you don t know what a weight you ve taken off my mind You know how it is A fellow falls in love and instantly starts thinking he hasn t a chance on earth I hadn t a notion she felt that way about me I m not fit to shine her shoes My dear old man if you hadn t come and told me this I never should have had the nerve to say a word to her You re a corker You ve changed everything You ll have to excuse me I must go to her I can t wait a minute I must rush and dress Make yourself at home here Have you breakfasted George George Say George I ve got to rush away See that mister Bannister has everything he wants Get him some breakfast Good bye old man He gripped Bailey s hand once more You re all right Good bye He sprang for the staircase George Pennicut turned to the speechless Bailey How would it be if I made you a nice cup of hot tea and a rasher of am sir he inquired with a kindly smile Bailey eyed him glassily then found speech Go to hell he shouted He strode to the door and shot into the street a seething volcano George for his part was startled but polite Yes sir he said Very good sir and withdrew Kirk having reached the top of the stairs had to check the wild rush he was making for the bathroom in order not to collide with Steve whom he found waiting for him with outstretched hand and sympathetic excitement writ large upon his face Excuse me squire said Steve I ve been playing the part of Rubberneck Rupert in that little drama you ve just been starring in I just couldn t help listening Say this mitt s for you Shake it So you re going to marry Bailey s sister Ruth are you You re the lucky guy She s a queen Do you know her Steve Do I know her Didn t I tell you I was the tame physical instructor in that palace I wish I had a dollar for every time I ve thrown the medicine ball at her Why I m the guy that gave her that figure of hers She don t come to me regular like Bailey and the old man but do I know her I should say I did know her Kirk shook his hand You re all right Steve he said huskily and vanished into the bathroom A sound as of a tropical deluge came from within Steve hammered upon the door The downpour ceased Say called Steve Hello I don t want to discourage you squire but The door opened and Kirk s head appeared What s the matter Well you heard what Bailey said About his father Sure It goes Kirk came out into the gallery towelling himself vigorously Who is her father he asked seating himself on the rail He s a son of a gun said Steve with emphasis As rich as John D pretty nearly and about as chummy as a rattlesnake Were you thinking of calling and asking him for a father s blessing Something of the sort I suppose Forget it He d give you the hook before you d got through asking if you might call him daddy You re comforting Steve They call you Little Sunbeam at home don t they Hell said Steve warmly I m not shooting this at you just to make you feel bad I gotta reason I want to make you see this ain t going to be no society walk over with the Four Hundred looking on from the pews and poppa signing cheques in the background Say did I ever tell you how I beat Kid Mitchell Does it apply to the case in hand Does it what to the which Had it any bearing on my painful position I only ask because that s what is interesting me most just now and if you re going to change the subject there s a chance that my attention may wander Sure it does It s a what d you call it when you pull something that s got another meaning tucked up its sleeve A parable That s right A what you said Well this Kid Mitchell was looked on as a coming champ in those days He had cleaned up some good boys while I had only gotten a rep about as big as a nickel with a hole in it I guess I looked pie to him He turkey trotted up to me for the first round and stopped in front of me as if he was wondering what had blown in and whether the Gerry Society would stand for his hitting it I could see him thinking This is too easy as plain as if he d said it And then he took another peek at me as much as to say Well let s get it over Where shall I soak him first And while he s doing this I get in range and I put my left pretty smart into his lunch wagon and I pick up my right off the carpet and hand it to him and down he goes And when he gets up again it s pretty nearly to morrow morning and I ve drawn the winner s end and gone home And the moral Why don t spar Punch Don t wait for the wallop Give it You mean Why when old man Bannister says Nix You shall never marry my child come back at him by saying Thanks very much but I ve just done it Good heavens Steve You ll never win out else You don t know old man Bannister I do But The door bell rang Who on earth s that said Kirk It can t be Bailey back again Good morning Pennicut spoke the clear voice of missus Lora Delane Porter I wish to see mister Winfield Yes ma am He s upstairs in is bath I will wait in the studio Good Lord cried Kirk bounding from his seat on the rail For Heaven s sake Steve go and talk to her while I dress I ll be down in a minute Sure What s her name missus Porter You ll like her Tell her all about yourself where you were born how much you are round the chest what s your favourite breakfast food That s what she likes to chat about And tell her I ll be down in a second Steve reaching the studio found missus Porter examining the boxing gloves which had been thrown on a chair Eight ounce ma am he said genially by way of introduction Kirk ll be lining up in a moment He s getting into his rags missus Porter looked at him with the gimlet stare which made her so intensely disliked by practically every man she knew Are you a friend of mister Winfield she said Sure We just been spieling together up above He sent me down to tell you he won t be long missus Porter concluded her inspection What is your name Dingle ma am You are extraordinarily well developed You have unusually long arms for a man of your height Yep I got a pretty good reach Are you an artist A which An artist A painter Steve smiled broadly I ve been called a good many things but no one s ever handed me that No ma am I m a has been I beg your pardon Granted What did you say you were asked missus Porter after a pause A has been I used to be a middle but mother kicked and I quit All through taking a blue eye home Wouldn t that jar you I have no doubt you intend to be explicit Not on your life protested Steve I may be a rough neck but I ve got me manners I wouldn t get explicit with a lady missus Porter sat down We appear to be talking at cross purposes she said I still do not gather what your profession is or was Why ain t I telling you I used to be a middle What is a middle Why it s in between the light heavies and the welters I was a welter when I broke into the fighting game but Now I understand You are a pugilist Used to be But mother kicked Kicked whom You don t get me ma am When I say she kicked I mean my blue eye threw a scare into her and she put a crimp in my career Made me quit when I should have been champ in another couple of fights I am afraid I cannot follow these domestic troubles of yours And why do you speak of your blue eye Your eyes are brown This one wasn t It was the fattest blue eye you ever seen I ran up against a short right hook I put him out next round ma am mind you but that didn t help me any with mother Directly she seen me blue eye she said That ll be all from you Steve You stop it this minute So I quit But gee It s tough on a fellow to have to sit out of the game and watch a bunch of cheeses like this new crop of middle weights swelling around and calling themselves fighters when they couldn t lick a postage stamp not if it was properly trained Hell Beg pardon ma am I find you an interesting study mister Dingle said missus Porter thoughtfully I have never met a pugilist before Do you box with mister Winfield Sure Kirk and me go five rounds every morning You have been boxing with him to day Then perhaps you can tell me if an absurd young man in eye glasses has called here yet He is wearing a grey Do you mean Bailey ma am Bailey Bannister You know my nephew mister Dingle Sure I box with him every morning I never expected to hear that my nephew Bailey did anything so sensible as to take regular exercise He does not look as if he did He certainly is a kind o half portion ma am But say if he s your nephew Miss Ruth s your niece Perfectly correct Then you know all about this business Which business mister Dingle Why Kirk and Miss Ruth missus Porter raised her eyebrows Really mister Dingle Has mister Winfield made you his confidant How s that Has mister Winfield told you about my niece and himself Hell no You don t find a real person like Kirk shooting his head about that kind of thing I had it from Bailey From Bailey Surest thing you know He blew in here and shouted it all out at the top of his voice Indeed I was wondering if he had arrived yet He left my apartment saying he was going to thrash mister Winfield I came here to save him from getting hurt Was there any trouble Not so s you could notice it I guess when he d taken a slant at Kirk he thought he wouldn t bother to swat him Say ma am Well Whose corner are you in for this scrap I don t understand you Well are you rooting for Kirk or are you holding the towel for old man Bannister You mean do I wish mister Winfield to marry my niece You re hep Most certainly I do It was I who brought them together Bully for you Well say I just been shooting the dope into Kirk upstairs I been you didn t happen to read the report of a scrap I once had with a gazook called Kid Mitchell did you ma am I seldom I may say never read the sporting section of the daily papers Steve looked at her in honest wonder For the love of Pete What else do you find to read in em he said Well I was telling Kirk about it The Kid came at me to soak me but I soaked him first and put him out It s the only thing to do ma am when you re up against it Get in the first wallop before the other guy can get himself set for his punch Kirk I says don t you wait for old man Bannister to tell you you can t marry Miss Ruth Marry her before he can say it I wish you d tell him the same thing ma am You know the old man as well as I do better I guess and you know that Kirk ain t got a chance in a million with him if he don t rush him Ain t that right mister Dingle said missus Porter I should like to shake you by the hand It is amazing to me to find such sound sense in a man You have expressed my view exactly If I have any influence with mister Winfield he shall marry my niece to day You are a man of really exceptional intelligence mister Dingle Aw check it with your hat ma am murmured Steve modestly Nix on the bouquets I m only a roughneck But I fall for Miss Ruth and there ain t many like Kirk so I d like to see them happy It would sure get my goat the worst way to have the old man gum the game for them I cannot understand a word you say said missus Porter but I fancy we mean the same thing Here comes mister Winfield at last I will speak to him at once Spiel away ma am said Steve The floor s yours Kirk entered the studio Chapter VI Breaking the News Old John Bannister returned that night Learning from Bailey s trembling lips the tremendous events that had been taking place in his absence he was first irritated then coldly amused His coolness dampened while it comforted Bailey A bearer of sensational tidings likes to spread a certain amount of dismay and terror but on the other hand it was a relief to him to find that his father appeared to consider trivial a crisis which to Bailey had seemed a disaster without parallel in the annals of American social life She said she was going to marry him Old Bannister opened the nut cracker mouth that always had the appearance of crushing something His pale eyes glowed for an instant Did she he said She seemed very ah determined Did she Silence falling like a cloud at this point Bailey rightly conjectured that the audience was at an end and left the room His father bit the end off a cigar and began to smoke Smoking he reviewed the situation and his fighting spirit rose to grapple with it He was not sorry that this had happened His was a patriarchal mind and he welcomed opportunities of exercising his authority over his children It had always been his policy to rule them masterfully and he had often resented the fact that his daughter by the nature of things was to a great extent outside his immediate rule During office hours business took him away from her The sun never set on his empire over Bailey but it needed a definite crisis like the present one to enable him to jerk at the reins which guided Ruth and he was glad of the chance to make his power felt The fact that this affair brought him into immediate contact with missus Porter added to his enjoyment Of all the people men or women with whom his business or social life had brought him into conflict she alone had fought him squarely and retired with the honours of war When his patriarchal mind had led him to bully his late wife it was missus Porter who had fought her cause It was missus Porter who openly expressed her contempt for his money and certain methods of making it She was the only person in his immediate sphere over whom he had no financial hold He was a man who liked to be surrounded by dependents and missus Porter stoutly declined to be a dependent She moved about the world blunt and self sufficing and he hated her as he hated no one else The thought that she had now come to grips with him and that he could best her in open fight was pleasant to him All his life except in his conflicts with her he had won He meant to win now Bailey s apprehensions amused him He had a thorough contempt for all actors authors musicians and artists whom he classed together in one group as men who did not count save in so far as they gave mild entertainment to the men who like himself did count The idea of anybody taking them seriously seemed too fantastic to be considered Of affection for his children he had little Bailey was useful in the office and Ruth ornamental at home They satisfied him He had never troubled to study their characters It had never occurred to him to wonder if they were fond of him They formed a necessary part of his household and beyond that he was not interested in them If he had ever thought about Ruth s nature he had dismissed her as a feminine counterpart of Bailey than whom no other son and heir in New York behaved so exactly as a son and heir should That Ruth even under the influence of Lora Delane Porter should have been capable of her present insubordination was surprising but the thing was too trivial to be a source of anxiety The mischief could be checked at once before it amounted to anything Bailey had not been gone too long before Ruth appeared She stood in the doorway looking at him for a moment Her face was pale and her eyes bright She was breathing quickly Are you busy father I I want to tell you something John Bannister smiled He had a wintry smile a sort of muscular affection of the mouth to which his eyes contributed nothing He had made up his mind to be perfectly calm and pleasant with Ruth He had read in novels and seen on the stage situations of this kind where the father had stormed and blustered The foolishness of such a policy amused him A strong man had no need to behave like that I think I have heard it already he said I have just been seeing Bailey What did Bailey tell you father That you fancied yourself in love with some actor or artist or other whose name I have forgotten It is not fancy I do love him Yes There was a pause Are you very angry father Why should I be Let s talk it over quietly There s no need to make a tragedy of it I m glad you feel like that father John Bannister lit another cigar Tell me all about it he said Ruth found herself surprisingly near tears She had come into the room with every nerve in her body braced for a supreme struggle Her father s unexpected gentleness weakened her exactly as he had foreseen The plan of action which he had determined upon was that of the wrestler who yields instead of resisting in order to throw an antagonist off his balance How did it begin he asked Well said Ruth it began when Aunt Lora took me to his studio Yes I heard that it was she who set the whole thing going She is a friend of this fellow what is his name Kirk Winfield Yes she seemed to know him quite well And then In spite of her anxiety Ruth smiled Well that s all she said I just fell in love with him mister Bannister nodded You just fell in love with him he repeated Pretty quick work wasn t it I suppose it was You just took one look at him and saw he was the affinity eh I suppose so And what did he do Was he equally sudden Ruth laughed She was feeling quite happy now He would have liked to be poor dear but he felt he had to be cautious and prepare the way before telling me If it hadn t been for Bailey he might be doing it still Apparently Bailey went to him and said I had said I was going to marry him and Kirk came flying round and well then it was all right mister Bannister drew thoughtfully at his cigar He was silent for a few moments Well my dear he said at last I think you had better consider the engagement broken off Ruth looked at him quickly He still smiled but his eyes were cold and hard She realized suddenly that she had been played with that all his kindliness and amiability had been merely a substitute for the storm which she had expected After all it was to be war between them and she braced herself for it Father she cried mister Bannister continued to puff serenely at his cigar We needn t get worked up about it he said Let s keep right on talking it over quietly Very well said Ruth But after what you have just said what is there to talk over You might be interested to hear my reasons for saying it And I will argue my side mister Bannister waved his hand gently You don t have to argue You just listen Ruth bit her lip Well In the first place said her father about this young man What is he Bailey says he is an artist Well what has he ever done Why don t I know his name I buy a good many pictures but I don t remember ever signing a cheque for one of his I read the magazines now and then but I can t recall seeing his signature to any of the illustrations How does he live anyway without going into the question of how he intends to support a wife Aunt Lora told me he had private means How much Five thousand dollars a year Exactly the amount necessary to let him live without working I have him placed now I know his type I could show you a thousand men in this city in exactly the same position They don t starve and they don t work This young man of yours is a loafer Well Ruth s voice was quiet but a faint colour had crept into her face and her eyes were blazing Now perhaps you would care to hear what I think of his principles How do you feel that he comes out of this business Does he show to advantage Isn t there just a suspicion of underhandedness about his behaviour No No He lets you pay these secret visits Ruth interrupted There was nothing secret about them to him Aunt Lora brought me to the studio in the first place and she kept on bringing me I don t suppose it ever occurred to Kirk to wonder who I was and who my father might be He has been perfectly straight If you like to say I have been underhanded I admit it I have More so than you imagine I just wanted him and I didn t care for anything except that It did not strike you that you owed anything to me for instance No I should have thought that as your father I had certain claims Ruth was silent mister Bannister sighed I thought you were fond of me Ruth he said wistfully It was the wrestler yielding instead of resisting Ruth s hard composure melted instantly She flung her arms round his neck in a burst of remorseful affection Of course I am father dear You re making this awfully hard for me mister Bannister chuckled inwardly It seemed to him that victory was in sight He always won he told himself always I only want you to be sensible Ruth stiffened at the word It jarred upon her She felt that they were leagues apart that they could never be in sympathy with each other Father she said Yes Would you like to see Kirk I have been wondering when he was going to appear on the scene I always thought it was customary on these occasions for the young man to present himself in person and not let the lady fight his battles for him Is this mister Winfield a little deficient in nerve Ruth flushed angrily I particularly asked Kirk not to come here before I had seen you I insisted on it Naturally he wanted to Of course There was a sneer in his voice which he did not try to hide It flicked Ruth like a whip Her painfully preserved restraint broke up under it Do you think Kirk is afraid of you father It crossed my mind He is not I have only your word for it You can have his if you want it There is the telephone You can have him here in ten minutes if you want to see him A very good idea But as it happens I do not want to see him There is no necessity His views on this matter do not interest me I There was a hurried knock at the door Bailey burst in ruffled and wild as to the eyes Father he cried I don t want to interrupt you but that infernal woman Aunt Lora has arrived and says she won t go till she has seen you She s downstairs now Not now said Lora Delane Porter moving him to one side and entering the room I thought it would be a comfort to you Ruth to have me with you to help explain exactly how matters stand Good evening John Go away Bailey Now let us discuss things quietly She is responsible for the whole thing father cried Bailey mister Bannister rose There is nothing to discuss he said shortly I have no wish to speak to you at all As you appear to have played a large part in this affair I may as well tell you that it is settled Ruth will not marry mister Winfield Lora Delane Porter settled herself comfortably in a chair She drew off her gloves and placed them on the table Please ask that boy Bailey to go she said He annoys me I cannot marshal my thoughts in his presence Quelled by her eye Bailey removed himself His father remained standing Ruth who had risen at her aunt s entry sat down again missus Porter looked round the room with some approval You have a nice taste in pictures John she said That is a Corot surely above the mantelpiece Will you But about this little matter You dislike the idea of Ruth marrying mister Winfield Have you seen mister Winfield I have not Then how can you possibly decide whether he is a fit husband for Ruth I know all about him What do you know What Ruth has told me That he is a loafer who pretends to be an artist He is a poor artist I grant you that His drawing is weak But are you aware that he is forty three inches round the chest six feet tall and in perfect physical condition What has that got to do with it Everything You have not read my Principles of Selection I have not I will send you a copy to morrow I will burn it directly it arrives Then you will miss a great deal of valuable information said missus Porter tranquilly There was a pause John Bannister glared furiously at missus Porter but her gaze was moving easily about the room taking in each picture in turn in a leisurely inspection An exclamation from Ruth broke the silence a sharp cry like that of an animal in pain She sprang up her face working her eyes filled with tears I can t stand it she cried I can t stand it any longer Father Kirk and I were married this afternoon missus Porter went quickly to her and put her arm round her Ruth was sobbing helplessly The strain had broken her John Bannister s face was leaden The veins stood out on his forehead His mouth twisted dumbly missus Porter led Ruth gently to the door and pushed her out Then she closed it and turned to him So now you know John she said Well what are you going to do about it Self control was second nature with John Bannister For years he had cultivated it as a commercial asset Often a fortune had depended on his mastery of his emotions Now in an instant he had himself under control once more His face resumed its normal expression of cold impassiveness Only his mouth twitched a little Well asked missus Porter Take her away he said quietly Take her out of here Let her go to him I have done with her I suppose so said missus Porter and left the room Chapter VII Sufficient Unto Themselves Some months after John Bannister had spoken his ultimatum in the library two drought stricken men met on the Rialto It was a close June evening full of thirst I could do with a drink said the first man Several My tongue is black clear down to the roots said the second Let s go up to Kirk Winfield s proposed the first man inspired Not for me said the other briefly Haven t you heard about Kirk He s married I know but And when I say married I mean married She s old John Bannister s daughter you know and I guess she inherits her father s character She s what I call a determined girl She seems to have made up her mind that the old crowd that used to trail around the studio aren t needed any longer and they ve been hitting the sidewalk on one ear ever since the honeymoon If you want to see her in action go up there now She ll be perfectly sweet and friendly but somehow you ll get the notion that you don t want to go there again and that she can bear up if you don t It s something in her manner I guess it s a trick these society girls learn You ve seen a bouncer handling a souse He doesn t rough house him He just puts his arm round his waist and kind of suggests he should leave the place Well it s like that But doesn t Kirk kick He used to like having us around His friend laughed Kick Kirk You should see him He just sits there waiting for you to go and when you do go shuts the door on you so quick you have to jump to keep from getting your coat caught in it I tell you those two are about all the company either of them needs They ve got the Newly weds licked to a whisper It s always the best fellows that get it the worse said the other philosophically and it s always the fellows you think are safe too I could have bet on Kirk Six months ago I d have given you any odds you wanted that he would never marry And I wouldn t have taken you It s always the way The criticisms of the two thirsty men though prejudiced were accurate Marriage had undeniably wrought changes in Kirk Winfield It had blown up decentralized and re arranged his entire scheme of life Kirk s was one of those natures that run to extremes He had been a whole hearted bachelor and he was assuredly a much married man For the first six months Ruth was almost literally his whole world His friends the old brigade of the studio had dropped away from him in a body They had visited the studio once or twice at first but after that had mysteriously disappeared He was too engrossed in his happiness to speculate on the reasons for this defection he only knew that he was glad of it Their visits had not been a success Conversation had flowed fitfully Some sixth sense told him that Ruth though charming to them all had not liked them and he himself was astonished to find what bull dogs they really were It was odd how out of sympathy he felt with them They seemed so unnecessary yet what a large part of his life they had once made up Something had come between him and them What it was he did not know Ruth could have told him She was the angel with the flaming sword who guarded their paradise Marriage was causing her to make unexpected discoveries with regard to herself Before she had always looked on herself as a rather unusually reasonable and certainly not a jealous woman But now she was filled with an active dislike for these quite harmless young men who came to try and share Kirk with her She knew it was utterly illogical A man must have friends Life could not be forever a hermitage of two She tried to analyse her objection to these men and came to the conclusion that it was the fact that they had known Kirk before she did that caused it She made a compromise with herself Kirk should have friends but they must be new ones In a little while when this crazy desire to keep herself and him alone together in a world of their own should have left her they would begin to build up a circle But these men whose vocabulary included the words Do you remember must be eliminated one and all Kirk blissfully unconscious that his future was being arranged for him and the steering wheel of his life quietly taken out of his hands passed his days in a state of almost painful happiness It never crossed his mind that he had ceased to be master of his fate and captain of his soul The reins were handled so gently that he did not feel them It seemed to him that he was travelling of his own free will along a pleasant path selected by himself He saw his friends go from him without a regret Perhaps at the bottom of his heart he had always had a suspicion of contempt for them He had taken them on their surface value as amusing fellows who were good company of an evening There was not one of them whom he had ever known as real friends know each other not one except Hank Jardine and Hank had yet to be subjected to the acid test of the new conditions There were moments when the thought of Hank threw a shadow across his happiness He could let these others go but Hank was different And something told him that Ruth would not like Hank But these shadows were not frequent Ruth filled his life too completely to allow him leisure to brood on possibilities of future trouble Looking back it struck him that on their wedding day they had been almost strangers They had taken each other blindly trusting to instinct Since then he had been getting to know her It was astonishing how much there was to know There was a fresh discovery to be made about her every day She was a perpetually recurring miracle The futility of his old life made him wince whenever he dared think of it How he had drifted a useless log on a sluggish current He was certainly a whole hearted convert As to Saul of Tarsus so to him there had come a sudden blinding light He could hardly believe that he was the same person who had scoffed at the idea of a man giving up his life to one woman and being happy But then the abstract wife had been a pale bloodless phantom and Ruth was real It was the realness of her that kept him in a state of perpetual amazement To see her moving about the studio to touch her to look at her across the dinner table to wake in the night and hear her breathing at his side It seemed to him that centuries might pass yet these things would still be wonderful And always in his heart there was the gratitude for what she had done for him She had given up everything to share his life She had weighed him in the balance against wealth and comfort and her place among the great ones of the world and had chosen him There were times when the thought filled him with a kind of delirious pride times again when he felt a grateful humility that made him long to fall down and worship this goddess who had stooped to him In a word he was very young very much in love and for the first time in his life was living with every drop of blood in his veins Hank returned to New York in due course He came to the studio the same night and he had not been there five minutes before a leaden weight descended on Kirk s soul It was as he had feared Ruth did not like him Hank was not the sort of man who makes universal appeal Also he was no ladies man He was long and lean and hard bitten and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non existent To get the best out of Hank as has been said you had to let him take his coat off and put his feet up on the back of a second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected Ruth conceded none of these things Throughout the interview Hank sat bolt upright tucking a pair of shoes of the dreadnought class coyly underneath his chair and drew suspiciously at Turkish cigarettes from Kirk s case An air of constraint hung over the party Again and again Kirk hoped that Hank would embark on the epic of his life but shyness kept Hank dumb He had heard on reaching New York that Kirk was married but he had learned no details and had conjured up in his mind the vision of a jolly little girl of the Bohemian type who would make a fuss over him as Kirk s oldest friend Confronted with Ruth he lost a nerve which had never before failed him This gorgeous creature he felt would never put up with those racy descriptions of wild adventures which had endeared him to Kirk As soon as he could decently do so he left and Kirk returning to the studio after seeing him out sat down moodily trying to convince himself against his judgment that the visit had not been such a failure after all Ruth was playing the piano softly She had turned out all the lights except one which hung above her head shining on her white arms as they moved From where he sat Kirk could see her profile Her eyes were half closed The sight of her as it always did sent a thrill through him but he was conscious of an ache behind it He had hoped so much that Hank would pass and he knew that he had not Why was it that two people so completely one as Ruth and himself could not see Hank with the same eyes He knew that she had thought him uncouth and impossible Why could not Hank have exerted himself more instead of sitting there in that stuffed way Why could not Ruth have unbent Why had not he himself done something to save the situation Of the three he blamed himself most He was the one who should have taken the lead and made things pleasant for everybody instead of forcing out conversational platitudes Once or twice he had caught Hank s eye and had hated himself for understanding what it said and not being able to deny it He had marked the end of their old relationship the parting of the ways and that a tragedy had been played out that night He found himself thinking of Hank as of a friend who had died What times they had had How smoothly they had got on together He could not recall a single occasion on which they had fallen out from the time when they had fought as boys at the prep school and cemented their friendship the next day After that there had been periods when they had parted sometimes for more than a year but they had always come together again and picked up the threads as neatly as if there had been no gap in their intimacy He had gone to college Hank had started on the roving life which suited his temperament But they had never lost touch with each other And now it was all over They would meet again but it would not be the same The angel with the flaming sword stood between them For the first time since the delirium of marriage had seized upon him Kirk was conscious of a feeling that all was not for the best in a best of all possible worlds a feeling of regret not that he had married the mere thought would have been a blasphemy but that marriage was such a complicated affair He liked a calm life free from complications and now they were springing up on every side There was the matter of the models Kirk had supposed that it was only in the comic papers that the artist s wife objected to his employing models He had classed it with the mother in law joke respecting it for its antiquity but not imagining that it ever really happened And Ruth had brought this absurd situation into the sphere of practical politics only a few days ago Since his marriage Kirk had dropped his work almost entirely There had seemed to be no time for it He liked to spend his days going round the stores with Ruth buying her things or looking in at the windows of Fifth Avenue shops and choosing what he would buy her when he had made his fortune It was agreed upon between them that he was to make his fortune some day Kirk s painting had always been more of a hobby with him than a profession He knew that he had talent but talent without hard work is a poor weapon and he had always shirked hard work He had an instinct for colour but his drawing was uncertain He hated linework while knowing that only through steady practice at linework could he achieve his artistic salvation He was an amateur and a lazy amateur But once in a while the work fever would grip him It had gripped him a few days before Hank s visit An idea for a picture had come to him and he had set to work upon it with his usual impulsiveness This had involved the arrival of Miss Hilda Vince at the studio There was no harm in Miss Vince Her morals were irreproachable She supported a work shy father and was engaged to be married to a young gentleman who travelled for a hat firm But she was of a chatty disposition and no respecter of persons She had posed frequently for Kirk in his bachelor days and was accustomed to call him by his first name a fact which Kirk had forgotten until Ruth who had been out in the park came in Miss Vince was saying at the moment So I says to her Kirk s just phoned to me to sit What Kirk she says Is he doin a bit of work for a change Well it s about time Aw Kirk don t need to work I says He s a plute He s got it in gobs So I didn t know you were busy dear said Ruth I won t interrupt you She went out Was that your wife inquired Miss Vince She s got a sweet face Say I read the piece about you and her in the paper You certainly got a nerve Kirk breaking in on the millionaires that way That night Ruth spoke her mind about Miss Vince It was in vain that Kirk touched on the work shy father dwelt feelingly on the young gentleman who travelled in hats Ruth had made up her mind It was thumbs down for Miss Vince But if I m to paint said Kirk I must have models There must be hundreds who don t call you by your Christian name After about five minutes they all do said Kirk It s a way they ve got They mean no harm Ruth then made this brilliant suggestion Kirk dear why don t you paint landscapes In spite of his annoyance he laughed Why don t I paint landscapes Ruth Because I m not a landscape painter that s why You could learn It s a different branch of the trade altogether You might just as well tell a catcher to pitch Well anyhow reported Ruth with spirit I won t have that Vince creature in the place again It was the first time she had jerked at the reins or given any sign that she was holding them and undoubtedly this was the moment at which Kirk should have said My dearest the time has come for me to state plainly that my soul is my own I decline to give in to this absurd suggestion Marriage is an affair of give and take not a circus where one party holds the hoop while the other jumps through and shams dead We shall be happier later on if we get this clearly into our heads now What he did say was Very well dear I ll write and tell her not to come He knew he was being abominably weak but he did not care He even felt a certain pleasure in his surrender Big muscular men are given to this feebleness with women Hercules probably wore an idiotic grin of happiness when he spun wool for Omphale Since then the picture had been laid aside but Kirk s desire to be up and at it had grown with inaction When a lazy man does make up his mind to assail a piece of work he is like a dog with a bone The music had stopped Ruth swung round What are you dreaming about Kirk Kirk came to himself with a start I was thinking of a lot of things For one about that picture of mine What about it Well when I was going to finish it Why don t you Kirk laughed Where s my model You ve scared her up a tree and I can t coax her down Ruth came over to him and sat down on a low chair at his side She put her arm round his waist and rested her head in the hollow of his shoulder Is he pining for his horrid Vince girl the poor boy He certainly is said Kirk Or at any rate for some understudy to her We must think Do they all call you Kirk I ve never met one who didn t What horrible creatures you artists are My dear kid you don t understand the thing at all When you re painting a model she ceases to be a girl at all You don t think of her as anything except a sort of lay figure Good gracious Does your lay figure call you Kirk too It always looks as if it were going to Ruth shuddered It s a repulsive thing I hate it It gives me the creeps I came in here last night and switched on the light and there it was goggling at me Are you getting nervous Ruth s face grew grave Do you know Kirk I really believe I am This morning as I was dressing I suddenly got the most awful feeling that something terrible was going to happen I don t know what It was perfectly vague I just felt a kind of horror It passed off in a moment or two but while it lasted ugh How ghastly Why didn t you tell me before You must be run down Look here let s shut up this place and get out to Florida or somewhere for the winter Let s don t do anything of the kind Florida indeed For the love of Mike as Steve would say it s much too expensive You know Kirk we are both frightfully extravagant I m sure we are spending too much money as it is You know you sold out some of your capital only the other day It was only that once And you had set your heart on that pendant Surely to goodness if I drag you away from a comfortable home to live in a hovel the least I can do is to You didn t drag me I just walked in and sat down and you couldn t think how to get rid of me so in despair you married me That was it And now I ve got to set to work and make a fortune and what do you call it support you in the style to which you have been accustomed Which brings us back to the picture I don t suppose I shall get ten dollars for it but I feel I shall curl up and die if I don t get it finished Are you absolutely determined about the Vince girl I m adamant I m granite I m chilled steel Oh Kirk can t you find a nice motherly old model with white hair and spectacles I shouldn t mind her calling you by your first name But it s absurd I told you just now that an artist doesn t look on his models as human beings while I know I ve read all about that in books and I believed it then Why when I married you I said to myself I mustn t be foolish Kirk s an artist I mustn t be a comic supplement wife and object to his using models Oh I was going to be so good and reasonable You would have loved me And then when it came to the real thing I found I just could not stand it I know it s silly of me I know just as well as you do that Miss Vince is quite a nice girl really and is going to make a splendid missus Travelling Salesman but that doesn t help me It s my wicked nature I suppose I m just a plain cat and that s all there is to it Look at the way I treat your friends Kirk started You jumped said Ruth You jerked my head Do you think I didn t know you had noticed it I knew how unhappy you were when mister Jardine was here and I just hated myself Didn t you like Hank asked Kirk Ruth was silent for a moment I wish you would Kirk went on You don t know what a real white man old Hank is You didn t see him properly that night He was nervous But he s one of the very best God ever made We ve known each other all our lives He and I Don t tell me cried Ruth Don t you see that that s just the reason why I can t like him Don t tell me about the things you and he did together unless you want me to hate him Don t you understand dear It s the same with all your friends I m jealous of them for having known you before I did And I hate these models because they come into a part of your life into which I can t I want you all to myself I want to be your whole life I know it s idiotic and impossible but I do You are my whole life said Kirk seriously I wasn t born till I met you There isn t a single moment when you are not my whole life She pressed her head contentedly against his arm Kirk Yes Let me pose for your picture What You couldn t Why not It s terribly hard work It s an awful strain I m sure I m as strong as that Vince girl You ask Steve he s seen me throw the medicine ball But posing is different Hilda Vince has been trained for it Well let me try at any rate But Do And I ll promise to like your Hank and not put on my grand manner when he begins telling me what fun you and he used to have in the good old days before I was born or thought of May I But Quick Promise Very well You dear I ll be the best model you ever had I won t move a muscle and I ll stand there till I drop You ll do nothing of the kind You ll come right down off that model throne the instant you feel the least bit tired The picture which Kirk was painting was one of those pictures which thousands of young artists are working on unceasingly every day Kirk s ideas about it were in a delightfully vague state He had a notion that it might turn out in the end as Carmen On the other hand if anything went wrong and he failed to insert a sufficient amount of wild devilry into it he could always hedge by calling it A Reverie or The Spanish Maiden Possibly if the thing became too pensive and soulful altogether he might give it some title suggestive of the absent lover at the bull fight The Toreador s Bride or something of that sort The only point on which he was solid was that it was to strike the Spanish note and to this end he gave Ruth a costume of black and orange and posed her on the model throne with a rose in her hair Privately he had decided that ten minutes would be Ruth s limit He knew something of the strain of sitting to an artist Tired he asked at the end of this period Ruth shook her head and smiled You must be Come and sit down and take a rest I m quite all right dear Go on with your work Well shout out the moment you feel you ve had enough He began to paint again The minutes went by and Ruth made no movement He began to grow absorbed in his work He lost count of time Ruth ceased to be Ruth ceased even to be flesh and blood She was just something he was painting Kirk The sharp suddenness of the cry brought him to his feet quivering Ruth was swaying on the model throne Her eyes were staring straight before her and her face was twisted with fear As he sprang forward she fell pitching stiffly head foremost as he had seen men fall in the ring her arms hanging at her sides and he caught her He carried her to the couch and laid her down He hung for an instant in doubt whether to go for water or telephone for the doctor He decided on the telephone He hung up the receiver and went back to Ruth She stirred and gave a little moan He flew upstairs and returned with a pitcher of water When he got back Ruth was sitting up The look of terror was gone from her face She smiled at him a faint curiously happy smile He flung himself on his knees beside her his arm round her waist and burst into a babble of self reproach He cursed himself for being such a brute such a beast as to let her stand there tiring herself to death She must never do it again He was a devil He ought to have known she could not stand it He was not fit to be married He was not fit to live Ruth ruffled his hair Stop abusing my husband she said I m fond of him Did you catch me Kirk Yes thank God I got to you just in time That s the last thing I remember wondering if you would You seemed such miles and miles away It was like looking at something in a mist through the wrong end of a telescope Oh Kirk Yes honey It came again that awful feeling as if something dreadful was going to happen And then I felt myself going She paused Kirk I think I know now I understand and oh I m so happy She buried her face on his shoulder and they stayed there silent till there came a ring at the bell Kirk got up George Pennicut ushered in the doctor It was the same little old doctor who had ministered to George in his hour of need Feeling better missus Winfield he said as he caught sight of Ruth Your husband told me over the phone that you were unconscious She fainted cried Kirk It was all through me I The doctor took him by the shoulders He had to stretch to do it You go away young man he said Take a walk round the block You aren t on in this scene Kirk was waiting in the hall when he left a few minutes later Well he said anxiously Well said the little doctor Is she all right There s nothing wrong is there The doctor grinned a friendly grin On the contrary he said You ought to be very pleased What do you mean It s quite a commonplace occurrence though I suppose it will seem like a miracle to you But believe me it has happened before If it hadn t you and I wouldn t be here now Kirk looked at him in utter astonishment His words seemed meaningless And then suddenly he understood and his heart seemed to stand still You don t mean he said huskily Yes I do said the doctor Good bye my boy I ve got to hurry off You caught me just as I was starting for the hospital Kirk went back to the studio his mind in a whirl Ruth was lying on the couch She looked up as the door opened He came quickly to her side Ruth he muttered Her eyes were shining with a wonderful light of joy She drew his head down and kissed him Oh Kirk she whispered I m happy I m happy I ve wanted this so He could not speak He sat on the edge of the couch and looked at her She had been wonderful to him before She was a thousand times more wonderful now Chapter VIII Suspense It seemed to Kirk as the days went by that a mist of unreality fell like a curtain between him and the things of this world Commonplace objects lost their character and became things to marvel at There was a new bond of sympathy between the world and himself A citizen walking in the park with his children became a kind of miracle Here was a man who had travelled the road which he was travelling now who had had the same hopes and fear and wonder Once he encountered a prosperous looking individual moving like a liner among tugs in the midst of no fewer than six offspring Kirk fixed him with such a concentrated stare of emotion and excitement that the other was alarmed and went on his way alertly as one in the presence of danger It is probable that if Kirk had happened to ask him the time at that moment or indeed addressed him at all he would have screamed for the police The mystery of childbirth and the wonder of it obsessed Kirk as time crept on And still more was he conscious of the horrible dread that was gathering within him Ruth s unvarying cheerfulness was to him almost uncanny None of the doubts and fears which blackened his life appeared to touch her Once he confided these to his friend the little doctor and was thoroughly bullied by him for his foolishness But in spite of ridicule the fear crept back cringingly like a whipped dog And then time moving on its leisurely but businesslike fashion the day arrived and for the first time in his life Kirk knew what fear really meant All that he had experienced till now had he saw been a mild apprehension not worthy of a stronger name His flesh crawled with the thoughts which rose in his mind like black bubbles in a pond There were moments when the temptation to stupefy himself with drink was almost irresistible It was his utter uselessness that paralysed him He seemed destined to be of no help to Ruth at just those crises when she needed him most When she was facing her father with the news of the marriage he had not been at her side And now when she was fighting for her life he could do nothing but pace the empty quiet studio and think The doctor had arrived at eight o clock cheery as ever and had come downstairs after seeing Ruth to ask him to telephone to missus Porter In his overwrought state this had jarred upon Kirk Here he felt was somebody who could help where he was useless missus Porter had appeared in a cab and had had the cold brutality to ask for a glass of sherry and a sandwich before going upstairs She put forward the lame excuse that she had not dined Kirk gave her the sherry and sandwich and resumed his patrol in a glow of indignation The idea of any one requiring food at this moment struck him as gross and revolting His wrath did not last In a short while fear came back into its own The hands of the clock pointed to ten before he stooped to following missus Porter s example George Pennicut had been sent out so he went into the little kitchen where he found eggs which he mixed with milk and swallowed After this he was aware of a momentary excess of optimism The future looked a little brighter But not for long Presently he was prowling the studio as restlessly as ever Men of Kirk s type are not given to deep thought Until now he had probably never spent more than a couple of minutes consecutively in self examination This vigil forced him upon himself and caused him to pass his character under review with strange and unsatisfactory results He had never realised before what a curiously contemptible and useless person he was It seemed to him that this was all he was fit for to hang about doing nothing while everybody else was busy and proving his or her own worth A door opened and the little doctor came quietly down the stairs Kirk sprang at him Well My dear man everything s going splendidly Couldn t be better The doctor s eyes searched his face When did you have anything to eat last I don t know I had some eggs and milk I don t know when The doctor took him by the shoulders and hustled him into the kitchen where he searched and found meat and bread Eat that he said I ll have some too I couldn t And some whisky Where do you keep it After the first few mouthfuls Kirk ate wolfishly The doctor munched a sandwich with the placidity of a summer boarder at a picnic His calmness amazed and almost shocked Kirk You can t help her by killing yourself said the doctor philosophically I like that woman with the gimlet eyes At least I don t but she s got sense Go on You haven t done yet Another highball won t hurt you He eyed Kirk with some sympathy It s a bad time for you of course For me Good God You want to keep your nerve Nothing awful is going to happen If only there was something I could do They also serve who only stand and wait quoted the doctor sententiously There is something you can do What Light your pipe and take it easy Kirk snorted I mean it In a very short while now you will be required to take the stage and embrace your son or daughter as the case may be You don t want to appear looking as if you had been run over by an automobile after a night out You want your appearance to give missus Winfield as little of a shock as possible Bear that in mind Well I must be going And Kirk was alone again The food and the drink and the doctor s words had a good effect His mind became quieter He sat down and filled his pipe After a few puffs he replaced it in his pocket It seemed too callous to think of smoking now The doctor was a good fellow but he did not understand All the same he was glad that he had had that whisky It had certainly put heart into him for the moment What was happening upstairs He strained his ears but could hear nothing Gradually as he waited his mood of morbid self criticism returned He had sunk once more into the depths when he was aware of a soft tapping The door bell rang very gently He went to the door and opened it I kinder thought I d look in and see how things were getting along said a voice It was Steve A subdued and furtive Steve Kirk s heart leaped at the sight of him It was as if he had found something solid to cling to in a shifting world Come in Steve He spoke huskily Steve sidled into the studio embarrassment written on every line of him Don t mind my butting in do you I ve been walking up and down and round the block till every cop on the island s standing by waiting for me to pull something Another minute and they d have pinched me on suspicion I just felt I had to come and see how Miss Ruth was making out The doctor was down here just now He said everything was going well I guess he knows his business There was a silence Kirk s ears were straining for sounds from above It s hell said Steve Kirk nodded This kind of talk was more what he wanted The doctor meant well but he was too professional Steve was human Go and get yourself a drink Steve I expect you need one Steve shook his head Waggon he said briefly And there was silence again Say Kirk Yes What a wonder she is Miss Ruth I mean I ve helped her throw that medicine ball often you wouldn t believe She s a wonder He paused Say this is hell ain t it Kirk did not answer It was very quiet in the studio now In the street outside a heavy waggon rumbled part Somebody shouted a few words of a popular song Steve sprang to his feet I ll fix that guy he said But the singing ceased and he sat down again Kirk got up and began to walk quickly up and down Steve watched him furtively You want to take your mind off it he said You ll be all in if you keep on worrying about it in that way Kirk stopped in his stride That s what the doctor said he snapped savagely What do you two fools think I m made of He recovered himself quickly ashamed of the outburst I m sorry Steve Don t mind anything I say It s awfully good of you to have come here and I m not going to forget it Steve scratched his chin reflectively Say I ll tell you something he said My mother told me once that when I was born my old dad took it just like you Found he was getting all worked up by having to hang around and do nothing so he says to himself I ve got to take my mind off this business or it s me for the foolish house Well sir there was a big guy down on that street who d been picking on dad good and hard for a mighty long while And this guy suddenly comes into dad s mind He felt of his muscle dad did Gee he says to himself I believe the way I m feeling I could just go and eat up that gink right away And the more he thought of it the better it looked to him so all of a sudden he grabs his hat and beats it like a streak down to the saloon on the corner where he knew the feller would be at that time and he goes straight up to him and hands him one Back comes the guy at him he was a great big son of a gun weighing thirty pounds more than dad and him and dad mixes it right there in the saloon till the barkeep and about fifty other fellers throws them out and they goes off to a vacant lot to finish the thing And dad s so worked up that he gives the other guy his till he hollers that that s all he ll want And then dad goes home and waits quite quiet and happy and peaceful till they tell him I m there Steve paused Kirk he said then how would you like a round or two with the small gloves just to get things off your mind for a spell and pass the time My dad said he found it eased him mighty good Kirk stared at him Just a couple of rounds urged Steve And you can go all out at that I shan t mind Just try to think I m some guy that s been picking on you and let me have it See what I mean For the first time that day the faint ghost of a grin appeared on Kirk s face I wonder if you re right Steve I know I m right And say don t think I don t need it too I ain t known Miss Ruth all this time for nothing You ll be doing me a kindness if you knock my face in The small gloves occupied a place of honour to themselves in a lower drawer It was not often that Kirk used them in his friendly bouts with Steve For ordinary occasions the larger and more padded species met with his approval Steve during these daily sparring encounters was amiability itself but he could not be counted upon not to forget himself for an occasional moment in the heat of the fray and though Kirk was courageous enough he preferred to preserve the regularity of his features at the expense of a little extra excitement Once after a brisk rally he had gone about the world looking as if he was suffering from mumps owing to a right hook which no one regretted more than Steve himself But to day was different and Kirk felt that even a repetition of that lethal punch would be welcome Steve when the contest opened was disposed to be consolatory in word as well as deed He kept up a desultory conversation as he circled and feinted You gotta look at it this way he began side stepping a left it ain t often you hear of anything going wrong at times like this You gotta remember he hooked Kirk neatly on the jaw that he concluded Kirk came back with a swing at the body which made his adversary grunt That s true he said Sure rejoined Steve a little breathlessly falling into a clinch They moved warily round each other So said Steve blocking a left that ought to comfort you some Kirk nodded He guessed correctly that the other was alluding to his last speech not to the counter which had just made the sight of his left eye a little uncertain Gradually as the bout progressed Kirk began to lose the slight diffidence which had hampered him at the start He had been feeling so wonderfully friendly toward Steve so grateful for his presence and his sympathy that it had been hard in spite of the other s admonitions to enter into the fray with any real conviction Moreover subconsciously he was listening all the time for sounds from above which never came These things gave a certain lameness to his operations It was immediately after this blow in the eye mentioned above that he ceased to be an individual with private troubles and a wandering mind and became a boxer pure and simple his whole brain concentrated on the problem of how to get past his opponent s guard Steve recognizing the change in an instant congratulated himself on the success of his treatment It had worked even more quickly than he had hoped He helped the cure with another swift jab which shot over Kirk s guard Kirk came in with a rush Steve slipped him Kirk rushed again Steve receiving a hard punch on a nose which though accustomed to such assaults had never grown really to enjoy them began to feel a slight diminution of his detached attitude toward this encounter Till now his position had been purely that of the kindly physician soothing a patient The rapidity with which the patient was permitting himself to be soothed rendered the post of physician something of a sinecure and Steve as Kirk had done began to slip back into the boxer It was while he was in what might be called a transition stage that an unexpected swing sent him with some violence against the wall and from that moment nature asserted itself A curious set look appeared on his face wrinkles creased his forehead his jaw protruded slightly Kirk made another rush This time Steve did not slip he went to meet it head down and hands busy missus Lora Delane Porter came downstairs with the measured impressiveness of one who bears weighty news Her determined face was pale and tired as it had every right to be but she bore herself proudly as one who has fought and not been defeated mister Winfield she said There was no answer Looking about her she found the studio empty Then from behind the closed door of the inner room she was aware of a strange shuffling sound She listened astonished She heard a gasp then curious thuds finally a bump louder than the thuds And then there was silence These things surprised missus Porter She opened the door and looked in It says much for her iron self control that she remained quiet at this point A lesser person after a far less tiring ordeal than she had passed through would have found relief in some cry or exclamation possibly even in a scream Against the far wall breathing hard and fondling his left eye with a four ounce glove leaned Steve Dingle His nose was bleeding somewhat freely but this he appeared to consider a trifle unworthy of serious attention On the floor an even more disturbing spectacle Kirk lay at full length To missus Porter s startled gaze he appeared to be dead He too was bleeding but he was not in a position to notice it It s all right ma am said Steve removing the hand from his face and revealing an eye which for spectacular dilapidation must have rivalled the epoch making one which had so excited his mother on a famous occasion It s nothing serious Has mister Winfield fainted Not exactly fainted ma am It s like this He d got me clear up in a corner and I seen it s up to me if I don t want to be knocked through the wall so I has to cross him Maybe I d gotten a little worked up myself by then But it was my fault I told him to go all out and he sure did This eye s going to be a pippin to morrow missus Porter examined the wounded organ with interest That I suppose mister Dingle is what you call a blue eye It sure is ma am What has been happening Well it s this way I see he s all worked up sitting around doing nothing except wait so I makes him come and spar a round to take his mind off it My old dad ma am when I was coming along found that dope fixed him all right so I reckoned it would do as much good here My old dad went and beat the block off a fellow down our street and it done him a lot of good missus Porter shook his gloved hand mister Dingle she said with enthusiasm I really believe that you are the only sensible man I have ever met Your common sense is astonishing I have no doubt you saved mister Winfield from a nervous break down Would you be kind enough when you are rested to fetch some water and bring him to and inform him that he is the father of a son Chapter IX The White Hope is Turned Down William Bannister Winfield was the most wonderful child Of course you had to have a certain amount of intelligence to see this To the vapid and irreflective observer he was not much to look at in the early stages of his career having a dough like face almost entirely devoid of nose a lack lustre eye and the general appearance of a poached egg His immediate circle of intimates however thought him a model of manly beauty and there was the undeniable fact that he had come into the world weighing nine pounds Take him for all in all a lad of promise Kirk s sense of being in a dream continued His identity seemed to have undergone a change The person he had known as Kirk Winfield had disappeared to be succeeded by a curious individual bubbling over with an absurd pride for which it was not easy to find an outlet Hitherto a rather reserved man he was conscious now of a desire to accost perfect strangers in the street and inform them that he was not the ordinary person they probably imagined but a father with an intensely unusual son at home and if they did not believe him they could come right along and see for themselves The only flaw in his happiness at the moment was the fact that his circle of friends was so small He had not missed the old brigade of the studio before but now the humblest of them would have been welcome provided he would have sat still and listened Even Percy Shanklyn would have been acceptable as an audience Steve excellent fellow was always glad to listen to him on his favourite subject He had many long talks with Steve on the question of William s future Steve as the infant s godfather which post he had claimed and secured at an early date had definite views on the matter Here held Steve was the chance of a lifetime With proper training a baby of such obvious muscular promise might be made the greatest fighter that ever stepped into the ring He was the real White Hope He advised Kirk to direct William s education on the lines which would insure his being when the time was ripe undisputed heavy weight champion of the world To Steve life outside the ring was a poor affair practically barren of prizes for the ambitious missus Lora Delane Porter eyeing William s brow of which there was plenty he being at this time extremely short of hair predicted a less robust and more intellectual future for him Something more on the lines of president of some great university or ambassador at some important court struck her as his logical sphere Kirk s view was that he should combine both careers and be an ambassador who took a few weeks off every now and then in order to defend his champion s belt In his spare time he might paint a picture or two Ruth hesitated between the army the navy the bar and business But every one was agreed that William was to be something special This remarkable child had a keen sense of humour Thus he seldom began to cry in his best vein till the small hours of the morning and on these occasions he would almost invariably begin again after he had been officially pronounced to be asleep His sudden grab at the hair of any adult who happened to come within reach was very droll too As to his other characteristics he was of rather an imperious nature He liked to be waited on He wanted what he wanted when he wanted it The greater part of his attention being occupied at this period with the important duty of chewing his thumb he assigned the drudgery of life to his dependants Their duties were to see that he got up in the morning dressed and took his tub and after that to hang around on the chance of general orders Any idea Kirk may have had of resuming his work was abandoned during these months No model young and breezy or white haired and motherly passed the studio doors Life was far too interesting for work The canvas which might have become Carmen or A Reverie or even The Toreador s Bride lay unfinished and neglected in a corner It astonished Kirk to find how strong the paternal instinct was in him In the days when he had allowed his mind to dwell upon the abstract wife he had sometimes gone a step further and conjured up the abstract baby The result had always been to fill him with a firm conviction that the most persuasive of wild horses should not drag him from his bachelor seclusion He had had definite ideas on babies as a class And here he was with his world pivoting on one of them It was curious The White Hope as Steve called his godson possibly with the idea of influencing him by suggestion grew The ailments which attacked lesser babies passed him by He avoided croup and even whooping cough paid him but a flying visit hardly worth mentioning His first tooth gave him a little trouble but that is the sort of thing which may happen to anyone and the spirited way in which he protested against the indignity of cutting it was proof of a high soul Such was the remarkableness of this child that it annoyed Kirk more and more that he should be obliged to give the exhibition of his extraordinary qualities to so small an audience Ruth felt the same and it was for this reason that the first overtures were made to the silent camp which contained her father and her brother Bailey Since that evening in the library there had come no sign from the house on Fifth Avenue that its inmates were aware of her existence Life had been too full till now to make this a cause of trouble to her but with William Bannister becoming every day more amazing the desire came to her to try and heal the breach Her father had so ordered his life in his relation to his children that Ruth s affection was not so deep as it might have been but after all he was William Bannister s grandfather and as such entitled to consideration It was these reflections that led to Steve s state visit to John Bannister probably the greatest fiasco on record Steve had been selected for the feat on the strength of his having the right of entry to the Fifth Avenue house for John Bannister was still obeying his doctor s orders and taking his daily spell of exercise with the pugilist and Steve bungled it hopelessly His task was not a simple one He was instructed to employ tact to hint rather than to speak to say nothing to convey the impression that Ruth in any way regretted the step she had taken to give the idea that it was a matter of complete indifference to her whether she ever saw her father again or not yet at the same time to make it quite clear that she was very anxious to see him as soon as possible William Bannister grown to maturity and upholding the interests of his country as ambassador at some important court might have jibbed at the mission William Bannister was to accompany Steve and be produced dramatically to support verbal arguments It seemed to Ruth that for her father to resist William when he saw him was an impossibility William s position was that of the ace of trumps in the cards which Steve was to play Steve made a few objections His chief argument against taking up the post assigned to him was that he was a roughneck and that the job in question was one which no roughneck however gifted in the matter of left hooks could hope to carry through with real success But he yielded to pressure and the expedition set out William Bannister at this time was at an age when he was beginning to talk a little and walk a little and take a great interest in things His walking was a bit amateurish and his speech rather hard to follow unless you had the key to it But nobody could have denied that his walk though staggery was a genuine walk and his speech though limited genuine speech within the meaning of the act He made no objections to the expedition On being told that he was going to see his grandpa he nodded curtly and said Gwa wah after his custom For as a conversationalist perhaps the best description of him is to say that he tried hard He rarely paused for a word When in difficulties he said something he did not seek refuge in silence That the something was not always immediately intelligible was the fault of his audience for not listening more carefully Perhaps the real mistake of the expedition was the nature of its baggage William Bannister had stood out for being allowed to take with him his wheelbarrow his box of bricks and his particular favourite the dying pig which you blew out and then allowed to collapse with a pleasing noise These properties had struck his parents as excessive but he was firm and when he gave signs of being determined to fight it out on these lines if it took all the summer they gave in Steve had no difficulty in smuggling William into his grandfather s house He was a great favourite below stairs there His great ally was the English butler Keggs Keggs was a stout dignified pigeon toed old sinner who cast off the butler when not on duty and displayed himself as something of a rounder He was a man of many parts It was his chief relaxation to look in at Broadway hotels while some big fight was in progress out West to watch the ticker and assure himself that the man he had backed with a portion of the loot which he had accumulated in the form of tips was doing justice to his judgment for in private Keggs was essentially the sport It was this that so endeared Steve to him A few years ago Keggs had won considerable sums by backing Steve and the latter was always given to understand that as far as the lower regions of it were concerned the house on Fifth Avenue was open to him at all hours To day he greeted Steve with enthusiasm and suggested a cigar in the pantry before the latter should proceed to his work He ain t ready for you yet mister Dingle He s lookin over some papers in for goodness sake who s this He had caught sight of William Bannister who having wriggled free of Steve was being made much of by the maids The kid said Steve briefly Not Steve nodded Sure His grandson Keggs solemnity increased You aren t going to take him upstairs with you Surest thing you know That s why I brought him Don t you do it mister Dingle E s in an awful temper this morning he gets worse and worse he ll fire you as soon as look at you Can t be helped I ve got me instructions You always were game said Keggs admiringly I used to see that quick enough before you retired from active work Well good luck to you mister Dingle Steve gathered up William Bannister the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig and made his way to the gymnasium The worst of these pre arranged scenes is that they never happen just as one figured them in one s mind Steve had expected to have to wait a few minutes in the gymnasium then there would be a step outside and the old man would enter The beauty of this to Steve s mind was that he himself would be discovered as the stage term is the onus of entering and opening the conversation would be on mister Bannister And as everybody who has ever had an awkward interview knows this makes all the difference But the minutes passed and still no grandfather The nervousness which he had with difficulty expelled began to return to Steve This was exactly like having to wait in the ring while one s opponent tried to get one s goat by dawdling in the dressing room An attempt to relieve himself by punching the ball was a dismal failure At the first bang of the leather against the wood William Bannister who had been working in a pre occupied way at the dying pig threw his head back and howled and would not be comforted till Steve took out the rope and skipped before him much as dancers used to dance before oriental monarchs in the old days Steve was just saying to himself for the fiftieth time that he was a fool to have come when Keggs arrived with the news that mister Bannister was too busy to take his usual exercise this morning and that Steve was at liberty to go It speaks well for Steve s character that he did not go He would have given much to retire for the old man was one of the few people who inspired in him anything resembling fear But he could not return tamely to the studio with his mission unaccomplished Say ask him if he can see me for a minute Say it is important Keggs eye rested on William Bannister and he shook his head I shouldn t mister Dingle Really I shouldn t You don t know what an ugly mood he s in Something s been worrying him It s what you might call courting disaster Gee Do you think I want to do it I ve just got to That s all there is to it A few moments later Keggs returned with the news that mister Bannister would see Dingle in the library Come along kid said Steve Gimme hold of the excess baggage and let s get a move on So in the end it was mister Bannister who was discovered and Steve who made the entrance And as Steve pointed out to Kirk later it just made all the difference The effect of the change on Steve was to make him almost rollicking in his manner as if he and mister Bannister were the nucleus of an Old Home Week celebration or two old college chums meeting after long absence Nervousness on the rare occasions when he suffered from it generally had that effect on him He breezed into the library carrying the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig and trailing William in his wake William s grandfather was seated with his back to the door dictating a letter to one of his secretaries He looked up as Steve entered He took in Steve and William in a rapid glance and guessed the latter s identity in an instant He had expected something of this sort ever since he had heard of his grandson s birth Indeed he had been somewhat surprised that the visit had not occurred before He betrayed no surprise One moment Dingle he said and turned to the secretary again A faint sneer came and went on his face The delay completed Steve s discomfiture He placed the wheel harrow on the floor the box of bricks on the wheelbarrow and the dying pig on the box of bricks whence it was instantly removed and inflated by William Referring to your letter of the eighth said mister Bannister in his cold level voice He was interrupted by the incisive cry of the dying pig Ask your son to be quiet Dingle he said impassively Steve was staggered Say this ain t my son squire he began breezily Your nephew then or whatever relation he happens to be to you He resumed his dictation Steve wiped his forehead and looked helplessly at the White Hope who having discarded the dying pig was now busy with the box of bricks Steve wished he had not come He was accustomed to the primitive exhibition of emotions having moved in circles where the wrathful expressed their wrath in a normal manner Anger which found its expression in an exaggerated politeness was out of his line and made him uncomfortable After what seemed to him a century John Bannister dismissed the secretary Even then however he did not come immediately to Steve He remained for a few moments writing with his back turned Then just when Steve had given up hope of ever securing his attention he turned suddenly Well Say it s this way colonel Steve had begun when a triumphant cry from the direction of the open window stopped him The White Hope was kneeling on a chair looking down into the street Bix he explained over his shoulder Kindly ring the bell Dingle said mister Bannister unmoved Your little nephew appears to have dropped his bricks into Fifth Avenue In answer to the summons Keggs appeared He looked anxious Keggs said mister Bannister tell one of the footmen to go out into the avenue and pick up some wooden bricks which he will find there Dingle s little brother has let some fall As Keggs left the room Steve s pent up nervousness exploded in a whirl of words Aw say boss quit yer kiddin You know this kid ain t anything to do with me Why say how would he be any relation of a roughneck like me Come off the roof bo You know well enough who he is He s your grandson On the level mister Bannister looked at William now engaged in running the wheelbarrow up and down the room emitting the while a curious sound possibly to encourage an imaginary horse The inspection did not seem to excite him or afford him any pleasure Oh he said Steve was damped but resumed gamely Say boss this is the greatest kid on earth I m not stringing you honest He s a wonder On the level did you ever see a kid that age with a pair of shoulders on him like what this kid s got Say squire what s the matter with calling the fight off and starting fair Miss Ruth would be tickled to death if you would Can the rough stuff colonel I know you think you ve been given a raw deal Kirk chipping in like that and copping off Miss Ruth but for the love of Mike what does it matter You seen for yourself what a dandy kid this is Well then check your grouch with your hat Do the square thing Have out the auto and come right round to the studio and make it up What s wrong with that colonel Honest they d be tickled clean through At this point Keggs entered followed by a footman carrying wooden bricks Keggs said mister Bannister telephone for the automobile at once That s the talk colonel cried Steve joyfully I know you were a sport to take me down to Wall Street Keggs bowed Oh Keggs said mister Bannister as he turned to leave Sir Another thing See that Dingle does not enter the house again And mister Bannister resumed his writing while Steve gathering up the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig took William by the hand and retreated That terminated Ruth s attempts to conciliate her father There remained Bailey From Bailey she was prepared to stand no nonsense Meeting him on the street she fairly kidnapped him driving him into a taxicab and pushing him into the studio where he was confronted by his nephew Bailey came poorly through the ordeal William Bannister a stern critic weighed him up in one long stare found him wanting and announced his decision with all the strength of powerful lungs In the end he had to be removed hiccupping and Bailey after lingering a few uneasy moments making conversation to Kirk departed with such a look about the back of him as he sprang into his cab that Ruth felt that the visit was one which would not be repeated She went back into the studio with a rather heavy heart She was fond of Bailey The sight of Kirk restored her After all what had happened was only what she had expected She had chosen her path and she did not regret it Chapter X An Interlude of Peace Two events of importance in the small world which centred round William B Winfield occurred at about this time The first was the entrance of Mamie the second the exit of missus Porter Mamie was the last of a series of nurses who came and went in somewhat rapid succession during the early years of the White Hope s life She was introduced by Steve who it seemed had known her since she was a child She was the nineteen year old daughter of a compositor on one of the morning papers a little mouselike thing with tiny hands and feet a soft voice and eyes that took up far more than their fair share of her face She had had no professional experience as a nursery maid but as Steve pointed out the fact that in the absence of her mother who had died some years previously she had had sole charge of three small brothers at the age when small brothers are least easily handled and had steered them through to the office boy age without mishap put her extremely high in the class of gifted amateurs Mamie was accordingly given a trial and survived it triumphantly William Bannister that discerning youth took to her at once Kirk liked the neat way she moved about the studio his heart being still sore at the performance of one of her predecessors who had upset and put a substantial foot through his masterpiece that same Ariadne in Naxos which Lora Delane Porter had criticised on the occasion of her first visit to the studio Ruth for her part was delighted with Mamie As for Steve though as an outside member of the firm he cannot be considered to count he had long ago made up his mind about her Some time before when he had found it impossible for him to be in her presence still less to converse with her without experiencing a warm clammy shooting sensation and a feeling of general weakness similar to that which follows a well directed blow at the solar plexus he had come to the conclusion that he must be in love The furious jealousy which assailed him on seeing her embraced by and embracing a stout person old enough to be her father convinced him of this The discovery that the stout man actually was her father s brother relieved his mind to a certain extent but the episode left him shaken He made up his mind to propose at once and get it over When Mamie joined the garrison of No ninety a year later the dashing feat was still unperformed There was that about Mamie which unmanned Steve She was so small and dainty that the ruggedness which had once been his pride seemed to him when he thought of her an insuperable defect The conviction that he was a roughneck deepened in him and tied his tongue The defection of missus Porter was a gradual affair From a very early period in the new regime she had been dissatisfied Accustomed to rule she found herself in an unexpectedly minor position She had definite views on the hygienic upbringing of children and these she imparted to Ruth who listened pleasantly smiled and ignored them missus Porter was not used to such treatment She found Ruth considerably less malleable than she had been before marriage and she resented the change Kirk coming in one afternoon found Ruth laughing It s only Aunt Lora she said She will come in and lecture me on how to raise babies She s crazy about microbes It s the new idea Sterilization and all that She thinks that everything a child touches ought to be sterilized first to kill the germs Bill s running awful risks being allowed to play about the studio like this Kirk looked at his son and heir who was submitting at that moment to be bathed He was standing up It was a peculiarity of his that he refused to sit down in a bath being apparently under the impression when asked to do so that there was a conspiracy afoot to drown him I don t see how the kid could be much fitter It s not so much what he is now She is worrying about what might happen to him She can talk about bacilli till your flesh creeps Honestly if Bill ever did get really ill I believe Aunt Lora could talk me round to her views about them in a minute It s only the fact that he is so splendidly well that makes it seem so absurd Kirk laughed It s all very well to laugh You haven t heard her I ve caught myself wavering a dozen times Do you know she says a child ought not to be kissed It has struck me said Kirk meditatively that your Aunt Lora if I may make the suggestion is the least bit of what Steve would call a shy dome Is there anything else she had mentioned Hundreds of things Bill ought to be kept in a properly sterilized nursery with sterilized toys and sterilized everything and the temperature ought to be just so high and no higher and just so low and no lower Get her to talk about it to you She makes you wonder why everybody is not dead This is a new development surely Has she ever broken out in this place before Oh yes In the old days she often used to talk about it She has written books about it I thought her books were all about the selfishness of the modern young man in not marrying Not at all Some of them are about how to look after the baby It s no good the modern young man marrying if he s going to murder his baby directly afterward is it Something in that There s just one objection to this sterilized nursery business though which she doesn t seem to have detected How am I going to provide these things on an income of five thousand and at the same time live in that luxury which the artist soul demands Bill my lad you ll have to sacrifice yourself for your father s good When I m a millionaire we ll see about it Meanwhile Meanwhile said Ruth come and be dried before you catch your death of cold She gathered William Bannister into her lap I pity any germ that tries to play catch as catch can with that infant remarked Kirk He d simply flatten it out in a round Did you ever see such a chest on a kid of that age It was after the installation of Whiskers at the studio that the diminution of missus Porter s visits became really marked There was something almost approaching a battle over Whiskers who was an Irish terrier puppy which Hank Jardine had presented to William Bannister as a belated birthday present missus Porter utterly excommunicated Whiskers Nothing she maintained was so notoriously supercharged with bacilli as a long haired dog If this was true William Bannister certainly gave them every chance to get to work upon himself It was his constant pleasure to clutch Whiskers to him in a vice like clinch to bury his face in his shaggy back and generally to court destruction Yet the more he clutched the healthier did he appear to grow and missus Porter s demand for the dog s banishment was overruled missus Porter retired in dudgeon She liked to rule and at No ninety she felt that she had become merely among those present She was in the position of a mother country whose colony has revolted For years she had been accustomed to look on Ruth as a disciple a weaker spirit whom she could mould to her will and now Ruth was refusing to be moulded So missus Porter s visits ceased Ruth still saw her at the apartment when she cared to go there but she kept away from the studio She considered that in the matter of William Bannister her claim had been jumped that she had been deposed and she withdrew I shall bear up said Kirk when this fact was brought home to him I mistrust your Aunt Lora as I should mistrust some great natural force which may become active at any moment and give you yours An earthquake for instance I have no quarrel with your Aunt Lora in her quiescent state but I fear the developments of that giant mind We are better off without her All the same said Ruth loyally she s rather a dear And we ought to remember that if it hadn t been for her you and I would never have met I do remember it And I m grateful But I can t help feeling that a woman capable of taking other people s lives and juggling with them as if they were india rubber balls as she did with ours is likely at any moment to break out in a new place My gratitude to her is the sort of gratitude you would feel toward a cyclone if you were walking home late for dinner and it caught you up and deposited you on your doorstep Your Aunt Lora is a human cyclone No on the whole she s more like an earthquake She has a habit of splitting up and altering the face of the world whenever she feels like it and I m too well satisfied with my world at present to relish the idea of having it changed Little by little the garrison of the studio had been whittled down Except for Steve the community had no regular members outside the family itself Hank was generally out of town Bailey paid one more visit then seemed to consider that he could now absent himself altogether And the members of Kirk s bachelor circle stayed away to a man Their isolation was rendered more complete by the fact that Ruth when she had ornamented New York society had made few real friends Most of the girls she had known bored her They were gushing creatures with a passion for sharing and imparting secrets and Ruth s cool reserve had alienated her from them When she married she dropped out The romance of her wedding gave people something to talk about for a few days and then she was forgotten And so it came about that she had her desire and was able practically to monopolize Kirk He and she and William Bannister lived in a kind of hermit s cell for three and enjoyed this highly unnatural state of things enormously Life had never seemed so full either to Kirk or herself There was always something to do something to think about something to look forward to if it was only a visit to a theatre or the inspection of William Bannister s bath Chapter XI Stung to Action It was in the third year of the White Hope s life that the placid evenness of Kirk s existence began to be troubled The orderly procession of the days was broken by happenings of unusual importance one at least of them extraordinarily unpleasant This was the failure of a certain stock in which nearly half of Kirk s patrimony was invested that capital which had always seemed to him as solid a part of life as the asphalt on which he walked as unchangeable a part of nature as the air he breathed He had always had it and he could hardly bring himself to realize that he was not always to have it It gave him an extraordinary feeling of panic and discomfort when at length he faced the fact squarely that his private means on the possession of which he had based the whole lazy scheme of his life were as much at the mercy of fate as the stake which a gambler flings on the green cloth He did not know enough of business to understand the complicated processes by which a stock hitherto supposed to be as impregnable as municipal bonds had been hammered into a ragged remnant in the course of a single day but the result of them was unpleasantly clear and easily grasped His income was cut in half and instead of being a comfortably off young man idly watching the pageant of life from a seat in the grand stand he must now plunge into the crowd and endeavour to earn a living as others did For his losses did not begin and end with the ruin of this particular stock At intervals during the past two years he had been nibbling at his capital and now forced to examine his affairs frankly and minutely he was astonished at the inroads he had made upon it There had been the upkeep of the summer shack he had bought in Connecticut There had been expenses in connection with William Bannister There had been little treats for Ruth There had been cigars and clothes and dinners and taxi cabs and all the other trifles which cost nothing but mount up and make a man wander beyond the bounds of his legitimate income It was borne in upon Kirk as he reflected upon these things that the only evidence he had shown of the possession of the artistic temperament had been the joyous carelessness of his extravagance In that only had he been the artist It shocked him to think how little honest work he had done during the past two years He had lived in a golden haze into which work had not entered He was to be shocked still more very soon Stung to action by his thoughts he embarked upon a sweeping attack on the stronghold of those who exchange cash for artists dreams He ransacked the studio and set out on his mission in a cab bulging with large small and medium sized canvases Like a wave receding from a breakwater he returned late in the day a branded failure The dealers had eyed his canvases large small and medium sized and in direct contravention of their professed object in life had refused to deal Only one of them a man with grimy hands but a moderately golden heart after passing a sepia thumb over some of the more ambitious works had offered him fifteen dollars for a little sketch which he had made in an energetic moment of William Bannister crawling on the floor This the dealer asserted was the sort of darned mushy stuff the public fell for and he held it to be worth the fifteen but not a cent more Kirk humble by now accepted three battered looking bills and departed He had a long talk with Ruth that night and rose from it in the frame of mind which in some men is induced by prayer Ruth was quite marvellously sensible and sympathetic I wanted you she said in answer to his self reproaches and here we are together It s simply nonsense to talk about ruining my life and dragging me down What does it matter about this money We have got plenty left We ve got about as much left as you used to spend on hats in the old days Well we can easily make it do I ve thought for some time that we were growing too extravagant And talking of hats I had no right to have that last one you bought me It was wickedly expensive We can economize there at any rate We can get along splendidly on what you have now Besides directly you settle down and start to paint we shall be quite rich again Kirk laughed grimly I wish you were a dealer he said Fifteen dollars is what I have managed to extract from them so far One of the Great Unwashed on Sixth Avenue gave me that for that sketch I did of Bill on the floor Which took you about three minutes to do Ruth pointed out triumphantly You see You re bound to make a fortune if you stick to it Kirk put his arm round her and gave her a silent hug of gratitude He had dreaded this talk and lo it was putting new life into him They sat for a few moments in silence I don t deserve it said Kirk at last Instead of comforting me like this and making me think I m rather a fine sort of a fellow you ought to be lashing me with scorpions I don t suppose any man has ever made such a criminal idiot of himself in this city before You couldn t tell that this stock was going to fail No but I could have done some work these last three years and made it not matter whether it failed or not You can t comfort me out of that knowledge I knew all along that I was being a waster and a loafer but I was so happy that I didn t mind I was so interested in seeing what you and the kid would do next that I didn t seem to have time to work And the result is that I ve gone right back There was a time when I really could paint a bit Not much it s true but enough to get along with Well I m going to start it again in earnest now and if I don t make good well there s always Hank s offer Ruth turned a little pale They had discussed Hank s offer before but then life had been bright and cloudless and Hank s offer a thing to smile at Now it had assumed an uncomfortably practical aspect You will make good said Ruth I ll do my best said Kirk But even as he spoke his mind was pondering on the proposition which Hank had made Hank always flitting from New York into the unknown and back again had called at the studio one evening after a long absence looking sick and tired He was one of those lean wiry men whom it is unusual to see in this condition and Kirk was sympathetic and inquisitive Hank needed no pressing He was full of his story I ve been in Colombia he said I got back on a fruit steamer this morning Do you know anything of Colombia Kirk reflected Only that there s generally a revolution there he said There wasn t anything of that kind this trip except in my interior Hank pulled thoughtfully at his pipe The odour of his remarkable brand of tobacco filled the studio I ve had a Hades of a time he said simply Kirk looked at him curiously Hank was in a singularly chastened mood to night What took you there Gold Gold Mining Hank nodded I didn t know there were gold mines in that part of the world said Kirk There are The gold that filled the holds of Spanish galleons in the sixteenth century came from Colombia The place is simply stiff with old Spanish relics But surely the mines must have been worked out ages ago Only on the surface Kirk laughed How do you mean only on the surface Explain I don t know a thing about gold except that getting it out of picture dealers is like getting blood out of a turnip It s simple enough The earth hoards its gold in two ways There s auriferous rock and auriferous dirt If the stuff is in the rock you crush it If it s in the dirt you wash it It sounds simple It is The difficult part is finding it And you have done that I have Or I m practically certain I have At any rate I know that I have discovered the ditches made by the Spaniards three hundred years ago If there was gold there in those days there is apt to be gold there now Only it isn t on the surface any longer They cleaned up as far as the surface is concerned so I have to sink shafts and dig tunnels I see It isn t so simple as it used to be It is practically if you have any knowledge of mining Well what s your trouble asked Kirk Why did you come back Why aren t you out there grabbing it with both hands and getting yourself into shape to be a walking gold mine to your friends I don t like to see this idle spirit in you Hank Hank smoked long and thoughtfully Kirk he said suddenly Well Hank shook his head No it s no good What is no good What do you mean I came back said Hank suddenly lucid with a wild notion of getting you to come in with me on this thing What Go to Colombia with you Hank nodded But of course it s not possible It s no job for a married man Why not If this gold of yours is just lying about in heaps it seems to me that a married man is exactly the man who ought to be around grabbing it Or do you believe that old yarn about two being able to live as cheaply as one Take it from me it s not so If there is gold waiting to be gathered up in handfuls me for it When do we start Can I bring Ruth and the kid I wish we could start If I could have had you with me these last few months I d never have quit But I guess it s out of the question You ve no idea what sort of an inferno it is and I won t let you come into it with your eyes shut But if ever you are in a real tight corner let me know It might be worth your while then to take a few risks Oh there are risks Risks My claims are located along the Atrato River in the Choco district Does that convey anything to you Not a thing The workings are three hundred miles inland Just three hundred miles of pure Hades You can get all the fevers you ever heard of and a few more I got most of them last trip I thought you were looking pretty bad I ought to be I ve swallowed so much quinine since I saw you last that my ears are buzzing still And then there are the insects They all bite Some bite worse than others but not much Darn it even the butterflies bite out there Every animal in the country has some other animal constantly chasing it until a white man comes along when they call a truce and both chase him And the vegetation is so thick and grows so quickly that you have to cut down the jungle about the workings every few days or so to avoid being swamped by it Otherwise finished Hank refilling his pipe and lighting it the place is a pretty good kind of summer resort And you re going back to it Back to the quinine and the beasts and the butterflies Sure The gold runs up to twenty dollars the cubic yard and is worth eighteen dollars an ounce When are you going I m in no hurry This year next year some time never No not never Call it some time And you want me to come too I would give half of whatever there is in the mine to have you come But things being as they are well I guess we can call it off Is there any chance in the world Kirk of your ever ceasing to be a bloated capitalist Could any of your stocks go back on you I doubt it They re pretty gilt edged I fancy though I ve never studied the question of stocks My little gold mine isn t in the same class with yours but it s as solid as a rock and no fevers and insects attached to it either And now the gold mine had proved of less than rock like solidity The most gilt edged of all the stocks had failed The capitalist had become in one brief day the struggling artist Hank s proposal seemed a good deal less fantastic now to Kirk as he prepared for his second onslaught the grand attack on the stronghold of those who bought art with gold Chapter XII A Climax One afternoon about two weeks later Kirk returning to the studio from an unprofitable raid into the region of the dealers found on the table a card bearing the name of missus Robert Wilbur This had been crossed out and beneath it in a straggly hand the name Miss Wilbur had been written The phenomenon of a caller at the cell of the two hermits was so strange that he awaited Ruth s arrival with more than his customary impatience She would be able to identify the visitor George Pennicut questioned on the point had no information of any value to impart A very pretty young lady she was said George with what you might call a lively manner She had seemed disappointed at finding nobody at home No she had left no message Ruth arriving a few moments later was met by Kirk with the card in his hand Can you throw any light on this he said Who is Miss Wilbur who has what you might call a lively manner and appears disappointed when she does not find us at home Ruth looked at the card Sybil Wilbur I wonder what she wants Who is she Let s get that settled first Oh she s a girl I used to know I haven t seen her for two years I thought she had forgotten my existence Call her up on the phone If we don t solve this mystery we shan t sleep to night It s like Robinson Crusoe and the footprint Ruth went to the telephone After a short conversation she turned to Kirk with sparkling eyes and the air of one with news to impart Kirk She wants you to paint her portrait What She s engaged to Bailey Just got engaged And the first thing she does is to insist on his letting her come to you for her portrait Ruth bubbled with laughter It s to be a birthday present for Bailey and Bailey has got to pay for it That s so exactly like Sybil I hope the portrait will be She s taking chances I think it s simply sweet of her She s a real friend At fairly long intervals apparently Did you say you had not seen her for two years She is an erratic little thing with an awfully good heart I feel touched at her remembering us Oh Kirk you must do a simply wonderful portrait something that everybody will talk about and then our fortune will be made You will become the only painter that people will go to for their portraits Kirk did not answer His experiences of late had developed in him an unwonted mistrust of his powers To this was added the knowledge that except for an impressionist study of Ruth for private exhibition only he had never attempted a portrait To be called upon suddenly like this to show his powers gave him much the same feeling which he had experienced when called upon as a child to recite poetry before an audience It was a species of stage fright But it was certainly a chance Portrait painting was an uncommonly lucrative line of business His imagination stirred by Ruth s saw visions of wealthy applicants turned away from the studio door owing to pressure of work on the part of the famous man for whose services they were bidding vast sums By Jove he said thoughtfully Another aspect of the matter occurred to him I wonder what Bailey thinks about it Oh he s probably so much in love with her that he doesn t mind what she does Besides Bailey likes you Does he Oh well if he doesn t he will This will bring you together I suppose he knows about it Oh yes Sybil said he did It s all settled She will be here to morrow for the first sitting Kirk spoke the fear that was in his mind Ruth old girl I m horribly nervous about this I am taken with a sort of second sight I see myself making a ghastly failure of this job and Bailey knocking me down and refusing to come across with the cheque Sybil is bringing the cheque with her to morrow said Ruth simply Is she said Kirk Now I wonder if that makes it worse or better I m trying to think Sybil Wilbur fluttered in next day at noon a tiny restless creature who darted about the studio like a humming bird She effervesced with the joy of life She uttered little squeaks of delight at everything she saw She hugged Ruth beamed at Kirk went wild over William Bannister thought the studio too cute for words insisted on being shown all over it and talked incessantly It was about two o clock before she actually began to sit and even then she was no statue A thought would come into her small head and she would whirl round to impart it to Ruth destroying in a second the pose which it had taken Kirk ten painful minutes to fix Kirk was too amused to be irritated She was such a friendly little soul and so obviously devoted to Ruth that he felt she was entitled to be a nuisance as a sitter He wondered more and more what weird principle of selection had been at work to bring Bailey and this butterfly together He had never given any deep thought to the study of his brother in law s character but from his small knowledge of him he would have imagined some one a trifle more substantial and serious as the ideal wife for him Life he conceived was to Bailey a stately march Sybil Wilbur evidently looked on it as a mad gallop Ruth felt the same She was fond of Sybil but she could not see her as the fore ordained missus Bailey I suppose she swept him off his feet she said It just shows that you never really get to know a person even if you re their sister Bailey must have all sorts of hidden sides to his character which I never noticed unless she has But I don t think there is much of that about Sybil She s just a child But she s very amusing isn t she She enjoys life so furiously I think Bailey will find her rather a handful Does she ever sit still by the way If she is going to act right along as she did to day this portrait will look like that cubist picture of the Dance at the Spring As the sittings went on Miss Wilbur consented gradually to simmer down and the portrait progressed with a fair amount of speed But Kirk was conscious every day of a growing sensation of panic He was trying his very hardest but it was bad work and he knew it His hand had never had very much cunning but what it had had it had lost in the years of his idleness Every day showed him more clearly that the portrait of Miss Wilbur on which so much depended was an amateurish daub He worked doggedly on but his heart was cold with that chill that grips the artist when he looks on his work and sees it to be bad At last it was finished Ruth thought it splendid Sybil Wilbur pronounced it cute as she did most things Kirk could hardly bear to look at it In its finished state it was worse than he could have believed possible In the old days he had been a fair painter with one or two bad faults Now the faults seemed to have grown like weeds choking whatever of merit he might once have possessed This was a horrible production and he was profoundly thankful when it was packed up and removed from the studio But behind his thankfulness lurked the feeling that all was not yet over that there was worse to come It came It was heralded by a tearful telephone call from Miss Wilbur who rang up Ruth with the agitated information that Bailey didn t seem to like it And on the heels of the message came Bailey in person pink from forehead to collar and almost as wrathful as he had been on the great occasion of his first visit to the studio His annoyance robbed his speech of its normal stateliness He struck a colloquial note unusual with him I guess you know what I ve come about he said He had found Kirk alone in the studio as ill luck would have it In the absence of Ruth he ventured to speak more freely than he would have done in her presence It s an infernal outrage he went on I ve been stung and you know it Kirk said nothing His silence infuriated Bailey It s the portrait I m speaking about the portrait if you have the nerve to call it that of Miss Wilbur I was against her sitting to you from the first but she insisted Now she s sorry It s as bad as all that is it said Kirk dully He felt curiously indisposed to fight A listlessness had gripped him He was even a little sorry for Bailey He saw his point of view and sympathized with it Yes said Bailey fiercely It is and you know it Kirk nodded Bailey was quite right He did know it It s a joke went on Bailey shrilly I can t hang it up People would laugh at it And to think that I paid you all that money for it I could have got a real artist for half the price That is easily remedied said Kirk I will send you a cheque to morrow Bailey was not to be appeased The venom of more than three years cried out for utterance He had always held definite views upon Kirk and Heaven had sent him the opportunity of expressing them Yes I dare say he said contemptuously That would settle the whole thing wouldn t it What do you think you are a millionaire Talking as if that amount of money made no difference to you Where does my sister come in How about Ruth You sneak her away from her home and then Kirk s lethargy left him He flushed I think that will be about all Bannister he said He spoke quietly but his voice trembled But Bailey s long dammed hatred having at last found an outlet was not to be checked in a moment Will it Will it The hell it will Let me tell you that I came here to talk straight to you and I m going to do it It s about time you had your darned dime novel romance shown up to you the way it strikes somebody else You think you re a tremendous dashing twentieth century Young Lochinvar don t you You thought you had done a pretty smooth bit of work when you sneaked Ruth away You You haven t enough backbone in you even to make a bluff at working to support her You re just what my father said you were a loafer who pretends to be an artist You ve got away with it up to now but you ve shown yourself up at last You damned waster Kirk walked to the door and flung it open You re perfectly right Bannister he said quietly Everything you have said is quite true And now would you mind going I ve not finished yet Yes you have Bailey hesitated The first time frenzy had left him and he was beginning to be a little ashamed of himself for having expressed his views in a manner which though satisfying was he felt less dignified than he could have wished He looked at Kirk who was standing stiffly by the door Something in his attitude decided Bailey to leave well alone Such had been his indignation that it was only now that for the first time it struck him that his statement of opinion had not been made without considerable bodily danger to himself Jarred nerves had stood him in the stead of courage but now his nerves were soothed and he saw things clearly He choked down what he had intended to say and walked out Kirk closed the door softly behind him and began to pace the studio floor as he had done on that night when Ruth had fought for her life in the room upstairs His mind worked slowly at first Then as it cleared he began to think more and more rapidly till the thoughts leaped and ran like tongues of fire scorching him It was all true That was what hurt Every word that Bailey had flung at him had been strictly just He had thought himself a fine romantic fellow He was a waster and a loafer who pretended to be an artist He had thrown away the little talent he had once possessed He had behaved shamefully to Ruth shirking his responsibilities and idling through life He realized it now when it was too late Suddenly through the chaos of his reflections there shone out clearly one coherent thought the recollection of what Hank Jardine had offered to him If ever you are in a real tight corner His brain cleared He sat down calmly to wait for Ruth His mind was made up Hank s offer was the way out the only way out and he must take it BOOK TWO Chapter I Empty handed The steamship Santa Barbara of the United Fruit Line moved slowly through the glittering water of the bay on her way to dock Out at quarantine earlier in the morning there had been a mist through which passing ships loomed up vague and shapeless but now the sun had dispersed it and a perfect May morning welcomed the Santa Barbara home Kirk leaned on the rail looking with dull eyes on the city he had left a year before Only a year It seemed ten As he stood there he felt an old man A drummer a cheery soul who had come aboard at Porto Rico sauntered up beaming with well being and good fellowship Looks pretty good sir said he Kirk did not answer He had not heard Some burg ventured the drummer Again encountering silence he turned away hurt This churlish attitude on the part of one returning to God s country on one of God s own mornings surprised and wounded him To him all was right with the world He had breakfasted well he was smoking a good cigar and he was strong in the knowledge that he had done well by the firm this trip and that bouquets were due to be handed to him in the office on lower Broadway He was annoyed with Kirk for having cast even a tiny cloud upon his contentment He communicated his feelings to the third officer who happened to come on deck at that moment Say who is that guy he asked complainingly The big son of a gun leaning on the rail Seems like he d got a hangover this morning Is he deaf and dumb or just plain grouchy The third officer eyed Kirk s back with sympathy I shouldn t worry him Freddie he said I guess if you had been up against it like him you d be shy on the small talk That s a fellow called Winfield They carried him on board at Colon He was about all in Got fever in Colombia inland at the mines and nearly died His pal did die Ever met Hank Jardine Long thin man The other nodded One of the best He made two trips with us And he s dead Died of fever away back in the interior where there s nothing much else except mosquitoes He and Winfield went in there after gold Did they get any asked the drummer interested The third officer spat disgustedly over the rail You ask Winfield Or rather don t because I guess it s not his pet subject He told me all about it when he was getting better There was gold there all right in chunks It only needed to be dug for And somebody else did the digging Of all the skin games It made me pretty hot under the collar and it wasn t me that was stung Out there you can t buy land if you re a foreigner you have to lease it from the natives Poor old Hank leased his bit all right and when he d got to his claim he found somebody else working on it It seemed there had been a flaw in his agreement and the owners had let it over his head to these other guys who had slipped them more than what Hank had done What did he do He couldn t do anything They were the right side of the law or what they call law out there There was nothing to do except beat it back again three hundred miles to the coast That s where they got the fever which finished Hank So you can understand concluded the third officer that mister Winfield isn t in what you can call a sunny mood If I were you I d go and talk to someone else if conversation s what you need Kirk stood motionless at the rail thinking It was not what was past that occupied his thoughts as the third officer had supposed it was the future The forlorn hope had failed he was limping back to Ruth wounded and broken He had sent her a wireless message She would be at the dock to meet him How could he face her Fate had been against him it was true but he was in no mood to make excuses for himself He had failed That was the beginning and the end of it He had set out to bring back wealth and comfort to her and he was returning empty handed That was what the immediate future held the meeting with Ruth And after His imagination was not equal to the task of considering that He had failed as an artist There was no future for him there He must find some other work But he was fit for no other work He had no training What could he do in a city where keenness of competition is a tradition It would be as if an unarmed man should attack a fortress The thought of the years he had wasted was very bitter Looking back he could see how fate had tricked him into throwing away his one talent He had had promise With hard work he could have become an artist a professional a man whose work was worth money in the open market He had never had it in him to be a great artist but he had had the facility which goes to make a good worker of the second class He had it still Given the time for hard study it was still in him to take his proper place among painters But time for study was out of his reach now He must set to work at once without a day s delay on something which would bring him immediate money The reflection brought his mind back abruptly to the practical consideration of the future Before him as he stood there the ragged battlements of New York seemed to frown down on him with a cold cruelty that paralysed his mind He had seen them a hundred times before They should have been familiar and friendly But this morning they were strange and sinister The skyline which daunts the emigrant as he comes up the bay to his new home struck fear into Kirk s heart He turned away and began to walk up and down the deck He felt tired and lonely For the first time he realized just what it meant to him that he should never see Hank again It had been hard almost impossible till now to force his mind to face that fact He had winced away from it But now it would not be avoided It fell upon him like a shadow Hank had filled a place of his own in Kirk s life Theirs had been one of those smooth friendships which absence cannot harm Often they had not seen each other for months at a time Indeed now that he thought of it Hank was generally away and he could not remember that they had ever exchanged letters Yet even so there had been a bond between them which had never broken And now Hank had dropped out Kirk began to think about death As with most men of his temperament it was a subject on which his mind had seldom dwelt never for any length of time His parents had died when he was too young to understand and circumstances had shielded him from the shadow of the great mystery Birth he understood it had forced itself into the scheme of his life but death till now had been a stranger to him The realization of it affected him oddly In a sense he found it stimulating not stimulating as birth had been but more subtly He could recall vividly the thrill that had come to him with the birth of his son For days he had walked as one in a trance The world had seemed unreal like an opium smoker s dream There had been magic everywhere But death had exactly the opposite effect It made everything curiously real himself most of all He had the sensation as he thought of Hank of knowing himself for the first time Somehow he felt strengthened braced for the fight as a soldier might who sees his comrade fall at his side There was something almost vindictive in the feeling that came to him It was too vague to be analysed but it filled him with a desire to fight gave him a sense of determination of which he had never before been conscious It toughened him and made the old easy going Kirk Winfield seem a stranger at whom he could look with detachment and a certain contempt As he walked back along the deck the battlements of the city met his gaze once more But now they seemed less formidable In the leisurely fashion of the home coming ship the Santa Barbara slid into her dock The gangplank was thrust out Kirk walked ashore For a moment he thought that Ruth had not come to meet him Then his heart leaped madly He had seen her There are worse spots in the world than the sheds of the New York customs but few more desolate yet to Kirk just then the shadowy vastness seemed a sunlit garden A flame of happiness blazed up in his mind blotting out in an instant the forebodings which had lurked there like evil creatures in a dark vault The future with its explanations and plans could take care of itself Ruth was a thing of the present He put his arms round her and held her The friendly drummer who chanced to be near observed them with interest and a good deal of pleasure The third officer s story had temporarily destroyed his feeling that all was right with the world and his sympathetic heart welcomed this evidence that life held compensations even for men who had been swindled out of valuable gold mines I guess he s not feeling so worse after all he mused and went on his way with an easy mind to be fawned upon by his grateful firm Ruth was holding Kirk at arm s length her eyes full of tears at the sight You poor boy how thin you are I had fever It s an awful place for fever out there Kirk Oh I m all right now The voyage set me up They made a great fuss over me on board Ruth s hand was clinging to his arm He squeezed it against his side It was wonderful to him this sense of being together again after these centuries of absence It drove from his mind the thought of all the explanations which sooner or later he had got to make Whatever might come after he would keep this moment in his memory golden and untarnished Don t you worry about me he said Now that I ve found you again I m feeling better than I ever did in my life You wait till you see me sparring with Steve to morrow By the way how is Steve Splendid And Bill Ruth drew herself up haughtily You dare to ask about your son after Steve How clumsy that sounds I mean you dare to put Steve before your son I believe you ve only just realized that you have a son I ve only just realized there s anybody or anything in the world except my wife Well after that I suppose I ve got to forgive you Since you have asked after Bill at last I may tell you that he s very well indeed Kirk s eyes glowed He ought to be a great kid by now He is And Mamie Have you still got her I wouldn t lose her for a million And Whiskers I m afraid Whiskers is gone Not dead No I gave him away For Heaven s sake Why Well dear the fact is I ve come around to Aunt Lora s way of thinking Eh About germs Kirk laughed the first real laugh he had had for a year That insane fad of hers Ruth was serious I have she said We re taking a great deal more care of Bill than in the old days I hate to think of the way I used to let him run around wild then He might have died What nonsense He was simply bursting with health all the time I had a horrible shock after you left Ruth went on The poor little fellow was awfully ill with some kind of a fever The doctor almost gave him up Good heavens Aunt Lora helped me to nurse him and she made me see how I had been exposing him to all sorts of risks and well now we guard against them There was a silence I grew to rely on her a great deal Kirk when you were away You know I always used to before we were married She s so wonderfully strong And then when your letters stopped coming There aren t any postal arrangements out there in the interior It was the worst part of it not being able to write to you or hear from you Heavens what an exile I ve been this last year Anything may have happened Perhaps something has said Ruth mysteriously What do you mean Wait and see Oh I know one thing that has happened I ve been looking at you all this while trying to think what it was You ve grown a beard and it looks perfectly horrid Sheer laziness It shall come off this very day I knew you would hate it I certainly do It makes you look so old Kirk s face clouded I feel old For the first time since he had left the ship the memory of Hank had come back to him The sight of Ruth had driven it away but now it swept back on him The golden moment was over Life with all its troubles and its explanations and its burdening sense of failure must be faced What s the matter asked Ruth startled by the sudden change I was thinking of poor old Hank Where is mister Jardine Didn t he come back with you He s dead dear said Kirk gently He died of fever while we were working our way back to the coast Oh It was the idea of death that shocked Ruth not the particular manifestation of it Hank had not touched her life She had begun by disliking him and ended by feeling for him the tolerant sort of affection which she might have bestowed upon a dog or a cat Hank as a man was nothing to her and she could not quite keep her indifference out of her voice It was only later when he looked back on this conversation that Kirk realized this At the moment he was unconscious of it significant as it was of the fact that there were points at which his mind and Ruth s did not touch When Ruth spoke again it was to change the subject Well Kirk she said have you come back with your trunk crammed with nuggets You haven t said a word about the mine yet and I m dying to know He groaned inwardly The moment he had been dreading had arrived more swiftly than he had expected It was time for him to face facts No he said shortly Ruth looked at him curiously She met his eyes and saw the pain in them and intuition told her in an instant what Kirk stumbling through his story could not have told her in an hour She squeezed his arm affectionately Don t tell me she said I understand And it doesn t matter It doesn t matter a bit Doesn t matter But Ruth s eyes were dancing Kirk dear I ve something to tell you Wait till we get outside What do you mean You ll soon see They went out into the street Against the kerb a large red automobile was standing The chauffeur touched his cap as he saw them Kirk stared at him dumbly In you get dear said Ruth She met his astonished gaze with a smile of triumph This was her moment the moment for which she had been waiting The chauffeur started the machine I don t understand Whose car is this Mine Yours Ours Oh Kirk darling I was so afraid that you would come back bulging with a fortune that would make my little one look like nothing But you haven t you haven t and it s just splendid She caught his hand and pressed it It s simply sweet of you to look so astonished I was hoping you would This car belongs to us and there s another just as big besides and a house and oh everything you can think of Kirk dear we ve nothing to worry us any longer We re rich Chapter II An Unknown Path Kirk blinked He closed his eyes and opened them again The automobile was still there and he was still in it Ruth was still gazing at him with the triumphant look in her eyes The chauffeur silent emblem of a substantial bank balance still sat stiffly at the steering wheel Rich Kirk repeated Rich Ruth assured him I don t understand Ruth s smile faded Poor father Your father He died just after you sailed Just before Bill got ill She gave a little sigh Kirk how odd life is But It was terrible It was some kind of a stroke He had been working too hard and taking no exercise You know when he sent Steve away that time he didn t engage anybody else in his place He went back to his old way of living which the doctor had warned him against He worked and worked until one day Bailey says he fainted at the office They brought him home and he just went out like a burned out candle I I went to him but for a long time he wouldn t see me Oh Kirk the hours I spent in the library hoping that he would let me come to him But he never did till right at the end Then I went up and he was dying He couldn t speak I don t know now how he felt toward me at the last I kissed him He was all shrunk to nothing I had a horrible feeling that I had never been a real daughter to him But but you know he made it difficult awfully difficult And then he died Bailey was on one side of the bed and I was on the other and the nurse and the doctor were whispering outside the door I could hear them through the transom She slipped her hand into Kirk s and sat silent while the car slid into the traffic of Fifth Avenue For the second time the shadow of the Great Mystery had fallen on the brightness of the perfect morning The car had stopped at Thirty Fourth Street to allow the hurrying crowds to cross the avenue Kirk looked at them with a feeling of sadness It was not caused by John Bannister s death He was too honest to be able to plunge himself into false emotion at will His feeling was more a vague uneasiness almost a presentiment Things changed so quickly in this world Old landmarks shifted as the crowd of strangers was shifting before him now hurrying into his life and hurrying out of it He too had changed Ruth though he had detected no signs of it must be different from the Ruth he had left a year ago The old life was dead What had the new life in store for him Wealth for one thing other standards of living new experiences An odd sensation of regret that this stream of gold had descended upon him deepened his momentary depression They had been so happy he and Ruth and the kid in the old days of the hermit s cell Something that was almost a superstitious fear of this unexpected legacy came upon him It was unlucky money grudgingly given at the eleventh hour He seemed to feel John Bannister watching him with a sneer and he was afraid of him His nerves were still a little unstrung from the horror of his wanderings and the fever had left him weak It seemed to him that there was a curse on the old man s wealth that somehow it was destined to bring him unhappiness The policeman waved his hand The car jerked forward The sudden movement brought him to himself He smiled a little ashamed of having been so fanciful the sky was blue the sun shone a cool breeze put the joy of life into him and at his side Ruth sat smiling now From her too the cloud had been lifted It seems like a fairy story said Kirk breaking the silence that had fallen between them I think it must have been the thought of Bill that made him do it said Ruth He left half his money to Bailey and half to me during my lifetime Bailey s married now by the way She paused I m afraid father never forgave you dear she added He made Bailey the trustee for the money and it goes to Bill in trust after my death She looked at him rather nervously it seemed to Kirk The terms of the will had been the cause of some trouble to her Especially had she speculated on his reception of the news that Bailey was to play so important a part in the administration of the money Kirk had never told her what had passed between him and Bailey that afternoon in the studio but her quick intelligence had enabled her to guess at the truth and she was aware that the minds of the two men their temperaments were naturally antagonistic Kirk s reception of the news relieved her Of course he said He couldn t do anything else He knew nothing of me except that I was a kind of man with whom he was quite out of sympathy He mistrusted all artists I expect in a bunch And anyway an artist is pretty sure to be a bad man of business He would know that And and well what I mean is it strikes me as a very sensible arrangement Why are we stopping here The car had drawn up before a large house on the upper avenue one of those houses which advertise affluence with as little reticence as a fat diamond solitaire We live here said Ruth laughing Kirk drew a long breath Do we By George he exclaimed I see it s going to take me quite a while to get used to this state of things A thought struck him How about the studio Have you got rid of it Of course not The idea After the perfect times we had there We re going to keep it on as an annex Every now and then when we are tired of being rich we ll creep off there and boil eggs over the gas stove and pretend we are just ordinary persons again And oftener than every now and then this particular plutocrat is going to creep off there and try to teach himself to paint pictures Ruth nodded Yes I think you ought to have a hobby It s good for you Kirk said nothing But it was not as a hobby that he was regarding his painting He had come to a knowledge of realities in the wilderness and to an appreciation of the fact that he had a soul which could not be kept alive except by honest work He had the decent man s distaste for living on his wife s money He supposed it was inevitable that a certain portion of it must go to his support but he was resolved that there should be in the sight of the gods who look down on human affairs at least a reasonable excuse for his existence If work could make him anything approaching a real artist he would become one Meanwhile he was quite willing that Ruth should look upon his life work as a pleasant pastime to save him from ennui Even to his wife a man is not always eager to exhibit his soul in its nakedness By the way said Ruth you won t find George Pennicut at the studio He has gone back to England I m sorry I liked George He liked you He left all sorts of messages He nearly wept when he said good bye But he wouldn t stop In a burst of confidence he told me what the trouble was Our blue sky had got on his nerves He wanted a London drizzle again He said the thought of it made him homesick Kirk entered the house thoughtfully Somehow this last piece of news had put the coping stone on the edifice of his his what Depression It was hardly that No it was rather a kind of vague regret for the life which had so definitely ended the feeling which the Romans called desiderium and the Greeks pathos The defection of George Pennicut was a small thing in itself but it meant the removal of another landmark We had some bully good times in that studio he said The words were a requiem The first person whom he met in this great house in the kingdom of which he was to be king consort was a butler of incredible stateliness This was none other than Steve s friend Keggs But round the outlying portions of this official he had perceived as the door opened a section of a woman in a brown dress The butler moving to one side he found himself confronting missus Lora Delane Porter If other things in Kirk s world had changed time had wrought in vain upon the great authoress She looked as masterful as unyielding and as efficient as she had looked at the time of his departure She took his hand without emotion and inspected him keenly You are thinner she remarked I said that Aunt Lora said Ruth Poor boy he s a skeleton You are not so robust I have been ill Ruth interposed He s had fever Aunt Lora and you are not to tease him I should be the last person to tease any man What sort of fever I think it was a blend of all sorts replied Kirk A kind of Irish stew of a fever You are not infectious Certainly not missus Porter checked Ruth as she was about to speak We owe it to William to be careful she explained After all the trouble we have taken to exclude him from germs it is only reasonable to make these inquiries Come along dear said Ruth and I ll show you the house Don t mind Aunt Lora she whispered she means well and she really is splendid with Bill Kirk followed her He was feeling chilled again His old mistrust of missus Porter revived If their brief interview was to be taken as evidence she seemed to have regained entirely her old ascendancy over Ruth He felt vaguely uneasy as a man might who walks in a powder magazine Aunt Lora lives here now observed Ruth casually as they went upstairs Kirk started Literally do you mean Is this her home Ruth smiled at him over her shoulder She won t interfere with you she said Surely this great house is large enough for the three of us Besides she s so devoted to Bill She looks after him all the time of course nowadays I don t get quite so much time to be with him myself One has an awful lot of calls on one I feel Bill is so safe with Aunt Lora on the premises She stopped at a door on the first floor This is Bill s nursery He s out just now Mamie takes him for a drive every morning when it s fine Something impelled Kirk to speak Don t you ever take him for walks in the morning now he asked He used to love it Silly Of course I do when I can manage it For drives rather Aunt Lora is rather against his walking much in the city He might so easily catch something you know She opened the door There she said What do you think of that for a nursery If Kirk had spoken his mind he would have said that of all the ghastly nurseries the human brain could have conceived this was the ghastliest It was a large square room and to Kirk s startled eyes had much the appearance of an operating theatre at a hospital There was no carpet on the tiled floor The walls likewise tiled were so bare that the eye ached contemplating them In the corner by the window stood the little white cot Beside it on the wall hung a large thermometer Various knobs of brass decorated the opposite wall At the farther end of the room was a bath complete with shower and all the other apparatus of a modern tub It was probably the most horrible room in all New York Well what do you think of it demanded Ruth proudly Kirk gazed at her speechless This he said to himself was Ruth his wife who had housed his son in the spare bedroom of the studio and allowed a shaggy Irish terrier to sleep on his bed who had permitted him to play by the hour in the dust of the studio floor who had even assisted him to do so by descending into the dust herself in the role of a bear or a snake What had happened to this world from which he had been absent but one short year Was everybody mad or was he hopelessly behind the times Well Ruth reminded him Kirk eyed the dreadful room It looks clean he said at last It is clean said the voice of Lora Delane Porter proudly behind him She had followed them up the stairs to do the honours of the nursery the centre of her world It is essentially clean There is not an object in that room which is not carefully sterilized night and morning with a weak solution of boric acid Even Mamie inquired Kirk It had been his intention to be mildly jocular but missus Porter s reply showed him that in jest he had spoken the truth Certainly Have you any idea Kirk of the number of germs there are on the surface of the human body It runs into billions You she fixed him with her steely eye you are at the present moment one mass of microbes I sneaked through quarantine all right To the adult there is not so much danger in these microbes provided he or she maintains a reasonable degree of personal cleanliness That is why adults may be permitted to mix with other adults without preliminary sterilization But in the case of a growing child it is entirely different No precaution is excessive So From below at this point there came the sound of the front door bell Ruth went to the landing and looked over the banisters That ought to be Bill and Mamie back from their drive she said The sound of a child s voice came to Kirk as he stood listening and as he heard it all the old feeling of paternal pride and excitement which had left him during his wanderings swept over him like a wave He reproached himself that while the memory of Ruth had been with him during every waking moment of the past year there had been occasions when that of William Bannister had become a little faded He ran down the stairs Hello Mamie he said How are you You re looking well Mamie greeted him with the shy smile which was wont to cause such havoc in Steve s heart And who s this you ve got with you Mamie you know you ve no business going about with young men like this Who is he He stood looking at William Bannister and William Bannister stood looking at him Kirk smiling William staring with the intense gravity of childhood and trying to place this bearded stranger among his circle of friends He seemed to be thinking that the familiarity of the other s manner indicated a certain amount of previous acquaintanceship Watch that busy brain working said Kirk He s trying to place me It s all right Bill old man it s my fault I had no right to spring myself on you with eight feet of beard It isn t giving you a square deal Never mind it s coming off in a few minutes never to return and then perhaps you ll remember that you ve a father Fa a a ar shrieked William Bannister triumphantly taking the cue with admirable swiftness He leaped at Kirk and Kirk swung him up in the air It was quite an effort for William Bannister had grown astonishingly in the past year Pop said he firmly as if resolved to prevent any possibility of mistake Daddy he added continuing to play upon the theme He summed up You re my pop Then satisfied that this was final and that there could now be no chance for Kirk to back out of the contract he reached out a hand and gave a tug at the beard which had led to all the confusion What s this You may well ask said Kirk I got struck that way because I left you and mummy for a whole year But now I m back I m going to be allowed to take it off and give it away Whom shall I give it to Steve Do you think Steve would like it Yes you can go on pulling it it won t break On the other hand I should just like to mention that it s hurting something fierce my son It s fastened on at the other end you know Why Don t ask me That s the way it s built William Bannister obligingly disentangled himself from the beard Where you been he inquired Miles and miles away You know the Battery William Bannister nodded Well a long way past that First I took a ship and went ever so many miles Then I landed and went ever so many more miles with all sorts of beasts trying to bite pieces out of me This interested William Bannister Tigers he inquired I didn t actually see any tigers but I expect they were sneaking round There were mosquitoes though You know what a mosquito is William nodded Bumps he observed crisply That s right You see this lump here just above my mouth Well that s not a mosquito bite that s my nose but think of something about that size and you ll have some idea of what a mosquito bite is like out there But why am I boring you with my troubles Tell me all about yourself You ve certainly been growing whatever else you may have been doing while I ve been away I can hardly lift you Has Steve taught you to box yet At this moment he was aware that he had become the centre of a small group Looking round he found himself gazing into a face so stiff with horror and disapproval that he was startled almost into dropping William What could have happened to induce missus Porter to look like that he could not imagine but her expression checked his flow of light conversation as if it had been turned off with a switch He lowered Bill to the ground What on earth s the matter he asked What has happened Without replying missus Porter made a gesture in the direction of the nursery which had the effect of sending Mamie and her charge off again on the journey upstairs which Kirk s advent had interrupted Bill seemed sorry to go but he trudged sturdily on without remark Kirk followed him with his eyes till he disappeared at the bend of the stairway What s the matter he repeated Are you mad Kirk demanded missus Porter in a tense voice Kirk turned helplessly to Ruth You had better let me explain Aunt Lora she said Of course Kirk couldn t be expected to know poor boy You seem to forget that he has only this minute come into the house Aunt Lora was not to be appeased That is absolutely no excuse He has just left a ship where he cannot have failed to pick up bacilli of every description He has himself only recently recovered from a probably infectious fever He is wearing a beard notoriously the most germ ridden abomination in existence Kirk started He was not proud of his beard but he had not regarded it as quite the pestilential thing which it seemed to be in the eyes of missus Porter And he picks up the child she went on Hugs him Kisses him And you say he could not have known better Surely the most elementary common sense Aunt Lora said Ruth She spoke quietly but there was a note in her voice which acted on missus Porter like magic Her flow of words ceased abruptly It was a small incident but it had the effect of making Kirk grateful as he was for the interruption somehow vaguely uneasy for a moment It seemed to indicate some subtle change in Ruth s character some new quality of hardness added to it The Ruth he had left when he sailed for Colombia would he felt have been incapable of quelling her masterful aunt so very decisively and with such an economy of words It suggested previous warfare in which the elder women had been subdued to a point where a mere exclamation could pull her up when she forgot herself Kirk felt uncomfortable He did not like these sudden discoveries about Ruth I will explain to Kirk she said You go up and see that everything is right in the nursery And amazing spectacle off went missus Porter without another word Ruth put her arm in Kirk s and led him off to the smoking room You may smoke a cigar while I tell you all about Bill she said Kirk lit a cigar bewildered It is always unpleasant to be the person to whom things have to be explained Poor old boy Ruth went on you certainly are thin But about Bill I am afraid you are going to be a little upset about Bill Kirk Aunt Lora has no tact and she will make a speech on every possible occasion but she was right just now It really was rather dangerous picking Bill up like that and kissing him Kirk stared I don t understand Did you expect me to wave my hand to him Or would it have been more correct to bow Don t be so satirical Kirk you wither me No seriously you really mustn t kiss Bill I never do Nobody does What I dare say it sounds ridiculous to you but you were not here when he was so ill and nearly died You remember what I was telling you at the dock About giving Whiskers away Well this is all part of it After what happened I feel like Aunt Lora that we simply can t take too many precautions You saw his nursery Well it would be simply a waste of money giving him a nursery like that if he was allowed to be exposed to infection when he was out of it And I am supposed to be infectious Not more than anybody else There s no need to be hurt about it It s just as much a sacrifice for me So nobody makes a fuss over Bill now is that it Well no Not in the way you mean Pretty dreary outlook for the kid isn t it It s all for his good What a ghastly expression Ruth left her chair and came and sat on the arm of Kirk s She ruffled his hair lightly with the tips of her fingers Kirk who had been disposed to be militant softened instantly The action brought back a flood of memories It conjured up recollections of peaceful evenings in the old studio for this had been a favourite habit of Ruth s It made him feel that he loved her more than he had ever done in his life and incidentally that he was a brute to try and thwart her in anything whatsoever I know it s horrid for you dear old boy said Ruth coaxingly but do be good and not make a fuss about it Not kissing Bill doesn t mean that you need be any the less fond of him I know it will be strange at first I didn t get used to it for ever so long but honestly it is for his good however ghastly the expression of the thing may sound It s treating the kid like a wretched invalid grumbled Kirk You wait till you see him playing and then you ll know if he s a wretched invalid or not May I see him playing Don t be silly Of course I thought I had better ask Being the perambulating plague spot I am I was not taking any risks How horribly self centred you are You will talk as if you were in some special sort of quarantine I keep on telling you it s the same for all of us I suppose when I m with him I shall have to be sterilized I don t think it necessary myself but Aunt Lora does so it s always done It humours her and it really isn t any trouble Besides it may be necessary after all One never knows and it s best to be on the safe side Kirk laid down his cigar firmly the cold cigar which stress of emotion had made him forget to keep alight Ruth old girl he said earnestly this is pure lunacy Ruth s fingers wandered idly through his hair She did not speak for some moments You will be good about it won t you Kirk dear she said at last It is curious what a large part hair and its treatment may play in the undoing of strong men The case of Samson may be recalled in this connection Kirk with Ruth ruffling the wiry growth that hid his scalp was incapable of serious opposition He tried to be morose and resolute but failed miserably Oh very well he grunted That s a good boy And you promise you won t go hugging Bill again Very well There s an angel for you Now I ll fix you a cocktail as a reward Well mind you sterilize it carefully Ruth laughed Having gained her point she could afford to She made the cocktail and brought it to him And now I ll be off and dress and then you can take me out to lunch somewhere Aren t you dressed My goodness no Not for going to restaurants You forget that I m one of the idle rich now I spend my whole day putting on different kinds of clothes I ve a position to keep up now mister Winfield Kirk lit a fresh cigar and sat thinking The old feeling of desolation which had attacked him as he came up the bay had returned He felt like a stranger in a strange world Life was not the same Ruth was not the same Nothing was the same The more he contemplated the new regulations affecting Bill the chillier and more unfriendly did they seem to him He could not bring himself to realize Ruth as one of the great army of cranks preaching and carrying out the gospel of Lora Delane Porter It seemed so at variance with her character as he had known it He could not seriously bring himself to believe that she genuinely approved of these absurd restrictions Yet apparently she did He looked into the future It had a grey and bleak aspect He seemed to himself like a man gazing down an unknown path full of unknown perils Chapter III The Misadventure of Steve Kirk was not the only person whom the sudden change in the financial position of the Winfield family had hit hard The blighting effects of sudden wealth had touched Steve while Kirk was still in Colombia In a sense it had wrecked Steve s world Nobody had told him to stop or even diminish the number of his visits but the fact remained that by the time Kirk returned to New York he had practically ceased to go to the house on Fifth Avenue For all his roughness Steve possessed a delicacy which sometimes almost amounted to diffidence and he did not need to be told that there was a substantial difference as far as he was concerned between the new headquarters of the family and the old At the studio he had been accustomed to walk in when it pleased him sure of a welcome but he had an idea that he did not fit as neatly into the atmosphere of Fifth Avenue as he had done into that of Sixty First Street and nobody disabused him of it It was perhaps the presence of missus Porter that really made the difference In spite of the compliments she had sometimes paid to his common sense missus Porter did not put Steve at his ease He was almost afraid of her Consequently when he came to Fifth Avenue he remained below stairs talking pugilism with Keggs It was from Keggs that he first learned of the changes that had taken place in the surroundings of William Bannister I ve ad the privilege of serving in some of the best houses in England said the butler one evening as they sat smoking in the pantry and I ve never seen such goings on I don t hold with the pampering of children What do you mean pampering asked Steve Well Lord love a duck replied the butler who in his moments of relaxation was addicted to homely expletives of the lower London type If you don t call it pampering what do you call pampering He ain t allowed to touch nothing that ain t been it s slipped my memory what they call it but it s got something to do with microbes They sprinkle stuff on his toys and on his clothes and on his nurse what s more and on any one who comes to see him And his nursery ain t what I call a nursery at all It s nothing more or less than a private ospital with its white tiles and its antiseptics and what not and the temperature just so and no lower nor higher I don t call it aving a proper faith in Providence pampering and fussing over a child to that extent You re stringing me Not a bit of it mister Dingle I ve seen the nursery with my own eyes and I ave my information direct from the young person who looks after the child But say in the old days that kid was about the dandiest little sport that ever came down the pike You seen him that day I brought him round to say hello to the old man He didn t have no nursery at all then let alone one with white tiles I ve seen him come up off the studio floor looking like a coon with the dust And Miss Ruth tickled to see him like that too For the love of Mike what s come to her It s all along of this Porter said Keggs morosely She s done it all And if he went on with sudden heat she don t break her abit of addressing me in a tone what the umblest dorg would resent I m liable to forget my place and give her a piece of my mind Coming round and interfering Got your goat has she commented Steve interested She s what you d call a tough proposition that dame I used to have my eye on her all the time in the old days waiting for her to start something But say I d like to see this nursery you ve been talking about Take me up and let me lamp it Keggs shook his head I daren t mister Dingle It ud be as much as my place is worth But darn it I m the kid s godfather That wouldn t make no difference to that Porter She d pick on me just the same But if you care to risk it mister Dingle I ll show you where it is You ll find the young person up there She ll tell you more about the child s abits and daily life than I can Good enough said Steve He had not seen Mamie for some time and absence had made the heart grow fonder It embittered him that his meetings with her were all too rare nowadays She seemed to have abandoned the practice of walking altogether for whenever he saw her now she was driving in the automobile with Bill Keggs information about the new system threw some light upon this and made him all the more anxious to meet her now It was a curious delusion of Steve s that he was always going to pluck up courage and propose to Mamie the very next time he saw her This had gone on now for over two years but he still clung to it Repeated failures to reveal his burning emotions never caused him to lose the conviction that he would do it for certain next time It was in his customary braced up do or die frame of mind that he entered the nursery now His visit to Keggs had been rather a late one and had lasted some time before the subject of the White Hope had been broached with the result that when Steve arrived among the white tiles and antiseptics he found his godson in bed and asleep In a chair by the cot Mamie sat sewing Her eyes widened with surprise when she saw who the visitor was and she put a finger to her lip and pointed to the sleeper And as we have to record another of the long list of Steve s failures to propose we may say here in excuse that this reception took a great deal of the edge off the dashing resolution which had been his up to that moment It made him feel self conscious from the start Whatever brings you up here Steve whispered Mamie It was not a very tactful remark perhaps considering that Steve was the child s godfather and as such might reasonably expect to be allowed a free pass to his nursery but Mamie like Keggs had fallen so under the domination of Lora Delane Porter that she had grown to consider it almost a natural law that no one came to see Bill unless approved of and personally conducted by her Steve did not answer He was gaping at the fittings of the place in which he found himself It was precisely as Keggs had described it white tiles and all He was roused from his reflections by the approach of Mamie or rather not so much by her approach as by the fact that at this moment she suddenly squirted something at him It was cold and wet and hit him in the face before as he put it to Keggs later he could get his guard up For the love of Sh said Mamie warningly What s the idea What are you handing me I ve got to It s to sterilize you I do it to every one Gee You ve got a swell job Well go to it then Shoot I m ready It s boric acid explained Mamie I shouldn t wonder Is this all part of the Porter circus Yes Where is she inquired Steve in sudden alarm Is she likely to butt in No She s out Good said Steve and sat down relieved to resume his inspection of the room When he had finished he drew a deep breath Well he said softly Say Mamie what do you think about it I m not paid to think about it Steve That means you agree with me that it s the punkest state of things you ever struck Well you re quite right It is It s a shame to think of that innocent kid having this sort of deal handed to him Why just think of him at the studio But Mamie whatever her private views was loyal to her employers She refused to be drawn into a discussion on the subject Have you been downstairs with mister Keggs Steve Yes It was him that told me about all this Say Mame we ain t seen much of each other lately No Mighty little Yes Having got as far as this Steve should of course have gone resolutely ahead After all it is not a very long step from telling a girl in a hushed whisper with a shake in it that you have not seen much of her lately to hinting that you would like to see a great deal more of her in the future Steve was on the right lines and he knew it but that fatal lack of nerve which had wrecked him on all the other occasions when he had got as far as this undid him now He relapsed into silence and Mamie went on sewing In a way if you shut your eyes to the white tiles and the thermometer and the brass knobs and the shower bath it was a peaceful scene and Steve as he sat there and watched Mamie sew was stirred by it Remove the white tiles the thermometer the brass knobs and the shower bath and this was precisely the sort of scene his imagination conjured up when the business of life slackened sufficiently to allow him to dream dreams There he was sitting in one chair there was Mamie sitting in another and there in the corner was the little white cot well perhaps that was being a shade too prophetic on the other hand it always came into these dreams of his There in short was everything arranged just as he pictured it and all that was needed to make the picture real was for him to propose and Mamie to accept him It was the disturbing thought that the second condition did not necessarily follow on to the first that had kept Steve from taking the plunge for the last two years Unlike the hero of the poem he feared his fate too much to put it to the touch to win or lose it all Presently the silence began to oppress Steve Mamie had her needlework and that apparently served her in lieu of conversation but Steve had nothing to occupy him and he began to grow restless He always despised himself thoroughly for his feebleness on these occasions and he despised himself now He determined to make a big effort Mamie he said As he was nervous and had been silent so long that his vocal cords had gone off duty under the impression that their day s work was over the word came out of him like a husky gunshot Mamie started and the White Hope who had been sleeping peacefully stirred and muttered S sh hissed Mamie Steve collapsed with the feeling that it was not his lucky night while Mamie bent anxiously over the cot The sleeper however did not wake He gurgled gave a sigh then resumed his interrupted repose Mamie returned to her seat Yes she said as if nothing had occurred and as if there had been no interval between Steve s remark and her reply Steve could not equal her calmness He had been strung up when he spoke and the interruption had undone him He reflected ruefully that he might have said something to the point if he had been allowed to go straight on now he had forgotten what he had meant to say Oh nothing he replied Silence fell once more on the nursery Steve was bracing himself up for another attack when suddenly there came a sound of voices from the stairs One voice was a mere murmur but the other was sharp and unmistakable the incisive note of Lora Delane Porter It brought Steve and Mamie to their feet simultaneously What s it matter said Steve stoutly answering the panic in Mamie s eyes It s not her house and I got a perfect right to be here You don t know her I shall get into trouble Mamie was pale with apprehension She knew her Lora Delane Porter and she knew what would happen if Steve were to be discovered there It was as Keggs put it as much as her place was worth For a brief instant Mamie faced a future in which she was driven from Bill s presence into outer darkness dismissed and told never to return That was what would happen Sitting and talking with Steve in the sacred nursery at this time of night was a crime and she had known it all the time But she had been glad to see Steve again after all this while if Steve had known how glad he would certainly have found courage and said what he had so often failed to say and knowing that missus Porter was out she had thought the risk of his presence worth taking Now with discovery imminent panic came upon her The voices were quite close now There was no doubt of the destination of the speakers They were heading slowly but directly for the nursery Steve not being fully abreast of the new rules and regulations of the sacred apartment could not read Mamie s mind completely He did not know that under missus Porter s code the admission of a visitor during the hours of sleep was a felony in the first degree punishable by instant dismissal But Mamie s face and her brief reference to trouble were enough to tell him that the position was critical and with the instinct of the trapped he looked round him for cover But the White Hope s nursery was not constructed with a view to providing cover for bulky gentlemen who should not have been there It was as bare as a billiard table as far as practicable hiding places were concerned And then his eye caught the water proof sheet of the shower bath Behind that there was just room for concealment With a brief nod of encouragement to Mamie he leaped at it The door opened as he disappeared missus Porter s rules concerning visitors though stringent as regarded Mamie were capable of being relaxed when she herself was the person to relax them She had a visitor with her now a long severe looking lady with a sharp nose surmounted by spectacles who taking in the white tiles the thermometer the cot and the brass knobs in a single comprehensive glance observed Admirable missus Porter was obviously pleased with this approval Her companion was a woman doctor of great repute among the advanced apostles of hygiene and praise from her was praise indeed She advanced into the room with an air of suppressed pride These tiles are thoroughly cleaned twice each day with an antiseptic solution Just so said the spectacled lady You notice the thermometer Exactly Those knobs you see on the wall have various uses Quite They examined the knobs with an air of profound seriousness missus Porter erect and complacent the other leaning forward and peering through her spectacles Mamie took advantage of their backs and turned to cast a hurried glance at the water proof curtain It was certainly an admirable screen no sign of Steve was visible but nevertheless she did not cease to quake This said missus Porter controls the heat This this and this are for the ventilation Just so just so just so said the doctor And this of course is for the shower bath I understand And extending a firm finger she gave the knob a forceful push missus Porter nodded That is the cold shower she said This is the hot It is a very ingenious arrangement one of Malcolmson s patents There is a regulator at the side of the bath which enables the nurse to get just the correct temperature I will turn on both and then It was as missus Porter s hand was extended toward the knob that the paralysis which terror had put upon Mamie relaxed its grip She had stood by without a movement while the cold water splashed down upon the hidden Steve Her heart had ached for him but she had not stirred But now with the prospect of allowing him to be boiled alive before her she acted It is generally only on the stage that a little child comes to the rescue of adults at critical moments but William Bannister was accorded the opportunity of doing so off it It happened that at the moment of missus Porter s entry Mamie had been standing near his cot and she had not moved since The consequence was that she was within easy reach of him and despair giving her what in the circumstances amounted to a flash of inspiration she leaned quickly forward even as missus Porter s finger touched the knob and gave the round head on the pillow a rapid push William Bannister sat up with a grunt rubbed his eyes and seeing strangers began to cry It was so obvious to missus Porter and her companion both from the evidence of their guilty consciences and the look of respectful reproach on Mamie s face that the sound of their voices had disturbed the child that they were routed from the start Oh dear me He is awake said the lady doctor I am afraid we did not lower our voices added missus Porter And yet William is usually such a sound sleeper Perhaps we had better Just so said the doctor go downstairs while the nurse gets him off to sleep again Quite The door closed behind them Oh Steve said Mamie The White Hope had gone to sleep again with the amazing speed of childhood and Mamie was looking pityingly at the bedraggled object which had emerged cautiously from behind the waterproof I got mine muttered Steve ruefully You ain t got a towel anywhere have you Mame Mamie produced a towel and watched him apologetically as he attempted to dry himself I m so sorry Steve Cut it out It was my fault I oughtn t to have been there Say it was a bit of luck the kid waking just then Yes said Mamie Observe the tricks that conscience plays us If Mamie had told Steve what had caused William to wake he would certainly have been so charmed by her presence of mind exerted on his behalf to save him from the warm fate which missus Porter s unconscious hand had been about to bring down upon him that he would have forgotten his diffidence then and there and as the poet has it have eased his bosom of much perilous stuff But conscience would not allow Mamie to reveal the secret Already she was suffering the pangs of remorse for having in however good a cause broken her idol s rest with a push that might have given the poor lamb a headache She could not confess the crime even to Steve And if Steve had had the pluck to tell Mamie that he loved her as he stood before her dripping with the water which he had suffered in silence rather than betray her she would have fallen into his arms For Steve at that moment had all the glamour for her of the self sacrificing hero of a moving picture film He had not actually risked death for her perhaps but he had taken a sudden cold shower bath without a murmur all for her Mamie was thrilled She looked at him with the gleaming eyes of devotion But Steve just because he knew that he was wet and fancied that he must look ridiculous held his peace And presently his secret still locked in his bosom and his collar sticking limply to his neck he crept downstairs avoiding the society of his fellow man and slunk out into the night where if there was no Mamie there were at any rate dry clothes Chapter IV The Widening Gap The new life hit Kirk as a wave hits a bather and like a wave swept him off his feet choked him and generally filled him with a feeling of discomfort He should have been prepared for it but he was not He should have divined from the first that the money was bound to produce changes other than a mere shifting of headquarters from Sixty First Street to Fifth Avenue But he had deluded himself at first with the idea that Ruth was different from other women that she was superior to the artificial pleasures of the Society which is distinguished by the big S In a moment of weakness induced by hair ruffling he had given in on the point of the hygienic upbringing of William Bannister but there he had imagined his troubles were to cease He had supposed that he was about to resume the old hermit s cell life of the studio and live in a world which contained only Ruth Bill and himself He was quickly undeceived Within two days he was made aware of the fact that Ruth was in the very centre of the social whirlpool and that she took it for granted that he would join her there There was nothing of the hermit about Ruth now She was amazingly undomestic Her old distaste for the fashionable life of New York seemed to have vanished absolutely As far as Kirk could see she was always entertaining or being entertained He was pitched head long into a world where people talked incessantly of things which bored him and did things which seemed to him simply mad And Ruth whom he had thought he understood revelled in it all At first he tried to get at her point of view to discover what she found to enjoy in this lunatic existence of aimlessness and futility One night as they were driving home from a dinner which had bored him unspeakably he asked the question point blank It seemed to him incredible that she could take pleasure in an entertainment which had filled him with such depression Ruth he said impulsively as the car moved off what do you see in this sort of thing How can you stand these people What have you in common with them Poor old Kirk I know you hated it to night But we shan t be dining with the Baileys every night Bailey Bannister had been their host on that occasion and the dinner had been elaborate and gorgeous missus Bailey was now one of the leaders of the younger set Bailey looking much more than a year older than when Kirk had seen him last had presided at the head of the table with great dignity and the meeting with him had not contributed to the pleasure of Kirk s evening Were you awfully bored You seemed to be getting along quite well with Sybil I like her She s good fun She s certainly having good fun I d give anything to know what Bailey really thinks of it She is the most shockingly extravagant little creature in New York You know the Wilburs were quite poor and poor Sybil was kept very short I think that marrying Bailey and having all this money to play with has turned her head It struck Kirk that the criticism applied equally well to the critic She does the most absurd things She gave a freak dinner when you were away that cost I don t know how much She is always doing something Well I suppose Bailey knows what he is about but at her present pace she must be keeping him busy making money to pay for all her fads You ought to paint a picture of Bailey Kirk as the typical patient American husband You couldn t get a better model Suggest it to him and let me hide somewhere where I can hear what he says Bailey has his own opinion of my pictures Ruth laughed a little nervously She had always wondered exactly what had taken place that day in the studio and the subject was one which she was shy of exhuming She turned the conversation What did you ask me just now Something about I asked you what you had in common with these people Ruth reflected Oh well it s rather difficult to say if you put it like that They re just people you know They are amusing sometimes I used to know most of them I suppose that is the chief thing which brings us together They happen to be there and if you re travelling on a road you naturally talk to your fellow travellers But why Don t you like them Which of them didn t you like It was Kirk s turn to reflect Well that s hard to answer too I don t think I actively liked or disliked any of them They seemed to me just not worth while My point is rather why are we wasting a perfectly good evening mixing with them What s the use That s my case in a nut shell If you put it like that what s the use of anything One must do something We can t be hermits A curious feeling of being infinitely far from Ruth came over Kirk She dismissed his dream as a whimsical impossibility not worthy of serious consideration Why could they not be hermits They had been hermits before and it had been the happiest period of both their lives Why just because an old man had died and left them money must they rule out the best thing in life as impossible and plunge into a nightmare which was not life at all He had tried to deceive himself but he could do so no longer Ruth had changed The curse with which his sensitive imagination had invested John Bannister s legacy was after all no imaginary curse Like a golden wedge it had forced Ruth and himself apart Everything had changed He was no longer the centre of Ruth s life He was just an encumbrance a nuisance who could not be got rid of and must remain a permanent handicap always in the way So thought Kirk morbidly as the automobile passed through the silent streets It must be remembered that he had been extremely bored for a solid three hours and was predisposed consequently to gloomy thoughts Whatever his faults Kirk rarely whined He had never felt so miserable in his life but he tried to infuse a tone of lightness into the conversation After all if Ruth s intuition fell short of enabling her to understand his feelings nothing was to be gained by parading them I guess it s my fault he said that I haven t got abreast of the society game as yet You had better give me a few pointers My trouble is that being new to them I can t tell whether these people are types or exceptions Take Clarence Grayling for instance Are there any more at home like Clarence My dear child all Bailey s special friends are like Clarence exactly like I remember telling him so once Who was the specimen with the little black moustache who thought America crude and said that the only place to live in was southern Italy Is he an isolated case or an epidemic He is scarcer than Clarence but he s quite a well marked type He is the millionaire s son who has done Europe and doesn t mean you to forget it There was a chesty person with a wave of hair coming down over his forehead A sickeningly handsome fellow who looked like a poet I think they called him Basil Does he run around in flocks or is he unique Ruth did not reply for a moment Basil Milbank was a part of the past which in the year during which Kirk had been away had come rather startlingly to life There had been a time when Basil had been very near and important to her Indeed but for the intervention of missus Porter described in an earlier passage she would certainly have married Basil Then Kirk had crossed her path and had monopolized her During the studio period the recollection of Basil had grown faint After that just at the moment when Kirk was not there to lend her strength he had come back into her life For nearly a year she had seen him daily and gradually at first almost with fear she had realized that the old fascination was by no means such a thing of the past as she had supposed She had hoped for Kirk s return as a general sorely pressed hopes for reinforcements With Kirk at her side she felt Basil would slip back into his proper place in the scheme of things And behold Kirk had returned and still the tension remained unrelaxed For Kirk had changed After the first day she could not conceal it from herself That it was she who had changed did not present itself to her as a possible explanation of the fact that she now felt out of touch with her husband All she knew was that they had been linked together by bonds of sympathy and were so no longer She found Kirk dull She hated to admit it but the truth forced itself upon her He had begun to bore her She collected her thoughts and answered his question Basil Milbank Oh I should call him unique She felt a wild impulse to warn him to explain the real significance of this man whom he classed contemptuously with Clarence Grayling and that absurd little Dana Ferris as somebody of no account She wanted to cry out to him that she was in danger and that only he could help her But she could not speak and Kirk went on in the same tone of half tolerant contempt Who is he She controlled herself with an effort and answered indifferently Oh Basil Well you might say he s everything He plays polo leads cotillions yachts shoots plays the piano wonderfully everything People usually like him very much She paused Women especially She had tried to put something into her tone which might serve to awaken him something which might prepare the way for what she wanted to say and what if she did not say it now when the mood was on her she could never say But Kirk was deaf He looks that sort of man he said And as he said it the accumulated boredom of the past three hours found vent in a vast yawn Ruth set her teeth She felt as if she had received a blow When he spoke again it was on the subject of street paving defects in New York City It was true as Ruth had said that they did not dine with the Baileys every night but that seemed to Kirk as the days went on the one and only bright spot in the new state of affairs He could not bring himself to treat life with a philosophical resignation His was not open revolt He was outwardly docile but inwardly he rebelled furiously Perhaps the unnaturally secluded life which he had led since his marriage had unfitted him for mixing in society even more than nature had done He had grown out of the habit of mixing Crowds irritated him He hated doing the same thing at the same time as a hundred other people Like most Bohemians he was at his best in a small circle He liked his friends as single spies not in battalions He was a man who should have had a few intimates and no acquaintances and his present life was bounded north south east and west by acquaintances Most of the men to whom he spoke he did not even know by name He would seek information from Ruth as they drove home Who was the pop eyed second story man with the bald head and the convex waistcoat who glued himself to me to night If you mean the fine old gentleman with the slightly prominent eyes and rather thin hair that was Brock Mason the vice president of consolidated groceries You mustn t even think disrespectfully of a man as rich as that He isn t what you would call a sparkling talker He doesn t have to be His time is worth a hundred dollars a minute or a second I forget which Put me down for a nickel s worth next time And then they began to laugh over Ruth s suggestion that they should save up and hire mister Mason for an afternoon and make him keep quiet all the time for Ruth was generally ready to join him in ridiculing their new acquaintances She had none of that reverence for the great and the near great which running to seed becomes snobbery It was this trait in her which kept alive long after it might have died the hope that her present state of mind was only a phase and that when she had tired of the new game she would become the old Ruth of the studio But when he was honest with himself he was forced to admit that she showed no signs of ever tiring of it They had drifted apart They were out of touch with each other It was not an uncommon state of things in the circle in which Kirk now found himself Indeed it seemed to him that the semi detached couple was the rule rather than the exception But there was small consolation in this reflection He was not at all interested in the domestic troubles of the people he mixed with His own hit him very hard Ruth had criticized little missus Bailey but there was no doubt that she herself had had her head turned quite as completely by the new life The first time that Kirk realized this was when he came upon an article in a Sunday paper printed around a blurred caricature which professed to be a photograph of missus Kirk Winfield in which she was alluded to with reverence and gusto as one of society s leading hostesses In the course of the article reference was made to no fewer than three freak dinners of varying ingenuity which she had provided for her delighted friends It was this that staggered Kirk That missus Bailey should indulge in this particular form of insanity was intelligible But that Ruth should have descended to it was another thing altogether He did not refer to the article when he met Ruth but he was more than ever conscious of the gap between them the gap which was widening every day The experiences he had undergone during the year of his wandering had strengthened Kirk considerably but nature is not easily expelled and the constitutional weakness of character which had hampered him through life prevented him from making any open protests or appeal Moreover he could understand now her point of view and that disarmed him He saw how this state of things had come about In a sense it was the natural state of things Ruth had been brought up in certain surroundings Her love for him new and overwhelming had enabled her to free herself temporarily from these surroundings and to become reconciled to a life for which he told himself she had never been intended Fate had thrown her back into her natural sphere And now she revelled in the old environment as an exile revels in the life of the homeland from which he has been so long absent That was the crux of the tragedy Ruth was at home He was not Ruth was among her own people He was a stranger among strangers a prisoner in a land where men spoke with an alien tongue There was nothing to be done The gods had played one of their practical jokes and he must join in the laugh against himself and try to pretend that he was not hurt Chapter V The Real Thing Kirk sat in the nursery with his chin on his hands staring gloomily at William Bannister On the floor William Bannister played some game of his own invention with his box of bricks They were alone It was the first time they had been alone together for two weeks As a rule when Kirk paid his daily visit Lora Delane Porter was there watchful and forbidding prepared on the slightest excuse to fall upon him with rules and prohibitions To day she was out and Kirk had the field to himself for Mamie whose duty it was to mount guard and who had been threatened with many terrible things by missus Porter if she did not stay on guard had once more allowed her too sympathetic nature to get the better of her and had vanished Kirk was too dispirited to take advantage of his good fortune He had a sense of being there on parole of being on his honour not to touch So he sat in his chair and looked at Bill while Bill crooning to himself played decorously with bricks The truth had been a long time in coming home to Kirk but it had reached him at last Ever since his return he had clung to the belief that it was a genuine conviction of its merits that had led Ruth to support her aunt s scheme for Bill s welfare He himself had always looked on the exaggerated precautions for the maintenance of the latter s health as ridiculous and unnecessary but he had acquiesced in them because he thought that Ruth sincerely believed them indispensable After all he had not been there when Bill so nearly died and he could understand that the shock of that episode might have distorted the judgment even of a woman so well balanced as Ruth He was quite ready to be loyal to her in the matter however distasteful it might be to him But now he saw the truth A succession of tiny incidents had brought light to him Ruth might or might not be to some extent genuine in her belief in the new system but her chief motive for giving it her support was something quite different He had tried not to admit to himself but he could do so no longer Ruth allowed missus Porter to have her way because it suited her to do so because with missus Porter on the premises she had more leisure in which to amuse herself because to put it in a word the child had begun to bore her Everything pointed to that In the old days it had been her chief pleasure to be with the boy Their walks in the park had been a daily ceremony with which nothing had been allowed to interfere But now she always had some excuse for keeping away from him Her visits to the nursery when she did go there were brief and perfunctory And the mischief of it was that she always presented such admirable reasons for abstaining from Bill s society when it was suggested to her that she should go to him that it was impossible to bring her out into the open and settle the matter once and for all Patience was one of the virtues which set off the defects in Kirk s character but he did not feel very patient now as he sat and watched Bill playing on the floor Well Bill old man what do you make of it all he said at last The child looked up and fixed him with unwinking eyes Kirk winced They were so exactly Ruth s eyes That wide open expression when somebody speaking suddenly to her interrupted a train of thought was one of her hundred minor charms Bill had reproduced it to the life He stared for a moment then as if there had been some telepathy between them said I want mummy Kirk laughed bitterly You aren t the only one I want mummy too Where is mummy I couldn t tell you exactly At a luncheon party somewhere What s luncheon party A sort of entertainment where everybody eats too much and talks all the time without ever saying a thing that s worth hearing Bill considered this gravely Why Because they like it I suppose Why do they like it Goodness knows Does mummy like it I suppose so Does mummy eat too much She doesn t The others do Why William Bannister s thirst for knowledge was at this time perhaps his most marked characteristic No encyclopaedia could have coped with it Kirk was accustomed to do his best cheerfully yielding up what little information on general subjects he happened to possess but he was like missus Partington sweeping back the Atlantic Ocean with her broom Because they ve been raised that way he replied to the last question Bill old man when you grow up don t you ever become one of these fellows who can t walk two blocks without stopping three times to catch up with their breath If you get like that mutt Dana Ferris you ll break my heart And you re heading that way poor kid What s Ferris He s a man I met at dinner the other night When he was your age he was the richest child in America and everybody fussed over him till he grew up into a wretched little creature with a black moustache and two chins You ought to see him He would make you laugh and you don t get much to laugh at nowadays I guess it isn t hygienic for a kid to laugh Bill honestly what do you think of things Don t you ever want to hurl one of those sterilized bricks of yours at a certain lady Or has she taken all the heart out of you by this time This was beyond Bill as Kirk s monologues frequently were He changed the subject I wish I had a cat he said by way of starting a new topic Well why haven t you a cat Why haven t you a dozen cats if you want them I asked Aunty Lora could I have a cat and she said Certainly not cats are cats are Unhygienic What s that It s what your Aunt Lora might think a cat was Or did she say pestilential I don t amember But she wouldn t let you have one Mamie said a cat might scratch me Well you wouldn t mind that said Kirk anxiously He had come to be almost morbidly on the look out for evidence which might go to prove that this cotton wool existence was stealing from the child the birthright of courage which was his from both his parents Much often depends on little things and if Bill had replied in the affirmative to the question it would probably have had the result of sending Kirk there and then raging through the house conducting a sort of War of Independence The only thing that had kept him from doing so before was the reflection that missus Porter s system could not be definitely taxed with any harmful results But his mind was never easy Every day found him still nervously on the alert for symptoms Bill soothed him now by answering No in a very decided voice All well so far but it had been an anxious moment It seemed incredible to Kirk that the life he was leading should not in time turn the child into a whimpering bundle of nerves His conversations with Bill were as a result a sort of spiritual parallel to the daily taking of his temperature with the thermometer Sooner or later he always led the talk round to some point where Bill must make a definite pronouncement which would show whether or not the insidious decay had begun to set in So far all appeared to be well In earlier conversations Bill subtly questioned had stoutly maintained that he was not afraid of Indians dogs pirates mice cows June bugs or noises in the dark He had even gone so far as to state that if an Indian chief found his way into the nursery he Bill would chop his head off The most exacting father could not have asked more And yet Kirk was not satisfied he remained uneasy It so happened that this afternoon Bill who had had hitherto to maintain his reputation for intrepidity entirely by verbal statements was afforded an opportunity of providing a practical demonstration that his heart was in the right place The game he was playing with the bricks was one that involved a certain amount of running about with a puffing accompaniment of a vaguely equine nature And while performing this part of the programme he chanced to trip He hesitated for a moment as if uncertain whether to fall or remain standing then did the former with a most emphatic bump He scrambled up stood looking at Kirk with a twitching lip then gave a great gulp and resumed his trotting The whole exhibition of indomitable heroism was over in half a minute and he did not even bother to wait for applause The effect of the incident on Kirk was magical He was in the position of an earnest worshipper who tortured with doubts has prayed for a sign This was a revelation A million anti Indian statements however resolute were nothing to this This was the real thing Before his eyes this super child of his had fallen in a manner which might quite reasonably have led to tears which would Kirk felt sure have produced bellows of anguish from every other child in America And what had happened Not a moan No sir not one solitary cry Just a gulp which you had to strain your ears to hear and which at that might have been a mere taking in of breath such as every athlete must do and all was over This child of his was the real thing It had been proved beyond possibility of criticism There are moments when a man on parole forgets his promise All thought of rules and prohibitions went from Kirk He rose from his seat grabbed his son with both hands and hugged him We cannot even begin to estimate the number of bacilli which must have rushed whooping with joy on to the unfortunate child Under a microscope it would probably have looked like an Old Home Week And Kirk did not care He simply kept on hugging That was the sort of man he was thoroughly heartless Bill you re great he cried Bill had been an amazed party to the incident Nothing of this kind had happened to him for so long that he had forgotten there were children to whom this sort of thing did happen Then he recollected a similar encounter with a bearded man down in the hall when he came in one morning from his ride in the automobile A moment later he had connected his facts This man who had no beard was the same man as the man who had a beard and this behaviour was a personal eccentricity of his The thought crossed his mind that Aunty Lora would not approve of this And then surprisingly there came the thought that he did not care whether Aunty Lora approved or not He liked it and that was enough for him The seeds of revolt had been sown in the bosom of William Bannister It happened that Ruth returning from her luncheon party looked in at the nursery on her way upstairs She was confronted with the spectacle of Bill seated on Kirk s lap his face against Kirk s shoulder Kirk though he had stopped speaking as the door opened appeared to be in the middle of a story for Bill after a brief glance at the newcomer asked What happened then Kirk really said Ruth Kirk did not appear in the least ashamed of himself Ruth this kid is the most amazing kid Do you know what happened just now He was running along and he tripped and came down flat And he didn t even think of crying He just picked himself up and That was very brave of you Billy But seriously Kirk you shouldn t hug him like that Think what Aunt Lora would say Aunt Lora be Bother Aunt Lora Well I won t give you away If she heard she would write a book about it And she was just starting to come up when I was downstairs We came in together You had better fly while there s time It was sound advice and Kirk took it It was not till some time later going over the incident again in his mind he realized how very lightly Ruth had treated what if she really adhered to missus Porter s views on hygiene should have been to her a dreadful discovery The reflection was pleasant to him for a moment it seemed to draw Ruth and himself closer together then he saw the reverse side of it If Ruth did not really believe in this absurd hygienic nonsense why had she permitted it to be practised upon the boy There was only one answer and it was the one which Kirk had already guessed at She did it because it gave her more freedom because it bored her to look after the child herself because she was not the same Ruth he had left at the studio when he started with Hank Jardine for Colombia Chapter VI The Outcasts Three months of his new life had gone by before Kirk awoke from the stupor which had gripped him as the result of the general upheaval of his world Ever since his return from Colombia he had honestly been intending to resume his painting and attacking it this time in a business like way to try to mould himself into the semblance of an efficient artist His mind had been full of fine resolutions He would engage a good teacher some competent artist whom fortune had not treated well and who would be glad of the job Washington Square and its neighbourhood were full of them and settle down grimly working regular hours to recover lost ground But the rush of life as lived on the upper avenue had swept him away He had been carried along on the rapids of dinners parties dances theatres luncheons and the rest and his great resolve had gone bobbing away from him on the current He had recovered it now and climbed painfully ashore feeling bruised and exhausted but determined Among the motley crowd which had made the studio a home in the days of Kirk s bachelorhood had been an artist one might almost say an ex artist named Robert Dwight Penway An over fondness for rye whisky at the Brevoort cafe had handicapped Robert as an active force in the world of New York art As a practical worker he was not greatly esteemed least of all by the editors of magazines who had paid advance cheques to him for work which when delivered at all was delivered too late for publication These once bitten were now twice shy of mister Penway They did not deny his great talents which were indeed indisputable but they were fixed in their determination not to make use of them Fate could have provided no more suitable ally for Kirk It was universally admitted around Washington Square and grudgingly down town that in the matter of theory mister Penway excelled He could teach to perfection what he was too erratic to practise Robert Dwight Penway run to earth one sultry evening in the Brevoort welcomed Kirk as a brother as a rich brother Even when his first impression that he was to have the run of the house on Fifth Avenue and mix freely with touchable multi millionaires had been corrected his altitude was still brotherly He parted from Kirk with many solemn promises to present himself at the studio daily and teach him enough art to put him clear at the top of the profession Way above all these other dubs asserted mister Penway Robert Dwight Penway s attitude toward his contemporaries in art bore a striking resemblance to Steve s estimate of his successors in the middle weight department of the American prize ring Surprisingly to those who knew him mister Penway was as good as his word Certainly Kirk s terms had been extremely generous but he had thrown away many a contract of equal value in his palmy days Possibly his activity was due to his liking for Kirk or it may have been that the prospect of sitting by with a cigar while somebody else worked with nothing to do all day except offer criticism and advice appealed to him At any rate he appeared at the studio on the following afternoon completely sober and excessively critical He examined the canvases which Kirk had hauled from shelves and corners for his inspection One after another he gazed upon them in an increasingly significant silence When the last one was laid aside he delivered judgment Golly he said Kirk flushed It was not that he was not in complete agreement with the verdict Looking at these paintings some of which he had in the old days thought extremely good he was forced to admit that Golly was the only possible criticism He had not seen them for a long time and absence had enabled him to correct first impressions Moreover something had happened to him causing him to detect flaws where he had seen only merits Life had sharpened his powers of judgment He was a grown man looking at the follies of his youth Burn them said mister Penway lighting a cigar with the air of one restoring his tissues after a strenuous ordeal Burn the lot They re awful Darned amateur nightmares They offend the eye Cast them into a burning fiery furnace Kirk nodded The criticism was just It erred if at all on the side of mildness Certainly something had happened to him since he perpetrated those daubs He had developed He saw things with new eyes I guess I had better start right in again at the beginning he said Earlier than that amended mister Penway So Kirk settled down to a routine of hard work and so doing drove another blow at the wedge which was separating his life from Ruth s There were days now when they did not meet at all and others when they saw each other for a few short moments in which neither seemed to have much to say Ruth had made a perfunctory protest against the new departure Really she said it does seem absurd for you to spend all your time down at that old studio It isn t as if you had to But of course if you want to And she had gone on to speak of other subjects It was plain to Kirk that his absence scarcely affected her She was still in the rapids and every day carried her farther away from him It did not hurt him now A sort of apathy seemed to have fallen on him The old days became more and more remote Sometimes he doubted whether anything remained of her former love for him and sometimes he wondered if he still loved her She was so different that it was almost as if she were a stranger Once they had had everything in common Now it seemed to him that they had nothing not even Bill He did not brood upon it He gave himself no time for that He worked doggedly on under the blasphemous but efficient guidance of mister Penway He was becoming a man with a fixed idea the idea of making good He began to make headway His beginnings were small but practical He no longer sat down when the spirit moved him to dash off vague masterpieces which might turn into something quite unexpected on the road to completion he snatched at anything definite that presented itself Sometimes it was a couple of illustrations to a short story in one of the minor magazines sometimes a picture to go with an eulogy of a patent medicine Whatever it was he seized upon it and put into it all the talent he possessed And thanks to the indefatigable coaching of Robert Dwight Penway a certain merit was beginning to creep into his work His drawing was growing firmer He no longer shirked difficulties mister Penway was good enough to approve of his progress Being free from any morbid distaste for himself he attributed that progress to its proper source As he said once in a moment of expansive candour he could given a free hand and something to drink and smoke while doing it make an artist out of two sticks and a lump of coal Why I ve made you turn out things that are like something on earth my boy he said proudly And that he added as he reached out for the bottle of Bourbon which Kirk had provided for him is going some Kirk was far too grateful to resent the slightly unflattering note a more spirited man might have detected in the remark Only once during those days did Kirk allow himself to weaken and admit to himself how wretched he was He was drawing a picture of Steve at the time and Steve had the sympathy which encourages weakness in others It was a significant sign of his changed attitude towards his profession that he was not drawing Steve as a figure in an allegorical picture or as Apollo or The Toiler but simply as a well developed young man who had had the good sense to support his nether garments with Middleton s Undeniable Suspenders The picture when completed would show Steve smirking down at the region of his waist line and announcing with pride and satisfaction They re Middleton s Kirk was putting all he knew into the work and his face as he drew was dark and gloomy Steve noted this with concern He had perceived for some time that Kirk had changed He had lost all his old boyish enjoyment of their sparring bouts and he threw the medicine ball with an absent gloom almost equal to Bailey s It had not occurred to Steve to question Kirk about this If Kirk had anything on his mind which he wished to impart he would say it Meanwhile the friendly thing for him to do was to be quiet and pretend to notice nothing It seemed to Steve that nothing was going right these days Here was he chafing at his inability to open his heart to Mamie Here was Kirk obviously in trouble And a smaller thing but of interest as showing how universal the present depression was there was Bailey Bannister equally obviously much worried over something or other For Bailey had reinstated Steve in the place he had occupied before old John Bannister had dismissed him and for some time past Steve had marked him down as a man with a secret trouble He had never been of a riotously cheerful disposition but it had been possible once to draw him into conversation at the close of the morning s exercises Now he hardly spoke And often when Steve arrived in the morning he was informed that mister Bannister had started for Wall Street early on important business These things troubled Steve His simple soul abhorred a mystery But it was the case of Kirk that worried him most for he half guessed that the latter s gloom had to do with Ruth and he worshipped Ruth Kirk laid down his sketch and got up I guess that ll do for the moment Steve he said Steve relaxed the attitude of proud satisfaction which he had assumed in order to do justice to the Undeniable Suspenders He stretched himself and sat down You certainly are working to beat the band just now squire he remarked It s a pretty good thing work Steve said Kirk If it does nothing else it keeps you from thinking He knew it was feeble of him but he was powerfully impelled to relieve himself by confiding his wretchedness to Steve He need not say much he told himself plausibly only just enough to lighten the burden a little He would not be disloyal to Ruth he had not sunk to that but after all Steve was Steve It was not like blurting out his troubles to a stranger It would harm nobody and do him a great deal of good if he talked to Steve He relit his pipe which had gone out during a tense spell of work on the suspenders Well Steve he said what do you think of life How is this best of all possible worlds treating you Steve deposed that life was pretty punk You re a great describer Steve You ve hit it first time Punk is the word It s funny if you look at it properly Take my own case The superficial observer who is apt to be a bonehead would say that I ought to be singing psalms of joy I am married to the woman I wanted to marry I have a son who not to be fulsome is a perfectly good sort of son I have no financial troubles I eat well I have ceased to tremble when I see a job of work In fact I have advanced in my art to such an extent that shrewd business men like Middleton put the pictorial side of their Undeniable Suspenders in my hands and go off to play golf with their minds easy having perfect confidence in my skill and judgment If I can t be merry and bright who can Do you find me merry and bright Steve I ve seen you in better shape said Steve cautiously I ve felt in better shape Steve coughed The conversation was about to become delicate What s eating you colonel he asked presently Kirk frowned in silence at the Undeniable for a few moments Then the pent up misery of months exploded in a cascade of words He jumped up and began to walk restlessly about the studio Damn it Steve I ought not to say a word I know It s weak and cowardly and bad taste and everything else you can think of to speak of it even to you One s supposed to stand this sort of roasting at the stake with a grin as if one enjoyed it But after all you are different It s not as if it was any one You are different aren t you Sure Well you know what s wrong as well as I do Surest thing you know It s hit me too How s that Well things ain t the same That s about what it comes to Kirk stopped and looked at him His expression was wistful I ought not to be talking about it You go right ahead squire said Steve soothingly I know just how you feel and I guess talking s not going to do any harm Act as if I wasn t here Look on it as a monologue I don t amount to anything When did you go to the house last Steve Steve reflected About a couple of weeks ago I reckon See the kid Steve shook his head Seeing his nibs ain t my long suit these days I may be wrong but I got the idea there was a dead line for me about three blocks away from the nursery I asked Keggs was the coast clear but he said the Porter dame was in the ring so I kind of thought I d better away I don t seem to fit in with all them white tiles and thermometers You used to see him every day when we were here And you didn t seem to contaminate him as far as any one could notice There was a silence Do you see him often colonel Kirk laughed Oh yes I m favoured I pay a state visit every day Think of that I sit in a chair at the other end of the room while missus Porter stands between to see that I don t start anything Bill plays with his sterilized bricks Occasionally he and I exchange a few civil words It s as jolly and sociable as you could want We have great times Say on the level I wonder you stand for it I ve got to stand for it He s your kid Not exclusively I have a partner Steve Steve snorted dolefully Ain t it hell the way things break loose in this world he sighed Who d have thought two years ago Do you make it only two I should have put it at about two thousand Honest squire if any one had told me then that Miss Ruth had it in her to take up with all these fool stunts Well I can t say I was prepared for it Steve coughed again Kirk was in an expansive mood this afternoon and the occasion was ideal for the putting forward of certain views which he had long wished to impart But on the other hand the subject was a peculiarly delicate one It has been well said that it is better for a third party to quarrel with a buzz saw than to interfere between husband and wife and Steve was constitutionally averse to anything that savoured of butting in Still Kirk had turned the talk into this channel He decided to risk it If I were you he said I d get busy and start something Such as what Steve decided to abandon caution and speak his mind Him almost as much as Kirk the existing state of things had driven to desperation Though in a sense he was only a spectator the fact that the altered conditions of Kirk s life involved his almost complete separation from Mamie gave him what might be called a stake in the affair The brief and rare glimpses which he got of her nowadays made it absolutely impossible for him to conduct his wooing on a business like basis A diffident man cannot possibly achieve any success in odd moments Constant propinquity is his only hope That fact alone he considered almost gave him the right to interfere And apart from that his affection for Kirk and Ruth gave him a claim Finally he held what was practically an official position in the family councils on the strength of being William Bannister Winfield s godfather He loved William Bannister as a son and it had been one of his favourite day dreams to conjure up a vision of the time when he should be permitted to undertake the child s physical training He had toyed lovingly with the idea of imparting to this promising pupil all that he knew of the greatest game on earth He had watched him in the old days staggering about the studio and had pictured him grown to his full strength his muscles trained his brain full of the wisdom of one who if his mother had not kicked would have been middle weight champion of America He had resigned himself to the fact that the infant s social status made it impossible that he should be the real White Hope whom he had once pictured beating all comers in the roped ring but after all there was a certain mild fame to be acquired even by an amateur And now that dream was over unless Kirk could be goaded into strong action in time Why don t you sneak the kid away somewhere he suggested Why don t you go right in at them and say It s my kid and I m going to take him away into the country out of all this white tile stuff and let him roll in the mud same as he used to Why say there s that shack of yours in Connecticut just made for it That kid would have the time of his life there You think that s the solution do you Steve I m dead sure it is Steve s voice became more and more enthusiastic as the idea unfolded itself Why it ain t only the kid I m thinking of There s Miss Ruth Say you don t mind me pulling this line of talk Go ahead I began it What about Miss Ruth Well you know just what s the matter with her She s let this society game run away with her I guess she started it because she felt lonesome when you were away and now it s got her and she can t drop it All she wants is a jolt It would slow her up and show her just where she was She s asking for it One good snappy jolt would put the whole thing right And this thing of jerking the kid away to Connecticut would be the right dope believe me Kirk shook his head It wouldn t do Steve It isn t that I don t want to do it but one must play to the rules I can t explain what I mean I can only say it s impossible Let s think of a parallel case When you were in the ring there must have been times when you had a chance of hitting your man low Why didn t you do it It would have jolted him all right Why I d have lost on a foul Well so should I lose on a foul if I started the sort of rough house you suggest I don t get you Well if you want it in plain English Ruth would never forgive me Is that clear enough You re dead wrong boss said Steve excitedly I know her I thought I did Well anyway Steve thanks for the suggestion but believe me nothing doing And now if you feel like it I wish you would resume your celebrated imitation of a man exulting over the fact that he is wearing Middleton s Undeniable There isn t much more to do and I should like to get through with it to day if possible There hold that pose It s exactly right The honest man gloating over his suspenders You ought to go on the stage Steve Chapter VII Cutting the Tangled Knot There are some men whose mission in life it appears to be to go about the world creating crises in the lives of other people When there is thunder in the air they precipitate the thunderbolt Bailey Bannister was one of these He meant extraordinarily well but he was a dangerous man for that very reason and in a properly constituted world would have been segregated or kept under supervision He would not leave the tangled lives of those around him to adjust themselves He blundered in and tried to help He nearly always produced a definite result but seldom the one at which he aimed That he should have interfered in the affairs of Ruth and Kirk at this time was it must be admitted unselfish of him for just now he was having troubles of his own on a somewhat extensive scale His wife s extravagance was putting a strain on his finances and he was faced with the choice of checking her or increasing his income Being very much in love he shrank from the former task and adopted the other way out of the difficulty It was this that had led to the change in his manner noticed by Steve In order to make more money he had had to take risks and only recently had he begun to perceive how extremely risky these risks were For the first time in its history the firm of Bannister was making first hand acquaintance with frenzied finance It is perhaps a little unfair to lay the blame for this entirely at the door of Bailey s Sybil Her extravagance was largely responsible but Bailey s newly found freedom was also a factor in the developments of the firm s operations If you keep a dog a dog with a high sense of his abilities and importance tied up and muzzled for a length of time and then abruptly set it free the chances are that it will celebrate its freedom This had happened in the case of Bailey Just as her father s money had caused Ruth to plunge into a whirl of pleasures which she did not really enjoy merely for the novelty of it so the death of John Bannister and his own consequent accession to the throne had upset Bailey s balance and embarked him on an orgy of speculation quite foreign to his true nature All their lives Ruth and Bailey had been repressed by their father and his removal had unsteadied them Bailey on whom the shadow of the dead man had pressed particularly severely had been quite intoxicated by sudden freedom He had been a cipher in the firm of Bannister Son In the firm of Bannister company he was an untrammelled despot He did that which was right in his own eyes and there was no one to say him nay It was true that veteran members of the firm looking in the glass found white hairs where no white hairs had been and wrinkles on foreheads which under the solid rule of old John Bannister had been smooth but it would have taken more than these straws to convince Bailey that the wind which was blowing was an ill wind He had developed in a day the sublime self confidence of a young Napoleon He was all dash and enterprise the hurricane fighter of Wall Street With these private interests to occupy him it is surprising that he should have found time to take the affairs of Ruth and Kirk in hand But he did For some time he had watched the widening gulf between them with pained solicitude He disliked Kirk personally but that did not influence him He conceived it to be his duty to suppress private prejudices Duty seemed to call him to go to Kirk s aid and smooth out his domestic difficulties What urged him to this course more than anything else was Ruth s growing intimacy with Basil Milbank for in the period which had elapsed since the conversation recorded earlier in the story when Kirk had first made the other s acquaintance the gifted Basil had become a very important and menacing figure in Ruth s life To Ruth as to most women his gifts were his attraction He danced well he talked well he did everything well He appealed to a side of Ruth s nature which Kirk scarcely touched a side which had only come into prominence in the last year His manner was admirable He suggested sympathy without expressing it He could convey to Ruth that he thought her a misunderstood and neglected wife while talking to her about the weather He could make his own knight errant attitude toward her perfectly plain without saying a word merely by playing soft music to her on the piano for he had the gift of saying more with his finger tips than most men could have said in a long speech carefully rehearsed Kirk s inability to accompany Ruth into her present life had given Basil his chance Into the gap which now lay between them he had slipped with a smooth neatness born of experience Bailey hated Basil Men as a rule did without knowing why Basil s reputation was shady without being actually bad He was a suspect who had never been convicted New York contained several husbands who eyed him askance but could not verify their suspicions and the apparent hopelessness of ever doing so made them look on Basil as a man who had carried smoothness into the realms of fine art He was considered too gifted to be wholesome The men of his set being for the most part amiably stupid resented his cleverness Bailey just at present was feeling strongly on the subject of Basil He was at that stage of his married life when he would have preferred his Sybil to speak civilly to no other man than himself And only yesterday Sybil had come to him to inform him with obvious delight that Basil Milbank had invited her to join his yacht party for a lengthy voyage This had stung Bailey He was not included in the invitation The whole affair struck him as sinister It was true that Sybil had never shown any sign of being fascinated by Basil but he told himself there was no knowing He forbade Sybil to accept the invitation To soothe her disappointment he sent her off then and there to Tiffany s with a roving commission to get what she liked for Bailey the stern strong man the man who knew when to put his foot down was no tyrant But he would have been indignant at the suggestion that he had bribed Sybil to refuse Basil s invitation One of the arguments which Sybil had advanced in the brief discussion which had followed the putting down of Bailey s foot had been that Ruth had been invited and accepted so why should not she Bailey had not replied to this it was at this point of the proceedings that the Tiffany motive had been introduced but he had not forgotten it He thought it over and decided to call upon Ruth He did so It was unfortunate that the nervous strain of being the Napoleon of Wall Street had had the effect of increasing to a marked extent the portentousness of Bailey s always portentous manner Ruth rebelled against it There was an insufferable suggestion of ripe old age and fatherliness in his attitude which she found irritating in the extreme All her life she had chafed at authority and now when Bailey set himself up as one possessing it she showed the worst side of herself to him He struck this unfortunate note from the very beginning Ruth he said I wish to speak seriously to you Ruth looked at him with hostile eyes but did not speak He did not know it poor man but he had selected an exceedingly bad moment for his lecture It so happened that only half an hour before she and Kirk had come nearer to open warfare than they had ever come It had come about in this way Kirk had slept badly the night before and as he lay awake in the small hours his conscience had troubled him Had he done all that it was in him to do to bridge the gap between Ruth and himself That was what his conscience had wanted to know The answer was in the negative On the following day just before Bailey s call he accordingly sought Ruth out and rather nervously for Ruth made him feel nervous nowadays suggested that he and she and William Bannister should take the air in each other s company and go and feed the squirrels in the park Ruth declined It is possible that she declined somewhat curtly The day was close and oppressive and she had a headache and a general feeling of ill will toward her species Also in her heart she considered that the scheme proposed smacked too much of Sunday afternoon domesticity in Brooklyn The idea of papa mamma and baby sporting together in a public park offended her sense of the social proprieties She did not reveal these thoughts to Kirk because she was more than a little ashamed of them A year ago she knew she would not have objected to the idea A year ago such an expedition would have been a daily occurrence with her Now she felt if William Bannister wished to feed squirrels Mamie was his proper companion She could not put all this baldly to Kirk so she placed the burden of her refusal on the adequate shoulders of Lora Delane Porter Aunt Lora she said would never hear of William Bannister wandering at large in such an unhygienic fashion Upon which Kirk whose patience was not so robust as it had been and who like Ruth found the day oppressive and making for irritability had cursed Aunt Lora heartily given it as his opinion that between them she and Ruth were turning the child from a human being into a sort of spineless effeminate exhibit in a museum and had taken himself off to the studio muttering disjointed things Ruth was still quivering with the indignation of a woman who has been cheated of the last word when Bailey appeared and announced that he wished to speak seriously to her Bailey saw the hostility in her eyes and winced a little before it He was not feeling altogether at his ease He had had experience of Ruth in this mood and she had taught him to respect it But he was not going to shirk his duty He resumed I am only speaking for your own good he said I know that it is nothing but thoughtlessness on your part but I am naturally anxious Bailey interrupted Ruth get to the point Bailey drew a long breath Well then he said baulked of his preamble and rushing on his fate I think you see too much of Basil Milbank Ruth raised her eyebrows Oh The mildness of her tone deceived Bailey I do not like to speak of these things he went on more happily but I feel that I must It is my duty Basil Milbank has not a good reputation He is not the sort of man who ah who in fact he has not a good reputation Oh I understand that he has invited you to form one of his yacht party How did you know Sybil told me He invited her I refused to allow her to accept the invitation And what did Sybil say She was naturally a little disappointed of course but she did as I requested I wonder she didn t pack her things and go straight off My dear Ruth That is what I should have done You don t know what you are saying Oh Do you think I should let Kirk dictate to me like that He is certain to disapprove of your going when he hears of the invitation What will you do Ruth s eyes opened For a moment she looked almost ugly What shall I do Why go of course She clenched her teeth A woman s mind can work curiously and she was associating Kirk with Bailey in what she considered an unwarrantable intrusion into her private affairs It was as if Kirk and not Bailey were standing there demanding that she should not associate with Basil Milbank I shall make it my business said Bailey to warn Kirk that this man is not a desirable companion for you The discussion of this miserable yacht affair had brought back to Bailey all the jealousy which he had felt when Sybil had first told him of it All the vague stories he had ever heard about Basil were surging in his mind like waves of some corrosive acid He had become a leading member of the extreme wing of the anti Milbank party He regarded Basil with the aversion which a dignified pigeon might feel for a circling hawk and he was now looking on this yacht party as a deadly peril from which Ruth must be saved at any cost I shall speak to him very strongly he added Ruth s suppressed anger blazed up in the sudden way which before now had disconcerted her brother Bailey what do you mean by coming here and saying this sort of thing You re becoming a perfect old woman You spend your whole time prying into other people s affairs I m sorry for Sybil Bailey cast one reproachable look at her and left the room with pained dignity Something seemed to tell him that no good could come to him from a prolongation of the interview Ruth in this mood always had been too much for him and always would be Well he had done his duty as far as he was concerned It now remained to do the same by Kirk He hailed a taxi and drove to the studio Kirk was busy and not anxious for conversation least of all with Bailey He had not forgotten their last tete a tete Bailey however was regarding him with a feeling almost of friendliness They were bound together by a common grievance against Basil Milbank I came here Winfield he said after a few moments of awkward conversation on neutral topics because I understand that this man Milbank has invited Ruth to join his yacht party What yacht party This man Milbank is taking a party for a cruise shortly in his yacht Who is Milbank Surely you have met him Yes he was at my house one night when you and Ruth dined there shortly after your return I don t remember him However it doesn t matter But why does the fact that he has asked Ruth on his yacht excite you Are you nervous about the sea I dislike this man Milbank very much Winfield I think Ruth sees too much of him Kirk stiffened His eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch Oh he said It seemed to Bailey for an instant that he had been talking all his life to people who raised their eyebrows and said Oh but he continued manfully I do not think that Ruth should know him Winfield Wouldn t Ruth be rather a good judge of that His tone nettled Bailey but the man conscious of doing his duty acquires an artificial thickness of skin and he controlled himself But he had lost that feeling of friendliness of sympathy with a brother in misfortune which he had brought in with him I disagree with you entirely he said Another thing went on Kirk If this man Milbank I still can t place him is such a thug or whatever it is that he happens to be how did he come to be at your house the night you say I met him Bailey winced He wished the world was not perpetually reminding him that Basil and Sybil were on speaking terms Sybil invited him I may say he has asked Sybil to make one of the yacht party I absolutely forbade it But Heavens What s wrong with the man He has a bad reputation Has he indeed And I wish my wife to associate with him as little as possible And I should advise you to forbid Ruth to see more of him than she can help Kirk laughed The idea struck him as comic My good man I don t forbid Ruth to do things Bailey objecting to being called any one s good man especially Kirk s permitted his temper to get the better of him Then you should he snapped I have no wish to quarrel with you I came in here in a friendly spirit to warn you but I must say that for a man who married a girl as you married Ruth in direct opposition to the wishes of her family you take a curious view of your obligations Ruth has always been a headstrong impulsive girl and it is for you to see that she is protected from herself If you are indifferent to her welfare then all I can say is that you should not have married her You appear to think otherwise Good afternoon He stalked out of the studio leaving Kirk uncomfortably conscious that he had had the worst of the argument Bailey had been officious no doubt and his pompous mode of expression was not soothing but there was no doubt that he had had right on his side Marrying Ruth did not involve obligations He had never considered her in that light but perhaps she was a girl who had to be protected from herself She was certainly impulsive Bailey had been right there if nowhere else Who was this fellow Milbank who had sprung suddenly from nowhere into the position of a menace What were Ruth s feelings toward him Kirk threw his mind back to the dinner party at Bailey s and tried to place him Was it the man yes he had it now It was the man with the wave of hair over his forehead the fellow who looked like a poet Memory came to him with a rush He recalled his instinctive dislike for the fellow So that was Milbank was it He got up and put away his brushes There would be no more work for him that afternoon He walked slowly home The heat of the day had grown steadily more oppressive It was one of those airless stifling afternoons which afflict New York in the summer He remembered seeing something about a record in the evening paper which he had bought on his way to the studio a whole column about heat and humidity It certainly felt unusually warm even for New York It was one of those days when nerves are strained when molehills become mountains and mountains are all Everests He had felt it when he talked with Ruth about Bill and the squirrels and he felt it now He was conscious of being extraordinarily irritated not so much with any particular person as with the world in general The very vagueness of Bailey s insinuations against Basil Milbank increased his resentment What a pompous ass Bailey was What a fool he had been to give Bailey such a chance of snubbing him What an extraordinarily futile and unpleasant world it was altogether He braced himself with an effort It was this heat which was making him magnify trifles Bailey was a fool Probably there was nothing whatever wrong with this fellow Milbank Probably he had some personal objection to the man and that was all And yet the image of Basil which had come back to his mind was not reassuring He had mistrusted him that night and he mistrusted him now What should he do Ruth was not Sybil She was not the sort of woman a man could forbid to do things It would require tact to induce her to refuse Basil s invitation As he reached the door an idea came to him so simple that he wondered that it had not occurred to him before It was perhaps an echo of his conversation with Steve He would get Ruth to come away with him to the shack in the Connecticut woods As he dwelt on the idea the heat of the day seemed to become less oppressive and his heart leaped How cool and pleasant it would be out there They would take Bill with them and live the simple life again in the country this time instead of in town Perhaps out there far away from the over crowded city he and Ruth would be able to come to an understanding and bridge over that ghastly gulf As for his work he could do that as well in the woods as in New York And anyhow he had earned a vacation For days mister Penway had been hinting that the time had arrived for a folding of the hands mister Penway s views on New York and its record humidity were strong and crisply expressed His idea he told Kirk was that some sport with a heart should loan him a couple of hundred bucks and let him beat it to the seashore before he melted In the drawing room Ruth was playing the piano softly as she had done so often at the studio Kirk went to her and kissed her A marked coolness in her reception of the kiss increased the feeling of nervousness which he had felt at the sight of her It came back to him that they had parted that afternoon for the first time on definitely hostile terms He decided to ignore the fact Something told him that Ruth had not forgotten but it might be that cheerfulness now would blot out the resentment of past irritability But in his embarrassment he was more than cheerful As Steve had been on the occasion of his visit to old John Bannister he was breezy breezy with an effort that was as painful to Ruth as it was to himself breezy with a horrible musical comedy breeziness He could have adopted no more fatal tone with Ruth at that moment All the afternoon she had been a complicated tangle of fretted nerves Her quarrel with Kirk Bailey s visit a conscience that would not lie down and go to sleep at her orders but insisted on running riot all these things had unfitted her to bear up amiably under sudden self conscious breeziness And the heat of the day charged now with the oppressiveness of long overdue thunder completed her mood When Kirk came in and began to speak the softest notes of the human voice would have jarred upon her And Kirk in his nervousness was almost shouting His voice rang through the room and Ruth winced away from it like a stricken thing From out of the hell of nerves and heat and interfering brothers there materialized itself as she sat there a very vivid hatred of Kirk Kirk meanwhile uneasy but a little guessing at the fury behind Ruth s calm face was expounding his great scheme his panacea for all the ills of domestic misunderstandings and parted lives Ruth old girl Ruth shuddered Ruth old girl I ve had a bully good idea It s getting too warm for anything in New York Did you ever feel anything like it is to day Why shouldn t you and I pop down to the shack and camp out there for a week or so And we would take Bill with us Just we three with somebody to do the cooking It would be great What do you say What Ruth said languidly was It s quite impossible It was damping but Kirk felt that at all costs he must refuse to be damped He clutched at his cheerfulness and held it Nonsense he retorted Why is it impossible It s a great idea Ruth half hid a yawn She knew she was behaving abominably and she was glad of it It s impossible as far as I m concerned I have a hundred things to do before I can leave New York Well I could do with a day or two to clear up a few bits of work I have on hand Why couldn t we start this day week It is out of the question for me About then I shall be on mister Milbank s yacht He has invited me to join his party The actual day is not settled but it will be in about a week s time Oh said Kirk Ruth said nothing Have you accepted the invitation I have not actually answered his letter I was just going to when you came in But you mean to accept it Certainly Several of my friends will be there Sybil for one Not Sybil Oh I know Bailey has made some ridiculous objection to her going but I mean to persuade her Kirk did not answer She looked at him steadily So Bailey did call on you this afternoon He told me he was going to but I hoped he would think better of it But apparently there are no limits to Bailey s stupidity Yes Bailey came to the studio He seemed troubled about this yacht party Did he advise you to forbid me to go Well yes he did And now you have come to do it Not at all I told Bailey that you were not the sort of woman one forbade to do things I m not There was a pause All the same I wish you wouldn t go Ruth did not answer It would be very jolly out at the shack Ruth shuddered elaborately and gave a little laugh Would it It s rather a question of taste Personally I can t imagine anything more depressing and uncomfortable than being cooped up in a draughty frame house miles away from anywhere There s no reason why you should not go though if you like that sort of thing Of course you must not take Bill Why not Kirk spoke calmly enough but he was very near the breaking point All his good resolutions had vanished under the acid of Ruth s manner I couldn t let him rough it like that Aunt Lora would have a fit Conditions being favourable it only needs a spark to explode a powder magazine and there are moments when a word can turn an outwardly calm and patient man into a raging maniac This introduction of missus Porter s name into the discussion at this particular point broke down the last remnants of Kirk s self control For a few seconds his fury so mastered him that he could not speak Then suddenly the storm passed and he found himself cool and venomous He looked at Ruth curiously It seemed incredible to him that he had ever loved her We had better get this settled he said in a hard quiet voice Ruth started She had never heard him speak like this before She had not imagined him capable of speaking in that way Even in the days when she had loved him most she had never looked up to him She had considered his nature weak and she had loved his weakness Except in the case of her father she had always dominated the persons with whom she mixed and she had taken it for granted that her will was stronger than Kirk s Something in his voice now told her that she had under estimated him Get what settled she asked and was furious with herself because her voice shook Is missus Porter the mother of the child or are you What has missus Porter to do with it Why should I ask her permission How does it happen to be any business of missus Porter s at all Ruth felt baffled He was giving her no chance to take the offensive There was nothing in his tone which she could openly resent He was not shouting at her he was speaking quietly There was nothing for her to do but answer the question and she knew that her answer would give him another point in the contest Even as she spoke she knew that her words were ridiculous Aunt Lora has been wonderful with him No child could have been better looked after I know she has used him as a vehicle for her particular form of insanity but that s not the point What I am asking is why she was introduced at all I told you When you were away Bill nearly Died I know I m not forgetting that And naturally for a time you were frightened It is just possible that for the moment you lost your head and honestly thought that missus Porter s methods were the only chance for him But that state of mind could not last all the time with you You are not a crank like your aunt You are a perfectly sensible level headed woman And you must have seen the idiocy of it all long before I came back Why did you let it go on Ruth did not answer I will tell you why Because it saved you trouble Because it gave you more leisure for the sort of futile waste of time which seems to be the only thing you care for nowadays Don t trouble to deny it Do you think I haven t seen in these last few months that Bill bores you to death Oh I know you always have some perfect excuse for keeping away from him It s too much trouble for you to be a mother to him so you hedge with your conscience by letting missus Porter pamper him and sterilize his toys and all the rest of it and try to make yourself think that you have done your duty to him You know that as far as everything goes that matters any tenement child is better off than Bill I You had better let me finish what I have got to say I will be as brief as I can That is my case as regards Bill Now about myself What do you think I am made of I ve stood it just as long as I could you have tried me too hard I m through Heaven knows why it should have come to this It is not so very long ago that Bill was half the world to you and I was the other half Now apparently there is not room in your world for either of us Ruth had risen She was trembling I think we had better end this He broke in on her words End it Yes you re right One way or the other Either go back to the old life or start a new one What we are living now is a horrible burlesque What do you mean How start a new life I mean exactly what I say In the life you are living now I am an anachronism I m a survival I m out of date and in the way You would be freer without me That s absurd Is the idea so novel Is our marriage the only failure in New York Do you mean that we ought to separate Only a little more a very little more than we are separated now Never see each other again instead of seeing each other for a few minutes every day It s not a very big step to take Ruth sat down and rested her chin on her hand staring at nothing Kirk went to the window and looked out Over the park the sky was black In the room behind him the light had faded till it seemed as if night were come The air was heavy and stifling A flicker of lightning came and went in the darkness over the trees He turned abruptly It is the only reasonable thing to do Our present mode of life is a farce We are drifting farther apart every day Perhaps I have changed I know you have We are two strangers chained together We have made a muddle of it and the best thing we can do is to admit it I am no good to you I have no part in your present life You re the queen and I m just the prince consort the fellow who happens to be missus Winfield s husband It s not a pleasant part to have to play and I have had enough of it We had better separate before we hate each other You have your amusements I have my work We can continue them apart We shall both be better off He stopped Ruth did not speak She was still sitting in the same attitude It was too dark to see her face It formed a little splash of white in the dusk She did not move Kirk went to the door I m going up to say good bye to Bill Have you anything to say against that And I shall say good bye to him in my own way She made no sign that she had heard him Good bye he said again The door closed Up in the nursery Bill crooned to himself as he played on the floor Mamie sat in a chair sewing The opening of the door caused them to look up simultaneously Hello said Bill His voice was cordial without being enthusiastic He was glad to see Kirk but tin soldiers were tin soldiers and demanded concentrated attention When you are in the middle of intricate manoeuvres you cannot allow yourself to be more than momentarily distracted by anything Mamie said Kirk hoarsely go out for a minute will you I shan t be long Mamie obediently departed Later when Keggs was spreading the news of Kirk s departure in the servants hall she remembered that his manner had struck her as strange Kirk sat down in the chair she had left and looked at Bill He felt choked There was a mist before his eyes Bill The child absorbed in his game did not look up Bill old man come here a minute I ve something to say Bill looked up nodded moved a couple of soldiers and got up He came to Kirk s side His chosen mode of progression at this time was a kind of lurch He was accustomed to breathe heavily during the journey and on arrival at the terminus usually shouted triumphantly Kirk put an arm round him Bill stared gravely up into his face There was a silence From outside came a sudden rumbling crash Bill jumped Funder he said in a voice that shook a little Not afraid of thunder are you said Kirk Bill shook his head stoutly Bill Yes daddy Kirk fought to keep his voice steady Bill old man I m afraid you won t see me again for some time I m going away In a ship No not in a ship In a train Perhaps Take me with you daddy I m afraid I can t Bill Shan t I ever see you again Kirk winced How direct children are What was it they called it in the papers The custody of the child How little it said and how much it meant The sight of Bill s wide eyes and quivering mouth reminded him that he was not the only person involved in the tragedy of those five words He pulled himself together Bill was waiting anxiously for an answer to his question There was no need to make Bill unhappy before his time Of course you will he said trying to make his voice cheerful Of course I will echoed Bill dutifully Kirk could not trust himself to speak again The old sensation of choking had come back to him The room was a blur He caught Bill to him in a grip that made the child cry out held him for a long minute then put him gently down and made blindly for the door The storm had burst by the time Kirk found himself in the street The thunder crashed and great spears of lightning flashed across the sky A few heavy drops heralded the approach of the rain and before he had reached the corner it was beating down in torrents He walked on raising his face to the storm finding in it a curious relief A magical coolness had crept into the air and with it a strange calm into his troubled mind He looked back at the scene through which he had passed as at something infinitely remote He could not realize distinctly what had happened He was only aware that everything was over that with a few words he had broken his life into small pieces Too impatient to unravel the tangled knot he had cut it and nothing could mend it now Why The rain had ceased as suddenly as it had begun The sun was struggling through a mass of thin cloud over the park The world was full of the drip and rush of water All that had made the day oppressive and strained nerves to breaking point had gone leaving peace behind Kirk felt like one waking from an evil dream Why did it happen he asked himself What made me do it A distant rumble of thunder answered the question Chapter VIII Steve to the Rescue It is an unfortunate fact that when a powder magazine explodes the damage is not confined to the person who struck the match but extends to the innocent bystanders In the present case it was Steve Dingle who sustained the worst injuries Of the others who might have been affected missus Lora Delane Porter was bomb proof No explosion in her neighbourhood could shake her She received the news of Kirk s outbreak with composure Privately in her eugenic heart she considered his presence superfluous now that William Bannister was safely launched upon his career In the drama of which she was the self appointed stage director Kirk was a mere super supporting the infant star Her great mind occupied almost entirely by the past and the future took little account of the present So long as Kirk did not interfere with her management of Bill he was at liberty so far as she was concerned to come or go as he pleased Steve could not imitate her admirable detachment He was a poor philosopher and all that his mind could grasp was that Kirk was in trouble and that Ruth had apparently gone mad The affair did not come to his ears immediately He visited the studio at frequent intervals and found Kirk there working hard and showing no signs of having passed through a crisis which had wrecked his life He was quiet it is true but then he was apt to be quiet nowadays Probably if it had not been for Keggs he would have been kept in ignorance of what had happened for a time Walking one evening up Broadway he met Keggs taking the air and observing the night life of New York like himself Keggs greeted Steve with enthusiasm He liked Steve and it was just possible that Steve might not have heard about the great upheaval He suggested a drink at a neighbouring saloon We have not seen you at our house lately mister Dingle he remarked having pecked at his glass of beer like an old wise bird He looked at Steve with a bright eye somewhat puffy at the lids but full of life No said Steve That s right Guess I must have been busy Keggs uttered a senile chuckle and drank more beer They re rum uns he went on I ve been in some queer places but this beats em all What do you mean inquired Steve as a second chuckle escaped his companion Why it s come to an ead things has mister Dingle That s what I mean You won t have forgotten all about the pampering of that child what I told you of quite recent Well it s been and come to an ead Yes Continue colonel This listens good You ain t eard Not a word Keggs smiled a happy smile and sipped his beer It did the old man good finding an entirely new audience like this Why mister Winfield as packed up and left Steve gasped Left he cried Not quit Not gone for good For his own good I should say Finds himself better off away from it all if you ask me But adn t you reelly heard mister Dingle God bless my soul I thought it was public property by now that little bit of noos Why mister Winfield asn t been living with us for the matter of a week or more For the love of Mike I m telling you the honest truth mister Dingle Two weeks ago come next Saturday mister Winfield meets me in the all looking wild and arassed it was the same day there was that big thunder storm and he looks at me glassy like and says to me Keggs ave my bag packed and my boxes too I m going away for a time I ll send a messenger for em And out he goes into the rain which begins to come down cats and dogs the moment he was in the street I start to go out after him with his rain coat thinking he d get wet before he could find a cab they being so scarce in this city not like London where you simply ave to raise your and to ave a dozen flocking round you but he don t stop he just goes walking off through the rain and all and I gets back into the house not wishing to be wetted myself on account of my rheumatism which is always troublesome in the damp weather And I says to myself Ullo ullo ullo what s all this See what I mean I could tell as plain as if I d been in the room with them that they had been having words And since that day e ain t been near the ouse and where he is now is more than I can tell you mister Dingle Why he s at the studio At the studio is he Well I shouldn t wonder if he wasn t better off E didn t strike me as a man what was used to the ways of society He s happier where he is I expect And having summed matters up in this philosophical manner Keggs drained his glass and cocked an expectant eye at Steve Steve obeyed the signal and ordered a further supply of the beer for which mister Keggs had a plebian and unbutlerlike fondness His companion turned the conversation to the prospects of one of that group of inefficient middleweights whom Steve so heartily despised between whom and another of the same degraded band a ten round contest had been arranged and would shortly take place Ordinarily this would have been a subject on which Steve would have found plenty to say but his mind was occupied with what he had just heard and he sat silent while the silver haired patron of sport opposite prattled on respecting current form Steve felt stunned It was unthinkable that this thing had really occurred mister Keggs sipping beer discussed the coming fight He weighed the alleged left hook of one principal against the much advertised right swing of the other He spoke with apprehension of a yellow streak which certain purists claimed to have discovered in the gladiator on whose chances he proposed to invest his cash Steve was not listening to him A sudden thought had come to him filling his mind to the exclusion of all else The recollection of his talk with Kirk at the studio had come back to him He had advised Kirk as a solution of his difficulties to kidnap the child and take him to Connecticut Well Kirk was out of the running now but he Steve was still in it He would do it himself The idea thrilled him It was so in keeping with his theory of the virtue of the swift and immediate punch administered with the minimum of preliminary sparring There was a risk attached to the scheme which appealed to him Above all he honestly believed that it would achieve its object the straightening out of the tangle which Ruth and Kirk had made of their lives When once an idea had entered Steve s head he was tenacious of it He had come to the decision that Ruth needed what he called a jolt to bring her to herself much as a sleep walker is aroused by the touch of a hand and he clung to it He interrupted mister Keggs in the middle of a speech touching on his man s alleged yellow streak Will you be at home to night colonel he asked I certainly will mister Dingle Mind if I look in I shall be delighted I can offer you a cigar that I think you ll appreciate and we can continue this little chat at our leisure missus Winfield s dining out and that there Porter thank Gawd as gone to Boston Chapter IX At One in the Morning William Bannister Winfield slept the peaceful sleep of childhood in his sterilized cot The light gleamed faintly on the white tiles It lit up the brass knobs on the walls the spotless curtains the large thermometer An intruder interested in these things would have seen by a glance at this last that the temperature of the room was exactly that recommended by doctors as the correct temperature for the nursery of a sleeping child no higher no lower The transom over the door was closed but the window was open at the top to precisely the extent advocated by the authorities due consideration having been taken for the time of year and the condition of the outer atmosphere The hour was one in the morning Childhood is a readily adaptable time of life and William Bannister after a few days of blank astonishment varied by open mutiny had accepted the change in his surroundings and daily existence with admirable philosophy His memory was not far reaching and as time went on and he began to accommodate himself to the new situation he had gradually forgotten the days at the studio as it is to be supposed he had forgotten the clouds of glory which he had trailed on his entry into this world If memories of past bear hunts among the canvases on the dusty floor ever came to him now he never mentioned it A child can weave romance into any condition of life in which fate places him and William Bannister had managed to interest himself in his present existence with a considerable gusto Scraps of conversation between missus Porter and Mamie overheard and digested had given him a good working knowledge of the system of hygiene of which he was the centre He was vague as to details but not vaguer than most people He knew that something called sterilizing was the beginning and end of life and that things known as germs were the Great Peril He had expended much thought on the subject of germs Mamie questioned could give him no more definite information than that they were things which got at you and hurt you and his awe of missus Porter had kept him from going to the fountainhead of knowledge for further data Building on the information to hand he had formed in his mind an odd kind of anthropomorphic image of the germ He pictured it as a squat thick set man of repellent aspect and stealthy movements who sneaked up on you when you were not looking and did unpleasant things to you selecting as the time for his attacks those nights when you had allowed your attention to wander while saying your prayers On such occasions it was Bill s practice to fool him by repeating his prayers to himself in bed after the official ceremony Some times to make certain he would do this so often that he fell asleep in mid prayer He was always glad of the night light A germ hates light preferring to do his scoundrelly work when it is so black that you can t see your hand in front of your face and the darkness presses down on you like a blanket Occasionally a fear would cross his mind that the night light might go out but it never did being one of mister Edison s best electric efforts neatly draped with black veiling Apart from this he had few worries certainly none serious enough to keep him awake He was sleeping now his head on his right arm a sterilized Teddy bear clutched firmly in his other hand with the concentration of one engaged upon a feat at which he is an expert The door opened slowly A head insinuated itself into the room furtively as if uncertain of its welcome The door continued to open and Steve slipped in He closed the door as gently as he had opened it and stood there glancing about him A slow grin appeared upon his face to be succeeded by an expression of serious resolve For Steve was anxious It was still Steve s intention to remove steal purloin and kidnap William Bannister that night but now that the moment had come for doing it he was nervous He was not used to this sort of thing He was an honest ex middleweight not a burglar and just now he felt particularly burglarious The stillness of the house oppressed him He had not relished the long wait between the moment of his apparent departure and that of his entry into the nursery He had acted with simple cunning He had remained talking pugilism with Keggs in the pantry till a prodigious yawn from his host had told him that the time was come for the breaking up of the party Then begging Keggs not to move as he could find his way out he had hurried to the back door opened and shut it and darted into hiding Presently Keggs yawning loudly had toddled along the passage bolted the door and made his way upstairs to bed leaving Steve to his vigil Steve s reflections during this period had not been of the pleasantest Exactly what his explanation was to be if by any mischance he should make a noise and be detected he had been unable to decide Finally he had dismissed the problem as insoluble and had concentrated his mind on taking precautions to omit any such noise So far he had succeeded He had found his way to the nursery easily enough having marked the location earnestly on his previous visits During the whole of his conversation with Keggs in the pantry he had been repeating to himself the magic formula which began First staircase to the left turn to the right and here he was now at his goal and ready to begin But it was just this question of beginning which exercised him so grievously How was he to begin Should he go straight to the cot and wake the kid Suppose the kid was scared and let out a howl A warm prickly sensation about the forehead was Steve s silent comment on this reflection He took a step forward and stopped again He was conscious of tremors about the region of the spine The thought crossed his mind at that moment that burglars earned their money As he stood hesitating his problem was solved for him There came a heavy sigh from the direction of the cot which made him start as if a pistol had exploded in his ear and then he was aware of two large eyes staring at him There was a tense pause A drop of perspiration rolled down his cheek bone and anchored itself stickily on the angle of his jaw It tickled abominably but he did not dare to move for fear of unleashing the scream which brooded over the situation like a cloud At any moment now a howl of terror might rip the silence and bring the household on the run And then the explanations A second drop of perspiration started out in the wake of the first The large eyes continued to inspect him They were clouded with sleep Suddenly a frightened look came into them and as he saw it Steve braced his muscles for the shock Here it comes he said miserably to himself Oh Lord We re off He searched in his brain for speech desperately as the best man at a wedding searches for that ring while the universe stands still waiting expectantly He found no speech The child s mouth opened Steve eyed him fascinated No bird encountering a snake was ever so incapable of movement as he Are you a germ inquired William Bannister Steve tottered to the cot and sat down on it The relief was too much for him Gee kid he said you had my goat then I ve got to hand it to you His sudden approach had confirmed William Bannister s worst suspicions This was precisely how he had expected the germ to behave He shrank back on the pillow gulping Why for the love of Mike said Steve don t you know me kid I m not a porch climber Don t you remember Steve who used to raise Hades with you at the studio Darn it I m your godfather I m Steve William Bannister sat up partially reassured What s Steve he inquired I m Steve Why How do you mean why The large eyes inspected him gravely I remember he said finally Well don t go forgetting kid I couldn t stand a second session like that I got a weak heart You re Steve That s right Stick to that and we ll get along fine I thought you were a germ A what They get at you and hurt you Who said so Mamie Are you scared of germs The White Hope nodded gravely I have to be sterilized because of them Are you sterilized Nobody ever told me so But say kid you don t want to be frightened of germs or microbes or bacilli or any of the rest of the circus You don t want to be frightened of nothing You re the White Hope the bear cat that ain t scared of anything on earth What s this germ thing like anyway It s a I ve never seen one but Mamie says they get at you and hurt you I think it s a kind of big sort of ugly man that creeps in when you re asleep So that s why you thought I was one The White Hope nodded Forget it said Steve Mamie is a queen all right believe me but she s got the wrong dope on this microbe proposition You don t need to be scared of them any more Why some of me best pals are germs What s pals Why friends You and me are pals Me and your pop are pals Where s pop He s gone away I remember He thought he needed a change of air Don t you ever need a change of air I don t know Well you do Take it from me This is about the punkest joint I ever was in You don t want to stay in a dairy kitchen like this What s dairy kitchen This is All these white tiles and fixings It makes me feel like a pint of milk to look at em It s because of the germs Ain t I telling you the germs don t want to hurt you Aunt Lora told Mamie they do Say cull you tell your Aunt Lora to make a noise like an ice cream in the sun and melt away She s a prune and what she says don t go Do you want to know what a germ or a microbe it s the same thing really is It s a fellow that has the best time you can think of They ve been fooling you kid They saw you were easy so they handed it to you on a plate I m the guy that can put you wise about microbes Tell me Sure Well a microbe is a kid that just runs wild out in the country He don t have to hang around in a white tiled nursery and eat sterilized junk and go to bed when they tell him to He has a swell time out in the woods fishing and playing around in the dirt and going after birds eggs and picking berries and oh shucks anything else you can think of Wouldn t you like to do that William Bannister nodded Well say as it happens there s a fine chance for you to be a germ right away I know a little place down in the Connecticut woods which would just hit you right You could put on overalls What s overalls Sort of clothes Not like the fussed up scenery you have to wear now but the real sort of clothes which you can muss up and nobody cares a darn You can put em on and go out and tear up Jack like a regular kid all you want Say don t you remember the fool stunts you and me used to pull off in the studio What studio Gee you re a bit shy on your English ain t you It makes it sort of hard for a guy to keep up what you might call a flow of talk Still you should worry Why don t you remember where you used to live before you came to this joint Big dusty sort of place where you and me used to play around on the floor The White Hope nodded Well wouldn t you like to do that again Yes And be a regular microbe Yes Steve looked at his watch Well that s lucky he said It happens to be exactly the right time for starting out to be one That s curious ain t it Yes I ve got a pal friend you know Is he a germ Sure He s waiting for me now in an automobile in the park Why Because I asked him to He owns a garage Place where automobiles live you know I asked him to bring out a car and wait around near by because I might be taking a pal of mine that s you for a ride into the country to night Of course you don t have to come if you don t want to Only it s mighty nice out there You can spend all to morrow rolling about in the grass and listening to the birds I shouldn t wonder if we couldn t borrow a farmer s kid for you to play with There s lots of them around He should show you the best time you ve had in months William Bannister s eyes gleamed The finer points of the scheme were beginning to stand out before him with a growing clarity Would I have to take my bib he asked excitedly Steve uttered a scornful laugh No sir We don t wear bibs out there As far as William Bannister was concerned this appeared to settle it Of all the trials of his young life he hated most his bib Let s go Steve breathed a sigh of relief Right squire we will he said But I guess we had best leave a letter for Mamie so s she won t be wondering where you ve got to Will Mamie be cross Not on your life She ll be tickled to death He scribbled a few lines on a piece of paper and left them on the cot from which William Bannister had now scrambled Can you dress yourself asked Steve Oh yes It was an accomplishment of which the White Hope was extremely proud Well go to it then Steve Hello Won t it be a surprise for Mamie You bet it will And she won t be the only one at that Will mother be surprised She sure will And pop You bet William Bannister chuckled delightedly Ready said Steve Yes Now listen We ve got to get out of this joint as quiet as mice It would spoil the surprise if they was to hear us and come out and ask what we were doing Get that Yes Well see how quiet you can make it You don t want even to breathe more than you can help They left the room and crept down the dark stairs In the hall Steve lit a match and switched on the electric light He unbolted the door and peered out into the avenue Close by under the trees stood an automobile its headlights staring into the night Quick cried Steve He picked up the White Hope closed the door and ran Chapter X Accepting the Gifts of the Gods It was fortunate considering the magnitude of the shock which she was to receive that circumstances had given Steve s Mamie unusual powers of resistance in the matter of shocks For years before her introduction into the home of the Winfield family her life had been one long series of crises She had never known what the morrow might bring forth though experience had convinced her that it was pretty certain to bring forth something agitating which would call for all her well known ability to handle disaster The sole care of three small brothers and a weak minded father gives a girl exceptional opportunities of cultivating poise under difficult conditions It had become second nature with Mamie to keep her head though the heavens fell Consequently when she entered the nursery next morning and found it empty she did not go into hysterics She did not even scream She read Steve s note twice very carefully then sat down to think what was her best plan of action Her ingrained habit of looking on the bright side of things the result of a life which had pessimism been allowed to rule it might have ended prematurely with what the papers are fond of calling a rash act led her to consider first those points in the situation which she labelled in her meditations as bits of luck It was a bit of luck that missus Porter happened to be away for the moment It gave her time for reflection It was another bit of luck that as she had learned from Keggs whom she met on the stairs on her way to the nursery a mysterious telephone call had caused Ruth to rise from her bed some three hours before her usual time and depart hurriedly in a cab This also helped Keggs had no information to give as to Ruth s destination or the probable hour of her return She had vanished without a word except a request to Keggs to tell the driver of her taxi to go to the Thirty Third Street subway Must a ad bad noos Keggs thought because she were look n white as a sheet Mamie was sorry that Ruth had had bad news but her departure certainly helped to relieve the pressure of an appalling situation With the absence of Ruth and missus Porter the bits of luck came to an end Try as she would Mamie could discover no other silver linings in the cloud bank And even these ameliorations of the disaster were only temporary Ruth would return Worse missus Porter would return Like two Mother Hubbards they would go to the cupboard and the cupboard would be bare And to her Mamie would fall the task of explanation The only explanation that occurred to her was that Steve had gone suddenly mad He had given no hint of his altruistic motives in the hurried scrawl which she had found on the empty cot He had merely said that he had taken away William Bannister but that it was all right Why Steve should imagine that it was all right baffled Mamie Anything less all right she had never come across in a lifetime of disconcerting experiences She was aware that things were not as they should be between Ruth and Kirk and the spectacle of the broken home had troubled her gentle heart but she failed to establish a connection between Kirk s departure and Steve s midnight raid After devoting some ten minutes to steady brainwork she permitted herself the indulgence of a few tears She did not often behave in this shockingly weak way her role in life hitherto having been that of the one calm person in a disrupted world When her father had lost his job and the rent was due and Brother Jim had fallen in the mud to the detriment of his only suit of clothes and Brothers Terence and Mike had developed respectively a sore throat and a funny feeling in the chest she had remained dry eyed and capable Her father had cried her brother Jim had cried her brother Terence had cried and her brother Mike had cried in a manner that made the weeping of the rest of the family seem like the uncanny stillness of a summer night but she had not shed a tear Now however she gave way She buried her little face on the pillow which so brief a while before had been pressed by the round head of William Bannister and mourned like a modern Niobe At the end of two minutes she rose sniffing but courageous herself again In her misery an idea had come to her It was quite a simple and obvious idea but till now it had eluded her She would go round to the studio and see Kirk After all it was his affair as much as anybody else s and she had a feeling that it would be easier to break the news to him than to Ruth and missus Porter She washed her eyes put on her hat and set out Luck however was not running her way that morning Arriving at the studio she rang the bell and rang and rang again without result except a marked increase in her already substantial depression When it became plain to her that the studio was empty she desisted It is an illustration of her remarkable force of character that at this point refusing to be crushed by the bludgeoning of fate she walked to Broadway and went into a moving picture palace There was nothing to be effected by staying in the house and worrying so she resolutely declined to worry From this point onward her day divided itself into a series of three movements repeated at regular intervals From the moving pictures she went to the house on Fifth Avenue Finding that neither Ruth nor missus Porter had returned she went to the studio Ringing the bell there and getting no answer she took in the movies once more Mamie was a philosopher The atmosphere of the great house was still untroubled on her second visit The care of the White Hope had always been left exclusively in the hands of the women and the rest of the household had not yet detected his absence It was not their business to watch his comings in and his goings out Besides they had other things to occupy them The unique occasion of the double absence of Ruth and missus Porter was being celebrated by a sort of Saturnalia or slaves holiday It was true that either or both might return at any moment but there was a disposition on the part of the domestic staff to take a chance on it Keggs that sinful butler had strolled round to an apparently untenanted house on Forty First Street where those who knew their New York could by giving the signal obtain admittance and the privilege of losing their money at the pleasing game of roulette with a double zero George the footman in company with Henriette the lady s maid and Rollins the chauffeur who had butted in absolutely uninvited to George s acute disgust were taking the air in the park The rest of the staff with the exception of a house maid who had been bribed with two dollars and an old dress which had once been Ruth s and was now the property of Henriette to stand by the ship were somewhere on the island amusing themselves in the way that seemed best to them For all practical purposes it was a safe and sane Fourth provided out of a blue sky by the god of chance It was about five o clock when Mamie having at a modest estimate seen five hundred persecuted heroes a thousand ill used heroines several regiments of cowboys and perhaps two thousand comic men pursued by angry mobs returned from her usual visit to the studio This time there were signs of hope in the shape of a large automobile opposite the door She rang the bell and there came from within the welcome sound of footsteps An elderly man of a somewhat dissipated countenance opened the door I want to see mister Winfield said Mamie mister Penway for it was he gave her the approving glance which your man of taste and discrimination does not fail to bestow upon youth and beauty and bawled over his shoulder Kirk Kirk came down the passage He was looking brown and healthy He was in his shirt sleeves Oh mister Winfield I m in such trouble Why Mamie What s the matter Come in Mamie followed him into the studio eluding mister Penway whose arm was hovering in the neighbourhood of her waist Sit down said Kirk What s the trouble Have you been trying to get at me before We ve been down to Long Beach A delightful spot observed mister Penway who had followed Sandy but replete with squabs Why didn t you come earlier We could have taken you May I talk privately with you mister Winfield Sure Kirk looked at mister Penway who nodded agreeably Outside for Robert he inquired amiably Very well There is no Buttinsky blood in the Penway family Let me just fix myself a high ball and borrow one of your cigars and I ll go and sit in the car and commune with nature Take your time Just a moment Mamie said Kirk when he had gone He picked up a telegram which lay on the table I ll read this and see if it s important and then we ll get right down to business We only got back a moment before you arrived so I m a bit behind with my correspondence As he read the telegram a look of astonishment came into his face He sat down and read the message a second time Mamie waited patiently Good Lord he muttered A sudden thought struck Mamie mister Winfield is it from Steve she said Kirk started and looked at her incredulously How on earth did you know Good Heavens Are you in this Mamie too Mamie handed him her note He read it without a word When he had finished he sat back in his chair thinking I thought Steve might have telegraphed to you said Mamie Kirk roused himself from his thoughts Was this what you came to see me about Yes What does Ruth what do they think of it up there They don t know anything about it missus Winfield went away early this morning mister Keggs said she had had a telephone call missus Porter is in Boston She will be back to day some time What are we to do Do Kirk jumped up and began to pace the floor I ll tell you what I m going to do Steve has taken the boy up to my shack in Connecticut I m going there as fast as the auto can take me Steve s mad Is he Steve s the best pal I ve got For two years I ve been aching to get at this boy and Steve has had the sense to show me the way He went on as if talking to himself Steve s a man I m just a fool who hangs round without the nerve to act If I had had the pluck of a rabbit I d have done this myself six months ago But I ve hung round doing nothing while that damned Porter woman played the fool with the boy I ll be lucky now if he remembers who I am He turned abruptly to Mamie Mamie you can tell them whatever you please when you get home They can t blame you It s not your fault Tell them that Steve was acting for me with my complete approval Tell them that the kid s going to be brought up right from now on I ve got him and I m going to keep him Mamie had risen and was facing him a very determined midget pink and resolute I m not going home mister Winfield What If you are going to Bill I am coming with you Nonsense That s my place with him But you can t It s impossible Not more impossible than what has happened already I won t take you Then I ll go by train I know where your house is Steve told me It s out of the question Mamie s Irish temper got the better of her professional desire to maintain the discreetly respectful attitude of employee toward employer Is it then We ll see Do you think I m going to leave you and Steve to look after my Bill What do men know about taking care of children You would choke the poor mite or let him kill himself a hundred ways She glared at him defiantly He glared back at her Then his sense of humour came to his rescue She looked so absurdly small standing there with her chin up and her fists clenched He laughed delightedly He went up to her and placed a hand on each of her shoulders looking down at her He felt that he loved her for her championship of Bill You re a brick Mamie Of course you shall come We ll call at the house and you can pack your grip But by George if you put that infernal thermometer in I ll run the automobile up against a telegraph pole and then Bill will lose us both Finished said a voice Oh I beg your pardon Sorry mister Penway was gazing at them with affectionate interest from the doorway Kirk released Mamie and stepped back I only looked in explained mister Penway Didn t mean to intrude Thought you might have finished your chat and it was a trifle lonely communing with nature Bob said Kirk you ll have to get on without me for a day or two Make yourself at home You know where everything is I can satisfy my simple needs Thinking of going away I ve got to go up to Connecticut I don t know how long I shall be away Take your time said mister Penway affably Going in the auto Yes The weather is very pleasant for automobiling just now remarked mister Penway Ten minutes later having thrown a few things together into a bag Kirk took his place at the wheel Mamie sat beside him The bag had the rear seat to itself There seems to be plenty of room still said mister Penway I have half a mind to come with you He looked at Mamie But on reflection I fancy you can get along without me He stood at the door gazing after the motor as it moved down the street When it had turned the corner he went back into the studio and mixed himself a high ball Kirk does manage to find them he said enviously Chapter XI mister Penway on the Grill Fate moves in a mysterious way Luck comes hand in hand with misfortune What we lose on the swings we make up on the roundabouts If Keggs had not seen twenty five of his hard earned dollars pass at one swoop into the clutches of the croupier at the apparently untenanted house on Forty First Street and become disgusted with the pleasing game of roulette he might have delayed his return to the house on Fifth Avenue till a later hour in which case he would have missed the remarkable and stimulating spectacle of Kirk driving to the door in an automobile with Mamie at his side of Mamie jumping out and entering the house of Mamie leaving the house with a suit case of Kirk helping her into the automobile and of the automobile disappearing with its interesting occupants up the avenue at a high rate of speed Having lost his money as stated and having returned home he was enabled to be a witness the only witness of these notable events and his breast was filled with a calm joy in consequence This was something special This was exclusive a scoop He looked forward to the return of missus Porter with an eagerness which earlier in the day he would have considered impossible Somehow Ruth did not figure in his picture of the delivery of the sensational news that mister Winfield had eloped with the young person engaged to look after her son missus Porter s was one of those characters which monopolize any stage on which they appear Besides Keggs disliked missus Porter and the pleasure of the prospect of giving her a shock left no room for other thoughts It was nearly seven o clock when missus Porter reached the house She was a little tired from the journey but in high good humour She had had a thoroughly satisfactory interview with her publishers satisfactory that is to say to herself the publishers had other views Is missus Winfield in she asked Keggs as he admitted her Ruth was always sympathetic about her guerrilla warfare with the publishers She looked forward to a cosy chat in the course of which she would trace step by step the progress of the late campaign which had begun overnight and had culminated that morning in a sort of Gettysburg from which she had emerged with her arms full of captured flags and all the other trophies of conquest No madam said Keggs missus Winfield has not yet returned Keggs was an artist in tragic narration He did not give away his climax he led up to it by degrees as slow as his audience would permit Returned I did not know she intended to go away Her yacht party is next week I understand Yes madam Where has she gone To Tuxedo madam Tuxedo missus Winfield has just rung us up from there upon the telephone to request that necessaries for an indefinite stay be despatched to her She is visiting missus Bailey Bannister If missus Porter had been Steve she would probably have said For the love of Mike at this point Being herself she merely repeated the butler s last words If I may be allowed to say so madam I think that there must have been trouble at missus Bannister s A telephone call came from her very early this morning for missus Winfield which caused missus Winfield to rise and leave in a taximeter cab in an extreme hurry If I might be allowed to suggest it it is probably a case of serious illness missus Winfield was looking very disturbed H m said missus Porter The exclamation was one of disappointment rather than of apprehension Sudden illnesses at the Bailey home did not stir her but she was annoyed that her recital of the squelching of the publishers would have to wait She went upstairs Her intention was to look in at the nursery and satisfy herself that all was well with William Bannister She had given Mamie specific instructions as to his care on her departure but you never knew Perhaps her keen eye might be able to detect some deviation from the rules she had laid down It detected one at once The nursery was empty According to schedule the child should have been taking his bath She went downstairs again Keggs was waiting in the hall He had foreseen this return He had allowed her to go upstairs with his story but half heard because that appealed to his artistic sense This story to his mind was too good to be bolted at a sitting it was the ideal serial Keggs Madam Where is Master William I fear I do not know madam When did he go out It is seven o clock he should have been in an hour ago I have been making inquiries madam and I regret to inform you that nobody appears to have seen Master William all day What It not being my place to follow his movements I was unaware of this until quite recently but from conversation with the other domestics I find that he seems to have disappeared Disappeared A glow of enjoyment such as he had sometimes experienced when the ticker at the Cadillac Hotel informed him that the man he had backed in some San Francisco fight had upset his opponent for the count began to permeate Keggs Disappeared madam he repeated Perhaps missus Winfield took him with her to Tuxedo No madam missus Winfield was alone I was present when she drove away Send Mamie to me at once said missus Porter Keggs could have whooped with delight had not such an action seemed to him likely to prejudice his chances of retaining a good situation He contented himself with wriggling ecstatically The young person is not in the house madam Not in the house What business has she to be out Where is she I could not tell you madam Keggs paused reluctant to deal the final blow as a child lingers lovingly over the last lick of ice cream in a cone I last saw her at about five o clock driving off with mister Winfield in an automobile What Keggs was content His climax had not missed fire Its staggering effect was plain on the face of his hearer For once missus Porter s poise had deserted her Her one word had been a scream She did not tell me her destination madam went on Keggs making all that could be made of what was left of the situation after its artistic finish She came in and packed a suit case and went out again and joined mister Winfield in the automobile and they drove off together missus Porter recovered herself This was a matter which called for silent meditation not for chit chat with a garrulous butler That will do Keggs Very good madam Keggs withdrew to his pantry well pleased He considered that he had done himself justice as a raconteur He had not spoiled a good story in the telling missus Porter went to her room and sat down to think She was a woman of action and she soon reached a decision The errant pair must be followed and at once Her great mind playing over the situation like a searchlight detected a connection between this elopement and the disappearance of William Bannister She had long since marked Kirk down as a malcontent and she now labelled the absent Mamie as a snake in the grass who had feigned submission to her rule while meditating all the time the theft of the child and the elopement with Kirk She had placed the same construction on Mamie s departure with Kirk as had mister Penway showing that it is not only great minds that think alike A latent conviction as to the immorality of all artists which had been one of the maxims of her late mother sprang into life She blamed herself for having allowed a nurse of such undeniable physical attractions to become a member of the household Mamie s very quietness and apparent absence of bad qualities became additional evidence against her now missus Porter arguing that these things indicated deep deceitfulness She told herself what was not the case that she had never trusted that girl But Lora Delane Porter was not a woman to waste time in retrospection She had not been in her room five minutes before her mind was made up It was improbable that Kirk and his guilty accomplice had sought so near and obvious a haven as the studio but it was undoubtedly there that pursuit must begin She knew nothing of his way of living at that retreat but she imagined that he must have appointed some successor to George Pennicut as general factotum and it might be that this person would have information to impart The task of inducing him to impart it did not daunt missus Porter She had a just confidence in her powers of cross examination She went to the telephone and called up the garage where Ruth s automobiles were housed Her plan of action was now complete If no information were forthcoming at the studio she would endeavour to find out where Kirk had hired the car in which he had taken Mamie away He would probably have secured it from some garage near by But this detective work would be a last resource Like a good general she did not admit of the possibility of failing in her first attack And luck being with her it happened that at the moment when she set out mister Penway feeling pretty comfortable where he was abandoned his idea of going out for a stroll along Broadway and settled himself to pass the next few hours in Kirk s armchair mister Penway s first feeling when the bell rang rousing him from his peaceful musings was one of mild vexation A few minutes later when missus Porter had really got to work upon him he would not have recognized that tepid emotion as vexation at all missus Porter wasted no time She perforated mister Penway s spine with her eyes reduced it to the consistency of summer squash and drove him before her into the studio where she took a seat and motioned him to do the same For a moment she sat looking at him by way of completing the work of subjection while mister Penway writhed uneasily on his chair and thought of past sins My name is missus Porter she began abruptly Mine s Penway said the miserable being before her It struck him as the only thing to say I have come to inquire about mister Winfield As she paused mister Penway felt it incumbent upon him to speak again Dear old Kirk he mumbled Nothing of the kind said missus Porter sharply mister Winfield is a scoundrel of the worst type and if you are as intimate a friend of his as your words imply it does not argue well for your respectability mister Penway opened his mouth feebly and closed it again Having closed it he reopened it and allowed it to remain ajar as it were It was his idea of being conciliatory Tell me mister Penway started violently Tell me when did you last see mister Winfield We went to Long Beach together this afternoon In an automobile Yes Ah Were you here when mister Winfield left again For the life of him mister Penway had not the courage to say no There was something about this woman s stare which acted hypnotically upon his mind never at its best as early in the evening He nodded There was a young woman with him pursued missus Porter At this moment mister Penway s eyes roving desperately about the room fell upon the bottle of Bourbon which Kirk s kindly hospitality had provided His emotions at the sight of it were those of the shipwrecked mariner who see a sail He sprang at it and poured himself out a stiff dose Before missus Porter s disgusted gaze he drained the glass and then turned to her a new man The noble spirit restored his own For the first time since the interview had begun he felt capable of sustaining his end of the conversation with ease and dignity How s that he said There was a young woman with him repeated missus Porter mister Penway imagined that he had placed her by this time Here he told himself in his own crude language was the squab s mother camping on Kirk s trail with an axe mister Penway s moral code was of the easiest description His sympathies were entirely with Kirk Fortified by the Bourbon he set himself resolutely to the task of lying whole heartedly on behalf of his absent friend No he said firmly No exclaimed missus Porter No repeated mister Penway with iron resolution No young woman No young woman whatsoever I noticed it particularly because I thought it strange don t you know what I mean is don t you know strange there shouldn t be How tragic is a man s fruitless fight on behalf of a friend For one short instant missus Porter allowed mister Penway to imagine that the victory was his then she administered the coup de grace Don t lie you worthless creature she said They stopped at my house on their way while the girl packed a suitcase mister Penway threw up his brief There are moments when the stoutest hearted even under the influence of old Bourbon realize that to fight on is merely to fight in vain He condensed his emotions into four words Of all the chumps he remarked and pouring himself out a further instalment of the raw spirit he sat down a beaten man missus Porter continued to harry him Exactly she said So you see that there is no need for any more subterfuge and concealment I do not intend to leave this room until you have told me all you have to tell so you had better be quick about it Kindly tell me the truth in as few words as possible if you know what is meant by telling the truth A belated tenderness for his dignity came to mister Penway You are insulting he remarked You are you are most insulting I meant to be said missus Porter crisply Now Tell me Where has mister Winfield gone mister Penway preserved an offended silence missus Porter struck the table a blow with a book which caused him to leap in his seat Where has mister Winfield gone How should I know How should you know Because he told you I should imagine Where has mister Winfield gone C nnecticut said mister Penway finally capitulating What part of Connecticut I don t know What part of Connecticut I tell you I don t know He said I m off to Connecticut and left It suddenly struck mister Penway that his defeat was not so overwhelming as he had imagined So you haven t got much out of me you see after all he added missus Porter rose On the contrary she said I have got out of you precisely the information which I required and in considerably less time than I had supposed likely If it interests you I may tell you that mister Winfield has gone to a small house which he owns in the Connecticut woods Then what demanded mister Penway indignantly did you mean by keeping on saying What part of C nnecticut What part of C nnecticut What part Because mister Winfield s destination has only just occurred to me She looked at him closely You are a curious and not uninteresting object mister Penway mister Penway started Eh Object lesson I should have said I should like to exhibit you as a warning to the youth of this country What From the look of your frame I should imagine that you were once a man of some physique Your shoulders are good Even now a rigorous course of physical training might save you I have known more helpless cases saved by firm treatment You have allowed yourself to deteriorate much as did a man named Pennicut who used to be employed here by mister Winfield I saved him I dare say I could make something of you I can see at a glance that you eat drink and smoke too much You could not hold out your hand now at this minute without it trembling I could said mister Penway indignantly He held it out and it quivered like a tuning fork There said missus Porter calmly What do you expect You know your own business best I suppose but I should like to tell you that if you do not become a teetotaller instantly and begin taking exercise you will probably die suddenly within a very few years Personally I shall bear the calamity with fortitude Good evening mister Penway For some moments after she had gone mister Penway sat staring before him His eyes wore a glassy look His mouth was still ajar Damn woman he said at length He turned to his meditations Damn impertinent woman Another interval for reflection and he spoke again Damn impertinent interfering woman that He reached out for the bottle of Bourbon and filled his glass He put it to his lips then slowly withdrew it Damn impertinent inter I wonder There was a small mirror on the opposite wall He walked unsteadily toward it and put out his tongue He continued in this attitude for a time then with increased dejection turned away He placed a hand over his heart This seemed to depress him still further Finally he went to the table took up the glass poured its contents carefully back into the bottle which he corked and replaced on the shelf On the floor against the wall was a pair of Indian clubs He picked these up and examined them owlishly He gave them little tentative jerks Finally with the air of a man carrying out a great resolution he began to swing them He swung them in slow irregular sweeps his eyes the while still glassy staring fixedly at the ceiling Chapter XII Dolls with Souls Ruth had not seen Bailey since the afternoon when he had called to warn her against Basil Milbank Whether it was offended dignity that kept him away or merely pressure of business she did not know That pressure of business existed she was aware The papers were full and had been full for several days of wars and rumours of wars down in Wall Street and though she understood nothing of finance she knew that Bailey was in the forefront of the battle Her knowledge was based partly on occasional references in the papers to the firm of Bannister company and partly on what she heard in society She did not hear all that was said in society about Bailey s financial operations which as Bailey had the control of her money was unfortunate for her The manipulation of money bored her and she had left the investing of her legacy entirely to Bailey Her father she knew had always had a high opinion of Bailey s business instincts and that was good enough for her She could not know how completely revolutionized the latter s mind had become since the old man s death and how freedom had turned him from a steady young man of business to a frenzied financier It was common report now that Bailey was taking big chances Some went so far as to say that he was asking for it it in his case being presumably the Nemesis which waits on those who take big chances in an uncertain market It was in the air that he was going up against the Pinkey Dowd group and the Norman Graham combination and everybody knew that the cemeteries of Wall Street were full of the unhonoured graves of others who in years past had attempted to do the same Pinkey that sinister buccaneer could have eaten a dozen Baileys Devouring aspiring young men of the Bailey type was Norman s chief diversion Ruth knew nothing of these things She told herself that it was her abruptness that had driven Bailey away Weariness and depression had settled on Ruth since that afternoon of the storm It was as if the storm had wrought an awakening in her It had marked a definite point of change in her outlook She felt as if she had been roused from a trance by a sharp blow If Steve had but known she had had the jolt by which he set such store She knew now that she had thrown away the substance for the shadow Kirk s anger so unlike him so foreign to the weak easy going person she had always thought him had brought her to herself But it was too late There could be no going back and picking up the threads She had lost him and must bear the consequences The withdrawal of Bailey was a small thing by comparison a submotive in the greater tragedy But she had always been fond of Bailey and it hurt her to think that she should have driven him out of her life It seemed to her that she was very much alone now She was marooned on a desert island of froth and laughter Everything that mattered she had lost Even Bill had gone from her The bitter justice of Kirk s words came home to her now in her time of clear thinking It was all true In the first excitement of the new life he had bored her She had looked upon missus Porter as a saviour who brought her freedom together with an easy conscience It had been so simple to deceive herself to cheat herself into the comfortable belief that all that could be done for him was being done when as concerned the essential thing as Kirk had said there was no child of the streets who was not better off She tramped her round of social duties mechanically Everything bored her now The joy of life had gone out of her She ate the bread of sorrow in captivity And then this morning had come a voice from the world she had lost little missus Bailey s voice small and tearful Could she possibly come out by the next train Bailey was very ill Bailey was dying Bailey had come home last night looking ghastly He had not slept In the early morning he had begun to babble missus Bailey s voice had risen and broken on the word and Ruth at the other end of the wire had heard her frightened sobs The doctor had come The doctor had looked awfully grave The doctor had telephoned to New York for another doctor They were both upstairs now It was awful and Ruth must come at once This was the bad news which had brought about the pallor which had impressed mister Keggs as he helped Ruth into her cab Little missus Bailey was waiting for her on the platform when she got out of the train Her face was drawn and miserable She looked like a beaten kitten She hugged Ruth hysterically Oh my dear I m so glad you ve come He s better but it has been awful The doctors have had to fight him to keep him in bed He was crazy to get to town He kept saying over and over again that he must be at the office They gave him something and he was asleep when I left the house She began to cry helplessly The fates had not bestowed upon Sybil Bannister the same care in the matter of education for times of crisis which they had accorded to Steve s Mamie Her life till now had been sheltered and unruffled and disaster swooping upon her had found her an easy victim She was trying to be brave but her powers of resistance were small like her body She clung to Ruth as a child clings to its mother Ruth as she tried to comfort her felt curiously old It occurred to her with a suggestion almost of grotesqueness that she and Sybil had been debutantes in the same season They walked up to the house The summer cottage which Bailey had taken was not far from the station On the way in the intervals of her sobs Sybil told Ruth the disjointed story of what had happened Bailey had not been looking well for some days She had thought it must be the heat or business worries or something He had not eaten very much and he had seemed too tired to talk when he got home each evening She had begged him to take a few days rest That had been the only occasion in the whole of the last week when she had heard him laugh and it had been such a horrid ugly sort of laugh that she wished she hadn t He had said that if he stayed away from the office for some time to come it would mean love in a cottage for them for the rest of their lives and not a summer cottage at Tuxedo at that My dear child he had gone on and you know when Bailey calls me that said Sybil it means that there is something the matter for as a rule he never calls me anything but my name or baby or something like that Which gave Ruth a little shock of surprise Somehow the idea of the dignified Bailey addressing his wife as baby startled her She was certainly learning these days that she did not know people as completely as she had supposed There seemed to be endless sides to people s characters which had never come under her notice A sudden memory of Kirk on that fateful afternoon came to her and made her wince missus Bailey continued My dear child he went on this week is about the most important week you and I are ever likely to live through It s the show down We either come out on top or we blow up It s one thing or the other And if I take a few days holiday just now you had better start looking about for the best place to sell your jewellery Those were his very words she said tearfully I remember them all It was so unlike his usual way of talking Ruth acknowledged that it was More than ever she felt that she did not know the complete Bailey He was probably exaggerating she said for the sake of saying something Sybil was silent for a moment It isn t that that s worrying me she went on then Somehow I don t seem to care at all whether we come out right or not so long as he gets well Last night when I thought he was going to die I made up my mind that I couldn t go on living without him I wouldn t have either This time the shock of surprise which came to Ruth was greater by a hundred fold than the first had been She gave a quick glance at Sybil Her small face was hard and the little white teeth gleamed between her drawn lips It was the face for one brief instant of a fanatic The sight of it affected Ruth extraordinarily It was as if she had seen a naked soul where she had never imagined a soul to be She had weighed Sybil in the same calm complacent almost patronizing fashion in which she had weighed Bailey Kirk everybody She had set her down as a delightful child an undeveloped feather brained little thing pleasant to spend an afternoon with but not to be taken seriously by any one as magnificent and superior as Ruth Winfield And what manner of a man must Bailey be Bailey whom she had always looked on as a dear but as quite a joke something to be chaffed and made to look foolish if he was capable of inspiring love like this A wave of humility swept over her The pygmies of her world were springing up as giants dwarfing her The pinnacle of superiority on which she had stood so long was crumbling into dust She was finding herself She winced again as the thought stabbed her that she was finding herself too late They reached the house in silence each occupied with her own thoughts The defiant look had died out of Sybil s face and she was once more a child crying because unknown forces had hurt it But Ruth was not looking at her now She was too busy examining this new world into which she had been abruptly cast this world where dolls had souls and jokes lost their point At the cottage good news awaited them The crisis was past Bailey was definitely out of danger He was still asleep and sleeping easily It had just been an ordinary breakdown due to worrying and overwork said the doctor the bigger of the doctors the one who had been summoned from New York All your husband needs now missus Bannister is rest See that he is kept quiet That s all there is to it As if by way of a commentary on his words a small boy on a bicycle rode up with a telegram Sybil opened it She read it and looked at Ruth with large eyes From the office she said handing it to her Ruth read it It was a C D Q an S O S from the front an appeal for help from the forefront of the battle She did not understand the details of it but the purport was clear The battle had begun and Bailey was needed But Bailey lay sleeping in his tent She handed it back in silence There was nothing to be done The second telegram arrived half an hour after the first It differed from the first only in its greater emphasis Panic seemed to be growing in the army of the lost leader The ringing of the telephone began almost simultaneously with the arrival of the second telegram Ruth went to the receiver A frantic voice was inquiring for mister Bannister even as she put it to her ear This is missus Winfield speaking she said steadily mister Bannister s sister mister Bannister is very ill and cannot possibly attend to any business There was a silence at the other end of the wire Then a voice with the calm of desperation said Thank you There was a pause Thank you said the voice again in a crushed sort of way and the receiver was hung up Ruth went back to Sybil The hours passed How she got through them Ruth hardly knew Time seemed to have stopped For the most part they sat in silence In the afternoon Sybil was allowed to see Bailey for a few minutes She returned thoughtful She kissed Ruth before she sat down and once or twice after that Ruth looking up found her eyes fixed upon her It seemed to Ruth that there was something which she was trying to say but she asked no questions After dinner they sat out on the porch It was a perfect night The cool dusk was soothing Ruth broke a long silence Sybil Yes dear May I tell you something Well I m afraid it s bad news Sybil turned quickly You called up the office while I was with Bailey Ruth started How did you know I guessed I have been trying to do it all day but I hadn t the pluck Well I m afraid things are about as bad as they can be A mister Meadows spoke to me He was very gloomy He told me a lot of things which I couldn t follow details of what had happened but I understood all that was necessary I m afraid Bailey s ruined said Sybil quietly mister Meadows seemed to think so He may have exaggerated Sybil shook her head No Bailey was talking to me upstairs I expected it There was a long silence Ruth Yes I m afraid Sybil stopped Yes A sudden light of understanding came to Ruth She knew what it was that Sybil was trying to say had been trying to say ever since she spoke with Bailey My money has gone too Is that it Sybil did not answer Ruth went quickly to her and took her in her arms You poor baby she cried Was that what was on your mind wondering how you should tell me I knew there was something troubling you Sybil began to sob I didn t know how to tell you she whispered Ruth laughed excitedly She felt as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders a weight which had been crushing the life out of her In the last few days the scales had fallen from her eyes and she had seen clearly She realized now what Kirk had realized from the first that what had forced his life apart from hers had been the golden wedge of her father s money It was the burden of wealth that had weighed her down without her knowing it She felt as if she had been suddenly set free I m dreadfully sorry said Sybil feebly Ruth laughed again I m not she said If you knew how glad I was you would be congratulating me instead of looking as if you thought I was going to bite you Glad Of course I m glad Everything s going to be all right again now Sybil dear Kirk and I had the most awful quarrel the other day We we actually decided it would be better for us to separate It was all my fault I had neglected Kirk and I had neglected Bill and Kirk couldn t stand it any longer But now that this has happened don t you see that it will be all right again You can t stand on your dignity when you re up against real trouble If this had not happened neither of us would have had the pluck to make the first move but now you see we shall just naturally fall into each other s arms and be happy again he and I and Bill just as we were before It must be lovely for you having Bill said little missus Bailey wistfully I wish She stopped There was a corner of her mind into which she could not admit any one even Ruth Having him ought to have been enough for any woman Ruth s voice was serious It was enough for me in the old days when we were at the studio What fools women are sometimes I suppose I lost my head coming suddenly into all that money I don t know why for it was not as if I had not had plenty of time when father was alive to get used to the idea of being rich I think it must have been the unexpectedness of it I certainly did behave as if I had gone mad Goodness I m glad it s over and that we can make a fresh start What is it like being poor Ruth Of course we were never very well off at home but we weren t really poor It s heaven if you re with the right man missus Bailey sighed Bailey s the right man as far as I m concerned But I m wondering how he will bear it poor dear Ruth was feeling too happy herself to allow any one else to be unhappy if she could help it Why of course he will be splendid about it she said You re letting your imagination run away with you You have got the idea of Bailey and yourself as two broken creatures begging in the streets I don t know how badly Bailey will be off after this smash but I do know that he will have all his brains and his energy left Ruth was conscious of a momentary feeling of surprise that she should be eulogizing Bailey in this fashion and stranger still that she should be really sincere in what she said But to day seemed to have changed everything and she was regarding her brother with a new born respect She could still see Sybil s face as it had appeared in that memorable moment of self revelation It had made a deep impression upon her A man like Bailey is worth a large salary to any one even if he may not be able to start out for himself again immediately I m not worrying about you and Bailey You will have forgotten all about this crash this time next year Sybil brightened up She was by nature easily moved and Ruth s words had stimulated her imagination He is awfully clever she said her eyes shining Why this sort of thing happens every six months to anybody who has anything to do with Wall Street proceeded Ruth fired by her own optimism You read about it in the papers every day Nobody thinks anything of it Sybil though anxious to look on the bright side could not quite rise to these heights of scorn for the earthquake which had shaken her world I hope not It would be awful to go through a time like this again Ruth reassured her though it entailed a certain inconsistency on her part She had a true woman s contempt for consistency Of course you won t have to go through it again Bailey will be careful in future not to not to do whatever it is that he has done She felt that the end of her inspiring speech was a little weak but she did not see how she could mend it Her talk with mister Meadows on the telephone had left her as vague as before as to the actual details of what had been happening that day in Wall Street She remembered stray remarks of his about bulls and she had gathered that something had happened to something which mister Meadows called G R D s which had evidently been at the root of the trouble but there her grasp of high finance ended Sybil however was not exigent She brightened at Ruth s words as if they had been an authoritative pronouncement from an expert Bailey is sure to do right she said I think I ll creep in and see if he s still asleep Ruth left alone on the porch fell into a pleasant train of thought There was something in her mental attitude which amused her She wondered if anybody had ever received the announcement of financial ruin in quite the same way before Yet to her this attitude seemed the only one possible How simple everything was now She could go to Kirk and as she had said to Sybil start again The golden barrier between them had vanished One day had wiped out all the wretchedness of the last year They were back where they had started with all the accumulated experience of those twelve months to help them steer their little ship clear of the rocks on its new voyage She was roused from her dream by the sound of an automobile drawing up at the door A voice that she recognised called her name She went quickly down the steps Is that you Aunt Lora missus Porter masterly woman never wasted time in useless chatter Jump in my dear she said crisply Your husband has stolen William and eloped with that girl Mamie whom I never trusted to Connecticut Chapter XIII 
753-32846-0000	train-other-500	Pastures New Steve had arrived at the Connecticut shack in the early dawn of the day which had been so eventful to most of his friends and acquaintances William Bannister s interest in the drive at first acute
none	none	 had ceased after the first five miles and he had passed the remainder of the journey in a sound sleep 
753-32846-0001	train-other-500	from which the stopping of the car did not awaken him Steve jumped down and stretched himself There was a wonderful freshness in the air which made him forget for a moment his desire for repose He looked about him breathing deep draughts of its coolness
753-32846-0002	train-other-500	The robins which though not so well advertised rise just as punctually as the lark were beginning to sing as they made their simple toilets before setting out to attend to the early worm
753-32846-0003	train-other-500	The sky to the east was a delicate blend of pinks and greens and yellows with a hint of blue behind the grey which was still the prevailing note A vaguely sentimental mood came upon Steve
753-32846-0004	train-other-500	In his heart he knew perfectly well that he could never be happy for any length of time out of sight and hearing of Broadway cars but at that moment such was the magic of the dawn he felt a longing to settle down in the country and pass the rest of his days a simple farmer
753-32846-0005	train-other-500	with beard unchecked by razor
none	none	 He saw himself feeding the chickens and addressing the pigs by their pet names 
753-32846-0006	train-other-500	while Mamie in a cotton frock called cheerfully to him to come in because breakfast was ready and getting cold Mamie Ah His sigh turned into a yawn
753-32846-0007	train-other-500	He realized with the abruptness which comes to a man who stands alone with nature in the small hours that he was very sleepy The excitement which had sustained him till now had begun to ebb The free life of the bearded farmer
753-32846-0008	train-other-500	seemed suddenly less attractive Bed was what he wanted now not nature
none	none	 He opened the door of the car and lifted William Bannister out swathed in rugs 
753-32846-0009	train-other-500	The White Hope gurgled drowsily but did not wake Steve carried him on to the porch and laid him down Then he turned his attention to the problem of effecting an entry Once an honest man has taken to amateur burgling he soon picks up the tricks of it
753-32846-0010	train-other-500	To open his knife and shoot back the catch of the nearest window
none	none	 was with Steve the work if not of a moment of a very few minutes 
753-32846-0011	train-other-500	He climbed in and unlocked the front door Then he carried his young charge into the sitting room and laid him down on a chair
none	none	 a step nearer his ultimate destination 
753-32846-0012	train-other-500	bed Steve s faculties were rapidly becoming numb with approaching sleep but he roused himself to face certain details of the country life which till now had escaped him
753-32846-0013	train-other-500	His earnest concentration on the main plank of his platform the spiriting away of William Bannister had caused him to overlook the fact that no preparations had been made to welcome him on his arrival at his destination
none	none	 He had treated the shack as if it had been a summer hotel where he could walk in and engage a room It now struck him that there was much to be attended to before he could as he put it to himself 
753-32846-0014	train-other-500	hit the hay There was the White Hope s bed to be made and by the way of a preliminary to that sheets must be found and blankets
none	none	 not to mention pillows 
753-32846-0015	train-other-500	Yawning wearily he set out on his search He found sheets but mistrusted them They might or might not be perfectly dry He did not care to risk his godson s valuable health in the experiment
753-32846-0016	train-other-500	A hazy notion that blankets were always safe restored his spirits and he became cheerful on reflecting that a child with William Bannister s gift for sleep would not be likely to notice the absence of linen in his bed The couch which he finally passed adequate
753-32846-0017	train-other-500	would have caused Lora Delane Porter s hair to stand erect but it satisfied Steve He went downstairs and returning with William Bannister placed him carefully on it and tucked him in The White Hope slept on Having assured himself that all was well
753-32846-0018	train-other-500	Steve made up a similar nest for himself and removing his coat and shoes crawled under the blankets Five minutes later rhythmical snores proclaimed the fact that nature had triumphed over all the discomforts of one of the worst made beds in Connecticut
753-32846-0019	train-other-500	The sun was high when Steve woke He rose stiffly and went into the other room William Bannister still slept Steve regarded him admiringly For the dormouse act he mused
753-32846-0020	train-other-500	that kid certainly stands alone You got to hand it to him
none	none	 An aching void within him called his mind to the question of breakfast It began to come home to him 
753-32846-0021	train-other-500	that he had not planned out this expedition with that thoroughness which marks the great general
none	none	 I guess I ll have to get out to the nearest village in the bubble 
753-32846-0022	train-other-500	he said And while I m there maybe I d better send Kirk a wire And I reckon I ll have to take the kid If he wakes up and finds me gone he ll throw fits Up you get squire
753-32846-0023	train-other-500	He kneaded the recumbent form of his godson with a large hand until he had massaged out of him the last remains of his great sleep It took some time but it was effective The White Hope sat up full of life and energy
753-32846-0024	train-other-500	He inspected Steve gravely for a moment endeavouring to place him Hello Steve he said at length Hello kid Where am I In the country In Connecticut What s Necticut
753-32846-0025	train-other-500	This is Where we are Where are we Here In Connecticut Why Steve raised a protesting hand Not so early in the day kid not before breakfast he pleaded Honest I m not strong enough
753-32846-0026	train-other-500	It ain t as if we was a vaudeville team that had got to rehearse What s rehearse Steve changed the subject Say kid ain t you feeling like you could bite into something
none	none	 I got an emptiness inside me as big as all outdoors How about a mouthful of cereal and a shirred egg Now for the love of Mike 
753-32846-0027	train-other-500	he went on quickly as his godson opened his mouth to speak
none	none	 don t say What s shirred It s something you do to eggs 
753-32846-0028	train-other-500	It s one way of fixing em What s fixing inquired William Bannister brightly Steve sighed When he spoke he was calm but determined That ll be all the dialogue for the present he said We ll play the rest of our act in dumb show Get a move on you
none	none	 and I ll take you out in the bubble 
753-32846-0029	train-other-500	the automobile the car the chug chug wagon the thing we came here in
none	none	 if you want to know what bubble is 
753-32846-0030	train-other-500	and we ll scare up some breakfast Steve s ignorance of the locality in which he found himself was complete but he had a general impression that farmers as a class were people who delighted in providing breakfasts for the needy if the needy possessed the necessary price
none	none	 Acting on this assumption he postponed his trip to the nearest town 
753-32846-0031	train-other-500	and drove slowly along the roads with his eyes open for signs of life He found a suitable farm
none	none	 and applying the brakes gathered up William Bannister and knocked at the door 
753-32846-0032	train-other-500	His surmise as to the hospitality of farmers proved correct and presently they were sitting down to a breakfast which it did his famished soul good to contemplate William Bannister seemed less enthusiastic
753-32846-0033	train-other-500	Steve having disposed of two eggs in quick succession
none	none	 turned to see how his young charge was progressing with his repast 
753-32846-0034	train-other-500	and found him eyeing a bowl of bread and milk in a sort of frozen horror
none	none	 What s the matter kid 
753-32846-0035	train-other-500	he asked Get busy No paper said William Bannister For the love of Pete
none	none	 Do you expect your morning paper out in the woods 
753-32846-0036	train-other-500	No paper repeated the White Hope firmly Steve regarded him thoughtfully I didn t have this trip planned out right he said regretfully I ought to have got Mamie to come along
none	none	 I bet a hundred dollars she would have 
753-32846-0037	train-other-500	got next to your meanings in a second I pass
none	none	 What s your kick anyway 
753-32846-0038	train-other-500	What s all this about paper Aunty Lora says not to eat bread that doesn t come wrapped up in paper said the White Hope becoming surprisingly lucid Mamie undoes it out of crinkly paper I get you
753-32846-0039	train-other-500	They feed you rolls at home wrapped up in tissue paper is that it What s tissue Same as crinkly Well see here You remember what we was talking about last night about germs Yes Well
753-32846-0040	train-other-500	that s one thing germs never do eat bread out of crinkly paper
none	none	 You want to forget all the dope they shot into you back in New York and start fresh 
753-32846-0041	train-other-500	You do what I tell you and you can t go wrong If you re going to be a regular germ
none	none	 what you ve got to do is to wrap yourself round that bread and 
753-32846-0042	train-other-500	milk the quickest you can Get me
none	none	 Till you do that we can t begin to start out to have a good time 
753-32846-0043	train-other-500	William Bannister made no more objections He attacked his meal with an easy conscience
none	none	 and about a quarter of an hour later leaned back 
753-32846-0044	train-other-500	with a deep sigh of repletion Steve meanwhile had entered into conversation with the lady of the house Say
none	none	 I guess you ain t got a kid of your own anywheres have you 
753-32846-0045	train-other-500	Sure I have said the hostess proudly
none	none	 He s out in the field with his pop this minute 
753-32846-0046	train-other-500	His name s Jim Fine
none	none	 I want to get hold of a kid to play with this kid here 
753-32846-0047	train-other-500	Jim sounds pretty good to me About the same age as this one For the Lord s sake
none	none	 Jim s eighteen and weighs two hundred pounds Cut out Jim 
753-32846-0048	train-other-500	I thought from the way you spoke he was a regular kid Know any one in these parts who s got something about the same weight as this one The farmer s wife reflected Kids is pretty scarce round here she said I reckon you won t get one that I knows of
753-32846-0049	train-other-500	There s that Tom Whiting but he s a bad boy He ain t been raised right What s the matter with him
none	none	 I don t want to speak harm of no one 
753-32846-0050	train-other-500	but his father used to be a low prize fighter and you know what they are Steve nodded sympathetically
none	none	 Regular plug uglies he said A friend of mine used to have to mix with them quite a lot poor fellah He used to say they was none of them truly refined And this kid takes after his pop eh Kind of scrappy kid is that it 
753-32846-0051	train-other-500	He s a bad boy Well

753-32846-0052	train-other-500	They live in the cottage by the big house you can see through them trees His pop looks after mister Wilson s prize dawgs That s his job What s Wilson asked the White Hope coming out of his stupor
none	none	 You beat me to it by a second kid I was just going to ask it myself 
753-32846-0053	train-other-500	He s one of them rich New Yawkers He has his summer place here
none	none	 and this Whiting looks after his prize dawgs Well I guess I ll give him a call It s going to be lonesome for my kid if he ain t got some one to show him how to hit it up 
753-32846-0054	train-other-500	He s not used to country life Come along
none	none	 We ll get into the bubble and go and send your pop a telegram What s telegram asked William Bannister I got you placed now said Steve regarding him with interest You re not going to turn into an ambassador or an artist or any of them things You re going to be the greatest district attorney that ever came down the pike Chapter XIV The Sixty First Street Cyclone It was past seven o clock when Kirk bending over the wheel with Mamie at his side came in sight of the shack The journey had been checked just outside the city by a blow out in one of the back tyres Kirk had spent the time while the shirt sleeved rescuer from the garage toiled over the injured wheel walking up and down with a cigar Neither he nor Mamie had shown much tendency towards conversation Mamie was habitually of a silent disposition and Kirk s mind was too full of his thoughts to admit of speech Ever since he had read Steve s telegram he had been in the grip of a wild exhilaration He had not stopped to ask himself what this mad freak of Steve s could possibly lead to in the end he was satisfied to feel that its immediate result would be that for a brief while at any rate he would have his son to himself away from all the chilling surroundings which had curbed him and frozen his natural feelings in the past He tried to keep his mind from dwelling upon Ruth He had thought too much of her of late for his comfort Since they had parted that day of the thunder storm the thought that he had lost her had stabbed him incessantly He had tried to tell himself that it was the best thing they could do to separate since it was so plain that their love had died but he could not cheat himself into believing it It might be true in her case it must be or why had she let him go that afternoon but for himself the separation had taught him that he loved her as much as ever more than ever Absence had purified him of that dull anger which had been his so short a while before He looked back and marvelled that he could ever have imagined for a moment that he had ceased to love her Now as he drove along the empty country roads he forced his mind to dwell as far as he could only upon his son There was a mist before his eyes as he thought of him What a bully lad he had been What fun they had had in the old days But that brought his mind back to Ruth and he turned his mind resolutely to the future again He chuckled silently as he thought of Steve Of all the mad things to do What had made him think of it How had such a wild scheme ever entered his head This he supposed was what Steve called punching instead of sparring But he had never given him credit for the imagination that could conceive a punch of this magnitude And how had he carried it out He could hardly have broken into the house Yet that seemed the only way in which it could have been done From Steve his thoughts returned to William Bannister He smiled again What a time they would have while it lasted The worst of it was it could not last long To morrow he supposed he would have to take the child back to his home He could not be a party to this kidnapping raid for any length of time This must be looked on as a brief holiday not as a permanent relief That was the only flaw in his happiness as he stopped the car at the door of the shack for by now he had succeeded at last in thrusting the image of Ruth from his mind There was a light in the ground floor window He raised his head and shouted Steve The door opened Hello Kirk That you Come along in You re just in time for the main performance He caught sight of Mamie standing beside Kirk Who s that he cried For a moment he thought it was Ruth and his honest heart leaped at the thought that his scheme had worked already and brought Kirk and her together again It s me Steve said Mamie in her small voice And Steve as he heard it was seized with the first real qualm he had had since he had embarked upon his great adventure As Kirk had endeavoured temporarily to forget Ruth so had he tried not to think of Mamie It was the only thing he was ashamed of in the whole affair the shock he must have given her Hello Mamie he said sheepishly and paused Words did not come readily to him Mamie entered the house without speaking It seemed to Steve that invective would have been better than this ominous silence He looked ruefully at her retreating back and turned to greet Kirk You re mighty late he said I only got your telegram toward the end of the afternoon I had been away all day I came here as fast as I could hit it up directly I read it We had a blow out and that delayed us Steve ventured a question Say Kirk why us while we re talking of it How does Mamie come to be here She insisted on coming It seems that everybody in the house was away to day so she tells me so she came round to me with your note I guess this has put me in pretty bad with Mamie observed Steve regretfully Has she been knocking me on the trip Not a word Steve brightened but became subdued again next moment I guess she s just saving it he said resignedly Steve what made you do it Oh I reckoned you could do with having the kid to yourself for a spell said Steve awkwardly You re all right Steve But how did you manage it I shouldn t have thought it possible Oh it wasn t so hard that part I just hid in the house and but say let s forget it it makes me feel kind of mean somehow It seems to me I may have lost Mamie her job It s mighty hard to do the right thing by every one in this world ain t it Come along in and see the kid He s great Are you feeling ready for supper Him and me was just going to start It occurred to Kirk for the first time that he was hungry Have you got anything to eat Steve Steve brightened again Have we he said We ve got everything there is in Connecticut Why say we re celebrating This is our big day Know what s happened Why He stopped short as if somebody had choked him They had gone into the sitting room while he was speaking The table was laid for supper A chafing dish stood at one end and the remainder of the available space was filled with a collection of foods from cold chicken to candy which did credit to Steve s imagination But it was not the sight of these that checked his flow of speech It was the look on Mamie s face as he caught sight of it in the lamplight The White Hope was sitting at the table in the attitude of one who has heard the gong and is anxious to begin while Mamie bending over him raised her head as the two men entered and fixed Steve with a baleful stare What have you been doing to the poor mite she demanded fiercely to get his face scratched this way There was no doubt about the scratch It was a long angry red line running from temple to chin The White Hope becoming conscious of the fact that the attention of the public was upon him and diagnosing the cause volunteered an explanation Bad boy he said and looked meaningly again at the candy What does he mean by bad boy Just what he says Mamie honest Gee you don t think I done it do you Have you been letting the precious lamb fight cried Mamie her eyes two circles of blue indignation Steve s enthusiasm overcame his sense of guilt He uttered a whoop Letting him Gee Listen to her Why say that kid don t have to be let He s a scrapper from Swatville on the Bingle Honest That s what all this food is about We re celebrating This is a little supper given in his honour by a few of his admirers and backers meaning me Why say Kirk that kid of yours is just the greatest thing that ever happened Get that chafing dish going and I ll tell you all about it How did he come by that scratch said Mamie coldly sticking to her point I ll tell you quick enough But let s start in on the eats first You wouldn t keep a coming champ waiting for his grub would you Look how he s lamping that candy Were you going to let the poor mite stuff himself with candy Steve Dingle Sure Whatever he says goes He owns the joint after this afternoon Mamie swiftly removed the unwholesome delicacy The idea Kirk was busying himself with the chafing dish What have you got in here Steve Lobster colonel I had to do thirty miles to get it too Mamie looked at him fixedly Were you going to feed lobster to this child she asked with ominous calm Were you intending to put him to bed full of broiled lobster and marshmallows Nix on the rough stuff Mamie pleaded the embarrassed pugilist How was I to know what kids feed on And maybe he would have passed up the lobster at that and stuck to the sardines Sardines Ain t kids allowed sardines said Steve anxiously The guy at the store told me they were wholesome and nourishing It looked to me as if that ought to hit young Fitzsimmons about right What s the matter with them A little bread and milk is all that he ever has before he goes to bed Steve detected a flaw in this and hastened to make his point Sure he said but he don t win the bantam weight champeenship of Connecticut every night Is that what he s done to day Steve asked Kirk It certainly is Ain t I telling you That s the trouble You re not You and Mamie seem to be having a discussion about the nourishing properties of sardines and lobster What has been happening this afternoon Bad boy remarked William Bannister with his mouth full That s right said Steve That s it in a nutshell Say it was this way It seemed to me that having no kid of his own age to play around with his nibs was apt to get lonesome so I asked about and found that there was a guy of the name of Whiting living near here who had a kid of the same age or thereabouts Maybe you remember him He used to fight at the feather weight limit some time back Called himself Young O Brien He was a pretty good scrapper in his time and now he s up here looking after some gent s prize dogs Well I goes to him and borrows his kid He s a scrappy sort of kid at that and weighs ten pounds more than his nibs but I reckoned he d have to do and I thought I could stay around and part em if they got to mixing it Mamie uttered an indignant exclamation but Kirk s eyes were gleaming proudly Well he said Steve swallowed lobster and resumed Well you know how it is You meet a guy who s been in the same line of business as yourself and you find you ve got a heap to talk about I d never happened across the gink Whiting but I knew of him and of course he d heard of me and we got to discussing things I seen him lose on a foul to Tommy King in the eighteenth round out in Los Angeles and that kept us busy talking him having it that he hadn t gone within a mile of fouling Tommy and me saying I d been in a ring seat and had the goods on him same as if I d taken a snap shot Well we was both getting pretty hot under the collar about it when suddenly there s the blazes of a noise behind us and there s the two kids scrapping all over the lot The Whiting kid had started it mind you and him ten pounds heavier than Bill and tough too The White Hope confirmed this Bad boy he remarked and with a deep breath resumed excavating work on a grapefruit Well I was just making a jump to separate them when this Whiting gook says Betcha a dollar my kid wins and before I knew what I was doing I d taken him It wasn t that that stopped me though It was his saying that his kid took after his dad and could eat up anything of his own age in America Well darn it could I take that from a slob of a mixed ale scrapper when it was handed out at the finest kid that ever came from New York Of course not said Kirk indignantly and even Mamie forbore to criticize She bent over the White Hope and gave his grapefruit stained cheek a kiss Well I should say not cried Steve I just hollered to his nibs Soak it to him kid for the honour of No ninety nine and believe me the young bear cat sort of gathered himself together winked at me and began to hammer the stuffing out of the scrappy kid Say there wasn t no sterilized stuff about his work You were a regular germ all right weren t you squire Germ agreed the White Hope He spoke drowsily Gee Steve resumed his saga in a whirl of enthusiasm Gee if they re right to start with if they re born right if they ve got the grit in them you can t sterilize it out of em if you use up half the germ killer in the country From the way that kid acted you d have thought he d been spending the last year in a training camp The other kid rolled him over but he come up again as if that was just the sort of stuff he liked and pretty soon I see that he s uncovered a yellow streak in the Whiting kid as big as a barn door You were on it weren t you colonel But the White Hope had no remarks to offer this time His head had fallen forward and was resting peacefully in his grapefruit He s asleep said Mamie She picked him up gently and carried him out He s a champeen at that too said Steve I had to pull him out of the hay this morning Well I guess he s earned it He s had a busy day What happened then Steve Why after that there wasn t a thing to it Whiting poor simp couldn t see it Betcha ten dollars my kid wins he hollers He s got him going Take you I shouts and at that moment the scrappy kid sees it s all over so he does the old business of fouling same as his pop done when he fought Tommy King It s in the blood I guess He takes and scratches poor Bill on the cheek That was enough for me I jumps in All over I says My kid wins on a foul Foul nothing says Whiting It was an accident and you lose because you jumped into the fight same as Connie McVey did when Corbett fought Sharkey Think you can get away with it pulling that old time stuff I didn t trouble to argue with him Oh I says is that it Say just take a slant at your man If you don t stop him quick he ll be in Texas For the scrappy kid was beating it while the going was good and was half a mile away running hard Well that was enough even for the Whiting guy I guess we ll call it a draw he says and all bets off I just looks at him and says quite civil and polite You darned half baked slob of a rough house scrapper I says it ain t a draw or anything like it My kid wins and I ll trouble you now to proceed to cash in with the dough or else I m liable to start something So he paid up and I took the White Hope indoors and give him a wash and brush up and we cranks up the bubble and hikes off to the town and spends the money on getting food for the celebration supper And what s over I slips into the kid s pocket and says That s your first winner s end kid and you ve earned it Steve paused and filled his glass I m on the waggon as a general thing nowadays he said but I reckon this an occasion Right here is where we drink his health And overcome by his emotion he burst into discordant song Fo or he s a jolly good fellow bellowed Steve For he s a jolly good fellow For he s There was a sound of quick footsteps outside and Mamie entered the room like a small whirlwind Be quiet she cried Do you want to wake him Wake him said Steve You can t wake that kid with dynamite He raised his glass Ladeez n gentlemen the boy wonder Here s to him The bantam weight champeen of Connecticut The Sixty First Street Cyclone The kid they couldn t sterilize The White Hope The White Hope echoed Kirk Fo or he s a jolly good fellow sang Steve Be quiet said missus Porter from the doorway and Steve wheeling round caught her eye and collapsed like a pricked balloon Chapter XV missus Porter s Waterloo Of the little band of revellers it would be hard to say which was the most taken aback at this invasion The excitement of the moment had kept them from hearing the sound of the automobile which missus Porter mistrusting the rough road that led to the shack had stopped some distance away Perhaps on the whole Kirk was more surprised than either of his companions Their guilty consciences had never been quite free from the idea of the possibility of pursuit but Kirk having gathered from Mamie that neither Ruth nor her aunt was aware of what had happened had counted upon remaining undisturbed till the time for return came on the morrow He stood staring at Ruth who had followed missus Porter into the room missus Porter took charge of the situation She was in her element She stood with one hand resting on the table as if she were about to make an after dinner speech as indeed she was Lora Delane Porter was not dissatisfied with the turn events had taken On the whole perhaps it might be said that she was pleased She intended when she began to speak to pulverize Kirk and the abandoned young woman whom he had selected as his partner in his shameful escapade but in this she was swayed almost entirely by a regard for abstract morality As concerned Ruth she felt that the situation was on the whole the best thing that could have happened To her Napoleonic mind which took little account of the softer emotions concerning itself entirely with the future of the race Kirk had played his part and was now lagging superfluous on the stage His tendency she felt was to retard rather than to assist William Bannister s development His influence such as it was clashed with hers She did not forget that there had been a time when Ruth having practically to choose between them had chosen to go Kirk s way and had abandoned herself to a life which could only be considered unhygienic and retrograde Her defeat in the matter of Whiskers the microbe harbouring dog from Ireland still rankled It was true that in what might be called the return match she had utterly routed Kirk but until this moment she had always been aware of him as an opponent who might have to be reckoned with She was quite convinced that it would be in the best interests of everybody especially of William Bannister if he could be eliminated There were signs of human weakness in Ruth which sometimes made her uneasy Ruth she told herself might bear the torch but when it came to not faltering she was less certain of her Ruth it was true had behaved admirably in the matter of the upbringing of William from the moment of her conversion till now but might she not at any moment become a backslider and fill the white tiled nursery with abominable long haired dogs Most certainly she might In a woman who had once been a long haired dogist there are always possibilities of a relapse into long haired dogism just as in a converted cannibal there are always possibilities of a return to the gods of wood and stone and the disposition to look on his fellow man purely in the light of breakfast food For these reasons missus Porter was determined to push home her present advantage to wipe Kirk off the map as an influence in Ruth s life It was her intention having recovered William Bannister and bathed him from head to foot in a weak solution of boric acid to stand over Ruth while she obtained a divorce That done she would be in a position to defy Kirk and all his antagonistic views on the subject of the hygienic upbringing of children She rapped the table and prepared to speak Even a Napoleon however may err from lack of sufficient information and there was a flaw in her position of which she was unaware From the beginning of the drive to the end of it Ruth had hardly spoken a word and missus Porter in consequence was still in ignorance of what had been happening that day in Wall Street and the effect of these happenings on her niece s outlook on life Could she have known it the silent girl beside her had already suffered the relapse which she had feared as a remote possibility Ruth s mind during that drive had been in a confusion of regrets and doubts and hopes There were times when she refused absolutely to believe the story of Kirk s baseness which her aunt poured into her ear during the first miles of the journey It was absurd and incredible Yet as they raced along the dark roads doubt came to her and would not be driven out A single unfortunate phrase of Kirk s spoken in haste but remembered at leisure formed the basis of this uncertainty That afternoon when he had left her he had said that Mamie was the real mother of the child Could it be that Mamie s undeviating devotion to the boy had won the love which she had lost It was possible Considered in the light of what missus Porter had told her it seemed in her blackest moments certain She knew how wrapped up in the boy Kirk had been Was it not a logical outcome of his estrangement from herself that he should have turned for consolation to the one person in sympathy with him in his great love for his child She tried to read his face as he stood looking at her now but she could find no hope in it The eyes that met hers were cold and expressionless missus Porter rapped the table a second time mister Winfield she said in the metallic voice with which she was wont to cow publishers insufficiently equipped with dash and enterprise in the matter of advertising treatises on the future of the race I have no doubt you are surprised to see us You appear to be looking your wife in the face It speaks well for your courage but badly for your sense of shame If you had the remnants of decent feeling in you you would be physically incapable of the feat If you would care to know how your conduct strikes an unprejudiced spectator I may tell you that I consider you a scoundrel of the worst type and unfit to associate with any but the low company in which I find you Steve who had been listening with interest and indeed a certain relish while Kirk was as he put it to himself getting his in this spirited fashion started at the concluding words of the address which in his opinion seemed slightly personal He had long ago made up his mind that Lora Delane Porter though an entertaining woman and on the whole more worth while than a moving picture show was quite mad but he felt even lunatics ought to realize that there is a limit to what they may say He moaned protestingly and rashly for he drew the speaker s attention upon himself This person went on missus Porter indicating Steve with a wave of her hand which caused him to sidestep swiftly and throw up an arm as had been his habit in the ring when Battling Dick or Fighting Jack endeavoured to blot him out with a right swing who I observe retains the tattered relics of a conscience seeing that he winces you employed to do the only dangerous part of your dirty work I hope he will see that he gets his money In his place I should be feeling uneasy Ma am protested Steve missus Porter silenced him with a gesture Be quiet she said Steve was quiet missus Porter returned to Kirk Of all her burning words Kirk had not heard one His eyes had never left Ruth s Like her he was trying to read a message from a face that seemed only cold In this crisis of their two lives he had no thought for anybody but her He had a sense of great issues of being on the verge of the tremendous but his brain felt numbed and heavy He could not think He could see nothing except her eyes His inattention seemed to communicate itself to missus Porter She rapped imperatively upon the table for the third time The report galvanized Steve as earlier in the day a similar report had galvanized mister Penway but Kirk did not move mister Winfield Still Kirk made no sign that he had heard her It was discouraging but Lora Delane Porter was not made of the stuff that yields readily to discouragement She resumed As for this wretched girl she indicated the silent Mamie with a wave of her hand this abandoned creature whom you have led astray this shameless partner of your Say The exclamation came from Steve and it stopped missus Porter like a bullet To her this interruption from one whom she had fallen upon and wiped out resembled a voice from the tomb She was not accustomed to having her victims rise up and cut sharply even peremptorily into the flow of her speech Macbeth confronted by the ghost of Banquo may have been a little more taken aback but not much She endeavoured to quell Steve with a glance but it was instantly apparent that he was immune for the time being to quelling glances His brown eyes were fixed upon her in a cold stare which she found arresting and charged with menace His chin protruded and his upper lip was entirely concealed behind its fellow in a most uncomfortable manner She had never had the privilege of seeing Steve in the active exercise of his late profession or she would have recognized the look It was the one which proclaims the state of mind commonly known as being fighting mad and in other days had usually heralded a knock out for some too persistent opponent Say ma am you want to cut that out That line of talk don t go Great is the magic of love that can restore a man in an instant of time from being an obsequious wreck to a thing of fire and resolution A moment before Steve s only immediate object in life had been to stay quiet and keep out of the way as much as possible He had never been a man of ready speech in the presence of an angry woman words intimidated him as blows never did especially the whirl of words which were at Lora Delane Porter s command in moments of emotion But this sudden onslaught upon Mamie innocent Mamie who had done nothing to anybody scattered his embarrassment and filled him with much the same spirit which sent bantam weight knights up against heavy weight dragons in the Middle Ages He felt inspired Nix on the abandoned creature he said with dignity You re on the wrong wire This here lady is my affianced wife He went to Mamie and putting his arm round her waist pressed her to him He was conscious as he did so of a sensation of wonderment at himself This was the attitude he had dreamed of a thousand times and had been afraid to assume For the last three years he had been picturing himself in precisely this position and daily had cursed the lack of nerve which had held him back Yet here he was and it had all happened in a moment A funny thing life What exclaimed missus Porter Sure thing said Steve His coolness the ease with which he found words astonished him as much as his rapidity of action I stole the kid he said and it was my idea at that Kirk didn t know anything about it I wired to him to day what I had done and that he was to come right along And added Steve in a burst of inspiration I said bring along Mamie too as the kid s used to her and there ought to be a woman around And she could be here all right and no harm she being my affianced wife He liked that phrase He had read it in a book somewhere and it was the goods He eyed missus Porter jauntily missus Porter s gaze wavered She was not feeling comfortable Hers was a nature that did not lend itself easily to apologies yet apologies were obviously what the situation demanded The thought of all the eloquence which she had expended to no end added to her discomfort For the first time she was pleased that Kirk had so manifestly not been listening to a word of it Oh she said She paused That puts a different complexion on this affair Betcha life She paused once more It was some moments before she could bring herself to speak She managed it at last I beg your pardon she said Mine ma am said Steve grandly Five minutes before the idea that he could ever speak grandly to Lora Delane Porter would have seemed ridiculous to him but he was surprised at nothing now And the young wom And the future missus Dingle s said missus Porter with an effort Thank you ma am said Steve and released Mamie who forthwith bolted from the room like a scared rabbit Steve had started to follow her when missus Porter magnificent woman snatching what was left from defeat stopped him Wait she said What you have said alters the matter in one respect but there is another point On your own confession you have been guilty of the extremely serious offence the penal offence of kidnapping a child who Drop me a line about it ma am said Steve Me time s rather full just now He disappeared into the outer darkness after Mamie In the room they had left Kirk and Ruth faced each other in silence Lora Delane Porter eyed them grimly It was the hour of her defeat and she knew it Forces too strong for her were at work Her grand attack the bringing of these two together that Ruth might confront Kirk in his guilt had recoiled upon her The Old Guard had made their charge up the hill and it had failed Victory had become a rout With one speech Steve had destroyed her whole plan of campaign She knew it was all over that in another moment if she remained she would be compelled to witness the humiliating spectacle of Ruth in Kirk s arms stammering the words which intuition told her were even now trembling on her lips She knew Ruth She could read her like a primer And her knowledge told her that she was about to capitulate that all her pride and resentment had been swept away that she had gone over to the enemy Elemental passions were warring against Lora Delane Porter and she bowed before them mister Winfield she said sharply her voice cutting the silence like a knife I beg your pardon I seem to have made a mistake Good night Kirk did not answer Good night Ruth Ruth made no sign that she had heard missus Porter grand in defeat moved slowly to the door But even in the greatest women there is that germ of feminine curiosity which cannot be wholly eliminated that little grain of dust that asserts itself and clogs the machinery It had been missus Porter s intention to leave the room without a glance her back defiantly toward the foe But as she reached the door there came from behind her a sound of movement a stifled cry a little sound whose meaning she knew too well She hesitated She stood still fighting herself But the grain of dust had done its work For an instant she ceased to be a smoothly working machine and became a woman subject to the dictates of impulse She turned Intuition had not deceived her Ruth had gone over to the enemy She was in Kirk s arms holding him to her her face hidden against his shoulder for all the world as if Lora Delane Porter her guiding force had ceased to exist missus Porter closed the door and walked stiffly through the scented night to where the headlights of her automobile cleft the darkness Birds asleep in the trees fluttered uneasily at the sudden throbbing of the engine Chapter XVI The White Hope Link The White Hope slept The noise of the departing car which had roused the birds had made no impression on him As Steve had said dynamite could not do it He slumbered on calmly detached unaware of the remarkable changes which in the past twenty four hours had taken place in his life An epoch had ended and a new one begun but he knew it not And probably if Kirk and Ruth who were standing at his bedside watching him had roused him and informed him of these facts he would have displayed little excitement He had the philosophical temperament He took things as they came Great natural phenomena like Lora Delane Porter he accepted as part of life When they were in his life he endured them stoically When they went out of it he got on without them Marcus Aurelius would have liked William Bannister Winfield They belonged to the same school of thought The years have a tendency to destroy this placidity towards life and to develop in man a sense of gratitude to fate for its occasional kindnesses and Kirk having been in the world longer than William Bannister did not take the gifts of the gods so much for granted He was profoundly grateful for what had happened That Lora Delane Porter should have retired from active interference with his concerns was much but that he should have had the incredible good fortune to be freed from the burden of John Bannister s money was more If ever money was the root of all evil this had been It had come into his life like a poisonous blight withering and destroying wherever it touched It had changed Ruth it had changed William Bannister it had changed himself it was as if the spirit of the old man had lived on hating him and working him mischief He always had superstitious fear of it and events had proved him right And now the cloud had rolled away A few crowded hours of Bailey s dashing imbecility had removed the curse forever He was alone with Ruth and his son in a world that contained only them just as in the old days of their happiness There was something symbolic something suggestive of the beginning of a new order of things in their isolation at this very moment Steve had gone Only he and Ruth and the child were left The child the White Hope he was the real hero of the story the real principal of the drama of their three lives He was the link that bound them together the force that worked for coherence and against chaos He stood between them his hands in theirs and while he did so there could be no parting of the ways His grip was light but as strong as steel Time would bring troubles moods misunderstandings for they were both human but while that grip held there could be no gulf dividing Ruth and himself as it had divided them in the past He faced the future calmly with open eyes It would be rough going at first very rough going It meant hard work incessant work No more vague masterpieces which might or might not turn into Carmen or The Spanish Maiden No more delightful idle days to be loafed through in the studio or the shops No more dreams seen hazily through the smoke of a cigar as he lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling of what he would do to morrow To morrow must look after itself His business was with the present and the work of the present He braced himself to the fight confident of his power to win He had found himself Bill stirred in his sleep and muttered Ruth bent over him and kissed the honourable scratch on his cheek Poor little chap You ll wake up and find that you aren t a millionaire baby after all I wonder if you ll mind Kirk do you mind Mind I don t said Ruth I think it will be rather fun being poor again Who s poor said Kirk stoutly I m not I ve got you and I ve got Bill Do you remember ages ago what that Vince girl the model you know said that her friend
