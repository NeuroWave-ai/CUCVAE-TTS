5831-87174-0000	train-other-500	The wagon had come to rest among the trees an hour or two before sunset It was a covered in dray and had been brought to in a little clearing of the scrubby undergrowth Two horses had drawn it all the way from the coast
5831-87174-0001	train-other-500	Freed of their harness they stood in the lee of a great gum their flanks matted with the dust which had caked with the run of sweat on them
none	none	 The mongrel that had followed at their heels lay stretched on the sward beside them 
5831-87174-0002	train-other-500	A red dappled cow and her calf were tethered to a wheel of the wagon and at a little distance from them were two battered crates of drooping and drowsy fowls
5831-87174-0003	train-other-500	On a patch of earth scraped clear of grass and leaves the fire threw off wisps of smoke and the dry musky incense of burning eucalyptus and dogwood It had smouldered
5831-87174-0004	train-other-500	and a woman stooping beside it was feeding it with branches of brushwood and sticks that she broke in her hands or across her knees A man was busy in the interior of the wagon moving heavy casks and pieces of furniture He lifted them out
5831-87174-0005	train-other-500	piled them on the ground and spread a couple of sheepskins over them Then he threw a sheepskin and a blanket of black and brown tweed on the floor for the night s resting It had been climbing the foothills for days this heavy old fashioned vehicle
5831-87174-0006	train-other-500	and the man and the woman had climbed with it she driving the cow and calf he giving his attention to the horses and clearing the track So slowly had it toiled along that at a little distance it looked like some weary indefatigable insect creeping among the trees
5831-87174-0007	train-other-500	The horses a sturdy young sandy grey mare and a raw weedy weather worn bay seemed as much part of it as its wooden frame ironshod wheels and awning of grimy sailcloth
5831-87174-0008	train-other-500	They tugged at their load with dull dumb patience and obstinacy although the bay had stumbled rather badly the whole way The man had put his shoulder to the wheel helping the horses up the steep banks and long slippery sidings
5831-87174-0009	train-other-500	He had stood trembling and sweating with them when heavy places in the road were past the veins knotted in his swarthy forehead the bare column of his throat gasping for the mountain air There was the same toiling faculty in him that there was in the horses
5831-87174-0010	train-other-500	an instinct to overcome all difficulties by exertion of the muscles of his back The wagon had creaked garrulously on the long slopes and stuttered and groaned up the steep hill sides
5831-87174-0011	train-other-500	It had forded creeks the horses splashing soberly through them and sending the spray into the air on either side It had crashed over the undergrowth that encroached on the track an ill blazed stock route among the trees
5831-87174-0012	train-other-500	and again and again the man had been obliged to haul aside fallen timber or burn it where it lay and cut away saplings in order to make a new path The wagon was filled with boxes and bags of food stuffs and pieces of furniture
5831-87174-0013	train-other-500	Inside it smelt like a grocer s shop and it had trailed the mingled odour of meal corned meat hemp iron seed wheat crude oil and potatoes through the virgin purity of the forest air
5831-87174-0014	train-other-500	Beneath its floor in wrappings of torn bags straw and hessian were lashed a wooden plough a broad bladed shovel and half a dozen farming and carpentering tools The fowls a game rooster a buff hen and a speckled pullet
5831-87174-0015	train-other-500	hung in wicker baskets from wooden pegs at the back They and the cow and her calf had wakened strange echoes in the forest the rooster heralding every morning at dawn this advance guard of civilisation
5831-87174-0016	train-other-500	When the vehicle had reached the summit of the foothills the track fell wavering into the green depths of the forest behind it a wale of broken ferns slain saplings blue gums and myrtles mown down as with a scythe by its wheels
5831-87174-0017	train-other-500	The timbered hills fell away wave upon wave into the mists of the distance and the plains stretched outward from them to the faintly glittering line the sea made on the dim horizon Somewhere to the west on those grey plains against the shore of an inlet
5831-87174-0018	train-other-500	was the township of Port Southern from which they had come Donald Cameron after studying a roughly made plan and the wall of the forest about him had taken the mare by her sandy forelock and turned the wagon in among the trees on the far side of a giant gum
none	none	 blazed with a cross on which the congealing sap had dried like blood Steering a north westerly course the wagon had tacked among the trees and come to the clearing And now that all preparations for the night were made he took the animals to the creek for water 
5831-87174-0019	train-other-500	It ran at the foot of the long low hillside and could be heard crooning and gurgling under the leafy murmur of the forest Leaving the fire the woman went to a fallen trunk sat down and gazed into the shadows gathering among the trees
5831-87174-0020	train-other-500	A rosy and saffron mist hung between their thronging boles The peace of the after glow held the hills the chirring of insects and the shrill sweet calling of birds had quivered into silence Only a leafy whispering stirred the quiet
5831-87174-0021	train-other-500	For a moment the fire of her clear spirit burnt low Hope and courage were lost in dreams There was wistfulness in her grey eyes as they went out before her wistfulness and heartache
5831-87174-0022	train-other-500	She seemed to be reading the scroll of the future seeing a dim mysterious unrolling of joys and sorrows with the eyes of her inner vision The sun had set when Cameron returned He tethered the cow to the wheel of the wagon
5831-87174-0023	train-other-500	and clamped rusty hobbles about the horses fetlocks Then he looked towards the woman Mary he called She did not hear and he walked towards her A man of few words Cameron did not speak as he searched his wife s face
5831-87174-0024	train-other-500	I I was dreaming she said looking up startled at the sight of him You re not grieving he asked There was a tremor in his voice though its roughness almost covered that No
5831-87174-0025	train-other-500	not grieving she said But thinking what it will be to us and our children by and by in this place It is a new country and a new people we re making they said at home and I m realising what they meant now Aye But it s a fine country
5831-87174-0026	train-other-500	Cameron s eyes travelled the length of the clearing over the slope of the hill They took in the silent world of the trees the rosy mist that still glowed between their slender thronging stems There was pride and an expression of sated hunger in his glance
5831-87174-0027	train-other-500	It s all ours this land about here he said Yes Her eyes wandered too I have worked all my days till now he said
5831-87174-0028	train-other-500	reviving a bitter memory without so much as a plot of sour earth as big as y re handkerchief to call my own Worked for other men sweated the body and soul out of me and now this is mine all this hundred acres and more when I m ready for it
5831-87174-0029	train-other-500	more and more and more He paused a moment all the emotion in him stirred and surging Then with a short drawn breath that dismissed the past and dedicated thought and energy to the future he went on
5831-87174-0030	train-other-500	I marked this place when I came through to the Port with Middleton s cattle last year I ll run cattle but I want to clear and cultivate too Up there where there are trees now will be ploughed fields and an orchard soon
none	none	 The house and barns ll be on the brow of the hill 
5831-87174-0031	train-other-500	By and by we shall have a name and a place in the country His wife s eyes were on his face He had spoken as though he were taking an oath No doubt it will be as you say Donald she said with a faint sigh
5831-87174-0032	train-other-500	But it is a strange lonely land indeed without the sight of a roof in all the long miles we have come by Never the sound of a human voice or the lowing of cattle Donald Cameron did not reply
5831-87174-0033	train-other-500	He was envisaging his schemes for the future Not a man given to dreams the thoughtful mood had taken him his breath came and went in steady draughts
none	none	 His face was set to the mould of his musing 
5831-87174-0034	train-other-500	there was determination in every line of it A gloomy face it was rough cast with deep set eyes His wife s words and the sigh that went with them were repeated in a remote brain cell
5831-87174-0035	train-other-500	You should be giving thanks not complaining he said his gaze returning to her We must do that now give thanks for the journey accomplished And as if it were the last duty of a well spent day
5831-87174-0036	train-other-500	he knelt on the grassy earth and Mary knelt beside him Donald Cameron addressed his God as man speaks to man yet his voice had a vibrating note as he prayed O Lord he said
5831-87174-0037	train-other-500	we thank Thee for having brought us in safety to our new home We thank Thee for having brought us over the sea through the storms and the troubles on the ship when there was nothing to eat but weevily biscuits and the water stank
none	none	 and there was like to be mutiny with the men in the chained gangs 
5831-87174-0038	train-other-500	We we thank Thee this woman and I She is a good woman for a man to have with him when he goes to the ends of the earth to carve out a name and a place for himself He paused thoughtfully for a moment and then went on
5831-87174-0039	train-other-500	I have said all that before but I have been thinking that it would do no harm to say it again now that we are ready to begin the new life and will need all Thy help and protection Lord
5831-87174-0040	train-other-500	We thank Thee for having brought us all the miles from the coast and the beasts and the wagon in safety though the bay horse I bought of Middleton s storekeeper is turning out badly He was a poor bargain at the best of it
5831-87174-0041	train-other-500	weak in the knee and spring halted Do Thou have a care of him Lord
none	none	 It will be a big loss to me if he is no use 
5831-87174-0042	train-other-500	with all the clearing and carting there will be to do soon He talked a little longer to the Almighty
none	none	 asking no favour but intimating that he expected to be justly dealt by as he himself dealt by all men In the matter of the bay he said that he did not think a God fearing man had been treated quite as well as 
5831-87174-0043	train-other-500	under the circumstances he might have been but he imputed no blame except to Middleton s storekeeper and gave thanks again A man of middle height squarely built Donald Cameron had the loosely slung frame of a farm labourer
5831-87174-0044	train-other-500	The woman beside him although her clothes were as poor and heavy as his was more finely and delicately made The hands clasped before her were long and slender The prayer ended they rose from the grass
5831-87174-0045	train-other-500	Cameron s eyes covered his wife A gust of tenderness swept him There was not what you might call much sentiment about our mating he said But I doubt not it has come Mary Yes Donald
5831-87174-0046	train-other-500	Her clear eyes were lifted to his May I be a true and faithful wife to you Y re not regretting at the long journey s end he asked It s not that a sigh went from her but that I m not worthy of you
none	none	 Whist he said You re my woman my wife It s all done with the past CHAPTER II A few months later Mary Cameron s voice as she sang lullabies to her baby mingled with the forest murmur and the sounds that came from the clearing the lowing of the cow the clucking and cackle of fowls the clang of Donald s axe as he ring barked trees near the house A one roomed hut built of long rough barked saplings ranged one above the other and thatched with coarse reddish brown bark laid on in slabs it stood on the brow of the hill not far from the wagon s first resting place Its two doors set opposite each other opened one towards the back hills and the other towards the creek and the cleared land on which a stubble of stumps still stood The walls of the hut inside were plastered with the clayey hill soil which Mary had rammed into crevices between the saplings when daylight had at first showed in thin shining streaks and the mountain breezes had crept chilly through them in the early mornings She had made the floor of beaten clay too and had gathered from the creek bed the grey and brown stones which Donald had built into the hearth and chimney with seams of lime and fine white sand that he had brought from the Port A window space had been left in the wall fronting the clearing but there was no glass in it At night or when it rained Mary hung a piece of hessian over the window Two chairs were the only ready made furniture of the room The boxes and bales brought in the wagon were piled in a corner A table made of box covers with sapling legs driven into the floor was under the window and a bed on a wooden foundation strapped with green hide stood against the back wall A few pieces of delft and white crockery glimmered on a shelf near the open fireplace and below them on another shelf were stone jars and two or three pots and pans Donald s harness saddle stirrup leathers and stock whip hung on pegs near the back door Among the bales and boxes under a dingy muffling cloth stood a spinning wheel and tied together with lengths of dusty yarn the parts of a weaver s hand loom which Mary had brought from the old country On Sundays when a bright fire sparkled on the hearth the mats of frayed hessian were spread on the floor and she had put a jar filled with wild flowers on the table her eyes brimmed with joy and tenderness as she gazed about her She had toiled all the summer out of doors with her husband to make their home timber cutting with him grubbing stumps from the land laying twigs and leaves in the stumps and lighting them so that the slow fires eating the wood left only charred shells to clear away She had driven Lassie the grey backwards and forwards drawing logs and tree trunks from the slope to the stack behind the house and when the frames of the wagon shed cow sheds and stable were up had laced the brushwood to them The weedy brown nag that was Lassie s trace mate during those first weeks in the hills had come down and got himself rather badly staked and Donald had had to shoot him It cost him a good deal to fire that shot but he had worked the harder for it Mary watched the cow while she browsed on the edge of the forest before a paddock on the top of the hill was fenced She milked fed the calf and the fowls and carried water from the creek to the house When she was not doing any of these things or baking brushing or furbishing indoors during those first few months her fingers were busy with little garments shirts and gowns and overalls cut from her own clothes of homespun tweed and unbleached calico It was at the end of a long golden day that a cry from her brought Donald from the far edge of the clearing He was turning the land for his first crop and when he heard that cry left the mare in her tracks the rope lines trailing beside her Later his hands trembling he took Lassie from the plough and led her to the creek for water Then although the sun had not set he hobbled her for the night went into the house and shut the door Usually all was silent within its walls when the darkness fell but this night a garish light flickered under the door There were sounds of hushed movement faint moaning the crackling of fire on the hearth all night The dog lying on the mat by the door did not know what to make of it He growled low and warningly now and then Towards morning while stars still sparkled over the dark wave of the forest a faintly wailing cry came from the hut The dog s ears twitched his yelping had an eerie note Sunlight was flooding the hills illumining the forest greenery making crimson and gold of the shoots on the saplings banishing the mists among the trees splashing in long shafts on the sward wet with dew when Donald Cameron opened the door His arms were folded round a shawled bundle He stood for a moment in the doorway the sunlight beating past him into the hut Then he lifted the small body in his arms kissed it and held it out to the dawn his face wrung with emotion All this yours your world my son he said They were quiet days that followed days spun off in lengths of sunshine from the looms of Time with the sleepy warmth of the end of the summer and the musky odours of the forest in them Mary worked less out of doors when she was about again her hands were full cooking washing and sewing and looking after the animals and the baby She sang to him as she worked All her joy and tenderness were centred in him now Donald did not understand the love songs she sang to little Davey They were always in her own Welsh tongue It s queer talk to make to a bairn he said one day smiling grimly as he listened to her He understands it I m sure she said smiling too Cameron sang himself sometimes when he was at the far end of the clearing It was always the same thing the gathering song of the Clan of Donald the Black While he was ploughing one morning Mary first heard him singing Pibroch o Donuil Dhu Pibroch o Donuil Wake thy wild voice anew Summon Clan Conuil The words of the grand old slogan echoed among the hills When next she heard it Mary lifted Davey out of his cradle and ran to the door with him crying happily Listen now Davey dear to thy father singing Cameron had interrupted himself to call to the mare as she turned a furrow Whoa Lass Whoa now He had gone on with his song as he bent the share to the slope of the hill again A hidden root checked his progress but when he had got it out of the way and the plough settled again he swung down hill giving his voice to the wind heartily Leave untended the herd The flock without shelter Leave the corpse uninterred The bride at the altar Leave the deer leave the steer Leave nets and barges Come in your fighting gear Broad swords and t a r ges His voice had not much music but Mary loved the way he sang with the fierceness and burr the rumble on the last word of a chieftain calling his men to battle It was almost as if he were calling his tribesmen to help him in the battle he had on hand But he was as shamefaced as a schoolboy about his singing and it was only when he was some distance from the house and had forgotten himself in his work that he gave expression to the deep seated joy and satisfaction with life that were in him Davey was four months old and the paddock his father had been ploughing the day he was born was green with the blades of its first crop when Mary asked When will you be going back to the Port Donald She had taken Cameron s tea to him where he was working among the trees a little way from the clearing He was resting for a few minutes sitting on a log with his axe beside him She spoke quietly as if it were an ordinary enough question she had asked Her eyes sought his There s very little flour left and only a small piece of corned meat I d made up my mind to go day after to morrow he said CHAPTER III This journey to Port Southern for stores meant that Mary would have to remain alone in the hills until her husband returned The cow and calf had to be fed and looked after They were valuable possessions and could not be left for fear they might wander away from the clearing and get lost in the scrub Besides there were the fowls to feed and the crop to guard from the shy bright eyed wild creatures that already lopping out of the forest at dawn had nibbled it down in places Cameron s eyes lingered on his wife as he answered her question She stood bareheaded before him the afternoon sunlight outlining her figure and setting threads of gold in her hair The coming of the child had made her vaguely dearer to him This journey had not been mentioned between them since Davey s birth He had tried to put off making it ekeing out their dwindling supply of corned meat by shooting the brown wallabys which came out of the trees on the edge of the clearing surprised at the sight of strange two legged and four legged creatures They and the little grey furry animals that scurried high on the branches of the trees on moonlight nights made very good food Donald Cameron had been told that no man need starve in the hills while he had a gun and there were possums in the trees But neither he nor Mary liked the strong flavour of possum flesh tasting as it did of the pungent eucalyptus buds and leaves the little creatures lived on He shot the possums for the sake of their skins though spread and tacked the grey pelts against the wall of the house and when the sun had dried them Mary stitched them into a rug She had lined Davey s cradle with them too Donald made ready for his journey next day During the morning he took his gun down from the shelf above the door cleaned it and called his wife out of doors He showed her how to use it and made her take aim at a tall tree at the end of the clearing You must have no fires or light in the place after sundown he said and let the grub fires in the stumps die out Bar the doors at night And if blacks or a white man sets foot in the hut y ve the gun And must use it Don t hesitate It s the law in this country self defence Every man for himself and a woman is doubly justified You understand Yes of course she answered And I ll leave you the dog he went on He s a good watch and ll give warning if there s any danger about Yes she said When the morning came she went to the track in the wagon with him carrying Davey She got down when they reached the track he kissed her and the child and turned his back on them silently She stood watching the wagon go along the path they had come by from the Port until its roof dipped out of sight over the crest of the hill then she went slowly back along the threadlike path among the trees A white winged bird flapped across her path already fear of the stillness was upon her When she reached the break in the trees and the clearing was visible the hut on the brow of the hill had an alien aspect The air was empty without the sound of Donald s axe clanging in the distance or of his voice calling Lassie She was glad when Davey began to cry fretfully But she could not sing to him She tried and her voice wavered and broke Every other murmur in the stillness was subdued to listen to it The day seemed endless At last night came She closed and barred the door of the hut at sunset glancing towards the shelf where Donald had put his gun The firelight flickered and gleamed on its polished barrel Kneeling by the hearth she tried to pray But her thoughts were flying in an incoherent flight like scattered birds Davey slept peacefully on the bed among the grey possum furs she had wrapped round him She watched him sleeping for awhile and then undressing noiselessly lay down beside him She did not sleep but lay listening to every sound The creak of the wood of the house the panting of the wind about it far away sounds among the trees the shrill cry of a night creature every stir and rustle until the pale light of early dawn crept under the door and she knew that it was day again While she was busy in the morning she was unconscious of the world about her or the flight of the day but when her work was done and she stood in the doorway at noon the silence struck her again All the long day there was a faint busy hum of insects in the air It came from the grass from the trees the long tasselled branches of downy honey sweet white blossoms that hung from them Yet this ceaseless chirring of insects the leafy murmuring of the trees twittering of birds in the brushwood the murmuring of the wind in distant valleys the intermittent crooning and drone of the creek all the faint sweet earth voices dropped into the great quiet that brooded over the place as they might have into a mysterious ocean that absorbed and obliterated all sounds The bright hours were rent by the momentary screeching and chatter of parroquets as they flew spreading the red green and yellow of their breasts against the blue sky At sunset and dawn there were merry melodious flutings long sweet mating calls carollings and bursts of husky gnomish laughter Yet the silence remained hovering and swallowing insatiably every sound She gazed at the wilderness of the trees about her From the hill on which the cow paddock was she could see only the clearing and trees trees standing in a green and undulating sea in every direction clothing the hills so that they seemed no more than a dark moss clinging close to their sides In the distance they took on all the misty shades of grey and blue or stood purple steeped in shadows under a rain cloud She remembered how she had wondered what their mystery contained for her when she had first seen them on the edge of the plains and she and Donald had set their faces towards them She looked down on the child in her arms and realised that they had brought him to her from him her eyes went to the brown roof of the hut with its back to the hillside a thread of smoke curling from its brown and grey chimney and to the stretches of dark upturned earth before it They had brought her this too all the dear homeness of it and a sense of peace and consolation filled her heart To throw off the spell of the silence she decided that she must work again But what to do Donald had said no fires were to be lit in the stumps because the smoke might attract wayfarers on the road or wandering natives to the clearing She sang to the child fitfully softly Then remembering the spinning wheel which stood in its muffling cloths against the wall in the hut she brought it into the sunshine and laid Davey down on a shawl at her feet When she had a slender thread of yarn going and the spinning wheel began its familiar communicative little click clatter her mind was set to old themes She forgot place and time as her fingers pursued their familiar track A gay little air went fluttering moth wise over her lips to the accompaniment of the wheel and the little tap tapping of its treadles She glanced at the child every now and then laughing and telling him that his mother had found the wherewithal to keep her busy and gay as a bonny baby s mother ought to be and that the song she was singing was a song that the women sang over their spinning wheels in the dear country that she had come from far across the sea But the shadows fell quickly The birds were calling long and warningly when she carried the wheel indoors and busied herself for the evening milking Wherever she went the dog that had come from the Port with them followed He trailed in her footsteps when she went to the creek for water or to the cow paddock He lay with watchful eyes on the edge of the clearing when she sat at her spinning in the afternoon or walked backwards and forwards crooning Davey to sleep At about noon on the fourth day while she was making porridge for her midday meal the dog started to his feet and barked furiously He had been lying stretched on the mat in the doorway For a moment her heart stood still Then she went to the door What is it Jo she asked The dog s eyes were fixed on the trees and scrubby undergrowth to the left of the hut Every short hair on his lean body bristled He growled sullenly Later in the afternoon when she sat in the clearing spinning and singing with Davey on his shawl beside her he started to his feet suddenly and snarled fiercely Mary looked at him again questioningly and her eyes flew to the edge of the trees in the direction he pointed No quivering leaf nor threatening sound stirred the quiet He subsided at her feet after a moment but his ears kept pricked twitched uneasily his eyes never left the edge of the trees Once they twisted up to her and she read in them the clear expression of a pitiful uneasiness the assurance of deathless fidelity a prayer almost to go into the house She picked up the child and walked towards the hut The dog followed glancing uneasily towards the edge of the clearing She shut the door on that side of the hut and went to the back door Jo Jo she called long and clearly He flew round to her Though her limbs trembled Mary went up to the paddock and brought the cow down to the shed She milked with Davey on her knees and the dog crouched beside her then with the child on one arm and the milk pail on the other she went towards the house again She did not go down to the creek for water as she usually did It s not because I m afraid Davey she murmured but Jo would not have barked like that for nothing It was a warning and it would not be nice of us to take no notice of him at all As she left the shed the dog darted savagely away She did not notice that he was no longer at her heels until she had re entered the hut As she was going to call him the words died on her lips Two gaunt and ragged men stood in the doorway CHAPTER IV Mary stood back from the threshold The fear that had haunted her for days had suddenly left her At first glance she had seen that the men had rough pieces of wood in their hands Her gaze was arrested by the taller shaggier man who had sprung forward He was about to speak roughly breathlessly but she anticipated him Her eyes flew past him to the man who hung in his shadow The gash of a wound was just visible under a grimy piece of rag wrapped across his forehead He s hurt she cried a sure instinct of protection urging her Come in and I ll bind up your head It wants water and a clean bandage Oh but you look starving both of you Have you lost your way in the hills It s terrible to do that But you re welcome indeed Come in and have something to eat and rest yourselves The tall man hung in the doorway as though speech and reason had deserted him But the other whose thatch of reddish hair stood up strangely from the filthy rag that bound his forehead raised his arm and took a step forward the glare of madness in his eyes But that movement was the last spurt of energy in him He pitched forward and lay across the threshold Oh bring him in and put him on the bed there and I ll try and do something for him Mary cried her eyes flying from the fallen body to the man who stood in the doorway He did as she asked and turned to her with watchful eyes You hold the child for me while I bathe his head she said it may bring him to She thrust Davey into his arms Sit down won t you she asked smiling towards him as she set some water on the fire and poured some more into a basin She tore up a piece of old linen and began very gently to bathe the unconscious man s head He groaned as the pain stirred again She spoke to him saying that the wound would mend the sooner for being cleansed and that it was a wonder he was alive at all with the state it was in Sitting in Donald s chair holding Davey in his arms tightly clumsily the tall man watched her his face turned to and from her as his eyes wandered apprehensively about the hut and to the door Here ma am he said at last snarling over the words Where s your man I ve no notion for him to come in and corner us if that s your game He s away she replied and will not be back perhaps for a day or two He stared at her I should never have thought Davey would be so good with a stranger she added her eyes travelling from Davey s round head on his arm to the man s dark face and the eyes that leapt and glittered in it She smiled into them Davey was crooning and gurgling He had crooked his little hands into the stranger s beard and his mother saw with joy that the stranger held his head as though he feared to dislodge those little hands No games ma am he growled or it ll be the worse for you We re desperate men It s our lives we re fighting for I knew that when I saw you she said quietly She put some bread on the table a mug of milk and a piece of cold meat It is not much to offer you but it is all I ve got she said I wish it were better because you re wanting good wholesome food just now I ll make some gruel for your friend and maybe there ll be an egg to morrow or I can set snares for a possum She took Davey from him and he turned to the table to eat The man on the bed moaned wearily She put Davey into his basket lined with furry skins and went to the sick man The cloths that she had put over it to soak off the filthy rag which bound his head had served their purpose She lifted them and the festering gash on his forehead was laid bare Her exclamation or a twinge of pain as the air touched the wound sharpened his brain His eyes opened He stared with semi conscious gaze a moment Then with a hoarse oath he sprang at her His quivering lean fingers gripped her throat and clung tenaciously The man at the table flung himself upon him and wrenched his hands away they struggled for a moment then the sick man dropped on to the bed again but he shouted incoherently his fever bright eyes baleful by the flickering firelight After the gaols n the sea n the bush to be taken now and like this by God he panted Let me be Let me be don t you see it s a trap It s all right the other gasped Don t let your tongue run away with you Steve I ll not be taken alive the man on the bed cried Not now not after getting through so far I ll not be taken alive n the one that tries to take me ll not live either The tall man cursed beneath his breath The woman means no harm to you he said It is the fever troubling him Mary explained The sick man was already weak again He lay on the bed limply and muttering uneasily You d best hold him so as I can put on the clean rags she said She had a length of old linen smeared with ointment from a small earthenware jar in her hands She laid it over the wound and gently and firmly bound it into place That ll be better she murmured The gaunt man overlooked her a curious cynical humour in his eyes You re a brave woman he said I m not indeed she replied but her eyes met his squarely She laughed softly and told him how afraid she had been earlier in the day At the sound of his mother s voice Davey piped wistfully She went over to him and rocked his cradle for a moment or two Hush Davey she said talking to him softly in her native Welsh We have company There s one hungry man wants his supper and another man sick that thy mother must make gruel for Do thou sing to thyself son till mother is ready to take thee again But Davey had no great notion of the laws of hospitality that separated him from the source of all consolation He wailed incontinently and from wailing took to uttering his protest with all the strength that was in him The unkempt stranger munching his dry bread by the table glanced furtively at Mary s back as she stooped over the fire stirring the gruel then he got up and went to the cradle He lifted the child with awkward carefulness Davey continued to wail nevertheless finding that it was not the soft covering of his mother s breast that he was laid against but a harsh fabric smelling of the sea the earth dank leaves and a strange personality When she took the gruel from the fire and poured it into a little bowl her eyes rested on the stranger as he tried to appease Davey He was cradling the child in his arms and muttering awkwardly distressfully There now There An expression of awe and reflectiveness veiled the sharpness of his features There now There then he kept saying He looked up to find Davey s mother s eyes resting on him and laughed a little shamefacedly I think he s forgetting his company manners surely he said You re the first company he s had to practise on she replied Her simplicity and again the clear shining eyes with their direct and smiling glance astounded him You d best give this to your friend yourself she went on putting the bowl on the table It seems to trouble him to see a strange face She lifted Davey from the stranger s arms and he took the bowl of gruel to the other man Be gentle with him and humour him she warned but make him eat all of it I ll put a blanket here on the hearth for you and Davey and I will sleep at the other end of the room When she had thrown all the spare clothing in the hut on the floor before the fire and had spread a patchwork quilt and the rug of possum skins at the far end of the room for herself she sat down on a low stool near the door and lifted Davey s lips to her breast She sang a half whispering lullaby rocking him in her arms His cries ceased her thoughts went off into a dreamy psalm of thanksgiving as his soft mouth pulled at her breast She looked up to find the eyes of the tall stranger on her A gaunt long limbed man his clothes hung on his arms and legs as if they were the wooden limbs of a scarecrow The shreds were knotted and tied together and showed bare shrunken shanks and shins burnt and cut about the dark hair of virility thick on them His face lean and leathern had a curious expression of hunger The eyes in it held dark memories yet a glitter of the sun Mary Cameron vaguely realised that she had known what manner of man this was the moment she looked into his eyes That was why she had not been afraid when he confronted her on the doorstep why too she had been able to ask him into her house and treat him as an unexpected but not unwelcome guest The man on the bed moaned Suddenly he started up with a shrill scream A wave A wave We ll be swamped His voice fell away muttering Then again he was crying Is that the land Dan that line against the sky over there No don t y see there there man God Don t say it isn t How long have we been in this boat Seems years been seein the sea them blasted little blue waves jumpin up n lickin my face Better throw me overboard Dan Dan Better throw me overboard can t stand it any longer The thirst and the pain in me head Dan Mary turned pitiful eyes on him rocking Davey and hushing him gently as he wakened and began to cry querulously A sail the sick man shouted Some blasted clipper for the Port d y think she ll see us Dan Are we too far away Will the waves hide us He sank back wearily muttering again I ll not be caught not be taken alive Dan He started up crying angrily I d rather go to hell than back A u gh A shriek that curdled the blood in her veins a cry that sped upwards in an uncurling scream of uncontrollable anguish flew from the sick man Another and another Mary looked at the man before her questioningly The lines about his nose were bent to a faint and bitter smile but there was no smile in his eyes Thinks he s being flogged he said He would be if we were caught taken back again You know where we came from Yes she said From the Island his head was jerked in the direction of the sea You re the first soul I ve spoken to since we escaped except him and he s been raving mad most of the time You and I ve got to do some talking ma am He looked about the room lifted Donald s chair and set it before her He had recovered his self possession was readjusting his plans Yes she said You know we meant to get all the food and clothes we wanted from this hut he said harshly We watched you all day from the trees and thought a man would be coming home after sundown We didn t mean to let you off if you screamed and brought him before we d got what we wanted The dog s dead Did you know I killed him caught him by the throat behind the shed But that was a pity she cried a note of distress in her voice Pity He leaned forward But we can t afford to have pity I saw you sitting spinning in the sun singing to the child My heart turned in me to see you like the women at home But that would not have saved you Starving men fighting for our lives we were Wild beasts Pity What pity s been shown to us Do y know what it means to have felt the lash and made your escape from Port Arthur swimming the bay at Eaglehawks Neck wrapped in kelp cheating the bloodhounds chained a few yards from each other across the Neck and the sentry who d shoot you like a dog if he saw you Do y know what it was like crawling from one end of the Island to the other in the bush at night with only a native to guide you not knowing whether he was going to spear you or run you into the tribe making your way in a cockle shell of a boat in the open sea without any mariner s tools at all and only a keg of water and a bit of possum skin to chew to keep the life in you No you don t know How could you He paused a moment and continued desperately And it s no good my trying to tell you Steve got a crack on his head the night we escaped He was mad with thirst in the boat I was near it myself and I had all the work to do pulling and straining my eyes for the land We had to keep out of sight of other boats too and the Government sloop going between Port Southern and Hobart Town for fear we d be seen picked up and sent back Months of scheming it took to get so far I d picked up the lay of the land near the Port and the way to get about in the country beyond from sailors It was a man who d got as far as the coast and had been sent back told me to look for the muddy river water in the sea and get up the river at night We wanted to make the Wirree because there is a man lives near the river we d heard would give us food and shelter or help us to get away to the hills We got to the river and had to be low in the bush all day till night came again Then I went up through the trees to a wooden house we could see among other houses that were all mud or mud and stones It was McNab s shanty We d got a sailor to take a letter through to him saying we were coming and to be on the look out for us And I d got a message from McNab telling us how to get to him what sort of man he was to look at and saying he was willing to help us get away on condition that when we got on our feet we d make it up to him of course we had to pay on the spot too And we d got a bit to do it with I ve heard them say on the Island he s making his fortune McNab They say there are men in this country now well off holding big positions who pay McNab what he likes because he helped them to get away They pay because if they don t no matter who they are what they re doing a word from him against them and back they d go to the darbies and the cells But there s a new game now A reward is out for the capture of escaped convicts The weary bitterness of his voice took a sharper edge It was a hot night I lay low near McNab s waiting for the chance to tell him we d come and get the food and clothes he d promised to have ready for us It was late I waited until there didn t seem anybody about the bar and the lights went out all but the one in a room at the side Then I got tired of waiting and crept up to the shanty and lay flat against the wall hoping to see if the way was clear and I could get a word with McNab The wall was not thick and there was a crack in it I could see into that room with the light McNab was there and the trooper from Port Southern with him Under his coat I could make out his uniform A bottle of rum made the talk go easy between them and I heard the plan they were making It was that M Laughlin should not keep too close a watch for travellers from the Island be too keen on their scent and McNab should play friendly to them and tell M Laughlin of their whereabouts when they thought they were getting off finely He was to arrest them and the pair of them would share the reward Steve and I were expected We were to be first victims Mary s exclamation of pity and horror comforted him The compassion of her eyes banished the evil mirthless smile from his I got back to Steve he said more quietly He was almost too ill to walk He understood though that we would not be troubling McNab when I told him what had happened and was quiet though he had been moaning and crying all day It was because of his fever I was afraid to leave him again or to try to get food in the township So we started for the ranges But we hadn t gone far when he gave out and I had to carry him I wanted to get him away from the tracks where the sound of his raving could be heard and so we ve been in the hills ever since nearly ten days it must be This was the first clearing we sighted since we saw the Wirree and we had to get what we could out of it or die in our tracks I m talking sane enough now but I was almost as mad as Steve with hunger and rage at the thought of being taken again and serving to get reward money for McNab when we came to the door here He hesitated It was the sight of you looking like the Mother of God with the child in your arms saved me I ll give you all the food and clothes I can she said Ma am his voice trembled Then he said roughly You re not playing the Thad McNab game Her eyes met his Do you think so she asked Davey and I a fine pair we are to play a game with you You think it s the easiest way to get rid of us to give us what we ask for She nodded smiling You are afraid then Not for myself but for you There was no wavering in her eyes I was not wanting my husband to find you here He might think it was his duty to send word back to the Port He might He d try Yes he d try But you ve got a sick man to think of and you re at the end of your strength yourself Donald s a strong man and he has no love for desperate characters A flickering smile played about her mouth You must be gone before he returns You can rest here to morrow and then you would be better going You can read the stick by the door The cross marks the day he went it will be five days since then to morrow and he may be back on the sixth or the seventh day The man looked from her to the sapling pole by the door counted the notches on it and his eyes returned to her You ve heard naught good of convicts that you should be treating me so he said No it s terrible tales I ve heard of the things they do and the things that are done to them A shadow had fallen on her face None too terrible for the truth he said They tell me it was a man in Melbourne told me it is the life makes them desperate she cried Men who have been sent out for quite little things become Dead to shame he said men who would kill a woman who has served them as you have served us for fear when they d gone she would betray them send her men and the black bloodhounds after them condemn them to hell and torture again Oh women have done it and men like me have made other women pay A gleam of anger lighted Mary Cameron s eyes If you believe I would give them the chance of taking you back again there is Donald s gun on the shelf she said Settle the matter for yourself But if you will believe the truth it is this My heart is with you and all like you The sick man muttered and cried Davey waking wailed fretfully We ll go to morrow the stranger said You ll give us food and clothing Yes she replied a little wearily But will you not rest now I must be sleeping myself because the child will be ill if I m not careful of him The man stood before her abashed his face working as though he were restraining the desire to cry as Davey was crying I can t understand why you should be as you are he said at length his voice breaking Ah there s reason enough she sighed and turned away from him He threw himself down before the fire But Mary did not sleep when she lay on the floor at the other end of the room although the regular breathing of her guest told her when he slept Once she sat up and looked at him where he lay stretched before the fire as he had thrown himself in an attitude of utter exhaustion The rambling cries and the moaning of the man on the bed kept her awake She found herself listening to the tangled threads of his raving The firelight leapt in long beams across the room There was no fear but a strange awe in her heart CHAPTER V In the morning the tall man s eyes followed Mary as she went about the work of her house As though he were dreaming he watched her break dry branches and sticks for the fire across her knee Then it occurred to him to offer to break them for her and he fetched an armful of wood from the stack in the yard He gazed as if it were strange and wonderful to see a woman washing dishes sweeping and cooking at her own hearth He saw her leg rope and bail the cow lead the cow and calf to the fenced paddock on the top of the hill after the milking and carry buckets of water from the creek to the house the sunlight touching her bare head and flashing from the water in her pails Mary did everything in a serene methodical way going from one task to another as though she were happy in each and in no hurry to be done with it He heard her calling to the fowls as she threw a handful of crumbs to them and seeing that he was watching she told him smiling a little that the matronly buff hen Mother Bunch was a very good hen indeed laying every day except Sunday in the summer and spring time and that the smart speckled backed pullet was no good at all for laying She gives us a little brown egg now and then Mary said and makes such a fuss about it That s why I call her Fanny She is so like Miss Fanny at home who could not sew at all well but when she made a dress that a woman could wear all the countryside knew about it He she indicated the lordly rooster is called the Meester that is the Master in English A smile showed in the man s sombre eyes Early in the morning she had given him a bowl of porridge and had eaten some herself A bowl containing porridge for Steve when he wakened was set by the hearth The house was in order Davey bathed and put in his basket in the sun and Mary was making bread of the little flour and meal left in the bags when Steve awoke He sat up on the bed and looked uneasily about the room He was a frail sickly looking creature The fever had left him but there were apprehension and desperate fear in his eyes as with a quickened light they rested on her He s awake Mary called softly to the man out of doors He sprang across the threshold It s all right Steve he said This woman s a friend She had stooped to the hearth and lifted the bowl of porridge Steve ate like a hungry dog tearing at the bread and thrusting large spoonfuls of porridge into his mouth Mary gave him a cup of hot milk He swallowed it at once and coughed and swore as it scalded his throat If you could see what you can do for us in the way of clothes ma am his companion said we ll be moving on Her eyes were troubled If harm came of my helping you she began if Innocent blood were shed he said There was bitterness in his voice You re like the rest of them Good bad or indifferent you herd us all together convicts If you mean his eyes sought hers if you mean you re afraid that instead of helping to give a man another chance for his life you may be helping a wolf to harry the lambs you re making a mistake ma am I swear by all I hold sacred you ll not repent of what you have done for me Mary smiled her tension of spirit relieved I believe you she said simply She took Donald s working clothes from the pegs where they hung behind the door They were worn but whole From the heavy sea chest that stood in the far corner of the room she took a grey flannel shirt also one of unbleached calico and a pair of dingy black trousers then she brought a pair of broken boots and a torn felt hat from the shed where the plough and tools were kept There s only one hat and I ll have to stitch it for you she said but he with a glance at Steve who had fallen asleep again on the bed he won t have need of a hat for awhile with that bandage on his head and when the cut is healed you had better give him this one to wear and you will be able to say you have lost yours The tall man glanced from Donald s heavy boots to Steve s bruised and blackened feet You had better put on those yourself Mary said following his glance perhaps he could wear mine She sat down and took off her shoes While he measured her shoe against Steve s foot she slipped her feet into a broken pair of green hide covers clamped with nails that Donald had made They will be right for him he said I ll waken him now and we ll get on our way She took the bread that had been browning on the hearth stones and put it on the table The hut was filled with the warm sweet smell of the newly baked loaves You can change in here while I put Davey to sleep outside she said And there s a pail of water and soap there by the doorway it will do you no harm to dowse with it The tall man laughed It was a boyish burst that laugh of his The piece of advice womanly in its essence and delivered with an air of maternal solicitude touched a forgotten well spring of merriment Mary lifted Davey into her arms and sang to him softly as she walked up and down in the sunshine A long straggling figure came to her a few moments later clad in Donald s clothes She smiled to see the way they hung short of his ankles hitched over the long thin legs But the dowsing of creek water had done more than cleanse his body in an indefinable way it had purified and stimulated the inner man He had found Donald s shears too and had clipped the shaggy growth about his chin to a modest beard and shorn his head of some of its shock of hair You have the air of a daffy young Englishman just arrived in the Colonies to make your fortune she said Ma am isn t that what I am There was a blithe recklessness in his voice He swept her the bow that was considered gallant in the old country Steve appeared in the doorway Are you going now she asked He nodded But I must give you some bread and milk to take with you she said It will be a long time before you strike Middleton s It was there I was thinking you might make for at first It s across the ranges to the east If you follow the track across the clearing you will find a stock route You ve only to keep along that and it will bring you to the station It s four or five days journey from here I think and maybe there ll be a job with cattle there Drovers are being wanted everywhere they were when we came up from the Port nearly a year ago Yes he said we heard in the Island that every man in the country s wanting to be gold hunting and that the cattle owners can t get beasts to the market They re running off wild where the stockmen have left them We want any job that ll bring food and money to begin with and they say men with cattle are not making too particular inquiries as to whose doing their drovin so long as it s done She put Davey in his basket and went back to the hut When she reappeared it was with some bread and a bottle of milk wrapped in a piece of bagging You ll have no trouble about water because there are creeks all through the hills she said as she put the bundle into his hand Steve had gone off without speaking to her He was slouching towards the trees The tall man took the food from her Their eyes met Have I ever seen you before I seem to know you she asked distress on her face Pray God not ma am he said What is your name You d better not know For a moment in a storm of gratitude and emotion his mind trembled on the verge of self revelation His face worked uncertainly I cannot say what I want to he said at last as if restraint denied him almost any expression at all This is a debt ma am If ever in any way I can repay I will But there s no way of letting you know what you have done for me For a moment his eyes held hers Then he turned away and she watched him stride across the clearing and disappear among the trees CHAPTER VI In her sleep Mary heard the rumble and groan of the wagon as it ground its way along the rough tracks and crashed over the undergrowth She awakened to hear the yelping of dogs the lowing of cattle sounds of men s voices in the clearing For a moment she believed that her mind was still hovering in the troubled state of dreams Then Donald s voice calling her struck through the drowsy uncertainty Trembling she sprang out of bed and threw Davey s red shawl about her shoulders She lighted the dip in a bowl of melted fat and put it on to the table Mary Again his voice hoarse and impatient came from the darkness on the edge of the clearing She pulled back the bolts and threw open the door Yes she called Donald loomed out of the darkness Across the clearing by the swinging light of a lantern before the wagon she dimly saw its white shape and the moving backs of cattle Her arms went out to Donald when he stood before her Where s the dog he asked Dead she said quietly From her eyes and her face as she fell back he learnt that something unusual had happened Then there has been trouble he said She nodded He swept his hat off with a great sigh But you re all right you and the bairn Yes When the dog did not fly out as we got near the house I thought something had happened There are tales in the Port of two men from Hobart Town escaped convicts having taken to the hills Their boat was found in the Wirree I tried to get back sooner fearing they might come this way but the roads were bad and then there were the cattle I haven t had an easy minute since I ve been away But we can talk later There s a boy come with me drivin the cattle I got a mob cheap from a man whose stockmen had cleared out and left them on his hands Get us something to eat ready I ll bring the wagon up to the shed now You can get what you want from it There s corned meat and oatmeal and flour for a year We ll put the cattle into the fenced paddock and then come down You can clear out the wagon enough to put a sheepskin or two and a blanket in it for Johnson He turned away and went back into the night Mary threw more wood on the fire As she put on her skirt and bodice she heard the wagon labouring forward She was out getting the flour and bacon she wanted from it by the light of a lantern when with a rattling of horns and a thunder of hoofs the cattle beat past her along the track behind the sheds The lantern light gave a vision of fierce bloodshot eyes of terror in a sea of tossing backs of moving flanks and branching horns She heard her husband s voice hoarse and yelling the voice of the strange youth and the cracking of whips and yelping of dogs for nearly an hour afterwards as they tried to get the beasts into the fenced paddock on the hill top It was nearly dawn before Donald and the slight insignificant looking young man he had brought with him from Port Southern had finished their meal Then the stockman went to sleep in the wagon and Donald Cameron turned to his wife Tell me what happened he said She did so very simply They must have been the same men I heard of in the Port he said breathing hard M Laughlin the trooper told me about them and that I had best look out for them up here There was no telling what they might do he said a desperate pair would stop at nothing I am not sure that I d better not send Johnson back to tell him that they ve been here and that You would not do that Donald Why not His voice the suppressed rage of it was a shock to her A man cannot leave his home in safety with these sort of men about and it is the duty of every honest man to deal as he would be dealt by You re a clever woman and no harm has come to you by them but there are other women who might not be so clever But they were not bad men Donald one of them was sick and the other It would be a good thing too being new in the district to stand well with the police he continued doggedly and if they were here those two they would either make back for the Port or the Wirree or try to get to Middleton s If they re on foot as ye say they could not go fast and M Laughlin with horses could catch them up in a day or two Which way did they go Mary turned her head away A sick feeling of grief and disappointment overcame her His eyes covered the averted curve of her face and the line of her neck Which way did they go he asked thickly Donald she turned to him I promised not to send anyone after them You know and I know that lots of men have been sent out for things that were not crimes at all and You know and you will not tell me he asked harshly as though he had not heard Yes she cried He took her by the shoulder His arm trembled I have stood this sort of thing long enough he said On the ship and in Melbourne it was the same You were always doing such things feeding or giving your clothes to filthy ailing gaol birds and whiners I have told you you could not afford to do it No respectable woman can afford to in a country where every second woman has the prison mark on her Show sympathy with lags and what ll be said next You re a lag yourself and that s why your sympathy s with them Y re my wife the wife of a decent man and free settler I d have y r remember that and I ll not have it said of you He threw her off from him Which way did they go Keen and compelling the deep set eyes those in dwelling places of his will met hers It was my word I gave Donald his wife said and I can t tell you CHAPTER VII In ten years Cameron s had become the biggest clearing in the hills as it was the oldest Many others had been made and were scattered throughout the lower ranges overlooking the Wirree plains though at great distances apart ten twelve and sometimes twenty miles lying between neighbouring homesteads The hut that had been Donald and Mary Cameron s first home had been broadened by the addition of several extra rooms Floors had been put down and a wide verandah spread out from them Every room had a window with four small glass panes The window sills verandah posts and doors had been painted green and the whole of the house whitewashed Its bark roof had given place to a covering of plum coloured slates there was even a coin or two of grey and golden lichen on them and the autumn and spring rains drummed merrily on the iron roof of the verandah Creepers climbed around the stone chimney and the verandah clematis showered starry white blossom over the roof and about the verandah post A little garden marked off from the long green fields of spring wheat by a fence of sharp toothed palings was filled with bright flowers English marigolds scarlet geraniums pink yellow and blue larkspurs and all manner of sweet smelling herbs sage mint marjoram and lemon thyme The narrow beaten paths that ran from the verandah to the gate and round the house were bordered with rosemary And in the summer a long line of hollyhocks pink white and red and red and white waved tall and straight at one side of the house The edge of the forest had been distanced so far on every side of the clearing except one that the trunks of the trees showed in dim outlines against it the misty drifting leafage swaying over and across them Only on the side on which the track climbed uphill from the road the trees still pressed against the paddock railings A long white gate in the fence where the road stopped bore the name Donald Cameron had given his place Ayrmuir It was the name of the estate he had worked on in Scotland when he was a lad It gave him no end of satisfaction to realise that he was the master of Ayrmuir and that his acres were broader than those of the Ayrmuir in the old country not only broader but his to do what he liked with his property unencumbered by mortgage or entail On the cleared hillsides about the house crops of wheat barley and rye had been sown An orchard climbed the slope on the left Behind the old barn and the stables were a row of haystacks The cowsheds and milking yards were a little further away Round the haystacks and about the barn a score of the buff and buttermilk coloured progeny of Mother Bunch a few speckled chickens black and white pullets and miscellaneous breeds of red feathered and long legged yellow fowls scratched and pecked industriously Donald Cameron farmed his land in the careful fashion of the Lowland Scots There was perhaps here and there a crooked line in his fields and a rick awry behind the barns But all was neatness and order from the beehives which stood with their pointed straw bonnets beneath the apple trees to the cowsheds where newly cut bracken was laid down every day or two for the cows to stand in when they were milked There was no filth or squelching morass in his cow yards The pigs wandered over the hills rooting under the tender grass Scarcely a straw was allowed to stray between the back of the house and barns In the feed room the harness room in every shed and yard the meticulous precision and passion for order which characterised all that Donald Cameron did was maintained There were changes indoors as well as out A long straight kitchen with a bricked floor and small window looking out on to the yard had been added to the original home On the east side two rooms had been built and a small limewashed shed behind the kitchen served for a dairy In it on broad low shelves against the wall the rows of milk pans with milk setting in them were ranged a small window in the back wall framed a square of blue sky When missus Cameron was making butter the sound of the milk in the churn the rumble and splash of the curded cream could be heard in the yard The sweet smell of the new butter and buttermilk hung about the kitchen door Ten years of indefatigable energy of clearing land breaking soil raising crops and rearing cattle doing battle with the wilderness overcoming all the hardships and odds that a pioneer has to struggle against had left their mark on Donald Cameron Every line in his face was ploughed deep His expression gloomy and taciturn as of old masked an internal concentration the bending of all faculties to the one end that occupied him Always a man of few words as the farm grew and its operations increased he became more and more silent talking only when it was necessary and seldom for the sake of companionship or mere social intercourse His mind was always busy with the movements of cattle branding mustering breeding buying and selling prices possibilities of the market He worked insatiably He was reminded of the flight of time only by the growth of his son a gawky long limbed boy As soon as he could walk Davey had taken his share in the work of the homestead rounding up cows in the early morning feeding fowls hunting for eggs in the ripening crops scaring birds from the ploughed land when seed was in and cutting ferns for the cowsheds and stables His father was little more than a dour taskmaster to the boy Davey had no memory of hearing him sing the gathering song of the Clan of Donald the Black His mother had taught him to read and count as she sat with her spinning wheel in the little garden in front of the house or stitching by the fire indoors on winter evenings Davey had to sit near her and spell out the words slowly from the Bible or the only other book she had a shabby little red history Sometimes when he was tired of reading or the click and purr of her wheel set her mind wandering she told him stories of the country over the sea where she was born Davey knew that the song she sang sometimes when she was spinning was a song a fairy had taught a Welshwoman long ago so that her spinning would go well and quickly She told him stories of the tylwyth teg the little brown Welsh fairies There was one he was never tired of hearing Tell me about the farmer s boy who married the fairy mother he would say eagerly And she would tell him the story she had heard when she was a child Once upon a time she would say ever so long ago there was a farmer s boy who minded his father s sheep on a wild lonely mountain side Not a mountain side like any we see in this country Davey dear but bare and dark with great rocks on it And one day when he was all alone up there he saw a girl looking at him from round a rock Her hair was so dark that it seemed part of the rock and her face was like one of the little flowers that grow on the mountain side But he knew that it was not a flower s face because there were eyes in it bright dark eyes and a mouth on it a little red mouth with tiny white teeth behind it They played on the mountain together for a long time and sometimes she helped him to drive his sheep After a while they got so fond of each other that the boy asked her to go home with him to his father s house and he told his father that he wanted to marry her That night a lot of little men riding on grey horses came down from the mountain on a path of moonlight and clattered into the farmyard of the farmer of Ystrad The smallest and fattest of the men in a red coat they all wore red coats and rode grey horses Did I say that they all rode grey horses Davey Yes mother Davey breathed She had this irritating little way of going back a word or two on her story if a thread caught on her wheel Well she began again and as likely as not her mind taken up with the tangled thread would add Where was I Davey And Davey all impatience for her to go on with the story though he could have almost told it himself would say And the smallest and fattest of the men in a red coat Oh yes Mary started again Strode into the kitchen and pinched the farmer s ear and said that he was Penelop s father the girl s name was Penelop and that he would let her marry the farmer s son and give her a dowry of health wealth and happiness on condition that nobody ever touched her with a piece of iron If anybody put a piece of iron on her Penelop s father said she would fly back to the mountain and her own people and never more sit by her husband s hearth and churn or spin for him So the farmer s boy married Penelop and very happily they lived together Everything on the farm prospered because of the fairy wife though she wore a red petticoat and was like any other woman to look at only more beautiful and always busy and merry She made fine soup and cheese and her spinning was always good and everybody was very fond of her Then one day when her husband wanted to go to a fair she ran into the fields to help him to catch his pony And while he was throwing the bridle the iron struck her arm and that minute she vanished into the air before his eyes She paused for Davey s exclamation of wonderment and then continued Though he wandered all over the mountain calling her Penelop never came back to her husband or the two little children she had left with him But one very cold night in the winter he wakened out of his sleep to hear her saying outside in the wind and rain Lest my son should find it cold Place on him his father s coat Lest the fair one find it cold Place on her my petticoat Mary sang the words to a quaint little air of her own making while Davey listened big eyed and awe stricken When the children grew up they had dark hair and bright sparkling eyes like their mother she would conclude smiling at him And when they had children they were like them too so that people who came from the valley where the farmer s boy had married the fairy were always known by their looks and they were called Pellings or the children of Penelop because it was said they had fairy blood in their veins Davey had always a thousand questions to ask He liked to brood over the story but he learnt more than fairy tales from his mother s memories of the old land Her mind was beginning to be occupied with thoughts of his future She and her husband were simple folk Cameron could barely read and write and what little knowledge Mary possessed she had already passed on to Davey She knew what Donald Cameron s ambitions were and after ten years of life with him had little doubt as to their achievement The position that it would put Davey in had begun to be a matter of concern to her She was turning over in her mind her plans for his getting a good education as she sat spinning beside the fireplace in the kitchen one evening when her husband said suddenly I wish to goodness you d put that clacking thing away have done with it now My wheel she asked mild surprise in her eyes Aye he said impatiently He was sitting in his chair on the other side of the hearth Don t you realise woman it s not the thing for missus Cameron of Ayrmuir to be doing Don t you realise y re a person of importance now The lady of the countryside if it comes to that and for you to sit there tapping and clacking that thing is as good as telling everybody y were a wench had to twist up wool for a living a few years ago She stared at him He shifted his seat uneasily I ve been thinking he continued it s no good having made the name and the money unless we live up to it You must get a girl to help y with the work of the house and we ll not sit in here any more in the evening but in the front room and have our meals there But the new carpet that s laid down and the new furniture Donald she exclaimed They re not there to be looked at are they he asked Last spring sales they were calling me Laird of Ayrmuir I cleared near on a thousand pounds I m not wanting to be flash and throw away money he added hastily But that s to show you we can and are going to live something the way they did at Ayrmuir in the old country She rose and lifted the spinning wheel from its place by the fire It was like putting an old and tried friend from her But when she sat down on her chair opposite Donald Cameron again there was a new steady light in her eyes You ll be a rich man indeed Donald if you go on as you are doing she said Aye He gazed before him smoking thoughtfully And your son will be a rich man after you Aye Well you must have him properly educated for the position he is going to have She came steadily to her point All your money won t be any use to him it will only make him ashamed to go where the money could take him unless he has got the education to hold his own Her eyes drew his from their contemplation of the fireplace and the falling embers You ve the book learning why can t you give it to him he said I have given him as much as I can she sighed but it s little enough I m not such a fine scholar as you think Donald There are things in those books that you brought from the Port in the sale lot with the arm chair and the fire irons that I cannot make head nor tail of though the fore bits I ve read say that A knowledge of the contents is essential to a liberal education She pronounced the words slowly and carefully Donald Cameron frowned He did not exactly know what she was driving at but those words sounded important I ve been thinking Mary went on quickly there s a good many people about here now and they ought to be getting their children educated too There s the Morrisons Mackays Rosses and O Brians And there s a child at the new shanty on the top of the track missus Ross was telling me last time she was here Between the lot of us we ought to be able to put up a school and get a teacher A barn on the road would do for a school In other parts of the country the people are getting up schools The newspaper you brought from Port Southern last sales said that Why should not we And where will you get y r teacher Cameron asked grimly Her colour rose I know what you mean she said The only sort of men who could and would think it worth while giving school to children are the convicts and ticket of leave men but there are decent men among them They seem to be doing very well in other places I see that mothers are going to the school room and sitting there doing their sewing so that they can be sure the children are learning no harm with their lessons We could not do that every day here but now and then one of us mothers could go to see that the school was going on well Anyway the children must be taught and we ve got to make the best bargain we can I ll think of what you say her husband replied You ll be going to the Clearwater River to morrow and be away a day or two won t you she asked I might take the cart and Lass and go and see what missus Ross and Martha Morrison and missus Mackay think of getting a school If people about are willing Donald Cameron said brooding over his pipe it d be a good thing for all of us a school The difficulty I can see will be the teacher Can we get one There s high wages for stockmen and drovers But maybe there ll be just some stranded young fool glad of the job and the chance of makin a little money without soiling his hands You could pick them up by the score in Melbourne but here He shook his head You might ask a few questions in the Port when you re there if there is any likely young man she said Aye I might he replied There was an amused gleam in his eyes as he looked up at her You seem to have thought a good deal on this matter before using y re tongue Is it not a good way she asked the smile in her eyes too Aye he admitted grudgingly a very good way And you do not mean the grass to grow under y re feet Mary No indeed She put her work basket away took the lighted candle from the table and went to her room The loose star of the candle flickered a moment in the gloom and then was extinguished But Donald Cameron left alone before the fire realised that the subject of Davey s schooling had been disposed of CHAPTER VIII It took missus Cameron some time to make her round of visits But she was very pleased with the result of them On the afternoon of the third day she drove in a high spring cart up the steep hillside on the top of which a shanty had been built only a few months before It was a stopping place for stockmen and travellers on the overland track the only one between the scattered settlements on the other side of the ranges and the Wirree River From the head of the ranges it looked down on the falling slopes of lesser hillsides and on the wide sweep of the inland plains It was not more than five or six miles from Ayrmuir but she had made it the last place to visit thinking that she might not have time to get to it before her husband was due to return from the Clearwater She had settled in her own mind to make a separate journey some afternoon if she could not include it in this one But her plans had gone well and briskly All the women she had seen thought the school a good idea and were anxious to have it the men had promised to help in the building and to pay the share that she had mentioned as likely to be asked of them for the Schoolmaster s services Davey had enjoyed the first part of the excursion as much as she had He had romped and run wild with boys and girls on the homesteads they had been to It was only when they were leaving Ross s that morning he had been disturbed After his mother and missus Ross had kissed good bye missus Cameron had shaken hands with Ted and Mick Ross and kissed little Jessie and he had shaken hands with missus Ross and grinned at the boys missus Ross exclaimed Why Davey hasn t said good bye to Jess She had lifted the child up to his face Jess s soft skin against his and her wet baby mouth overwhelmed him with confusion He brushed his coat sleeve across his cheek Oh Davey his mother laughed missus Ross laughed too and Ted and Mick giggled hilariously Davey had climbed into the cart and taken his seat by his mother angry and offended He had no idea why they were laughing at him and he sat stolid and sullen brooding over it all the morning When they came to the ramshackle house of grey palings with a roof of corrugated iron on the top of the hill two or three dogs flew out barking furiously A bullock wagon was drawn up on the side of the road and a lean stock horse hitched to a post stood twitching his tail to keep the flies away Half a dozen scraggy fowls scratched and pecked about the water butt A bare legged little girl with wind tossed dark hair ran out and stood staring at them She had a little white freckled face and eyes as shy and bright as a startled wild creature missus Cameron got down from the cart leaving Davey in it holding the reins Good day she said to the child I want to see mister Stevens The child stared at her Then a man came to the dark doorway of the house a lean lithe man with bearded chin and quick restless eyes She went towards him and explained in a few eager words why she had come Will you come in and take a seat ma am he asked his voice vibrating strangely She went into the house its very shadow exhaled a stale smell of crude spirits and tobacco You d better give Lass a drink Davey she called I ll be back presently The room she stepped into was kept with an attempt at orderliness It was bare and cleanly The dull afternoon sunshine garnished its bare walls the rough chairs and the bunks against the wall The man had followed her into the room and now faced her There was a suspension of the breath in his nostrils as this quiet grey clad woman lifted her eyes to his Neither of them spoke for a few minutes People passed and repassed the room feet dragged curious glances strayed into it If you recognise us give us away the game s up he muttered I understand missus Cameron said Steve made some money on the fields he said He bought this place and Deirdre and I came with him to see him settled Deirdre the child you saw outside belongs to me It s about her I came missus Cameron explained hurriedly glad to leave the ground of troubled memory She described the scheme for getting a school in the district building a room somewhere on the roadside at a point where it could be reached by children of the scattered clearings Who s to be the teacher he asked Sitting on a low form he leaned across the table and gazed at her Through the open window she could see Davey sitting up very stiff and straight in the spring cart He had taken his red history book from his pocket and was pretending to read The child whom the man before her had called Deirdre was standing staring at him A smile flitted across missus Cameron s face She thought that Davey had not forgiven her sex for the discomfiture it had put upon him that morning and was determined to have nothing to do with little girls That s our difficulty the teacher she said The only persons who have the education who are able to be teachers are Transports convicts he interrupted harshly Beg your pardon ma am his voice dropped contritely as he continued You were saying the only persons in the colony who could be school teachers are persons of evil character who could not be depended on not to corrupt the children What are you going to do then We thought if we could get a young man with the education who seemed reformed we would give him a chance she said For a while the mothers would go to the school and sit there during some of the lesson times to see That the children did not learn more than their reading writing and arithmetic Yes she smiled Do you think you would be willing to let your little girl come to the school if we can get a teacher He flung off his seat and strode restlessly up and down the room She s a wild cat She wouldn t go unless He threw back his head looking at her a blithe defiance creeping into his eyes and voice Unless you made me the teacher he said What would you say if I applied for the post You Her eyes were wide with amazement Oh I thought so he laughed But your reformed young man would have something of a past too you know and it might not be as clean even as mine It s a pity you won t consider me as a likely person I ve got what you call the education Have you she asked eagerly The grammar geography all the the learning that is essential to a liberal education All that and letters after my name for it he said bitterly But I m an Irishman I called myself a patriot and any stick is good enough to beat a dog with I don t know exactly what they called my offence inciting to revolt or using seditious language perhaps but I have earned my sentence since I got here It was that I was doing all the time in New South Wales and the Island inciting to revolt and using seditious language but the fire s gone out of me now I want a quiet life In his eyes she read a passionate impatience and weariness If you were willing that I should be the Schoolmaster the other people would be likely to have me perhaps he continued They would not know what you know and I can play the part of the broken down fool who has lost every penny he had on the fields It does not rest with me naming the Schoolmaster of course she said a little troubled But if the others are willing to have you I shall be glad She had a native grace that took for granted in others her own sincerity and purity of motive I am grateful missus Cameron he said She smiled to think that he knew her name You are Daniel Farrel he said When they went out of doors Lass was standing deserted with her nose over the water butt There was no sight or sound of Davey or Deirdre Her father called and presently she came racing round the corner of the house hair flying and eyes bright with mischief and laughter Davey followed at a breakneck pace His collar was twisted and a jagged three cornered tear showed in his grey trousers The girl flew to her father Davey came to a standstill sheepishly a few yards from his mother What have you been doing Deirdre Farrel asked Showing him the ring tail possum s nest in the tree at the back of the cow yard she said eagerly He couldn t climb because his trousers were too tight and I raced him up the hill She s a wild thing has never had anybody but me to look after her he said to missus Cameron the black head under his hand Her mother s dead missus Cameron asked gently Yes he said Davey and missus Cameron drove away Davey craned his neck looking back along the road several times and the last time he looked Deirdre was standing alone an elfish figure outlined against the sunset She can run mother he cried his eyes alight She can run and climb quicker than anybody I ever saw P raps I believe she s a Pelling mother She s got the bright eyes and black hair Maybe Mary Cameron said smiling at his eagerness and belief in the old story maybe there s fairy blood in her veins CHAPTER IX It was not long before a barn like building of slatted shingles appeared in a clearing off the road two or three miles below Steve s It stood on log foundations as if on account of its importance and had a door at one end of its road facing wall instead of in the middle as ordinary houses had and two windows with small square panes of glass stared out on the road Drovers and teamsters on the roads as they passed halted up to listen to the children singing and went on their way with oaths of admiration throats and eyes aching sometimes at the memories and vivid pictures the sound brought them Behind the school was the bark thatched hut which had been run up for the Schoolmaster to live in Donald Cameron had given the plot of land for the school and he had promised to sell the Schoolmaster a few acres beside it if he wanted to make use of his spare time to clear the land put in a crop or make a garden mister Farrel soon intimated that he did and came to terms with Donald Cameron At first no more than a dozen children went to school Some walked others came tumbling into the clearing two or three a back of a stolid jog trotting old horse others arrived packed together in a spring cart At the back of the clearing was a fenced paddock into which the horses were turned during school hours They were a merry company of young warrigals these children of the hills when they poured out of the school doorway played in the clearing at midday munching their crusty lunches or chased in the horses as a preliminary to scrambling on to them and racing each other helter skelter down the bush tracks spreading and straggling in every direction to their homes The Schoolmaster governed them all with an easy familiarity He had an eager boyish way of talking when he explained a peculiarity of spelling or grammar or a story from history a light reckless humour that made missus Cameron if she were sitting by the window sewing look up uneasily her serene face disturbed her eyes mildly reproving But the children laughed and loved the flippancies They scratched and scraped the better for being on good terms with the Schoolmaster although missus Cameron was afraid that they had not a proper respect for him and that he was not dignified enough with them She was not the only woman who sat on the seat by the window Sometimes missus Ross or missus Morrison took a turn there and knitted or stitched as they watched to see that the Schoolmaster s behaviour was all that might be expected They knew nothing of mister Farrel s history or antecedents As far as they were concerned he was a broken down Irishman who had come to make his fortune on the goldfields and lost any money he had That was his story and that he wanted to live a quiet life for awhile away from the temptations and risks of the scramble for gold His manner and air were decorous enough to make them believe it and after the first few visits of inspection they were satisfied not to make any more Only Mary Cameron was concerned as to the nature of some of the seeds he was sowing in the minds of the young generation She had heard him describing the state of Ireland under His Most Gracious Majesty George III to the older boys and girls and on another occasion had heard him telling them that the exports of Great Britain were cotton and woollen goods coal and iron and convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen s Land Did you have good lessons to day Davey she asked one evening when her son was poring over his books Not half as good as yesterday when you were there mother he said Why how was that she asked Oh mister Farrel says more things to make us laugh when you re there he said going on with his writing painstakingly He made me do sums all this morning and I d never have got them right if Deirdre hadn t helped me He lets her sit next me now When school was out a day or two later missus Cameron rose from her seat by the window She tied her bonnet strings The Schoolmaster hummed the tune the children had been singing before they clattered out for the day it was an old English folk song that he had taught them As he put away his books and pencils his eyes wandered towards missus Cameron once or twice Her back was to him she was looking out of the window He strode over to her He knew she was displeased His eyes had the guilty look of awaiting reproof the glad light of the miscreant who knows that he has done wrong but has enjoyed doing it He had not admitted to himself even that his reason for talking to make the children laugh and pointing a story from history with a radical or cynical moral was that her anxiety about the instruction they were getting might not be quite lulled He did not want her to give up coming to the school and cease to occupy the seat by the window occasionally But there was something in her face this afternoon that he had not seen there before It was a pity to talk to the children the way you did to day she said simply Facts missus Cameron he cried gaily The facts of life presented in an interesting form are far more important to boys and girls than a knowledge of let us say geography It was geography among other things we asked you to teach them she replied I beg your pardon ma am His pride was cut to the quick he bowed awkwardly I shan t be coming to the school any more mister Farrel she said after a few moments There was an odd mixture of dignity and humility in her bearing We re all grateful to you for what you have done in teaching the children I knew from the first that you were to be trusted that no harm would come of your schooling and Davey has told me that it is only when I am here that you talk as you have done to day You know I ve been coming for my own learning and not to see that you taught properly I came often because I wanted to learn and keep up with Davey so that I could help him by and by perhaps There was an unmistakable break in her voice It was not very kind to laugh at me She took the wild flowers from the jar of water on her table by the window as she always did and went to the door It had been very pleasant for her to sit on the bench under the window hearing the children sing old country songs and listening to the Schoolmaster telling them of other parts of the world of rules of speech and calculation of the nature of the earth the heavens the stars and the sea of kingdoms strange peoples and their histories and occupations The sunlight had come through the open window and a breeze bearing the honey fragrance of the white gum blossoms fleecing the trees on the edge of the clearing had fanned her face She was so sorry to be giving up those days in the school room that a mist of tears stood in her eyes as she glanced about it She had felt an innocent almost childish pleasure in them and in learning with the children missus Cameron The Schoolmaster sprang after her The trouble in his face surprised her Don t say that I that I that you think I could He was not able to say laugh at you But she had gone He dropped into her chair by the window and threw his arms across the table CHAPTER X The school had been working for over three years when missus Cameron and the Schoolmaster came to an agreement by which Davey was to have extra lessons after school hours to learn something of foreign languages and of the higher mathematics not to speak of other odds and ends of knowledge that mister Farrel might consider part of that liberal education she was so anxious he should acquire and Deirdre was to stay with missus Cameron for a while and learn to cook and sew and generally to practise woman s ways about a house It was bareback on Lass that Davey and Deirdre came jogging along the road from school for the first time missus Cameron heard their shrill joyous voices long before they emerged from the cover of the trees then she watched them climbing the track across the rise straddling the old horse s fat sides Deirdre with her arms round Davey s waist the red handkerchief containing her wardrobe in his left hand fast in Lass s matted mane He gave the old mare a flick now and again with a stripped branch he had in his right hand though it made no more impression than a fly alighting on her thick hair She kept on at her steady jogging pace until they were against the yard gate missus Cameron laughed when she saw them She kissed Deirdre and took the red bundle from Davey s hand Father says Deirdre said a quaint air of sedateness settling down on her that he s shamed to send me without stockings or a wedding garment missus Cameron But if you will get what is necessary for me next time you go to the Port he will be what was it Davey Extremely obliged Davey replied carefully mister Farrel says that he s bought her shoes and stockings over and over again mother but she won t wear them There s two shoes in the possum s nest by our house and a pair of boots in the creek Deirdre admitted with a sidelong look at him While Davey took Lass to the paddock on the top of the hill Deirdre went indoors with missus Cameron She had never been away from her father before At first she had been surprised at the suggestion of going anywhere without him but he had told her that she was going to learn to be like missus Cameron a good housewife so that she could look after him and their home as well as a grown woman and she was delighted at the idea Jogging up the hills behind Davey she had not realised that she was to spend the night away from Dan as he was to her in all her tense moments It was only when she went into the tiny box like paper covered room with two little white beds in it that she began to understand this She gazed at the room she had never seen anything like it with its white covers little cupboard with a mirror on it and papered walls spread with red and brown flowers You must wash your face and hands and feet Deirdre missus Cameron said and then I ll bring you a pair of Davey s shoes and stockings to wear until I can get others for you She unknotted the red handkerchief The two or three little garments of coarse calico it contained had been washed and rough dried Mary turned them over critically Dan washed them himself Deirdre said sullenly sensing the criticism He put them under his bed and slept on them so that they would look nice this morning He sewed up the holes too And he said O God when he folded them up and put them in the handkerchief missus Cameron stared at the clothes her heart sore for the Schoolmaster and his attempt to send the child to her with all her little belongings neatly mended and in order There was silence a moment Then Deirdre started away from her I don t want to stay here she cried Deirdre missus Cameron was amazed at the change that had come over the sunny little face I want Dan I want to go home Deirdre cried passionately I don t want to stay here I don t want to be like you I want want Dan She brushed past missus Cameron and ran out of the house missus Cameron went after her calling her but Deirdre a light flying figure ran on sobbing the trees swallowed her Where s the child Davey asked with the easy superiority of his extra years when he came down from the stables and found his mother standing at the gate looking down the track Deirdre and he had just come by She s gone Davey missus Cameron cried distressfully Gone where Home She went down the track he asked missus Cameron nodded tears of disappointment in her eyes She had been looking forward to having a little girl to teach and look after as though she were her own Davey set off at a run It was nearly an hour later that he returned a kicking struggling scratching little creature in his arms He released his hold of her as he entered the kitchen threw her from him and slammed the door behind him There scratch cat he cried fiercely Next time you try to run away remember what the Schoolmaster said If you love me Deirdre you ll be good to missus Cameron and do what she wants you to Deirdre had dropped to the floor and was crying wildly furiously Davey stared at her If you don t stop that howling and yelling at once I ll ride over and tell him how you re behaving he said And then what ll he say Deirdre s sobbing subsided There was a heavy step outside Donald Cameron opened the kitchen door What s this he asked looking down on the huddled heap on the floor that was Deirdre He glanced questioningly from his wife to Davey It s the Schoolmaster s little girl missus Cameron explained She s never been away from him before and Well we can t have this noise in the place he said irritably Deirdre had looked up at the sound of that harsh voice The sight of Davey s father quelled her Take her away and see that she gets ready for tea Davey missus Cameron said anxiously Although Deirdre made no more noise she sat shivering and quivering all the evening her eyes vacant of all but an inexpressible misery her thin little body shaken by long gasping breaths missus Cameron tried to comfort and console her talking to her gently and lovingly as she put her to bed but the child s mind was adamant I want Dan I want Dan she sobbed And in the morning when missus Cameron went into her room the window was open and the little white bed empty CHAPTER XI At school next morning Jessie Ross ran up to Davey her fair plaits flying I m to go home with you after school Davey Cameron she cried eagerly My mother wants your mother to give her the recipe for making cough mixture out of gum leaves All right said Davey It was a very dismal morning in the school room The Schoolmaster s face was dark with displeasure and it was a very sullen drooping Deirdre who took her seat beside Davey After school I m going to drive over to see your mother Davey mister Farrel said I must ask her pardon for what happened last night I am grieved and ashamed beyond measure that Deirdre His look of reproach went into Deirdre s heart With a wailing cry she burst into tears again Davey after his first glance at her kept his eyes on his book he tried not to see her or hear her sobbing beside him His heart was hot against mister Farrel For after all it was because she loved the Schoolmaster so much and could not bear to be separated from him that Deirdre was crying like this he told himself It was hard that mister Farrel should be angry with her as well as everybody else when she had made everybody angry with her on his account But the sight of Deirdre s grief was more than the Schoolmaster could bear either He lifted her out of her seat and carried her off to the far end of the room He sat there with her on his knee talking to her for awhile Once Davey glanced in their direction but he looked away quickly He had seen tears on the Schoolmaster s lean swarthy cheeks and Deirdre s face lifted to his with a penitent radiance and tear wet eyes shining The joy of being folded into his love again had banished the desolation and bleak misery from her face When school was out Jess clambered into the spring cart Davey had come to school in that day and perched herself on the high seat The Schoolmaster and Deirdre followed them along the road a little later Lass went without any flicking with a switch or mirthful goading of hard young heels that afternoon Davey brooded over the tragedy of Deirdre s having to become domesticated and of her love for her father that made it unendurable for her to be away from him even for a night Since he had forgiven her and they had come to an understanding she had eyes for nobody else Her eyes had followed him all the afternoon still swimming with tears an adoring light in them Davey s young male instinct was piqued He had had no existence for her yet he had always been her play mate and felt for her more than anybody else even the Schoolmaster he was sure Jess jolted up and down contentedly on the seat beside him The ends of her little fair pig tails flipped his arm She chatted gaily I like you better than any of the other boys at school Davey she said with innocent candour I think you re the nicest boy and I ll marry you when I grow up Mother says you kissed me once when I was quite a little girl And boys only kiss girls who are their sweethearts don t they Davey No I don t know Davey muttered Jessie Ross was a fair tidy looking little girl with home made stockings and black boots on her dangling feet Her round little face never freckled nor got sunburnt though she only wore a hat or bonnet in the summer time Her skin was prettily coloured and her grey blue eyes smiled up at him easily It pleased Davey to think that she thought he was the nicest boy He smiled sheepishly It was good to think that somebody liked him He looked round to see how far behind the Schoolmaster and Deirdre were They were not very far He saw Deirdre leaning happily against her father although in her hand Davey s eyes lighted was the red bundle He clucked and whistled to Lass Gee up Gee up old Lazybones he called cheerily Jess chirruped after him Gee up Gee up old Lazybones You don t like Deirdre better than me do you Davey she asked No said Davey in his newly won good humour and sore at Deirdre s indifference to his attempts to attract her attention all day The Schoolmaster means she s to stay with us anyway he thought Jess sighed Then if you like me you can kiss me again Davey she said Eh Davey looked scared Well then I ll kiss you Jess said gaily and forth with did Davey felt himself grow hot and red Jess laughed delightedly Oh you look so funny Davey she cried Mick doesn t look like that when I kiss him Jess was only a kid Davey told himself and because she had brothers and kissed them thought she could kiss other boys Yet her gay little peck at his cheek had not displeased him He wondered whether Deirdre and the Schoolmaster had seen it Davey got out of the cart to swing open the long gate He left it open for the Schoolmaster missus Cameron came into the yard Jess jumped out of the cart and ran to her Mother says missus Cameron dear she cried would you please give her the recipe for making cough mixture with gum leaves And she sends her love and hopes you are well as she is and our black cow has a calf and I found thirteen eggs in a nest in the creek paddock and Mick killed a snake five foot long under the verandah on Sunday missus Cameron smiled and kissed her Jess snuggled affectionately against her The Schoolmaster s bringing Deirdre Davey said missus Cameron s eyes flew along the track to the other cart that was coming slowly up the hillside Davey took charge of the Schoolmaster s horse missus Cameron and he and the children went indoors I ve come to apologise missus Cameron for Deirdre s rudeness last night the Schoolmaster said gravely It was very good of you to say that you would teach her what I so much want her to know I hope that you will forgive her and His voice trembled Deirdre you ve got something to say to missus Cameron yourself haven t you I m sorry Deirdre cried with a dry breathless gasp Her face had whitened the misery had come into her eyes again They went appealingly to the Schoolmaster and back to missus Cameron s face Will you forgive me and teach me to cook and sew and be a good housewife she sobbed as if she were repeating a lesson Poor child missus Cameron s compassionate gaze turned from Deirdre to the Schoolmaster Do you really think you ought to she asked So help me God ma am he said struggling with his emotion This is the only chance I ve got of making a decent woman of her your influence if you will use it I don t want her to be a hoyden always She must be gentled and tamed and if you will be as good as to help me He stopped abruptly You will forgive me Good day he said and went out of the room Deirdre made a quick passionate gesture after him She did not call him but a sob broke as she stood staring after him She ran into the garden to watch the cart with him in it go down the hillside and slip out of sight among the trees then she threw herself on the grass and sobbed broken heartedly Davey moved to go out to her Leave her alone his mother said gently it s best to let her get over it by herself Davey Jess flew backwards and forwards helping to set the table She delighted in making herself useful Oh missus Cameron what a funny salt cellar she cried We ve got two blue ones and a big new lamp mother got at the Port missus Cameron looked from the tear stained grief torn face of the Schoolmaster s little daughter to the plump rosy cheeked happily smiling child of her nearest and most prosperous neighbour and sighed When the tea was made she and the children sat round the table for their meal Donald Cameron was away and not expected home for a day or two Deirdre tried to eat when she was told to but her lips quivered She choked over the mouthfuls of food she swallowed missus Cameron put her arms round her but Deirdre stiffened against their gentle pressure She would not be comforted Davey stared at her miserably Only Jess chattered on artlessly taking no notice of her eating all her bread and butter and drinking her milk and water saying her grace and asking to be excused from the table when she had finished her meal as though she were demonstrating generally how a nice well mannered child ought to behave She had the other bed in the room in which Deirdre had been put to sleep the night before missus Cameron kissed them both good night Jess responded eagerly to her caress She threw her arms round missus Cameron s neck and rubbed her soft little face against hers purring affectionately I do love you missus Cameron dear she whispered Good night Deirdre submitted to the good night kiss she did not respond to it Of Davey she took no notice when she went to the little room she and Jess were to sleep in Jess held up her face for him to kiss as missus Cameron had done but he turned away brusquely as if he did not see it and she ran off crying gaily Good night Davey Jones And sweet sleep rest your bones Jess undressed methodically As she took off each garment she folded it and laid it neatly on the chair beside her bed When she had on her little night gown of unbleached calico she brushed her hair and plaited it again so that it hung in two braids on either side of her face Then she knelt down by her bedside folded her hands together and prayed aloud She got into bed and looked at Deirdre across the patchwork quilt conscious of having performed her whole duty for the day Aren t you sorry you re such a bad naughty wicked little girl she asked Deirdre s sobs were her only answer God doesn t love you and I don t and missus Cameron and Davey don t love you either Nobody loves bad wicked naughty little girls Jess said solemnly She put her head on the pillow and was sleeping sweetly peacefully in a few minutes Deirdre crept to the open window She gazed out of it at the dark heave of the forest that cut her off from the being she loved and the hut in the clearing behind the school The blue night sky that spread over her was spread over the hut in the clearing and the school too she knew They were not many miles away the hut the clearing and the school From gazing steadily before her and realising that fact she glanced from the window to the ground It was such a little distance Davey going to bed in a loft in the barn saw her standing at the window and watched her a troubled pain at her suffering gripping his heart When she dropped from the window into the garden he was beside her in an instant He caught her sobbing breath as he touched her You re not going home Deirdre he asked Yes she panted her eyes wide and dark with anguish I can t bear it Davey I can t breathe He ll be angry Davey said Yes She cried and sobbed quietly for a moment But I d rather he d be angry than send me away from him It ll be morning soon If you walked you wouldn t be home any earlier than if you waited for us to go to school Davey said with rare subtlety The Schoolmaster won t be angry if you wait till then Deirdre and A brilliant inspiration came to him I ll bring Lass in an hour earlier and we can start then True Davey Her eyes questioned him tragically True as death he said and struck his breast three times She turned to go back to the bedroom I m sorry that sorry Deirdre he cried fumbling for words and unable to express his sympathy She did not turn or look back at him as she clambered in the window but her face in the morning showed that she understood his championship She turned to him eagerly when she saw him at breakfast a subdued gratitude in her eyes Davey thought that she had at last recognised in him a friend to whom she could turn when everybody s hand was against her CHAPTER XII For months Davey and Deirdre went together along the winding tracks from the school to Cameron s and from Cameron s to school sometimes in the spring cart but more often on Lass s broad back Deirdre had to hang on to Davey when the old horse took it into her head to step out jauntily but for the most part they rode her lightly enough Davey with one hand on her mane and Deirdre swinging behind him Sometimes Davey dug his heels into her fat sides and put her at a trot that set them bumping up and down like peas in a box and laughing till the hills echoed And sometimes in the middle of the fun they found themselves shot on the roadside as Lass shied and propped pretending to be startled by a wallaby or a dead tree These comfortable middle aged shies and proppings were regarded as her little joke her way of indicating that she did not like being dug in the sides They shrieked with laughter as she stood blinking at them her white lashed eyes on which a chalky whiteness was growing bland and innocent As if she were so surprised and hadn t done it all of a purpose they explained to each other Deirdre quickly outgrew the dresses that missus Cameron had first made for her The Schoolmaster thought that Davey was growing too Although Lass was up to the weight of the two and they ran beside her up the hillsides as often as not and rode her only one at a time as they grew older with keen eyes for a fair thing where a horse was concerned the Schoolmaster bought a little wilding of a white stockinged chestnut for Deirdre to ride A stockman had traded the colt for a bottle of rum when his mare foaled at Steve s She was a fine animal with a strain of Arab in her and when the Schoolmaster had mouthed and gentled White Socks as Deirdre christened the colt she straddled him bareback and Davey had his old Lass to himself There was nothing for him to do but watch Deirdre as she went off down the track clinging lightly to the little horse whose legs spread out like the wings of a bird Davey s heart sickened with envy every time Deirdre dashed past him He urged Lass to the limit of her heavy clompering gait but even then she did not keep the chestnut in sight and all but broke a blood vessel in the attempt When Davey came up to her Deirdre was invariably twisted round waiting for him brilliant eyed a wind whipped colour in her cheeks and her hair flying about her You ll break your neck some day riding like that he told her sombrely But he was eating his heart out at not having a horse to put against hers at not being able to send flying the pebbles on the hill tracks as she did He had asked his father over and over again for a horse of his own but Donald Cameron would not give him one No my lad he said shrewdly I m not going to have you racing horses of mine on these roads with the Schoolmaster s girl breaking their knees and windin them I haven t money to throw away if the Schoolmaster has By and by when you re working with me you ll have a good steady going stock horse of y re own maybe Davey s school days were numbered missus Cameron knew He was shooting up into a long straggling youth His father was talking of breaking him into the work of the place and Davey was beginning to be restive at school wanting to do man s work and get a horse of his own Deirdre learnt womanly ways about a house quickly enough when she had made up her mind to Although since the new order of things at Ayrmuir missus Cameron had Jenny a big raw boned brown eyed girl from the Wirree to help her and the family had meals in the parlour and sat on the best shiny black horse hair furniture every day Deirdre made beds dusted and swept with missus Cameron She fed the fowls and learnt to cook and sew Davey had seen her churning sleeves rolled up from her long thin arms he had watched her and his mother working up shapeless masses of butter in the cool dark of the dairy When they washed clothes in tubs on the hillside he carried buckets of water for them and had helped to hang the clean heavy wet things on lines between the trees or to spread them on the grass to sun bleach missus Cameron had taught Deirdre to knit and when her husband was not at home had even taken her spinning wheel from under its covers set it up in the garden and showed her how to use it She had sat quite a long time at it spinning and delighting in its old friendly purr and clatter At such times she would sing softly to herself Davey and Deirdre crouched on the grass beside her and when they begged for them she would tell some of the fairy tales they loved to hear missus Cameron scarcely ever saw the Schoolmaster and it was rarely then that she spoke to him Sometimes she discovered him in the background of a gathering of hill folk who met in the school room on Sundays for hymns prayers and a reading of the Scriptures and sometimes she heard him singing in the distance as he rode along the hill roads Deirdre had sensed a reserve in missus Cameron s manner and attitude towards her father and could not forgive her for it though she had a shy half grateful affection for her Davey was not sure that he liked the Deirdre who had learnt to brush her hair and wear woman s clothes as well as the old Deirdre There was something more subdued about her her laughter was rarer though it had still the catch and ripple of a wild bird s song She was not quite tamed however for all that she did deftly and quickly though it was done had a certain wild grace It was one evening when she was knitting making a pair of socks for the Schoolmaster and muttering to herself Knit one slip one knit one two together slip one that he realised Deirdre was going a woman s way and that he had to go a man s It ll be moonlight early to night and there ll be dozens of possums in the white gums near the creek Deirdre he said coming to her eagerly The proposition of a possum hunt had always been irresistible Deirdre had loved to crouch in the bushes with him on moonlight nights and watch the little creatures at play on the high branches of trees near the edge of the clearing They had flung knobby pieces of wood at them or catapulted them and were rejoiced beyond measure when a shot told there was a startled scream among the possums and a little grey body tumbled from a bough in the moonlight to the dark earth But this night Deirdre shook her head and went on with her murmuring of Knit one slip one knit one two together slip one No I can t go possuming to night Davey she said I want to finish turning this heel CHAPTER XIII The summer of Davey s first year s work with his father was the driest the early settlers had known in the South A breathless insistent heat brooded over the hills their narrow valleys and the long bare Wirree plains The grass stood stiff and straw like by the roads and in the cleared paddocks rustling when anything moved in it Hordes of straw coloured grasshoppers lay in it whistling and whispering huskily or rose with whirring wings when anything disturbed them The skies faded to grey gave no promise of rain and when the sun set it left a dull angry flush the colour of a black snake s belly behind the hills The lesser mountain streams dried up The creek that ran through Cameron s paddocks became a mere trickle There was only one deep pool left of it In that only enough water remained to keep the household going for a month when Donald Cameron mustered and he Davey and the stockmen drove the cattle to the Clearwater River ten miles away to the south west It was still in good condition and Cameron held three hundred acres of the river frontage there He was better off than most of the hill folk who after driving their cattle a dozen miles or so for water had to pay high prices for paddocks to run them in Every man of Cameron s was away at the Clearwater and missus Cameron and Jenny alone at the homestead the afternoon that Deirdre came riding up out of the misty depths of the trees For days a heavy yellowish grey haze had covered the hills missus Cameron could not from her doorway see the slopes of the ranges behind the house The mist hung like a pall over the trees seeming to stifle the wild life of them Not a twitter of birds was heard Parroquets breaking the dun coloured mist with the scarlet and blue and green of their wings and breasts dashed over the clearing chattering hoarsely Now and then they rose from the orchard with shrill screams as Jenny drove them away from the few shrivelled plums left on the trees by flapping a dish cloth at them The air was full of the smell of burning The fires have been bad on the other side of the ranges Deirdre told missus Cameron as she came into the yard and slipped her bridle from Socks neck Father is taking our poddies and cows and Steve s to the Clearwater Yes missus Cameron said some men on the roads told us a few days ago that we d better get our beasts out of the back paddocks in case the fires come this way Deirdre caught Socks by his forelock but instead of turning him into the paddock behind the stables as she ordinarily did she led him into one of the fern spread earthern floored stalls and slammed the door on him A man at Steve s this morning said some of the people on the other side ve been burnt out she said The fires swept over the bush as if it were a grass paddock Martin s at Dale is burnt down and he said that some of the children going home from the Dale school were burnt to death missus Cameron exclaimed distressfully The fires came up so quickly they couldn t get home before them Deirdre continued And when they turned to go back the flames were all round Father sent me up Davey and mister Cameron being away he thought you mightn t know If the fires are at Dale There was a flicker of anxiety in missus Cameron s eyes They ve travelled over forty miles already Deirdre said And father says if the wind changes we ll get them up here for sure They may sweep right on as it is and miss us But he said it would be madness to try to fight them with only the three of us and if they do come this way to get down to the pool at once He said he d try to get here if the wind changes Once or twice there had been scrub fires in the summer and missus Cameron with everybody else on the place had helped to beat out the quickly running forked flames which tried to make their way across the paddocks of the clearing to the house and sheds She had carried water for the men beating when there was water to spare and they had dipped their bags and branches of green gum leaves into the water and slashed at the flames in the grass There are beaters and bags by the barn she said I cut the beaters after Davey and his father had gone thinking we might want them She meant to make a fight for her home if the fires came that way Deirdre realised The afternoon wore away slowly missus Cameron had few treasures but she made a bundle of them a Bible some of Davey s baby clothes an old fashioned gold rimmed brooch with a mosaic on black stone that Donald Cameron had given her and desired her to wear with the black silk dress he had insisted on her having and appearing in occasionally when people began to call him the Laird of Ayrmuir The dress was more an object of veneration than anything else but she wrapped it and the ribband and the piece of lace that she wore with it into the bundle and put them with her spinning wheel and a pair of blue vases that had been her first parlour ornaments on the back verandah where they would be easy to get if the fires threatened the house Deirdre moved restlessly about out of doors watching the haze on every side of the clearing for any sign of a break in it Are there any animals on the place missus Cameron she asked late in the afternoon Only a couple of cows and Lass missus Cameron replied They re in the top paddock I ll run them down Deirdre said Straddling Socks and calling to the toothless old cattle dog who lay dozing on his paws before the kitchen door she went to the hill top and brought down the cows and Lass a few minutes later Keep em there Jock she said and left the old dog shepherding them in the yard behind the barns While she was away missus Cameron and Jenny had bundled half a dozen hens and a game rooster into a big wicker crate Just before sunset they went to the hill top together missus Cameron and Deirdre and Jenny buzzing before them Not a puff of air stirred the tawny curtain that obscured the hills At a little distance the trees stood motionless The light leaves of the young gum saplings hung down pointed with a stillness that had tragedy in it Faint and far away in the silence though was a rushing murmur The smell of burning that had been in the air for days came with a harsher tang Darkness was making way against the smoke haze Neither Deirdre nor missus Cameron spoke staring into it A flock of parroquets flew out of the haze and scattered across the clearing with shrill startled screams A little brown feathered bird dropped into the grass Deirdre picked it up Its wings are singed she said quickly and they re quite hot still It can t have flown far Tense and alert she threw back her head A puff of wind feather light almost imperceptible touched her face It s coming from the west she breathed Will you take the animals to the pool Deirdre missus Cameron said sharply Jock ll keep them there Jenny you bring the beaters up here I ll stay and watch to see if the fire breaks If the wind s from the west it ll strike us first here CHAPTER XIV When Deirdre returned from the pool where she had left Lass the crate of fowls and the cows with the old dog standing guard over them missus Cameron was already beating an arrow of flame that had struck the paddock on the hill top and Jenny on the other edge of the fences was also beating Darkness had fallen The glare of the fire was visible above the thick standing wall of haze Deirdre saw a glittering line break through the grass at a little distance from missus Cameron and seizing one of the green branches Jenny had thrown down in the centre of the paddock beat the fire until it went out Other threads of fire appeared near her and she followed them along the fence slashing with the branch until they died down leaving blackened earth and breaths of virulent blue smoke Stay near the top of the hill Deirdre missus Cameron called and watch to see if there s a break on the front clearing or the pool side or near the sheds Then the fire began to show in a dozen places at once wriggling lizard like through the dry palely gleaming grass Beating became automatic an unflagging lashing and thrashing and watch had to be kept that the enemy was not attacking in another part of the clearing The blackened earth smoked under a dead flame one moment the next a spark kindled and wispish fire was running through the grass again Far down the hillside through the smoke mists to Deirdre on the top missus Cameron and Jenny looked wraith like in their white cotton dresses The fire in the trees of which these swift silent runners in the grass were fore warners was still some distance off But they could hear the crash of falling trees the rush and roar of the flames in the tangled leafage shrill cries of the wild creatures of the bush the blare and bellowing screams of cattle missus Cameron s light skirt caught fire Jenny beat it out with her hands She and missus Cameron fell back a moment The glare lighted the whole of the clearing In the valley flashing shafts of flame could be seen They leapt athwart clouds of smoke which drove billowing across the sky sprayed by showers of sparks missus Cameron Deirdre screamed warningly as a fire maddened steer leapt into the paddock and careered across it into the darkness on the other side The heat was suffocating The heavy acrid smoke in their lungs made their heads reel Deirdre was fighting a brilliant patch of flames half way across the paddock when missus Cameron called to her It s no good child she said Her face was dim with smoke her hands burnt and blackened It s no good trying to do any more we must go now They ran from the hill top to the house missus Cameron caught up her bundle Jenny the blue vases and the spinning wheel and Deirdre taking Socks from the stable in which he was beginning to whinny with fear led him down the track in front of the house They were half way across the clearing when missus Cameron came to a standstill Flames had eaten their way up the paddock and lay across the track We re cut off she said What can we do Deirdre asked There s no time to lose Jenny screamed dancing up and down beside herself with terror and excitement We re cut off Cut off She dropped one of the vases she was carrying and it broke in a thousand pieces I don t know missus Cameron said slowly Her eyes wandered to the broken pieces of the vase For a moment Deirdre s brain was paralysed too She stood staring down the track All the terrible stories of the fires of people who had been burnt to death flashed into her mind A shout was raised behind them It s father she cried The Schoolmaster dashed round the corner of the house His face was blackened and had angry weals where the fire had lashed it His eyebrows and beard were singed close to his head At a glance he took in the situation His horse with head hung was blowing like a bellows Davey s just behind me he gasped looking at missus Cameron mister Cameron and he didn t know the fires were making this way till I told them then he sent Davey I came to give him a hand Never thought we d get here miles of fire across the road Get a couple of blankets Deirdre and we ll make a dash for the creek Deirdre ran back to the house tore the blankets from the beds inside and threw them on to the verandah He dipped three of them in a bucket of water that stood by the kitchen door wrapped her in one and missus Cameron and Jenny in the others Davey swung into the yard on an all but spent horse Keep her going Davey the Schoolmaster cried and get down to the water I ll look after your mother Deirdre you take Jenny up behind you Fly along and let down the slip panel Socks ll stand the grass fire if you keep him at it Davey and Deirdre dashed across the smouldering and smoking paddock putting their horses blindly towards the corner of the fence where the slip rails were already down Trees on the edge of the clearing behind the house were already roaring wrapped in the smoke and flaming mantle of the fire A shower of sparks thrown up by a falling tree scattered over the stable and barns A hoarse yelping the cackling of fowls and the wild terrified lowing of the cows came from the pool Davey rode into it hustled the cows into the centre and took the old sheep dog up on his saddle Socks with Deirdre and Jenny on his back splashed in after him The Schoolmaster and missus Cameron followed a few moments later He had caught up her spinning wheel and she was clutching her bundle and the other blue vase CHAPTER XV The fire did not reach the trees above the pool till it had swept the orchards sheds and house on the brow of the hill missus Cameron watched it devouring them Every line of the sheds and barns the eaves and corners of the home that Donald and she had made was struck against the glare The stables fell with a crash Flames went up from the new weatherboard corner of the house It s like watching someone you love die slowly she cried A breath of wind brought a shower of blackened and burning leaves By a flank movement the fire was sweeping towards them The wind springing up gave it zest it sprang in long brilliant leaps over the quivering tops of the trees Davey and the Schoolmaster dropped from their horses missus Cameron Deirdre and Jenny crouched in the water till the fury of the flames had passed over their heads Davey had his hands full to keep the cows from breaking away mad with terror Socks the most restive and mettlesome of the horses started and whinnied as burning leaves struck him Deirdre threw her wet blanket over him and cowered next to him under it murmuring soothingly There now Steady old boy Steady my pretty The Schoolmaster held his own horse and Lass startled out of her peaceful phlegm by the terrifying roar and heat Even when the flames had raced on over the tree tops it was not safe to leave the pool The men and women in it stood in water to their waists for hours a red haze enveloping them The blankets dried in a few minutes The bush behind them through which the fire had passed showed trees stripped of their greenery and outlined with glowing embers Some of the dead trees beside the pool burned dully and fluttering red and blackened leaves drifted from the saplings Once Jenny had to dip to her neck as a spark of fire caught her dress Look out missus Cameron Deirdre cried sharply hearing a crack and seeing a glowing bough waver over Davey s mother The Schoolmaster brushed missus Cameron aside and the bough struck his face Deirdre uttered a low cry Davey too had seen the Schoolmaster s movement Are you hurt mister Farrel he asked anxiously No it isn t anything at all the Schoolmaster replied brusquely with a half laugh missus Cameron herself did not realise what had happened To the glare of the fire and the hot red mists a few hours before dawn succeeded a heavy darkness lit only by the columns of dead trees burning to ember The night seemed endless When the first wavering gleam came in the eastern sky it revealed the blackened fringe of the trees their green waving draperies scorched and fire eaten where the fire like a ravening monster had half consumed them and passed on The wind had swept the haze and the smoke before it The bosom of the earth lay bare of the light dry wanly golden grass that had covered it and from the paddocks and blackened forest thin spirals and breaths of bluish smoke rose and drifted The peaceful space of trees and the summer dried grasses about the Ayrmuir homestead were gone Charred outlines of sheds and what of the house was still left stood on the brow of the hill In the wan light the pool mirrored the desolation and the haggard and weary men and women who stood in it Chilled and cramped from being in the water so long exhausted with the anxieties of the night they ventured warily back to the still hot earth missus Cameron s eyes turned first to her son His face was grimed with smoke and leaf smuts There were angry red flushes on it where scraps of burning foliage had struck him Deirdre s and Jenny s clothes hung to them scorched and dripping there were burnt holes in missus Cameron s own dress Farrel and Davey were drenched to the skin The Schoolmaster had tied a handkerchief over his face covering one eye In the first light of the dawn Deirdre exclaimed when she saw it Father she cried you re hurt I m all right he said irritably She went over to him and lifted the handkerchief His face was curiously wrung with pain and blanched beneath the tan and smoke grime A clammy sweat beaded on his forehead Hold your tongue Deirdre he muttered It s only a bit of a burn missus Cameron was gazing at the ruins of her home What is it she asked hearing his voice low as it as pitched Oh you ve got a bad burn She went towards him distress in her eyes It s nothing at all it doesn t matter He edged away from her so that she should not see When you and Davey are fixed up missus Cameron Deirdre and I must get along and see how Steve and the school fared They found some flour bread and tea in stone jars among the ruins of the kitchen Davey milked the cows missus Cameron and Jenny built a fire in the yard and when they had all breakfasted on the scorched bread and some tea missus Cameron wanted to put flour on the Schoolmaster s burn But he said that it was not worth bothering about and would have nothing done for it CHAPTER XVI For months after the fires every settler in the hills was felling and carting timber New homes were built on the debris of the old Scarcely a house in the district had escaped the hunger of the flames A burnt out family lived in a tent in a lean to of bagging and bark or in what was left of the walls roofs and doors of houses jammed together to form some sort of shelter against the weather Every pair of hands were busy trying to get the new homes up before the autumn rains and money was scarce Most of the settlers had lost cattle and horses as well as their homesteads sheds and crops The wind that had driven the smoke and flames billowing before it brought a downpour which quenched the fire the morning after it had swept the southern slopes of the hills For days it rained steadily Light vertical showers soaked into the blackened earth There was every prospect of a good season to make up for the damage done by the fires Rain on fired earth makes for fertility good grain fat stock and an abundant harvest The settlers worked like beavers to be ready for it the prospect of a good season heartening their labours and leavening their disappointment at having again to do all the building and fencing that had been done only a few years before The only places in the district that remained a charred monument to the fires were the school and the school master s cottage The Schoolmaster and Deirdre were living at Steve s again By a miracle the shanty had escaped the fires it remained standing when scarcely another house in the countryside did Steve and two teamsters who had been hung up on the roads had spent the night watching that flying sparks did not catch its splintery grey shingles A corrugated iron roof had saved it they said although there was a good clearing on either side of the shanty For the first few days after the fires while the rain lasted Steve s had been stretched to the limit of its capacity to shelter homeless men women and children The men camped as best they might in the bar in the kitchen and on the verandahs missus Ross Jess Deirdre and missus Mackay her baby and three small boys slept in one room And when Steve heard that missus Morrison and Kitty who had wrapped themselves in wet blankets and crept into a corrugated iron tank while the fires were raging around them had no shelter but the tank during the rain the Schoolmaster went to bring them into the shanty and Steve and the Ross boys rigged a wind and rain screen of boughs and bagging round the verandah to make another room for them Deirdre took charge of the domestic arrangements though everybody lent a hand Notwithstanding the terrible experiences every member of the house party had passed through there was much more laughing than sighing much more finding of humour in every phase of awkward predicaments than dilating on dangers and difficulties Losses were discussed as the women helped Deirdre to make big savoury stews and put bumper loaves on the ashes of Steve s hearth but it was always with concluding exclamations of gratitude that things were no worse At Dale only a few miles on the other side of the ranges three mothers were weeping for little ones caught in the flames and burnt to death on their way home from school No lives had been lost on the southern slope of the hills All day the men were out riding in the rain trying to get a better idea of the damage done They ran up fences mustered stray cattle and in the evening brought back pitiful accounts of beasts burned to death in the gullies and dry creek beds When they sat with the women round the fire in Steve s kitchen their great green hide boots steaming before it breathless stories of fights with the fires were told Most of the men had been away taking cattle to water when the homesteads were attacked The flames had leapt the crest of the range and circled the clearings with incredible speed The women had to do the best they could to save the children the animals left on the farms and the buildings and many a good fight had been waged before they sought safety themselves It rained steadily for three days then the sunshine gleamed and Steve s house party broke up The men restless and eager to repair the damage that had been done were off at dawn the women and children followed a few hours later in lumbering carts and carry alls Some of them were going to make a lean to of boughs and bagging or of oilskins before night and some were going for stores to the Port or to the new township that was springing up about the Wirree river There was bound to be plenty of work for every pair of hands for months to come While everybody was busy felling fencing splitting and running up new buildings it was rumoured that the Schoolmaster and Deirdre were going to leave the hills CHAPTER XVII Davey had said good bye to the Schoolmaster Well I ll be going now he said moving away clumsily He had said all he could though there was not much of that Most of what he wanted to say remained deep within him He could not dig it up The words to express his feeling would not come He had muttered something about passing that way and having come in to say good bye when he entered the big bare room at Steve s He had not seen Deirdre nor the Schoolmaster since the night of the fires His father had kept him busy and with all the work of the new buildings going up at Ayrmuir there was plenty to do He talked of it for a while in a strained uninterested fashion Deirdre told me mother put up a great fight for the house he said but of course the old man doesn t give her credit for that thinks he could have saved it if he had been on the spot in time I wish he had been there I d like to ve seen if he could ve beaten a fire with that wind against him I might ve been with mother a bit earlier and been able to help her if I d had a decent nag and that s what I told him but I m not likely to get one The expense of the new buildings has got him down and he s mad because Nat left a couple of hundred yearlings in one of the back paddocks We ran in about a hundred of em last week found some burnt to cinders the others ve got away Awkwardly uncertainly he shifted his feet He did not want to go to say the final words and yet he did not know how to stay Farrel understood that and kept him talking longer He was still wearing a bandage over his left eye Your eye s all right isn t it Davey asked It isn t seriously hurt Mother was asking me the other day if it was better She doesn t know how it happened mister Farrel How what happened Farrel asked A spasm of pain twitched his lean sunburnt features He was sitting with his back to the light on a low bench under the window How you got that burn about your eyes said Davey But I saw If you hadn t tried to prevent the branch falling on mother the way she was standing it would have come down on her face It might have fallen on any of us The Schoolmaster spoke sharply I hope you re not going to have any trouble with it Davey said No of course not Dan rose from his seat under the window You ll be wanting to say good bye to Deirdre too won t you Davey He went across to the door and called into the next room Davey s going Deirdre But though a muffled sound of someone moving came from it there was no answer He called again but still there was no reply She must have gone to bring in the cows for Steve the Schoolmaster said Never mind I ll tell her you left a message for her Yes said the boy folding and re folding his hat But it did not seem the same thing as seeing Deirdre and saying good bye to her himself Mind if there s any books you re wanting or any way I can help you if you want to study more you can always let me know and I ll be glad to do anything I can for you the Schoolmaster said Steve will pass a letter on to me I don t know where we ll settle at first or just what we re going to do but he ll generally know our whereabouts And there s one other thing I d like to say Davey you can always be sure of a friend in the world If you get into a scrape or any sort of trouble will you remember that They gripped hands Thank you mister Farrel Davey muttered But I wish you weren t going he added desperately I wish we weren t too Farrel said with a sigh but then you see people don t want to build the school again They don t think there s the same need for one now Most of the girls I ve been teaching for the last few years can teach the children coming on well enough And besides there s talk of Government schools being set up everywhere Yes Davey s countenance was one of settled gloom Good bye The Schoolmaster wrung his hand Davey found himself lifting his rein from the docked sapling in the shanty yard Two other horses with reins hung over the post stood before Steve s bar a couple of cattle dogs lay at their heels nosing the dust The fowls scratching in the stable yard spread their wings and cackled as he turned out of the yard to the road So long Davey the Schoolmaster called from the verandah S long Davey replied The loose gravel rolled under his mare s feet as she slipped and slid down the hill the reins hanging loose on her neck He looked straight before him trying to understand the state of his mind He had not expected to be so disturbed at taking leave of the Schoolmaster Then he remembered that he had not seen Deirdre to say good bye to her he thought For the first time he realised that she was going away going out of his life Perhaps that realisation had been at the bottom of his thought all the time but it struck him suddenly viciously now He was looking into the distance dazed by the tumult within him when a blithe voice called him and glancing up he saw Deirdre standing on the bank by the roadside There you are Davey she cried Going away without saying a word to me I d a good mind to let you go She was breathless with running across the paddocks to reach the turn in the road The wind had blown her dark hair into little tendrils about her face and there was a sparkle of anger in her eyes I heard what you said to father she went on and if you haven t anything better to say to me I ll go back Davey gazed at her He gazed as though he had never seen her before She seemed another creature nothing like the ragged little urchin who had climbed trees with him and ridden to school straddle legged behind him nothing like the sedate housewife his mother had made of her either Deirdre stared at him too as though he were quite different from the Davey she had known A shy smile quivered on her lips She plucked nervously at trails of the scarlet runners which overhung the bank and put the end of a runner between her teeth and chewed the stalk Davey saw that her lips were as scarlet as the flowers that like broken winged butterflies hung at the end of the trail He slid off his horse and stood facing her His limbs were trembling What s the matter she asked a little distress creeping into her voice Davey s face was tense and colourless To the trouble which had surprised him that day a strange soft thrill was added when she put the runner stalk with its scarlet flowers between her teeth It struck him with a strange pang that Deirdre was beautiful that her lips were the same colour as the flowers hanging near them It was all translated this emotion of his in the shamed shy smile that came into his face as he stared at her Deirdre understood well enough She scrambled down the bank and went to him You are sorry we re going aren t you Davey she asked He nodded finding he could not speak The gloom of the forest was closing round them the sunset dying She sighed and slipped her hand into his After a few moments as he said nothing she spoke again It ll be all changed I suppose when father and I come back she said We will come back by and by sometime you know father says We ll come to see Steve perhaps But we ll be grown up quite you and I Davey You ll be married and I What Davey had wakened I was saying we ll be grown up and married perhaps by the time we see each other again Deirdre murmured None of the times ll come again like the ones when we went home on Lass or in the spring cart or walked and chased wallies and went after birds nests I wish they could I wish I could be just ten when I come back and give you a race down the road Davey Her voice ran on quickly but Davey s mind stuck on her first words There s only one girl I ll be married to he said Yes Her eyes leapt to his Jess Ross Who says so She does Deirdre laughed She says she s the only girl you ve ever kissed And her mother says When she was a kid they put her face up to me but I never kissed her or any girl Davey said I didn t believe it of course Deirdre laughed softly Why Well I thought if there was any girl you d be wanting to kiss it would be me Davey The bright shy glance that flew towards him and the quiver of her lips fired the boy His arms went out to her He caught her shoulder and held her to him For an instant he did not know whether it was night or day But when he withdrew from that moment of unconsciousness wild uncontrollable joy and possession his eyes were humid And her eyes beneath his were like pools in the forest which the fallen leaf mould has darkened and the twilight striking through the trees makes a dim mysterious mirror of Deirdre he whispered as if he had never before said her name and to say it were like singing in church He kissed her again slowly and tenderly the first pressure of her lips had made a man of him You re my sweetheart aren t you Deirdre he said exultingly holding her in his arms and gazing down at her When you come back we ll be married Yes Deirdre whispered Her eyes reflected the glow of her heart I ve always meant to marry you Davey though I ve sometimes pretended I liked Mick Ross or Buddy Morrison better She drew a little sigh But I m so glad it s all settled now and we re really going to marry each other The sunset had died out of the sky and the forest was dark about them when they kissed and whispered good bye for a little while Davey could scarcely say the words He watched Deirdre as she fled up hill to the shanty then leaping on his horse he sent her clattering down hill all his young manhood the tumult of his love awakened senses rejoicing and dreams orchestrating within him CHAPTER XVIII In the earliest days of Port Southern settlers tracking inland or further along the coast had to cross the Wirree driving their cattle and horses before them The shallows of the river where they crossed began to be called the Wirree Ford The tracks converged there and it was not long before a shanty appeared on the left bank a few hundred yards from the broad and slowly moving river The Wirree came down from the hills and flowed across the plains at the foot of the ranges The whole of the flat land it watered was spoken of as the Wirree river district or the Wirree The stream emptied itself into the waters of Bass Straits Opposite was Van Diemen s Land the beautiful green island on which penal settlements had been established Men had been known to escape from it to the mainland They made the dangerous passage of the Straits in open boats and sometimes were picked up in an exhausted condition by a frigate policing the coast or a trader and sent back to Hobart Town or Port Arthur Sometimes their dead bodies were tossed by the sea on the shores they had been trying to reach and sometimes steering by the muddy waters of the river that flowed out from the nearest point opposite the Island bearing silt and drift wood for a couple of miles into the sea they reached the land of promise and freedom As the beaten grass path along the seaboard became the main stock route between Port Southern and Rane a newly founded settlement at the further eastern end of the coast a township of curious mushroom growth cropped up about the Wirree Ford and McNab s shanty It was a collection of huts wattle and dab whitewashed for the most part but some of them were of sun baked sods plastered together or of the stones which were scattered over the plains or filled the creek beds McNab s weatherboard shanty with its sign board of a black bull with red rimmed eyes on a white ground was by far the most pretentious The history of these dwellers about McNab s was a matter of suspicion They arrived from nowhere out of the night silently and it was surmised crept up the river in the cockle shell boats which had brought them over the Straits and were sunk in the slowly moving river when they had served their purpose The fertile flats stretching to the edge of the mountains had been taken up before McNab got his holding on an arm of the Wirree He set about acquiring the selvedge of the plains which was cut off from the finer more arable land by a scrubby line of densely growing ti tree Most of the Wirree Ford men ran cattle on these strips of coarse grassed land thrashed by the sea breezes But they were no sticklers for the niceties of boundaries and property laws They drove their first wild eyed scraggy herds whither they listed a cursing blasphemous crew none dared gainsay them It was reckoned better to have the good will than the enmity of the Wirree river men The body of a settler who had threatened to have the law of them for grazing their beasts on his land was a few days afterwards found in the river drifting with the tide out to sea Some of the Wirree men made a living as fishermen Others maintained themselves by a desultory farming They ploughed the grey land of the seaboard with wooden hand ploughs But many of them thrived on what they could make out of the stockmen and drovers who passed through the township on their way to Rane or to the Port McNab was powerful enough even in those days and many and ingenious were the stories he invented to account for the presence of men who came to the Wirree Ford unexpectedly As the settlement grew it did justice to the rumoured accounts of its origin McNab s was the meeting place of stockmen drovers and teamsters on the southern roads and the carouses held there were night long It was recognised as a hotbed of thieves and ruffians by the roadsters and no man of substance or any pretensions at all would lodge the night in any of the mud built huts within a stone s throw of the river Before long the Wirree men had fat cattle to dispose of An open space between the huts not far from McNab s was used as a sale yard It was then that settlers who wanted good prices for their beasts had to drive them to the Wirree market A better bargain was driven in the Wirree square than anywhere else So Wirree Ford became Wirreeford and thrived and prospered until it was the busiest cattle market in the south To a certain extent its prosperity threw an air of respectability over it At first cattle owners and farmers from the hills entered the township in the morning and left it before the shadows of night fell They did their business and left the Wirree not much better off for their coming venturing into the shanty for a midday meal only and drinking sparingly if at all of the curious dark spirits it vended Then stores were opened There were less fearsome comings and goings missus Mary Ann Hegarty set up a shanty and proceeded to business with an air of great propriety Women and children were brought into the township for the cattle sales Sale days became weekly holidays They meant the donning of festive ribbands by the women and children the climbing into high spring carts and buggies and driving along the winding track from the hills to the township where groceries dress stuffs and household furnishings could be bought and stowed in the back of the carts for the home journey Sale days however still ended in gaming and drinking brawls at the shanties and sometimes in the dropping of a heavy still body into the Wirree when the tides would carry it out to sea It was the disappearance of a young farmer from the West Hills after a night at the Black Bull that made Donald Cameron decide to take action He backed by other farmers and well to do hill settlers made representations to the Port authorities as to the lawless character and conduct of Wirreeford township A trooper who rode into it a few days later was pelted with stones tarred and feathered and sent back to Port Southern Then a building was rim up on the outskirts of the township a ramshackle house built of overlapping smooth pine shingles It was whitewashed so that it stood out on the darkest nights to remind roisterers that law and order were in their midst And as soon as it was finished John M Laughlin a police sergeant from the Port took up his residence in it He mitigated the impression that undue severity would be meted out to evil doers from the new police head quarters by genially brawling with most of his neighbours at McNab s as soon as he arrived very successfully intimating that he was far too long sighted easy going and convivial a soul to interfere with the Wirree s little way of doing things Donald Cameron was well known in Wirreeford when it began to be a cattle market of importance So was Davey Young Davey as he was called when he began to go regularly to the sales in the years that followed the fires Cameron worked all day in the sale yards with his men He drove in his own beasts in the morning threw off his coat for the drafting and when the sales were over went out of the township a stolid stooping figure on his heavy bay cob Although he sometimes made close on a thousand pounds on a day s sales he went out of the township as often as not without spending a penny It was said that he was the wealthiest man in the countryside and as mean as they make em Yet his disinclination to spend money was made subservient to his sense of justice and a spirit of matter of fact integrity that he carried round with him made the Wirree people regard him with suspicious awe The iron quality of his will the hard straight gaze of his eyes were difficult things for men with uneasy consciences to encounter Because he was the first man in the country it was reckoned a matter of prestige to have the patronage of Donald Cameron of Ayrmuir whether for a meal store order or any job whatever In jest half earnest he was called the Laird of Ayrmuir Wirree men said that Thad McNab loathed Donald Cameron as the devil loathes holy water McNab was not the devil in their eyes nor Donald Cameron holy water but the saying perhaps suggested to them the composite forces of the two men Thad with his twisted mind his cruel eyes his treacherous underhand ways stood to them for something in the nature of the power of evil Donald Cameron with his harsh integrity his unbending virtue his parsimony and sober respectability stood for something in the nature of abstract good They had the respect for him that people sometimes have for a standard which has been hung before their eyes and which they have not been able to live up to But Thad was their aider and abettor Thad for all his tyrannies blackmail petulances made life easier for them They stood by him and blessed him cursing Donald Cameron and his sort who would have sent them back to the prison cells and torture of the Island It was not from motives of sheer kindness that McNab stood by them they knew but because it paid him Nevertheless the thing worked out in the same way Donald Cameron was more their enemy than Thad Thad s feud with him amused them as much as a cock fight their money was on their own bird and they barracked for him idly light heartedly scoffing at his enemy Almost every man in the Wirree was in McNab s debt He knew more about their lives and antecedents than was to their soul s comfort They suspected that more than one of the men who had been taken back to the Island had been put away by McNab and that those lean crooked hands of his had fingered Government money rewards for the capture of escaped convicts But so long as they were in with Thad McNab Wirreeford men with pasts that would not bear looking into thought they were all right Although there were rumours of treacherous dealings on his part with child like simplicity with the faith of the desperate they trusted McNab believing that he stood between them and the prisons of Port Arthur They believed that if they were in with Thad they need not wake sweating out of their sleep at the thought of the cat or worry if forgetful of consequences they gave that tell tale start at the clank and rattle of irons It was pretty well understood that Thad McNab and Sergeant M Laughlin worked together Thad had been hand in glove with him since he came to the Wirree River The fact sometimes stood unruly spirits in good stead when there was a merry night at the Black Bull But when there was an inconvenient accident over the cards once or twice and when there was a hold up on the Rane road just outside the township too it was conceded that M Laughlin had earned his screw Thad saw to it that occasionally he made an appearance of doing his duty If it had been imagined at head quarters that Sergeant M Laughlin winked at irregularities in the application of the law at Wirreeford he might have been moved on and that would not have suited the landlord of the Black Bull who would then have had another man to deal with or have found that another man was dealing with him Donald Cameron made no secret of his attitude to McNab After M Laughlin had been several months in the township and there was no outward or visible sight of his having mended its ways mister Cameron made representation to the authorities at Port Southern and through them to the powers that had their official residence in Melbourne in respect to Thadeus McNab s position and breaches of the law in Wirreeford He was clear in his own mind that there was a case against McNab first for harbouring convicts escaped from Van Diemen s Land and secondly for being the possessor of a still and for turning it to account in sly grog making John Ross Mathew Morrison and the rest of the hill folk and settlers at the farther end of the plains upheld him in this effort to rid the district of McNab but although an inquiry was made nothing came of it Donald Cameron gained no extra popularity in the Wirree on the first of his counts Thad s position was if anything strengthened by Cameron s hostility Every man in the township knew that he had to stand by McNab or McNab would not stand by him therefore when an officer from the Port came to investigate conditions in Wirreeford he found nothing to take exception to He reported that the local police officer was efficient and that complaints of the hill settlers were due to a personal rancour existing between Donald Cameron and the landlord of the Black Bull Thad flourished like a green bay tree after this failure to move him and forged the weapon of a very serviceable hate against Donald Cameron He kept it very carefully scabbarded but occasionally it leapt forth and its mettle was visible to all and sundry Ordinarily Thad kept a locked brain it was only in rare transports of rage that he revealed anything of its crooked workings And then those who saw them looked to their own behaviour and were careful to do nothing that would bring them into its toils Probably nobody but Cameron himself thought McNab had swallowed that little business of the inquiry when a few months later he was fawning round him telling him that dinners were to be served at the Bull on sale days and that his patronage would be an esteemed favour Those who heard him say Things has not been as they might have been always at the Black Bull mister Cameron you have had reason to complain in the past but everything is goin to be different for the future could not believe their ears It was very humbly with a flattering deference that McNab had asked the laird to help him to improve the tone of the place by occasionally having a meal in it Donald Cameron had been in the habit of taking his meat pasty or bread and cheese sandwich to the sale yards in his pocket He ate his lunch there at midday when most of the men made tracks for the bar opposite But after a while he took his meals at the Black Bull lowering not a whit of his dignity in the doing of it and treating McNab as curtly in his own establishment as he did anywhere else When he was down with rheumatics in the early spring the place had open doors to Davey He was served like a duke in it Young Davey promised to be a chip of the old block the Wirree said He worked as insatiably as the old man and was no more than a roadmender by the look of him His grey trousers had many a patch on them and his hat was as weathered a bit of felt as was seen in the yards He walked with the slouch of the cattle men men who have spent most of their days in the saddle When he flung off his hat it was seen he was good looking enough with an air of breed about him a something the Wirree did not quite get There was a great deal of his mother in the cast of his features and his eyes were grey and green like hers but his mouth was Donald Cameron s set in a boy s face Davey was a shy awkward fellow and spoke as little as the old man though it was acknowledged that if his hand was as rarely in his breeches pockets as his father s it was because there was nothing in them It was well known that Donald Cameron worked his son like a convict and kept him on short commons giving him neither wages nor pocket money so that he blushed when a down and out blackguard asked him for the price of drink and he had not got it to give He fed with the old man this young Davey Cameron and was never seen in the bars Few of the men who entered the shanties could say that they had had much to do with Cameron and his son except John Ross and the Morrison boys who occasionally dropped into McNab s But they were of the same sort hardworking thrifty God fearing respectable homely people of the hills who despised the Wirree River township its antecedents descendants and associations and did business with it only because business was better done there than anywhere else The Schoolmaster and Deirdre had been gone from the hills for over a year when Wirreeford began to make concessions for the sake of the younger generation Although cards were shuffled and dice were thrown at the Black Bull when the rush lights flickered in the windows after the sales and the little fires of cow dung lighted before the doors of the houses to keep away the sandflies and mosquitoes glowed in the dusk sending up faint wreaths of blue smoke missus Mary Ann Hegarty threw open her parlour and there was dancing in it until the small hours The hill people lent the countenance of their presence to days of out door sports and to the dancing at missus Hegarty s on Christmas and New Year s day The Ross boys danced with bright eyed Wirree girls Morrison s Kitty and some of the other girls from the hills learnt the reels and jigs that their parents had danced in the country beyond the seas they were always talking of The old people danced too There were nights of wholesome heart warming merriment and the singing of old songs Only Donald Cameron and his wife held aloof from these festivities But before long it was observed that Young Davey was going to the monthly dancing with the Rosses He rode down from the hills with the boys and Jess They made the Wirree streets ring as they galloped to Hegarty s and their laughter streeled out on the wind behind them as they went home in the early hours of the morning when even the roisterers at the Black Bull had fallen asleep in uneasy attitudes about its verandahs CHAPTER XIX It was not every day there was dancing at missus Mary Ann s only on Fridays after the cattle sales And it was not every Friday that Pat Glynn could be got for the music He wandered all over the country putting the devil into folks heels He was in the Port one day in Wirreeford the next then on to Rane or off wandering somewhere over the ranges Whenever word went round that Pat was coming the couples gathered from every direction Whether they danced on a wooden floor or on the grass was a matter of little importance There was always a merry time when Pat Glynn put up anywhere for the night He came trotting into Wirreeford on the day of the early November sales about two years after Deirdre and the Schoolmaster had left the hills The township was full of dust cattle and dogs boys yelling drafting and beating beasts from one yard to another men watching them drovers lean sun dried hawk eyed men cattle buyers cattle owners and auctioneers Horses were hanging on loose reins about the sale yards or in rows with drooping heads along the hitching posts at the Black Bull and missus Hegarty s Two or three heavy family carry alls were drawn up before the store where the women with children about them were shopping buying lengths of calico dress stuffs or groceries and ironmongery to take home to the hills Word that Pat Glynn was at Hegarty s went round like wildfire So at missus Mary Ann s it was that all the miscellaneous crowd of the sale yards foregathered They danced until the blood boiled under weather beaten leathern faces and the rising sweat left furrows in the dust of the road on them Matted lank sun bleached hair lay in wet streaky locks on foreheads marked with the line of hats that almost grew on them the line beyond which the sunburn never travelled Men women boys and girls of all ages children grandfathers and grandmothers Pat danced them all to a state of breathless exhaustion As he tucked his fiddle under his chin and raked it with his long bow his eyes gleamed with mischief and merriment His arm went backwards and forwards so dexterously with such agility that the gay airs he played possessed him as well as everyone who heard them Old men and women left their benches by the wall and skipped and trundled until the pine floor shook The only people who were not dancing were a young mother with a baby in her arms and a teamster too drunk to do more than hang by the doorpost He attempted a few wild and hilarious movements fell headlong and was dragged feet foremost to the door and thrown out because he cumbered the floor The young mother joggled her baby and sang softly in tune to Pat s music enfolding the assembled company and Pat himself in her beaming smile It was incense to Pat s soul to see everybody within earshot moving The clatter rhythmic lift shuffle and thump of heavily shod feet was as good to his ears as any of the old airs he played His arm flying quicker and quicker sent old and young along with the strain of his music like corks on a stream Heads bobbed feet stamped busily A catch of laughter flew out The elderly stout mother of a family called breathlessly Stop it Pat Stop it ye villain But Pat only laughed and his fiddle arm flew faster till the dancers dropped exhausted against the wall or hung there gasping with a stitch in their sides When he had tired them all out he lifted his bow with a flourish and a shout of laughter The two that kept the floor longer than most others were Jess Ross s Jess as she was called and young Davey Cameron They were reckoned a fine pair of dancers Pat had great pride in them When everybody else had left the floor he made the pace faster and faster for them till they whirled to a finish watched and cheered by the crowd against the walls Off scourings and derelicts of the Wirree whom missus Hegarty would not have to dance in her parlour had to amuse themselves by looking in the doorway or by jigging as best they might out of doors under the star strewn sky It was that night of the November sales when Pat was at Hegarty s that the Schoolmaster and Deirdre came back to the Wirree They put up at the Black Bull and it was not until the dance was in full swing that they appeared in missus Hegarty s doorway Pat was speeding up a reel his eyes kindling Faith it s a drop of the craythur you want to waken you up Mick Ross he called Catching up the air of his tune he sang gaily and the company joined in breathlessly at the top of its lungs He broke from the song into expostulation and explanation There s the darlin boy Buddy Morrison he cried tears of laughter running down his withered cheeks But he ll break Morrison s daughter s back for her Let you be gentle with the girl Buddy It s a young lady sir not a heifer ye have by the horns It was when Davey and Jess were having their last fling against Pat s music and he scraping for all he was worth to beat them in their whirling and turning that Jess saw a tall dark eyed girl watching them on the outskirts of the people who had just stopped dancing She knew her at once her dark eyes white skin the black hair that swept back from her face It was Deirdre Deirdre grown very tall and lithe and straight backed Deirdre in a dark dress with a necklace of red beads about her neck and a blue ribband round her waist Jess knew what the look in her eyes meant as she watched the dancing she knew and her heart exulted Deirdre would see that Davey and she had become great friends while she was away He had not seen the girl in the doorway He flung Jess backwards and forwards flushed and excited spurred on by the music and the test of keeping step losing no movement of hers to be even with Pat when he drew his last chords Jess flew with him Davey saw no more of her than her sonsy face surrounded with the fair wisps of curls Her grey eyes came to him and her lips parted and smiled as her arms went out to him She stumbled and fell breathlessly at the last he had to hold her to prevent her falling When up at the far end of the room he recovered his breath his eyes were shining His laughter rang out a gay challenge in it How s that for a finish Pat Oh ye re a deevil Davey the old man cried mopping his forehead Jess had put herself before Davey and his view of the door but he had moved to call to the fiddler He saw the group there and stood staring for a moment The colour ebbed from his face He recognised the Schoolmaster though he wore a shade over one eye now but it was the sight of the dark head the turn of a girl s shoulder and back near him that was a shock to Davey The great moment had come Deirdre had returned She stood with her back to the room men and women gathered about her and the Schoolmaster Davey heard her voice ring out The sound of it thrilled him and left him trembling It seemed only yesterday that she had gone and yet it was ages three years They had written once or twice at first but somehow the letters had stopped He had not heard from her for a long time What could he do What a lot there would be to tell her He wanted to show her his new horse a sturdy red bay that he had coveted on sight and had induced his father to buy Would he ever be able to go and speak to her he wondered his legs shook so Would he be able to speak His throat ached Did she know that he Davey her sweetheart was there against the wall so full of love for her that he could not move that he could only gaze at her If only she would come to him If only the whole of missus Mary Ann s room would fall away from them leave them just Deirdre and he together He did not see Jess did not realise that she was watching him with a pain in her eyes at the spell bound wonder and adoration of his It s Deirdre she said as if for her the end of the world had come Yes he breathed He could hear Deirdre laughing and chattering with the men and girls who had been to school with her when she and the Schoolmaster lived in the hills The Schoolmaster had gone out of doors again but where he had been a long black browed drover of Maitland s Conal Fighting Conal was standing leaning against the wall and smiling down on her Beneath the inexplicable exhilaration the tingling thrilling joy which possessed Davey a slow wrath surged at the way Conal looked and smiled at Deirdre and at the way she looked her eyes leaping up to his and smiled at Conal But she was his his sweetheart and had promised to marry him Davey told himself and the resurgent joy at seeing her flooded him Aren t you going to dance Davey Jess asked anxiously when Pat began to fiddle again No he said If you re not going to get up can I have this one with Jess asked Buddy Morrison with restrained eagerness What Davey asked his eyes on Deirdre If you re not getting up can I have this one with Jess repeated Bud Morrison His sun scorched face and ruddy hair was responsible for his youthful appearance although he was older by a couple of years than Davey He was Jess s most humble adorer but his grief was that she would never look at him if Davey was looking at her Oh yes Davey replied He watched Jess and Buddy Morrison go out among the dancers His eyes flew back to where Deirdre had been standing But she was dancing with Conal A lightning tremor of surprise flickered through him he caught his breath That anybody but himself would dance with Deirdre had not occurred to him He made up his mind that he would go to her after the dance What right had Conal to dance with her He was caught in a cloud of troubled thought and dismay Davey watched them dancing this tall slender girl with her hair knotted up on the nape of her neck and the long limbed bearded man who had come to the sales for Sam Maitland He could dance He and Deirdre were dancing as the people in Wirreeford had never seen folk dancing and Conal s dark handsome face was turned down to the girl s It was not the dance he was thinking of but her There was a gleam in his eyes as they covered her every movement was tender of her Jess in a fury of impatience with her partner dragged him off the floor He was heavy and slow on his feet missed the time and muddled his steps In order not to disgrace her own dancing she had to fall back against the wall When Deirdre came away from the dancers with her tall partner Davey went round to where they were standing Once only he had seen her flash a swift glance round the room then her eyes had not rested on him at all but skimmed past him like swallows in flight He thought that she had not recognised him Now that he stood near her his heart throbbed pain fully She laughed and chattered with the people about her Davey caught a word or two of her greetings to old schoolfellows Conal bent over her appropriatingly Deirdre flashed a smile at him as she talked Davey stood on the edge of the crowd A little hurt feeling began to grow in him Would he never catch her eye Would she never look his way Pat was calling for another dance The little crowd shifted and drifted away from Deirdre Mick Ross had the temerity to ask her if she would dance with him Davey heard him and he heard Long Conal drawl lazily in reply The man that dances with Deirdre will have to reck n with me to night Well I m not wanting to reck n with you Conal Mick replied laughing and withdrew to find another partner Davey s eyes sparkled He walked up to where Deirdre stood in the doorway with the drover Will you dance with me Deirdre he said Why she exclaimed blithely much as he had heard her exclaim to a dozen others It s Davey Cameron grown up I d never ve known you Davey but for the scar on your neck where the calf kicked you Do you remember the day we were taking him up to Steve s in the spring cart Davey and I used to have great times at the school she explained with a glance for Conal This is Conal you know Long Conal Davey Fighting Conal they call him don t they she went on with a little mischievous inflection in her voice Yes I know said Davey Will you dance with me Deirdre Few people south of the ranges did not know or had not heard of Fighting Conal of Sally the yellow streak of a cattle dog half dingo that he swore by and of his three parts bred mare Ginger Ginger for pluck Conal said and that was why she got her name Though he had his title to live up to Conal was a prime favourite on the roads It was rumoured that he had another name but nobody ever bothered about it Conal Fighting Conal was a good enough name for any man to go by it was reckoned There was talk under the breath of cattle duffing sometimes when he was mentioned But it was always under the breath for Conal was a man with a fist that could punish any reflections on his character as thoroughly as the fist of a man had ever been known to But he was a lightsome swaggerer a reckless devil me care good natured sort of bully Then if you know said Conal coolly you d better have gone home and to bed young shaver before havin asked Deirdre to dance with you to night I don t like any interference with the partners I choose for meself It was all said with a lazy good natured air Conal was sure of himself He reviewed with faint amusement this youngster who made claims to privileges that he had reserved to himself for the evening Will you dance with me Deirdre Davey asked again His eyes blazed he trembled with anger Well I m Conal straightened and swore amazedly But Deirdre s hand caught his sleeve We re missing all this dance she said quickly As she turned away on his arm her eyes swung round to Davey Go and find Jess she said you looked such a pretty couple dancing together when I came in Her laughter and light hearted little speech stupefied Davey He forgot his anger forgot Conal forgot the roomful of dancers stampeding merrily forgot Pat Glynn and his music He forgot everything but that Deirdre was laughing at him Her words tingled in his ears he had heard her laughter Deirdre his sweetheart was laughing at him Deirdre who had promised He stumbled out of the room CHAPTER XX Davey The Schoolmaster s voice went out with a glad note in it He turned aside from the men who were talking with him outside missus Hegarty s parlour His arm stretched to grip the boy s hand But Davey swung past He did not see or hear He did not even know where he was going He walked through darkness surging darkness though the night was a clear one stars diamond bright on the inky blue screen of the sky The houses of the Wirree were white in the light Deep shadows were cast back from their walls as they squatted against the earth Davey turned the angle of the house into the stable yard Instinct carried him to it and to the fence where his horse was tethered There was a fluttered cackle of fowls a startled yelping of dogs as he threw on his saddle and turned out of the yard taking the road to the hills The men outside Hegarty s smoking and swopping yarns with the Schoolmaster watched him go Sparks of white fire flew from his horse s hoofs as they beat along the road Young Davey s riding as though the devil were at his heels someone remarked through teeth that gripped a pipe Never seen him ride like that before Thad McNab said Farrel did not speak he wondered too what it was had sent the boy out into the night like that Half an hour before he had seen him dancing with Jess Ross and his face had just such a look as his mother s might have had when she was his age and dancing He looked back into the room Jess was sitting a very forlorn dejected little figure on a bench by herself Deirdre was dancing with Conal Instinctively he associated Davey s going with Deirdre They had been such good friends when they were children and he had imagined that they would be so glad to meet each other again He followed Deirdre as she danced with Conal Conal was an old friend of his He had seen a good deal of him since they left the hills and few men had the place in the Schoolmaster s regard and affection that Long Conal had He had been with them on several of their wanderings and Deirdre and he had always seemed to get on like brother and sister together he thought But now he saw the gleam in Conal s eyes as he bent over her the tenderness in his swarthy face Deirdre s smile her swift glances shy and alluring her averted head The way she laughed and moved were a revelation to him So Deirdre s a woman and at woman s tricks he thought She had been a child to him till this night Conal with his sunburnt bearded face his rough hands his eyes bright with love and laughter had made a woman of her he told himself And what had she made of him The Schoolmaster saw his eyes on her neck where the dark curls gathered dewily He knew as much as there was to be known of Long Conal knew that he had flirted and drunk and sworn his way along all the stock routes in the country He had kissed and ridden away times without number But there was something else in his eyes now something that promised he would never want to ride far or long from the sight of Deirdre The Schoolmaster was sure of that For a moment he saw the girl s averted face the curve of her white neck the little tendrils of hair clustering moist and jetty about her ears her scarlet fluttering lips as Conal might have seen them She s a beautiful woman Deirdre An uneasily moving voice jerked suddenly behind him with sly chuckling laughter It was Thad McNab who spoke He grudged missus Hegarty her gathering of young people and the patronage of Pat Glynn but then she was able to run the place better than he and although it was supposed to be her property none knew better than the two of them that it was his as much as the Black Bull McNab came and stood in missus Mary Ann s doorway sometimes when there was dancing and the joy of several of the dancers was quenched at the mere sight of his shrivelled yellow face and pale eyes The Schoolmaster looked down at him No man could afford to quarrel with McNab How old will she be now asked McNab Eighteen replied the Schoolmaster She s the prettiest girl ever seen down this part of the world muttered old Salt Watson Conal seems to think so It was Johnnie M Laughlin who laughed And who s Conal to think so Isn t any girl on the roads good enough for him to play the fool to asked McNab waspishly Best not let him hear you say so Thad McNab shook his shoulders I m not frightened of Conal The rest of ye may be Still you wouldn t like that fist of his about you Thad Salt Watson murmured and Conal isn t what y might call a respecter of persons when he s roused The Schoolmaster went into the dance room He crossed it in leisurely fashion and went to Jessie She was sitting staring before her a mist of tears dimming her pretty eyes He did not go near Deirdre did not look at her even But Conal dropped her hand when the Schoolmaster came into the room and a faint bird like fear that had fluttered in Deirdre s eyes vanished A little later she came to him with a breath that was almost a sob Can t we go now she said Looking into her eyes he saw the shine of tears in them He had meant to talk very seriously to her on their way from missus Hegarty s but now she demanded tenderness and not reproof She seemed to have stumbled against something she did not understand She had dropped her armour of gaiety all her shy bright glances smiles sighs and little airs and graces She had been playing with these women s weapons and had wearied of them or perhaps she was surprised at their power and troubled by it he thought There was a hurt expression he had never seen before in her eyes She looked very young and tired He wrapped her up in her shawl took her by the arm and they went out into the moonlight together making their way to the Black Bull where they were staying until they could find another home in the district CHAPTER XXI In the Wirree Farrel was never known as anything but the Schoolmaster Everybody called him that even Deirdre when she spoke of him They had gone to live in a cottage on the outskirts of the township The Schoolmaster had taken up his old trade though it was understood he had been droving with Conal for Maitland the greater part of the time he had been away Deirdre had wandered with him wherever he went and it was on her account he was anxious to get back to steadier and more settled ways of life it was said Before long two or three of the brown skinned Wirree children were trotting to the cottage for lessons every day The south had heard a great deal of Sam Maitland head of the well known firm of Maitland company stock dealers of Cooburra New South Wales There had been a bad season in the north west for a couple of years Maitland had bought up poor beasts and sent them to fatten in the south Conal had been driving them through Wirreeford at intervals of two or three months taking the fattened beasts back on the return journey over the border after he brought down the starvers All the week the township slept peacefully in the spring sunshine When a clear young moon came up over the plains in the evenings it drenched them with wan silver light But on Friday morning at dawn the cattle came pouring into the town with a cracking of whips barking of dogs yelling and shouting of men and boys With a rush and a rattling of horns they charged along between the rows of huddled houses swinging from one side to the other of the track wild and fearful eyed with lowered heads long strings of glistening saliva dripping from their mouths They seemed to be searching for the opportunity to break and head out to the hills again But ringed with cracking whips brushing horses snapping dogs they were turned into the sale yards The one street of Wirreeford had been cobbled for some distance on either side of the sale yards because the cattle and horses made a sea of mud about them when the spring rains had soaked into the soft earth The stores and shanties were full on sale days Drovers rough haired hawk eyed men with faces seared and seamed with the dust of the roads hands burnt and broken with barcoo slouched along the streets or stood watching their cattle yarning in desultory fashion leaning over the rails of the drafting yards They smoked or chewed and spat in front of the shanties and at night sprawled over the table at the Black Bull playing cards or tossing dice A mob that had travelled a long way was often yarded the night before the sales When the selling for the day was over the beasts that had come down from the hills were driven out along the Rane road and got under Way for the northern markets but sometimes they were left in the yards lowing and bellowing all night while the stockmen who were going to take charge of them spent the evening at the Black Bull or missus Mary Ann s The township was full of the smell of cattle and dogs and of the muddy slowly moving river that had become a waste butt for the houses In the early spring breezes from the ocean with a tang of salt in them blew right through the houses and later when the trees by the river blossomed and bore masses of golden down a warm sweet musky fragrance was wafted to their very doors It overlaid the reek of the cattle yards the fumes of rank spirits and tobacco that came from the shanties And in the long glimmering twilights when the light faded slowly from the plains and the wall of the hills changed from purple to blue and misty grey they were caught up into the mysterious darkness of the night those perfumes of the lightwood and wattle trees in blossom and rested like a benediction in the air From their shabby whitewashed wattle and dab hut on the outskirts of the town the Schoolmaster and Deirdre could watch the twilight dying on the plains and breathe all the fragrance of the trees by the river when they were in bloom The plains spread in vivid undulating green before the cottage to the distant line of the hills and the grass was full of wild flowers all manner of tiny shy and starry blue and white and yellow flowers Deirdre had watched Davey bring cattle down from the hills across the plains She had seen him riding off runaways Once a heifer had broken and careered over the plains before the cottage Davey had chased after her at breakneck speed and rising in his stirrups had swept his stock whip round her letting it fall on her plushy hide with ripping cracks He had flogged the beast driving her with strings of oaths his dog a black and tan fury yelping and snapping at her nozzle until the blood streamed from it and with a mutinous bellow she turned back to the mob again Deirdre had watched him going home in the evening with his father or some of Cameron s men at the heels of a mob his eyes going straight out before him He never looked her way or seemed to see her where she stood at the gate of the whitewashed cottage within a hundred yards of the river She had been chasing missus Mary Ann s geese from the river across the green paddock that lay between the shanty and the Schoolmaster s house when Davey rode out of the township towards her one evening He was driving a score or so of weedy straggling calves Deirdre stood by the roadside and waited for him her eyes luminous in the dusk The wind had whipped her hair to the long tendrils it used to hang in when they raced each other along the roads from school Davey she called as he came towards her There was appeal in her voice But Davey stared at her as though he had not seen her and passed on You re a rude horrible boy And I hate you hate you hate you she cried passionately after him When they met again it was near the sale yards when the street was thronged with people from the hills She had seen his horse hitched to the posts outside McNab s and so was ready for him when they passed The path was so narrow that they could not avoid brushing But Deirdre s chin was well up and her eyes very steady when they met his under his hat brim Such gloomy morose eyes they were that she looked into She almost exclaimed with surprise at them Her mouth opened to speak But Davey was as intent on passing as she had been His face had an ugly sullen look something of his father s dourness After he had passed she stood still and watched him He crossed the road and went into the Black Bull The Schoolmaster saw him there in the evening It was not often Farrel was seen in the tap room of the Black Bull though there was always a lighting of eyes a shifting of seats in anticipation of a lively evening when he appeared He wondered what Davey Cameron was doing there His father had been crippled with rheumatism for a couple of weeks and Davey had charge of his business Farrel wondered if he had begun to swagger to give himself airs on the strength of it He seemed on good terms with McNab and most of the men in the bar but his acknowledgment of Dan s greeting was off hand and he went soon after Farrel came in The Schoolmaster s eyes met McNab s but McNab s eyes never met any man s for very long Perhaps he was afraid of the inner man a stranger might get glimpse of afraid to let any one else see in his eyes the secrets of that sly spying soul of his Now that Farrel had only one eye McNab feared him less although when the concentrated light of the Schoolmaster s spirit poured from it in a single beam he fidgeted showed craven and was glad to escape No one had the knack that Dan Farrel had of showing McNab to the Wirree for what he was The Schoolmaster could string McNab up before the eyes of the men in the bar on the thread of one of his whimsical humours and show him dangling all his crooked limbs writhing his twisted face simmering with wrath He could pin McNab with a few lightly flung words and make a butt of him where he stood before his rows of short necked black and muddied bottles He would have him quivering with wrath impotent against that bitter blithe wit and the laughter it raised He laughed too McNab He was wise as cunning as a dingo Though his eyes were baleful and his hands shook as he poured the raw spirits from his bottle into a mug beside him he laughed It s a mad game y re on with McNab Salt Watson one of the oldest of the Wirreeford men said to the Schoolmaster one evening on his way home Give it up Dan It s good enough to make the boys laugh but you ve only to look at Thad s face when he smiles to know what he is promising himself of it all The Schoolmaster had watched McNab s face when he smiled He had learnt all he wanted to He knew what Salt meant For awhile he dropped out of the circle round Thad s bar When he made one of it his laughter was less frequent and he missed McNab when his lightly flung arrows of wit whistled in the assembly His spirits had suffered a depression Some of the men thought the trouble with his eyes was on his mind He avoided encounters with McNab though none of them had any idea he was afraid of Thad His one eye was more than a match for Thad s two any day they knew There was no open quarrel between them The Schoolmaster s duelling with McNab had never been more than a laughing matter a pricking rapier fashion in the intervals of card playing and drinks It had an air of good fellowship His humour had a quality of amiability though nobody was deceived by it least of all Thad himself There was always contempt and an underlying bitterness in it CHAPTER XXII What s the matter with Davey Farrel asked his daughter a few days later I ve asked him to come up here and have tea with us but he won t come He ll barely speak to me when we meet gets out of my way if he sees me coming Deirdre was kneeling by the hearth waiting for the kettle to boil Their table was spread with cups and saucers and a little pile of toast smoked beside the teapot She said nothing only bent her head lower to avoid his glance Have you got anything to do with it he asked The firelight played on her face For a moment she thought she would tell him of the meeting under the trees and the promises she and Davey had made to each other when they said good bye But there was so much to tell and he would be hurt that she had not told him about it long ago They never had any secrets She had shared all her thoughts with Dan At first that she and Davey were sweethearts had just been something to smile about and gossip over with herself The Schoolmaster had wondered while they were away why she was always restless and wanting to get back to the hills And now there was shame and grief in her heart a smarting sense of anger and disappointment that had come of seeing Davey dancing with Jess and of hearing what people were saying about them It was all fixed up between Ross s Jess and Davey Cameron someone had told her and remarked what a fine couple they would make and how satisfied their parents were about it even Donald Cameron who was not an easy man to please She could not explain all that Dan read in her face something of what was in her mind He took her hand and looked into her face It was quivering and downcast Then you have had something to do with it Deirdre he said No Her voice broke It was the night of the dance at missus Mary Ann s the night we came I remember he said Conal was there and Davey went away angry I ve tried to speak to him a dozen times since she cried Well I can t quite make it out the Schoolmaster said after a few moments but they tell me in the town that since his father s been ill and Davey s had charge of things he s been drinking a good deal and playing the fool at McNab s generally We ve got to try and get him out of that if it s only for his mother s sake Deirdre We owe her a bigger debt you and I you because you love me than we can ever repay She owes you something too the girl said quickly that night of the fires if you hadn t tried to prevent it She knew that he was displeased You mustn t say that again he said Oh I hate her I hate her Deirdre cried passionately What do you mean The Schoolmaster s voice was very quiet Deirdre clung to him sobbing I didn t mean that I hate her really she said I like her too But she s the only one who has ever come between you and me Dan and I can t bear it He drew her to his knees and looked down gravely into her face Her body was stiff against his it shuddered and a storm of tears shook her Tragic dark eyes were lifted to his when her weeping had spent itself When she came and you looked at her my heart died she said Don t you remember when we used to gather the wild flowers to put on the table at school you used to say we could never find a flower that was like her eyes When we made a missus Cameron bouquet we used to put in it white honey flowers and the pink giraffe orchids that grow on a long stem for the colour of her cheeks scarlet runners for her mouth and fly catchers for her hair Don t you remember At first we couldn t find anything for her hair but then I found the climbing fly catchers with the little pink buds on the end of them The down on the leaves all browny gold and glistening in the sun was a little bit like her hair wasn t it Dan Yes he said his mind going back to all their gay gatherings of wild flowers for missus Cameron It awed and surprised him that she should even then have discovered what his most secret heart was scarcely aware of It was the little blue flowers don t you remember we put in for her eyes Deirdre went on Though you said that they weren t a bit like her eyes Dew on the grass is what some would call her eyes but it is a poor colour that dew on the grass no colour at all you said Grass with the dew on it or dew with a scrap of heaven or the twilight shining in it would have been better That s what she has Deirdre you used to say eyes with the twilight in them twilight eyes you can see her thoughts gathering in them brooding and dark or glimmering like the light of the day dying Do you remember saying all that to me I do because I ve said it over to myself so often He understood the apprehensive shy and shamed confession of her eyes Do you mean he asked that Deirdre thinks anybody could be to me what she is Deirdre nodded her contrite gaze melting into his That one his head turned in the direction of the hills is like the Mother of God to me She was very good to me when I was a desperate man long ago Deirdre gazed at him her lips quivering That s why you must always love her missus Cameron my darling black head he said Sing it to me Deirdre cried thirsting for the tenderness of the old song He gathered her up in his arms and crooned in the Gaelic as he used to when she was a baby Put your black head darling darling darling Your darling black head my heart above O mouth of honey with thyme for fragrance Who with heart in breast could deny you love Deirdre pressing to him tasted the satisfaction that all young creatures have in being close to those they love His arms were warm and tender An invasion of peace drove the sorrowful ache from her heart My own mother she asked suddenly Was she like missus Cameron No There was the mingling of grief and troubled thinking in his face that she had always seen there when he spoke of her mother She had a little brown bird an English bird that sang in a cage he said She was like that but she never sang herself She was one of those people life has broken Deirdre You married her and looked after her Dan His head dropped he avoided her eyes Then you came and she died he said Such a sorrowful mite you were he went on Such a lonely baby wailing night and day that there was only one name to give you Deirdre Deirdre of the griefs His eyes were lifted to hers The black shield covered one of them the other was shining with his tenderness for her the strength of the tide behind it It was a sorrowful name to give you darling you that have been the sunshine and have banished the sorrows of my life he cried May they never come any more or grief touch us again CHAPTER XXIII Strange tales were being told of Cameron s son in Wirreeford Donald Cameron had been laid up crippled with rheumatism since the early spring and Davey had been managing for him For the first time in his life the boy found himself with responsibility authority and money in his hands The old man required a strict account of his movements and operations allowing him only a few shillings to pay for his meals and nothing over for the couple of drinks that cemented a deal in the township McNab had got hold of Young Davey How it was not exactly known Let the old man sew up his money bags Young Davey ll open them for him sale yard loafers began to say Davey swaggered He was cock of the walk at McNab s Conal had gone to New South Wales again and now there was not a man spent more nor was as free with the dice as Davey The Schoolmaster heard McNab talking to Davey in the parlour behind the bar one evening filling the boy with a flattery that went to his head faster than the crude spirits he plied him with The only son of the richest man in these parts be a bit of a millionaire y self Davey when y re too old to enjoy the money have a good time with it McNab said Your father s a great man a great man Davey a bit near that s all don t understand that a high spirited youngster like you se got to have a bit of gilt about him Makes you look ridiculous that s what it does havin no more money about you than a teamster or a bloomin rouseabout Here you you hold your tongue about the old man McNab Davey struggled to say You you give me the money It ll be all right when I come into the property I want to go n have a game with the boys now McNab sniggered Oh well you re a lad Davey he said As good a man with cattle as your father and you know better than he does how to make yourself popular We used to say you was as mean as him once a chip of the old block Davey started to his feet He stood by the table swaying a little as he hung to it You you be careful McNab or I ll smash your damned head he said It was only when they were very fuddled that men spoke to him like this McNab giggled Farrel heard the boy s voice It came to him thick and uncertain through the thin walls The door of McNab s parlour was ajar He caught a glimpse of Davey s sullen flushed face his eyes stupid and dull with the glow of drink in them He pushed open the door and went into the room Hullo Davey he said I was looking for you Davey stared at him uncertainly You mayn t know mister Farrel McNab said an evil light in his yellow eyes but Davey here is doing an important bit of business with me and you re intrudin The Schoolmaster glanced at him Intruding am I he replied coolly Well it seems to me it s just about time What do you mean What the hell do you mean School s out mister Farrel Davey crowed lurching back on his heels You hurry up and give me the money McNab McNab put a couple of sovereigns into his hand Come and have a drink mister Farrel Davey cried boisterously There s a couple of chaps in the bar waiting for me and I ll play you poker bob rises Not a dime more He staggered across the room and threw open the door into the tap room McNab followed him turning back at the doorway to shoot a glance of triumph at the Schoolmaster Davey s appearance in the bar was hailed with a shout Dan heard the rattling of bottles and glasses the shouts of laughter blaring of oaths and stamping of heavy feet that followed the boy s call for drinks all round Fragments of a song bawled jocosely came to the Schoolmaster s ears as he tramped down the road to the cottage on the edge of the township He brooded over the change in Davey asking himself how he came to be kicking over the traces why he was going to the dogs with the ne er do wells of McNab s what Donald Cameron would say to it if he knew how he could fail to know what his mother was feeling and thinking about it She would know of that he was certain Not much escaped those clear still eyes of hers In the morning when he saw the boy again he tried to speak to him but Davey swung past dragging his hat over his face shamefacedly The Schoolmaster got into the habit of watching him trying to see his face Sometimes it surprised him He had seen Davey thrashing a steer until the blood poured from its tawny hide He had seen him swinging along the roads on sale days after the midday meal reckless and laughing his head thrown back a couple of McNab s men at his heels He had heard him singing drunkenly on his way home to the hills in the evenings He went after him one evening when Johnson Cameron s head stockman had gone on early and Davey was going home alone Look here Davey he said riding beside him what s this game you re on You ll have to drop it Davey laughed You re like the rest of them he said bitterly Think a fellow never grows up I ve been treated like a kid too long The old man s been making me the laughing stock of the country and he s got to understand I m a man and I ve got to be treated like one You needn t go drinking and chucking money about at McNab s to be that Davey s eyes veered on him Conal does it he said And you all think no end of him Oh Conal What has he got to do with it The Schoolmaster hesitated Conal does it but then he s a roadster It comes natural to him It doesn t to you You re Cameron s son and Cameron s son Davey scoffed Much good that does me What s your father going to say when he hears about this business at the Black Bull the Schoolmaster asked Say Oh he ll cut up at first He s got to understand though I ve got to go my own way have some money to call my own He won t know more than s good for him though That s arranged between McNab and me You don t mean to say you ve got into any arrangement with McNab the Schoolmaster asked Oh you needn t look like that about it Davey replied It s a harmless one He s been decent I m not fool enough to give McNab any real handle against me You re a darned fool Davey the Schoolmaster said his voice ripping the silence with startled energy McNab and his crew ll have you in a hole before you know where you are Davey flicked the reins across his mare s neck She leapt forward along the track There was not a man in Wirreeford who did not think he knew what Thad was driving at that he was working for a shot at Donald Cameron through Young Davey Only he did not see it the calf they said They laughed and followed the course of Thad s snaring with winks chuckles of amusement and sly jokes at Young Davey s expense although they drank with him flattered and applauded him playing up to the part McNab had set them The Schoolmaster tried again to warn the boy This time Davey was inclined to listen to him What can McNab do to me he asked I m not a lag or a lag s son No the Schoolmaster said a little bitterly But I ve been watching McNab seeing the way he works He s got a genius for the underhand job There s not much he couldn t do if he set his mind to it He s set his mind to something now I can see that and you re in the way of it I don t know exactly what it is You know he doesn t love your father Perhaps it s that He s never forgiven him for trying to get him cleared out He s using you somehow Davey I believe you re right mister Farrel Davey said slowly after a while I ve been a fool He swore uneasily Think I ve been mad lately I wanted people to reckon I wasn t just Cameron s son and mean as they make em I m two parts wrong and one part right The right part is I ve got to be independent I ve got to have money of my own It was what you said the other night set me thinking I m going to keep out of McNab s way McNab never shows his hand when he means to win Davey there was a whimsical inflection in the Schoolmaster s voice You can only beat him at his own game if you don t let him see your cards either Eh the boy looked at him You mean don t drop him at once let him down slowly Yes He s got his knife into me too you know though he hasn t shown it quite clearly yet He s good at the waiting game It ll be a bit interesting to see how he marks us both off if we don t mark him off that is I m going to get out of his way as soon as I can I m giving up the teaching here Deirdre and I are going up to Steve s for a while and then I hope we ll shake the dust of the Wirree off our feet They were parting when the Schoolmaster said Hear Pat and Tom Kearney have cleared out to the new rush Eaglehawk isn t it They brought in a mob for Conal Maitland s cattle from the North west poor as mice They said Conal was on the roads and will be in presently to take them up to the hills Maitland s got a couple of fattening paddocks beyond Steve s Two days later on sale day this same scraggy mob of northern bullocks was still in the largest pen of the Wirreeford yards Davey heard them bellowing mournfully Conal s been expected the last couple of days to take charge of them somebody told him But he s not come yet and the Schoolmaster s beating the town for a man to drive em to the hills for him The boys ve all cleared out to the rush Dan s goin to take them himself in the morning CHAPTER XXIV missus Cameron was not seen in Wirreeford during those months of her husband s illness Cameron drove into the township unexpectedly one day when the sales were in progress and she was with him He went to the yards and she turned the horse a sturdy daughter of old Lassie back along the road and halted her outside the Schoolmaster s cottage Deirdre went out to meet her I only heard you were back a few days ago Deirdre missus Cameron said Didn t Davey tell you Deirdre asked No his mother replied They went indoors and missus Cameron sat with her back to the window in the Schoolmaster s wicker chair Deirdre noticed that she looked older and wearier than when she had last seen her They tell me you re to marry Conal the drover dear missus Cameron said It s not true Deirdre gasped turning away from her Who told you missus Ross it was missus Cameron replied She was over the other day she and Jess She said the boys had heard at the sales They tell me Deirdre s eyes met missus Cameron s and her voice ran as quietly as hers that Davey s to marry Jess Ross Oh missus Cameron exclaimed distressfully I don t know They say so but Davey Her face worked pitifully He s so strange I don t understand him at all Deirdre He s so changed I can t help him can t do anything for him He seems to have become a man quite suddenly and She put her hands over her eyes and began to cry Deirdre bent over her Don t Don t cry missus Cameron dear she whispered kissing her It s so foolish Mary Cameron said tremulously as if asking forbearance but my heart s just breaking to see Davey like he is I have managed to keep his father from knowing so far but I m afraid I daren t think what will happen when he knows Deirdre said nothing but her eyes were full missus Cameron stretched a hand out to her Oh dear she said they say it is Jess Davey s going to marry but I can t think it s anybody but you he cares about When first you went away we used to talk about you Davey used to say She s a Pelling I do believe mother because of the fairy tale I used to tell him He made me tell it over and over again after you d gone away It was about Penelop the tylwyth teg who married the farmer s boy Do you remember Deirdre I m sure I told it to you too in the old days Yes Deirdre cried breathlessly and ever afterwards their descendants were called Pellings the children of Penelop and it was said if they had dark hair and bright eyes there was fairy blood in their veins missus Cameron smiled Yes she said fancy you remembering it after all this long time dear Once soon after you d gone away Davey said to me I wonder if Deirdre married me mother would she melt away if I touched her with a piece of iron He sat thinking and smiling a long time Deirdre and I felt so happy about you both Then you came back and it was all different I ve been thinking perhaps it was Conal has come between you The eyes of Davey s mother were very wistful But if you re not going to marry Conal perhaps you can be good friends with Davey again Deirdre He would do anything in the world for you once The other night when he came home he had been at McNab s until late and the drink was strong on him I couldn t let him into the house for fear of his father waking He slept in the barn and I sat near him I was afraid he might light a match and drop it in the hay and he talked in his sleep sobbing and crying and it was your name he was saying over and over again to himself as though his heart was breaking over it Deirdre Deirdre And there s some affair with McNab troubling him missus Cameron went on I don t know what it is Oh I don t know what he s been doing to get mixed up with McNab in anything I know he can mean Davey no good whatever He has sworn to have vengeance on his father for long enough They say you re the most beautiful woman in the country Deirdre If only you d help me to keep Davey away from McNab s You could He d do anything for you in the old days What is it has come between you missus Cameron s eyes were very like Davey s had been when he kissed her under the trees Deirdre thought She put her hand in missus Cameron s A shadow darkened the window breaking the blank of the sunlight beyond it The Schoolmaster came in at the door that overlooked the road An exclamation drew his gaze to the far end of the room missus Cameron held out her hand to him She had not seen him since the night of the fires Deirdre went to her little lean to of a kitchen and busied herself making tea When she returned missus Cameron was sitting as she had left her on the wicker chair with her back to the light but there was an added pain in her eyes her hands lay limp in her lap Deirdre had a tray with tea and the cups on it She set it down on the table in the middle of the room and they gathered their chairs about it What a nice home you ve got missus Cameron said smiling at the Schoolmaster Deirdre has turned out a wonderful housekeeper after all The Schoolmaster laughed She was always more eager to be possuming and chasing calves with Davey than to be learning to cook and sew wasn t she he said But after a while she made butter as well as I could missus Cameron smiled And as for spinning Deirdre could take my old wheel and twist up a yarn for me in no time Will you let her come soon to stay with me for a while Yes The Schoolmaster s eyes dwelt on the girl for a moment There are not enough children coming for schooling We won t be here for much longer he said We ll be going up to Steve s soon Going up to Steve s Deirdre asked When The Schoolmaster did not answer at once When Conal gets back I want to see him first he said We ll just be staying a few weeks with Steve for a holiday and then be leaving the district again missus Cameron sat talking to them of the every day affairs of her life a little longer Then she got up to go Is it true what they say that he will lose his sight she asked Deirdre when they were outside Deirdre nodded She could scarcely speak of the time when the light of the world would be blotted out for ever from Dan We saw a doctor in Rane He said so she replied missus Cameron s exclamation was in the soft tongue of the spinning song she sang when she sat with her wheel in the garden Deirdre did not know the words but she understood their distress and the little gesture that went with them CHAPTER XXV Donald Cameron was made of the stuff that gives confidence and appreciation grudgingly He was obsessed by the idea that no one could do anything as well as he could He could only satisfy his own reckless desire to be up and doing by girding at all that was being done for him If Davey had been less efficient a stop gap it would have pleased him better He would have liked to see mistakes made which would assure him that no one but himself could run Ayrmuir as it ought to be run But Davey had done very well in his place He had brought off one bargain with a smartness that his father vaguely resented and Davey was chockful of boyish pride over There had been chafings and crossings of will two or three times Mary Cameron trembled when she heard them Anxious fears fluttered and filled her with foreboding every time her husband s irritability at his chained helplessness and crippling pain was directed at Davey The boy s short answers with an underlying contempt in them fanned his father s smouldering wrath Davey dear she had said once after there had been high words between them try and be a little more patient with your father It s hard on him having to sit in a chair like this after the active life he s led He s fretting his heart out to be up and doing things and seeing them done the way he likes There s no pleasing him mother Davey said shaking her arms from him She knew he was right but Davey was almost as sullen and surly as his father these days Donald Cameron kept him going all day The boy was dog weary when he came into the house at nightfall then there were entries to make and book keeping to do accounts of sales and movements of stock to render and nothing but carping and fault finding for his pains At one time in the evenings he used to take out his books and read intently for hours sprawling over the table till the candle flickered down and his mother said softly Won t you go to bed now dear knowing that late hours were never an excuse in Donald Cameron s eyes for failing to be out after the cows before the sun was up But now he lay in his chair his long legs stretched out before him after he had given his father an account of the day s work and got from him directions for the next and there was a sullen brooding look on his face an expression in his eyes that it hurt her to see Davey s face had changed so within the last few months It was a revelation to her There was a firmness of line about his chin and upper lip that caused her to glance from him to his father Little of the boy was left in Davey now she realised What there was lay in his eyes and about his mouth It was as if the child in him were dying hard Something had hurt him bitterly she surmised and she wondered whether it was bitter thinking hard riding or the life he was leading with strange rough men that had brought those creases about his nose given his face its dour manliness This man Davey was a strange to her Her heart yearned over him as though her baby had been snatched from her arms She wanted to know him to understand his ways of thinking But he had a new and strange manner with her His mind was shut He kissed her in a perfunctory fashion and when she put her arms round him he stiffened under them In sympathetic sensitive fashion she knew that he was guarding the kingdom of himself against her She had some subtle warning that he was afraid of her love of her tenderness which with its fine edge might prize open the inner shell of his being and discover the trouble and tremulous fury of emotion which lay hidden within She was afraid of offending him afraid of approaching him with her affection and sympathy afraid not to respect the reserve that he had put between them Yet her anxiety tormenting her one day she said Tell me what is troubling you Davey Tell me It is breaking my heart to see you like this There s nothing to tell mother he replied sharply For a long time he had not been coming home till late The silence of the long evenings when she sat and sewed by the fire and Donald Cameron glowered into it smoking had been unbroken Sometimes he had asked where Davey was Then she stilled the tremors in her voice to say quietly that she thought he was with the Rosses or at missus Hegarty s for the dancing CHAPTER XXVI When Davey came in from the Wirree the night after missus Cameron had been to see Deirdre and the Schoolmaster Donald Cameron was standing before the fire He had said nothing all the way of the long drive from Wirreeford but his wife by the set of his face knew that something unusual had happened He stood before the fireplace waiting for Davey to come home listening for the sound of his horse s feet the yelping of the dogs in the yard that would announce his arrival Before they had left the sale yards as he was sitting in the high buggy before they drove off he had sent her back to look for Davey and tell him to come home as soon as the sales were over Davey a lean lithe figure on the edge of a group of stockmen had recognised the urgency in her voice the appeal of her eyes as she gave him the message We were just fixing up to have a game of poker to night missus Cameron Mick Ross had said She sought Davey s eyes The shadow of his hat was over them He stood a moment flicking his leggings with the lash of the long whip curled on his arm Right mother I ll come along presently he said She went back to her husband her heart soothed But his face all the way home had filled her with fear Has anything happened to upset you Donald she asked Aye matter enough he replied What is it she ventured You ll hear soon He lapsed into silence again She knew that there was trouble ahead for Davey What it was she could only imagine every fibre of her being ached to know She hurried Jenny on with the dinner so that his father s inner man would be warmed and comforted before Davey arrived He was an hour or two later than they were When he came into the kitchen she went up to him and put her arms round him Whatever you do don t cross your father Davey dear she said He s in a queer temper to night Davey looked at her stupidly He threw off his hat and brushed his hand across his forehead Right mother he said slowly His voice was thick She smelt the whisky on his breath as he turned into the next room Hurrying backwards and forwards from the fire to the table lifting the dinner she had kept warm for him by the fire she did not hear the first words of the storm that was brewing in the inner room Lifting the tray she carried it in but on the threshold she stood still her heart cold at the sight of her husband and son They were facing each other all the antagonism that had been latent for months between them ablaze in their eyes betrayed by every line of their passion white faces She put her tray on the table Donald Cameron had a packet of papers in his hand The torn envelope he had taken them from lay on the floor Look at them look at them he shouted Perhaps you can tell me the meaning of them David took the papers He pushed back a chair staring at them Curse McNab he muttered He promised me Curb your tongue in this house Donald Cameron took a step forward Have you anything to say to these bills McNab says you ve had credit for a couple of hundred pounds Davey s head cleared The sight of his father s face livid with rage raised a demon in him Yes he said there s a couple of drinks I had to day not charged for You insolent young blackguard Donald Cameron cried careless of words in his anger Is this the sort of son I ve got goes robbing me behind my back drinking with pothouse boys lags and thieves I thought you could be trusted to take charge of my interests while I was ill Stop that Davey s nostrils quivered ominously Thought you could play the young lord and McNab comes telling me I ll wring McNab s neck Aye you will said the old man bitterly You ve let him wring you properly McNab s got no reason to love me and you know it but he did the square thing this time if he never did it in his life before telling me I was being robbed by my own son I d advise you father not to talk that way Davey s temper was rising I wanted money you wouldn t have given it to me if I d asked for it I had to get it McNab lent it to me He said I could pay him by and by and that it was good enough being Cameron s son to borrow money on He said you d never see these receipts I gave him Well you ll borrow no more Donald Cameron breathed Johnson can take charge of things till I m about again And before you make an arrangement of this kind again you ll perhaps wait till I m dead and buried I ll have it posted in the Wirree that no one is to serve you with drink unless you pay for it If you do that Davey began What I regret is that I didn t give Johnson charge of things from the first the old man continued But I set my own son before him You ve shown y weren t fit for the trust snaring me on a level with gaol birds Davey s voice trembled with passion I haven t snared you he cried I haven t taken what wasn t my own Isn t what s yours mine Haven t you always said so Isn t that what you ve said when I ve asked for wages and you ve said No Haven t you said that it will be all mine some day this place and all the money you ve made Who else have you got to give it to I ve only been doing with the money what you ought to have done I ve spent some of it so as not to have us shamed in the country Oh that s it is it Donald Cameron s grey eyes gleamed beneath their shaggy brows The son s to make ducks and drakes of the fortune the father earns by the sweat of his brow Well I ll tell you this much Davey you ll not get a penny of my money to throw to the winds If you were a good son a hardworking industrious lad y might be sure of it but if you were fifty times flesh of my flesh you d not get a penny to go to the devil with Donald Donald Mary Cameron laid a hand on her husband s coat Don t speak to the boy like that she cried You know he s a good lad that he s worked hard for years He pushed her away Be silent he said harshly You ve held y re tongue though you must have known what s been going on that he s got into these brawling roistering ways McNab told me about them said that I d be blaming him when I found out if he didn t tell me himself You ve screened and hidden the boy Leave mother out of it Davey said Davey she besought him It s all right mother he turned from her impatiently We ve got to have this out now and be done with it I m not going on as I have done This is what I ve got to say He eyed Donald Cameron squarely Since I left school four years ago I ve worked on this place worked harder than two men And what have I got for it wages No Abuse Stacks of it And you re making money hand over fist The contempt in his eyes deepened I know what your bank says I know what the countryside says about Donald Cameron s money You re the richest man this side of the ranges But how do we live You go about in old clothes as if you hadn t a penny to bless yourself with and I might be anybody s rouseabout for the look of me Never a penny leaks out of your pockets if you can help it There s none in them to leak out of mine Don t you know what people are saying about us Haven t you heard anybody say There go Cameron and his son Old Cameron is as mean as they make em and Young Davey s a chip of the old block It was hearing that got me down What s the good of your money to you What s the good of it to mother What s the good of it to me Because you worked hard for it in the beginning is that any reason why you should hang on to it when you ve got it be afraid to spend it I might just as well be dead as working always with nothing else in the world to think of but work always under your thumb screwed down not allowed to have a mind of my own I d rather get a job on the roads and be free and have a few shillings in my pocket Donald Cameron s face was set I ve said my say he said And I ve said my say cried Davey Johnson ll have charge from to morrow an you ll work under him You ll give me wages pay me the same as the rest of the men Davey asked his eyes bright with anger No Cameron hesitated Something of the justice of the boy s point of view reached him But there was more involved than a mere recognition of justice It meant the breaking of a will And it was foreign to his mind to yield his obstinacy was the habit of a lifetime You re my son not a hired labourer on the place he said I ve fed and clothed you all your days You ll have food and clothes and what else I like to give you And how much will that be Davey eyed him narrowly It won t wear a hole in y r trousers pockets Donald Cameron permitted himself the grim humour believing that he had won the day And it won t encourage you to be dicing and drinking at McNab s His mother more sensitive to Davey s state of mind broke in Oh she cried have no more of this talking now I Sit down and eat your supper Davey It ll all be cold Stick to your money Davey yelled I won t be fed and clothed by you any longer I ll earn my own living somewhere else He strode out of the room His mother heard him go across the flagged floor of the kitchen Go out after him Donald Call him back she urged No said Cameron slowly Davey s defiance was a shock to him He had ruled his little world autocratically His will had been law He had not believed that Davey would dare to resist it If he goes of his own will let him come back of it he said Oh go after him Donald she cried You ve driven him to it you with your harshness She ran to the door but already the beat of hoofs was flying up from the misty depths of the trees Davey Davey Davey she called She ran down the track calling him But Davey was beyond her voice or the sound of his horse s hoofs and the hot blood in his ears dulled the echo of his name that floated down to him When Mary went indoors again Donald Cameron was sitting in his chair the fire had gone out of his eyes leaving him dull and vacant You ve been harsh with him Donald she said It s all true what he says You have worked him like a navvy and never given him enough pocket money to keep him in tobacco even It s hard on him when the Morrison boys and the Rosses have their own money to spend and everybody saying we re better off than any of the people about You wouldn t have stood so much yourself at his age Whist woman he said pettishly his head bent as if he were trying to catch the sound of distant hoof beats Of course you d take sides with him Oh Donald isn t it yourself in him that s making him like this she cried Isn t it your own blood speaking in all his high handed ways What did you think your son would be to take the sort of treatment you ve given him from any man even his own father You should have stayed on the farm in the old country if you d wanted that sort of man for a son If you hadn t wanted Davey to have a high spirit you should never have come over the sea here You shouldn t have had me to come with you for his mother Donald Cameron dropped into his chair His face was grey and lined as if the light behind it were extinguished Be quiet will you not woman he said I will not There was a spark in her eyes I ve got to say what I m thinking now Donald Cameron I ve held my tongue long enough You ve had your way and I ve hardly dared to breathe when you spoke for years Your always laying your will on people crushes the spirit in them The dominating way you have wants to lay down everything before it But I m glad you ve not crushed Davey though it s breaking my heart to think of his going away from us I d rather have it than see him grow into the creeping crawling thing Nat Johnson is Davey s got in him what brought you and me here I m glad he s got that spirit There s no fear in it it goes straight forward You ve grown old and I ve grown old she continued breathlessly We ve lost all our fire but he s got it it s going on in him And you with your old ideas you don t like it but he s got to be free he s got to go his own way he s got to break his own earth Donald Donald Cameron moved restively It s from his mother he s taken his liking for clacking words then he said She fell back from him with a little desperate gesture that she had made so little headway against the stone wall of his mind Will you not go after him to Wirreeford and get him to come home again she asked pitifully He is a clever lad He ll be a credit and joy to us yet if you ll only give him his head for a bit Donald This at McNab s doesn t mean anything it s only to put you right with the people here really and because he s troubled in his mind about something else What do you mean His eyebrows twitched his sharp eyes settled on her There s a girl on his mind she replied hesitatingly Jess Ross he asked I d fixed in my mind for him to marry her Well there was the glimmer of a smile in her eyes It s not Jessie that Davey s got fixed in his mind to marry so perhaps it s just as well you should be away from each other for a while One of the Wirree girls lag s daughters every one of them His fingers drummed on the arm of his chair A shade of sadness had fallen on missus Cameron s face Well you you won t get Davey to come home or let me try she asked her heart fainting at her own words No He repeated the word slowly as if in fear that his tongue would give effect to other stirrings of his brain Of his own will he went of his own will he ll come back again Would you have in like circumstances she asked He did not reply He s our only one Donald she pleaded He s my son But what s the meaning of these he said shuffling the handful of McNab s papers Davey had thrown down Did I ever make bills like this for myself Haven t I worked and slaved year in and year out Did I ever throw away roistering what he has Mary looked at the bills She had not seen them before Oh she said slowly that s the bad blood of me in him My people were all a spendthrift lot and I ve never been able to keep anything at all myself whether it was love or money or a shawl or even a spirit of my own to go through my life with She picked up the tray with Davey s untouched meal on it and went out of the room CHAPTER XXVII A sou wester was tearing across the plains threatening to sweep the whole Wirree township off its foundations and dash the fragments of the mud houses against the hills It broke round the Black Bull with the noise of great guns and in the pauses of its blowing the booming of the sea on the beaches five miles away could be heard When Davey burst open the door he brought a gust of wind into the tap room that set the lights sputtering and flaring Two of them went out The glasses on McNab s bench danced as he hammered it with his fists For two pins I d thrash you he yelled You got me into borrowing money from you I was a blamed young fool But what s your game What do you mean playing fair to me and then giving me away to the old man A neat way of bleeding him that s what it was Getting me in here drunk and then The Schoolmaster was playing cards with a couple of men on an upturned box behind the door He threw down his cards and took Davey s arm The boy threw it off Leave me alone mister Farrel he cried I d sweep the floor with the the damned swine if he were worth sweeping the floor with You re all afraid of him Well I m not You see here Mister McNab he leant across the bar and his eyes burnt their way into the pale shifty eyes of Thad McNab I ll break every bone in your body if you ever interfere between me and mine again D you hear that I don t know what you ve got up your sleeve and I don t care You just keep it there see or it ll be the worse for you McNab had blenched at the boy s headlong passion The quivering long arms seemed scarcely able to keep themselves off his miserable shoulders His skin was the gingery colour of his hair and though he grinned feebly looking everywhere but at Davey there was not a man who did not see he was trembling Thad McNab was a coward everybody knew that There was nothing in the world he feared more than the vengeance which might wreak itself on his miserable body As Young Davey stamped out of the bar there was a rustle of movement smothered oaths of surprise and amusement a swinging of eyes after him with something of admiration and applause in them but McNab was recovering himself He gazed speechlessly after the boy too there was a ghost of a smile on his face His mind was working his lips moved though no words came The men who had wanted to cheer Young Davey shifted their opinions uneasily There would be more to score to McNab s account yet they imagined The Schoolmaster did not follow Davey out of the bar as he felt inclined to but when the boy had gone McNab looked across at him That s what comes of interferin Farrel he said You ll know better another time won t you McNab the Schoolmaster drawled looking up from the cards he was holding It s a bad business getting between father and son McNab s smile changed I was alludin to your interferin when I had a bit of business on hand mister Farrel he snarled Had you a bit of business on Thad the Schoolmaster asked Who with Davey And did I interfere Well now you beat me Out with it Let s hear all about it We re all old friends here McNab s wrath surged so that he could not speak There now Farrel cried He won t tell Never mind McNab you came off very well When Young Davey came in I thought he d have you out on the road for a certainty and he s a pretty bruiser Showed him how to put up his fists myself a couple of years ago It was Dan s way of saying things with a whimsicality an inimitable geniality tinged with sarcasm that brought the house down When the men in the bar threw back their heads and stretched their lungs that night Thad did not laugh He stood shivering with gimlet flames in his eyes his fingers twitching restlessly There were drinks all round and the Schoolmaster played another rubber before he swung out of the shanty and into the wind that roared and beat over the plains Davey was waiting in the lee of the garden fence round Farrel s cottage his little red mare set with her haunches against the wind What is it Davey the Schoolmaster asked when he saw him It s this mister Farrel Davey said on a short breath I ve quarrelled with the old man I want a job The cottage was in darkness But after he had taken Davey to the stable and they had turned Red into it they went indoors and a light gleamed from the small square windows until the sky was waning on the edge of the plains Then Davey came to the door and the Schoolmaster with him It s not advice as I told you but a job I m wanting the boy said His voice carried against the wind hoarse with anger and disappointment But this job Davey you know what it is The Schoolmaster s voice was troubled Yes I know haven t I told you As a matter of fact I haven t the price of food or a bed on me and I m not going back for it You said these cattle of Maitland s in the yards would have to be taken to the hills Maitland s got fattening paddocks up beyond Steve s hasn t he Tim and Pat Kearney have cleared off to the new rush and you said you d have to get somebody to take them for Conal You can have what money the Schoolmaster began It wasn t what I asked for Davey said curtly None knew better than Farrel what the difficulties of his getting work of any sort would be in the Wirree with McNab s mark against him In the hills no one would employ him for fear of offending Donald Cameron But it was neither McNab nor Donald Cameron the Schoolmaster was thinking of when he tried to persuade the boy to go home Not a word moved Davey from his purpose to be independent If you take this mob to morrow you will clear out then and look for another job on the other side of the ranges Yes Davey said eagerly Right the Schoolmaster replied but I don t want you in this business with Conal Davey The boy gripped his hand You said if ever I was hard up for a friend he said to come to you And this job with those beasts of Maitland s is the only thing sticking out for me just now Farrel turned away wearily I d be glad enough to stand by you always Davey he said But this is different I d never forgive myself if I got you into a mess However it can t do any harm your taking these beasts to Steve s Deirdre and I ll be going up in a day or two I ll tell Conal about it Then you can go on over the ranges There s always work on Middleton s or Yaraan Come in now and I ll make you a cup of tea Davey glanced at the lightening dome of the sky It s a couple of hours to dawn yet he said with a sigh Then I ll be going CHAPTER XXVIII Conal himself on the road met Davey behind Maitland s slowly moving scraggy high ribbed cattle What s the meaning of this he asked striding into Farrel s kitchen That kid of Cameron s Wanted a job the Schoolmaster said He s quarrelled with his father Does he know the game The Schoolmaster nodded staring over his pipe into the fire Conal threw off his hat His eyes were blazing The breath throbbed against the bare throat down which his beard climbed Do you mean to say you The Schoolmaster s eye on his halted his tongue No I don t mean to he said slowly He knocked the ash from his pipe By the way Conal who fixed the brands on that red bull You know the beast I mean small square blazed face sold in Port Southern last sales I did Fighting Conal threw himself into a chair Badly done the Schoolmaster murmured gazing before him He Young Davey twigged it He s been holding his tongue for what reason I don t know but he told me because he wanted this job I gave it to him Thad s got his knife into him Then why on earth did you want to take him on and get Thad on our tracks Don t take orders from Thad yet do you Conal Conal fidgeted under that glint in Dan s eye No he growled you know I don t but there s no good I can see in running against him What does this kid want anyhow Why there s more than a dozen of Cameron s cows in the mob I m after now The log that had been smouldering all day on the open hearth broke and fell with a shattering of embers Tell you the truth Conal the Schoolmaster looked straight out before him There s something in McNab s eyes tells me he s got his suspicions well if he has it s time to get out You ve had luck so far But there s something about McNab keeps making me feel as if he were promising himself something on my account saying to himself There s something coming to you Of course he thinks I m in this business with you Conal shifted his position and swore impatiently I d better keep out of your way that s what it amounts to Dan No the Schoolmaster said not that Let McNab think what he likes as far as I m concerned Only he hasn t any particular quarrel with you Conal and he has with me and if he tripped you up trying to get at me it would be a bad business Conal leant forward Things are tightening up north too he said I mean to quit Dan Maitland knows I do his business and a little bit extra on my own account That doesn t worry him so long as he gets a fancy price for the beasts I want to pull off this last lift and then turn the game down altogether I wish you were in this with me though you ve never been in any but square jobs before I ve been spying out the land took a short cut from Rane and got into the back hills Sent Tim and Pat on with those scrags of Maitland s Picked up Teddy at Steve s There s not much he doesn t know about the ways of scrub cattle Trust a black He took me down Narrow Valley to the plains We laid a couple of hours under cover in the dark Then the moon rose and you should ve seen the mob go stringin out across the plains lookin no more than a drove of rats in the dim light It s a pretty good bunch rollin fat and prices high I mean to pick it up Wouldn t ve known anything about it but for you it s out of my beat You ought to have a whack of the profits Dan Both men were silent for a few moments Only the fire creaked in the quiet room When I m through with this bit of work I ll get out and set up on the respectable somewhere We could take up a couple of hundred acres on our own account you and me Conal murmured go to church wear long tailed coats ring on some fancy speechifyin Me n Deirdre d sing in the choir When this is all through there s something I ll want to be saying to you Dan There was another moment s dreaming silence The Schoolmaster spoke with a sudden resolution No he said Do what you like yourself Conal but I made up my mind long ago not to have anything to do with cross jobs I m not in this I don t want to be and I ll have nothing to do with the proceeds You call Dan Conal rose from his seat by the fire with a gesture of disappointment It ll be full moon to morrow night and I m goin to make a dash for m Teddy and I ran up a yard near the old hut in Narrow Valley That s what s been keeping me Steve s goin to send tucker and fire irons down to day What about young Cameron the Schoolmaster asked We ll have to keep an eye on him You don t suppose he ll blab do you You say he knows the game already and hasn t But we can t afford to take chances But he s not to be dragged in Conal Conal threw back his head laughing Well I want another man he said As for being dragged in he won t be dragged in But did you ever hear of a youngster who d sit behind the door and suck his thumbs while there was moonlighting in the air It won t be a case of draggin him in but keepin him out After all it s the sport makes it worth while the waiting rush fight and carryin through of things He stretched his long limbs But I won t have Davey working with you Conal the Schoolmaster said angrily Deirdre came into the room a little bonnet over her head and a long black cloak covering her There was a wild colour the wind had whipped into them in her cheeks and her eyes were shining You Conal she cried eagerly when she saw the tall figure of the drover When did you get back Conal saw only her shining eyes and the fluttering line of her mouth He stood stock still staring at her It did not occur to his simple mind to ask whether it was for him her eyes were shining Only that glad and eager note in her voice pleased him The Schoolmaster had heard people say that Deirdre was beautiful but she had never seemed more beautiful than she was this evening when she came out of the gloom bringing into the quiet room and across the threshold of his troubled thoughts her youth and buoyancy of spirit the whole secret and subtle essence of her femininity in bloom Oh I I ve just got back and came to see your father at once Deirdre was all Conal could say Did you have a good trip she asked taking off her hat and coat He wondered how much of his enterprise she knew But there was no shadow on her face Yes all right he said a little awkwardly I saw missus Cameron at the store father she continued busy with her own thoughts and turning over in her mind what missus Cameron had said to her what she had said to missus Cameron and the plot light as a spider s web that they had woven between them for Davey s benefit And as I was coming along home she laughed blithely who did I meet on the road but Pat Glynn And he put this little parcel into my hand and said that he had been told to give it to me He made me promise not to open it until I got in too She tore the wrappings of brown paper and newspaper from a little brown box opened it and drew out a heavy old fashioned necklace made of links and twists of gold with a locket set with rubies and pearls at the end of it Oh isn t it pretty she cried The Schoolmaster stared at it and on Conal s face a thunder cloud of resentment gathered Who did he tell you sent it the Schoolmaster asked He wouldn t say only that it was from a devoted admirer Have you any idea who it s from Dan asked anger and anxiety struggling within him Deirdre looked up at Conal It s not from you Conal she asked hesitatingly He shook his head Perhaps it was Davey She looked at the Schoolmaster No he said Davey had no money I know so he couldn t have sent it You ve no idea of any one else No The light had gone from her face Conal seized his hat His mouth set in an ugly line I ll go and see Pat he said The door slammed behind him Deirdre stood looking down on the glimmering thing in her hand You re not to wear it Deirdre the Schoolmaster said harshly Her eyes flew to his He caught a reflection of his own spirit in them Do you think I d be likely to she said It was hours later when Conal slammed the door of the cottage again The suppressed rage in him burned to white ash He s gone Pat Glynn he said angrily I ve ransacked the place for him He s melted into thin air I ve been out along the Rane road and half way into the Port but he s done the disappearing trick There s not a track of him anywhere CHAPTER XXIX So you re goin to Steve s Deirdre It was Thad McNab who spoke He stood on the doorstep in the sunshine his yellow face thrust through the doorway the pale eyes in it smiling Deirdre was putting the last of her ribbands handkerchiefs and little personal belongings into a small canvas saddle bag McNab s voice startled her She glanced across at him Yes she said The sight of his crooked figure there in the doorway with the sunlight playing across it brought her a sense of uneasy wondering Quite suddenly the night before Farrel had decided to go up to the hills with Conal in the morning He had told Deirdre to follow them as soon as she had set the cottage in order and collected her clothes She wanted to go with them but there were a hundred and one things to keep her busy in the house dishes to scour floors to sweep covers and crockery to lock away in the cupboards She had just quenched the fire The ashes were smoking behind her under the water she had poured over them when McNab appeared The township was well astir by this time The Schoolmaster had talked of going to Steve s for long enough she did not expect anyone to be surprised at it He did not seem to expect that anyone would be surprised either though he had made up his mind rather suddenly the night before and had told her to ride out quietly and without chattering to anyone in the morning Yet McNab seemed surprised and annoyed She wondered how he knew so soon that the Schoolmaster had gone with Conal It was very early The sunshine was still of an untarnished brilliance missus Mary Ann s ducks and geese were making their first trip in wavering white and mottled lines to the shallow pools left by the tide beside the river Deirdre could see them through the open doorway Mighty sudden the Schoolmaster made up his mind eh my blackbird Thad said with what for him was geniality though geniality on his voice had a sour sound He shuffled into the room and stood near her Deirdre folded a ribband and packed it into her bag She made a great appearance of being busy going to and from the kitchen and the cupboards wrapping up and putting into the bag all manner of things that she had not meant to take in order that she might not be still to look at or to talk to McNab She did not want him to see how the sight of him had set her heart throbbing a little nervous pulse fluttering in her throat His nearness filled her with a sick fear but she would not have had McNab guess it She knew the shrewd sharpness of those pale shifty eyes of his Her eyes met his clearly There was not a flicker of the smooth white lids above them Oh no she said he d fixed to go to day sometime ago Well he might ve said so replied McNab There was something I wanted to talk to him about something partic lar Can I tell him what it is His eyes fell before the clear innocence of her gaze He moved uneasily No he said I dursay I ll find time to go and see him up at Steve s one of these days Tell him that I ll come soon He chuckled a moment They tell me he went on eyeing her narrowly they tell me he s taken that cub of Cameron s with him He did not wait for her reply but ran on the malice that was never far from it an undercurrent in his voice again He s not very clever your father my dear for all he s a Schoolmaster or he wouldn t have done that Give him my respects and say I hope the hills ll be for the good of his health And you I hope you ll be enjoyin y rself up there Though it s no place to be buryin the most beautiful woman in the South Well I ll have to be going now Deirdre moved quickly He had edged nearer and nearer her until his breath touched her face as she pulled the strings of her bag together Socks has been saddled this half hour Father ll be glad to see you any day at Steve s I m sure mister McNab she added backing towards the door McNab got between her and it He put his hand on her arm My the pretty neck it is he gurgled his voice deep in his throat But where s the gold chain Pat Glynn told me he had for you from a devoted admirer no less A gold chain it was with rubies and pearls on it fit for a lady to wear And there s more for you where it come from The one that sent it would dress you up like the finest lady in the land Pat said if you would Deirdre wrenched herself away from the clutching hands They caught at her again You must kiss me good bye then pretty he whispered She saw the flame in his eyes the wry smile on his lips The chestnut was standing saddled his bridle over the post by the door Deirdre leapt to his back her bag in her hand Thad followed her out of doors and stood watching her rubbing his hands together So shy my blackbird so shy he exclaimed almost gleefully Never mind Another day perhaps Deirdre looked down at him her eyes blazing If father heard you talking like that he d thrash you within an inch of your life she cried passionately McNab lost countenance Eh would he he snarled The fear of death and revenge the dealing out to himself of what he had dealt so often to others was the continual dogging terror that haunted him Then he smiled again and chuckled If I let him eh my pretty he said gazing up at her If I let him I wouldn t advise you to to tell him create bad feelin between us it d be a pity seeing me and y r father s pretty good friends and they say it s better to make a friend than an enemy of McNab Besides it was only my little bit of fun Deirdre Haven t I known you since you were so high Deirdre turned the chestnut to the road Good bye me dear McNab called And my respects to the Schoolmaster don t forget Tell him I think it was mean to do me the trick of clearin out without lettin me know though n me wantin to stand by him in any little bit of trouble that s comin to him But I ll be comin up to see him soon sooner than he thinks p raps There was a warning a veiled threat in the words As the chestnut flew out along the green roadsides that mean voice with its geniality and thin edged malice reverberated in Deirdre s ears She looked back when she was some distance out on the flat road that wound over the plains to the hills and saw McNab hobbling back towards the whitewashed irregular and dilapidated huts of the Wirree township Her eyes went out to the ranges with an eager sigh She quickened the chestnut s pace again with a rub of her heels on his sleek side CHAPTER XXX Deirdre s spirits rose as White Socks climbed the steep track of the foothills She drew the strong sweet leafy smells of the trees with eager breaths Tying her hat to the saddle she threw back her head to the sunshine exclaiming with delight to see the red and brown prickly shrub blossom out among the ferns sunlight making the young leaves hang upon the saplings in flakes of translucent green ruddy gold and amber She talked to Socks and called to the birds that flitted across the track It was so good to be in the hills again climbing the long winding path through the trees She wanted to catch the sunshine in her hands it hung in such yarns of palpable gold stuff across the track She sang softly to herself gazing into the blue haze that stood among the near trees The valleys were steeped in sun mists Her little horse ambled easily through them and when he climbed the steep hill sides she slipped from his back and walked beside him asking him again and again if it were not good to be going to Steve s to the paddocks where Socks himself had flung up his heels an unbroken colt and all the gay careless days of her childhood had been spent She felt as if they were leaving the reek and squalor of the Wirree River for ever And yet the vague uneasiness McNab s words had evoked hovered in her mind His eyes gestures ugly writhing smile kept recurring to her She was anxious to get to the Schoolmaster and give him McNab s message to know what he would make of it What harm was it McNab could do her father She knew that Dan feared him in a curious watchful way And the trouble that was coming to him What had McNab meant by that This business Conal was on what was it Why had she been told nothing about it The way McNab had talked to her too disquieted her All day a premonition of trouble haunted her She urged the chestnut on When they splashed through a creek at midday she let him stand for a few minutes in the middle of it dip his patchy white nose into the clear cold water and sough it up noisily A little further on near a gully in which the mists were unfathomable the trees grey as sea lichen in its depths she sat down by the roadside and ate her sandwich of bread and cheese and had a drink from her bottle of milk Davey and she had often made excursions to Long Gully when they were children to hear the bell birds They dropped mellow notes through the stillness of the trees that climbed the gully s steep sides Davey and she had crept warily through the undergrowth on the look out for snakes and had sat still for hours behind a fallen tree listening for the plomp plomp plomp of the shy birds notes of purest melody thrown into the pool of the silence A dead tree stood near the edge of the track Deirdre remembered that there had been a magpie s nest in it and that the maggies would swoop down on her and on Davey in the springtime if there were young birds in the nest screaming and flapping their wings and sometimes getting in a peck which brought the blood to her freckled face or to Davey s She glanced up to see if the magpies were about that day but they were not So gaunt and tall the dead tree stood Its branches seemed to strike against the sky They rattled with the sound of bones in the wind The sun and thrashing winter storms had bleached it and there were black wales and scars where a fire had eaten into the wood above the hacked zone that the axe of a settler had made when he ring barked it years ago As long as she could remember the dead tree had stood there gaunt and ghostly with the tangle of living trees behind it They were clad with their shifting whispering garment of leaves all the year round and decked with flowers in the springtime But the dead tree was naked It might have been an avenging spirit of the wilderness it stood with an air of such tragic desolation by the wayside There were dead trees all along the hill roads scores of them in the paddocks The ripping crack and thunder of their crashing to the earth could be heard in the dead of night sometimes When they thought of it country folk moved from under a dead tree Deirdre looked up at this one It seemed to waver in the wind She shook the crumbs from her skirt and caught the chestnut s bridle Scarlet runners were overhanging the bank on that turn of the road near where the school had been when she passed The chimney of the hut was still standing though the wild creepers had thrown long vines about it Supple jack had clambered over the half dozen twisted fruit trees it threw its shower of feathery seeding thistle down over the dark leafed apple branches Deirdre had meant to take Socks into the clearing and let him feed on the wild oats and clover matting it while she investigated the forlorn chimney and the fruit trees and flowers growing near where her garden had been seeking in the tangled undergrowth for the flowers she had planted long ago She had thought she would sit on the edge of the well listen for the great green frogs to go dropping into the water and weave her dreams of the old times for awhile watching the sunlight make a patchwork of dancing light with the shadows the leaves of the fruit trees cast on the beaten yard about the doorway of the hut But she went straight by with scarcely a glance at the grey chimney and the tangled garden greenery across which a tall sweet English rose nodded gaily She only stopped a moment to pull a trail of scarlet runners from the bank near the house She wondered if Davey had remembered the place and the flowers when he passed the day before She looked down at the scarlet flowers with a little smile as she pinned them into her dress But thought of the flowers and of Davey lasted only a moment She was eager to ask the Schoolmaster for an explanation and to hear from him what they had to fear from McNab When she saw Dan with the sun behind him coming towards her on his big grey nag whose nose was so like a kangaroo s that they called him the Roo she quickened her pace her heart swelling with love at the sight of him and at the thought of the concern which had sent him back along the road to meet her She lifted her face to his with a breathless little glad sob when she came up to him What is it he asked his anxiety leaping instinctively at the sight of her face Perhaps I m foolish she said quickly It s something McNab said before I left this morning It wasn t so much what he said but the way he said it And I ve been thinking of it all the way wondering what he meant Is there any harm he could do us What did he say Farrel asked He came just as I was going Deirdre told him and he seemed annoyed that you didn t tell him you were going to day said there was something particular he wanted to talk to you about Then just as I was going he said It was a mean trick clearin out without lettin me know such old friends as we are too and me wanting to stand by him in any little bit of trouble that s coming to him But I ll be coming up to see him one of these days soon sooner than he thinks p raps It wasn t so much what he said as the way he said it made me think Deirdre hesitated looking at her father s face She knew that he was troubled that there was enough in this to disturb him without telling him what else McNab had said to her They rode on in silence the horses brushing The Schoolmaster s head was bent in thought He rode in easy slouching negligent fashion and seemed to have forgotten he was not alone Deirdre spoke first Her voice had a quick low toned intensity I made up my mind on the way to day to ask you what this business is Conal s on and if you are with him or not she said I ought to know I m not a child and I m with you whatever it is I have an idea but you ought to tell me more than ever now that McNab Has his suspicions The Schoolmaster looked into her steady eyes Are you in this with Conal she asked I wasn t until last night he said I changed my mind suddenly and joined him What made you she inquired breathlessly He did not reply I know it was that necklace The reason had come to her instantly I m a good for nothing now Deirdre he said low and bitterly There s mighty little I can do and there ll be less presently I want enough money to get us away from here and keep us by and by when He did not say it but she knew that he meant when the night of blindness had fallen on him It was because you were afraid for me she murmured Afraid because of that necklace who it might have come from afraid He nodded And if you get the money we can go away from here and never come back to the Wirree River any more The Schoolmaster smiled He was surprised at the eagerness of her voice Yes he said but that was what was bothering me I thought you would not like to be leaving the place You were always wanting to come back when we were away before Oh a little fluttering sigh went out of her but I ll be glad to go now Tell me what you re going to do There s moonlight to night and we want to get a mob of wild cattle he said quietly A couple of hundred are eating their heads off in the scrub above Narrow Valley Do you remember when we were living here riding up the range sometimes we d start a cow or steer and it would plunge away through the brushwood scared as a rabbit After the fires more breakaways joined the mob We lost a couple of cows so did Steve others did too Well I told Conal about these beasts a while ago He made up his mind to get them He and Steve s black boy ve run up a stockyard near McMillan s hut in Narrow Valley and Conal and he mean to take the mob with that lot of Maitland s cattle he brought down for fattening not this but last trip up by the Snowy River into New South Wales It isn t as you may say permitted by law he continued But most of the cattle men who can do it do even the squatters when they get a chance Down here they don t think scrub cattle worth the getting Rosses staked a couple of horses a month or two ago and lost a good dog after this mob Cameron doesn t think them worth his while so why shouldn t we have them if we can get them If we get a couple of beasts with brands on them among the wild ones it may be worth drafting them out and driving them back to the hills But the hair grows thick on scrub cattle there s no need to be brand hunting If Conal weren t such a fine stockman we couldn t do it There s nobody like him When we pull off this deal we ll go away you and Conal and I If the price of cattle keeps up there ll be enough to divide among the three of us Davey s got to have his share if he s in Conal s offered him a third to work with him to night and run the mob through to the border He s a man short I ve been trying to persuade Davey to keep out of it but there s a lot of Donald Cameron in him he s as obstinate as a mule Says he wants a job and has got one and that s enough for him for the present They had come within sight of Steve s shanty on the brow of the hill When they drew rein before Steve s Conal lounged out of the house The dogs that had started up snarling at the approach of horses stretched themselves again in the dust by the verandahs and lay with their heads low on their forelegs Deirdre stood a moment looking about her Her face under the flat little yellow straw hat crossed by a red ribband that tied under her chin was very winsome her eyes bright with tears and laughter When she saw Steve in the doorway she ran to him and threw her arms around him Oh it s good to be here again Uncle Stevie she cried He chuckled delightedly There s a woman you are Deirdre A woman y ve grown What else would I grow she asked gaily It s good to be anywhere you are Deirdre Conal said coming up and standing beside them all his love in his eyes She laughed glancing up at him and Steve laughed to see the way the wind blew Davey by the open door watched them but Deirdre did not see him When she moved to go in he stood away from the door for her to pass He saw the scarlet runners that she had tucked into her gown under her chin She heard the catch in his breath and hesitated Conal saw her hand go out to him He saw Davey take it but he did not see the eyes she turned on him nor hear her say with a tremulous quiver of the lips They re saying they re glad to see me Will you not say so too Davey The Schoolmaster coming back from the stables called Conal McNab s been to see Deirdre he said He s got an idea something s in the wind she seems to think It s just as well we fixed for to night Conal It won t give him any time to get busy But hadn t you better be getting down to cover before it s much later It s only a couple of miles by the track Teddy goes There s time enough yet Conal replied his eyes on the open door gaping dark against the brightness of the sunshine Davey followed Deirdre indoors Teddy s bringing in the horses now You d better get in and have something to eat Send Davey to me Farrel said impatiently Conal crossed the verandah It was in the wide low roofed kitchen that he found Davey Deirdre was standing near him Only the glow of the firelight lighted the great room but that was sufficient to show him the sombre steadfast gaze with which Davey regarded the girl and something subdued in the droop of her figure a something of emotion humiliation in her averted head Dan wants you he said to Davey Davey had stared at Deirdre as though he were trying to read in her face what his heart ached to know and she had been waiting for him to read and know waiting for the first sound of his voice with a tremulous expectancy A moment more might have ended the year long griefs and heartache between them But Conal spoke and Davey wheeled out of the kitchen Conal strode over to the table near which Davey bad been He swung his leg over it and watched Deirdre as she put cups and saucers plates and knives on one end of it She cut some bread and buttered it There was a light in her eyes a colour in her cheeks She had watched Davey go with a little gesture of impatience a fluttering sigh Conal saw that She turned to him gaily poured out tea for him chattering but avoided his eyes He watched her with a smouldering suspicion Suddenly he leant forward and caught her hand His swart leathern face swung towards her the brilliant hawk eyes of Conal the Fighter leapt into hers You re to marry me Deirdre he said his voice hoarse and throbbing in his throat She shrank from him with a little breathless exclamation Don t do that he cried passionately Don t look at me like that Deirdre Conal she gasped In his eyes rose the appeal of dumb unfathomable devouring tenderness Say you ll love me say you will Deirdre he begged His face was turned towards her humble and mysteriously moved a strong light in his eyes So absorbed were they that they did not hear or if they heard paid no attention to the grind of wheels on the gravel before the shanty the yelping and snarling of dogs that announced the arrival of a vehicle at Steve s and such late arrivals were not usual I ve had my way with women They ve told you tales of me I know Conal pleaded But there s never a woman I ve cared for but you Deirdre And you he broke off impatiently there s no telling you how I care for you I haven t got words Besides it chokes me to speak of it raises a storm in me that there s no holding By and by when this is all over we ll go away you and the Schoolmaster and me Oh I ll be a good husband You ll give me y r word won t you Deirdre There were voices in the bar beyond but they did not heed them Conal was thinking only of her and his pleading Conal dear Deirdre said If you wouldn t talk like this any more Her eyes fell from his He snatched her hand from the flower under her chin where it had fallen Is it him you love he asked fiercely jerking his head in the direction of the back door by which Davey had gone out Is it Tell me I ll let no man come between you and me Deirdre I ll kill him if he tries to The door from the tap room with the sunlight splashing on the benches and bottles behind it opened and Steve and the new arrival came into the kitchen And who is it y ll be killing now Conal asked McNab genially He glanced from Conal to Deirdre You if you don t get out of my way yelled Conal quivering with rage Brushing past McNab he flung out of the room his spurs jingling They heard the irons on his boots click on the stones of the yard There now cried Steve tremulously He s been making love to you has he Deirdre All the boys ll be making love to you Deirdre And now here s mister McNab come up to see the Schoolmaster most partic lar He was altogether flustered at this unexpected visit of McNab s and at his wits end what to say next Dan was in the paddock with the black boy bringing in the horses for the night s work and here was McNab on the top of it all Deirdre s wits were quicker to work than his She realised what McNab s being in the shanty that night might mean to the Schoolmaster Conal Davey and herself She smiled at him McNab had not seen her smile like that except at Conal and that was on the night of the Schoolmaster s return at the dance at Hegarty s Why there s a surprise to play on me mister McNab she cried merrily You to be coming up the hills to day and never say a word about it this morning There I was riding along by myself and might have had a seat in the cart beside you McNab hardly knew what to make of her greeting He imagined that she had been thinking over his attentions of the morning and was feeling flattered by them for after all was he not Thadeus McNab and the gossips said the richest man in the country side not excepting Donald Cameron himself if the truth were known He thought that she was willing to coquet with him and that too the hint about the gold chain might not have been in vain He warmed to her smile preened himself and gave himself half a dozen gallant airs on the spot Every male instinct in him responded to her effort to be charming And now everybody s had tea but me she continued So we can just sit down and have some together McNab sat down beside her at the big table on which she had spread a white cloth A generous and genial glow suffused him For the moment he forgot the reason of his visit Deirdre had put it all out of his head with that smile of hers The sound of her merry voice set every fibre of him tingling and thrilling as his fibres had never tingled and thrilled before CHAPTER XXXI In the yard Conal told the Schoolmaster of McNab s arrival Settles us Farrel said shortly That s what he came to do And we can t afford to let him think there s anything on He s given his suspicions to M Laughlin most likely and the delay to night ll give them time to get the word out about us along the road So all we can do is lie low play civil to McNab let him think he s on the wrong track Then when this blows over in a couple of months perhaps Conal swore bitterly I could have wrung his neck when I saw him It was all I could do to keep me hands off him he said Don t be giving the game away Conal the Schoolmaster cautioned Mind we re not taking chances It ll be a couple of hours to moonrise after dark Conal said restively glancing at the waning sky If you could keep him busy playing cards and drinking let him think we weren t upset at seeing him and he Seems to be settlin down and looking foolish findin we re all about I might walk out after a bit I could get the beasts with Davey and that blithering half breed Sally s easily worth a couple of men with cattle Do you think I m likely to be able to keep McNab so busy he wouldn t notice you were walking out the Schoolmaster asked impatiently You and Davey had better come in and hang round loose presently He went towards the house His greeting of McNab was as lukewarm negligent and friendly as it always was Deirdre saw no flicker of anxiety in his face McNab s eyes were quick and keen on it for the first few minutes but finding no trace of repressed excitement not a spark of the impatience he expected but only a whimsical smile to convey that the Schoolmaster knew why he had come and was amused at the reason he dropped into the chair he had taken and sought to cover the unexpectedness of his visit by unusual affability He was sitting in Steve s chair by the fire when Farrel came into the room that was kitchen dining room sitting room and living room in general at Steve s Deirdre slipped out with a jug for water as the Schoolmaster came in Glancing over his shoulder he saw her talking to Conal in the yard When she returned her laughter and gaiety surprised him She set a jug of grog between Steve and McNab on the table near NcNab s elbow The Schoolmaster swore beneath his breath when he saw McNab s eyes on her He trembled with rage when he heard Deirdre talking to McNab but her eyes met his reassuringly He caught their message calm and purposeful He knew that she was playing the woman to McNab and why The knowledge angered and humiliated him Davey and Conal came into the long barely lighted room They threw themselves on a bench near the door Conal taking a pipe from his belt smoked morosely Davey did not look at McNab and McNab took no notice of him enjoying his position of importance by the fireside and chuckling over the gay chatter Deirdre threw to him We eat our heads off up here mister McNab she said And sleep Davey and Conal there to see them yawning over their supper to night you d think they d never seen a bed for weeks They ve been saying they re going to turn in early because they ve to go off mustering first thing in the morning and father and Steve would have sat here dozing by the fire for a while and then gone off to bed too I was thinking I would have to take out my sewing and talk to the cat till it was a decent hour to be saying my prayers But now p raps you ll have a game of cards with me though I don t suppose Conal and Davey ll go to bed early now seeing we ve got company Davey sat bolt upright against the wall It froze the blood in his veins to hear her on such terms of easy familiarity with McNab Conal shifted uneasily But we can get along without them can t we Deirdre asked blithely There s no need for them to be sitting up trying to be polite is there None at all McNab chuckled He thought he was getting on very well with Deirdre and that she was playing him off against Conal and Davey in a spirit of pique Right Good night McNab see you in the morning Conal said angrily He swung out of the room Davey followed him And now for the business that brought you McNab Mighty kind of you to have come after me with it The Schoolmaster sat down before Thad McNab facing him squarely his one eye played on McNab s shifty face There was just the faintest ironical emphasis in his voice McNab stirred uneasily Fact is he began his eyes shifted under the Schoolmaster s gaze Fact is we re wanting a school in the Wirree he plunged desperately Before you go away I thought I thought not knowing exactly what your plans were I d have a talk to you about it The place is gettin a bad name with the children growing up not able to make more than a mark for their names In the hills of course you taught the first generation as you might say so the older ones can teach the others coming on but down there it s different We ve never had any school or school teachers The people can t pay enough just a few of them to make it worth your while but if we built a school got em all together it might be a good thing I d maybe put up the money for the school maybe He fidgeted in his seat He did not want to commit himself too far and yet he was irritably conscious of the weakness of his explanation unless he did He had a suspicion than Dan Farrel was laughing at him up his sleeve too An ill humour was rising in him There was an ominous silence a moment of suspicion and suspense A word from either might have been a spark to the long hidden train of enmity between them Deirdre broke the silence She threw down a pack of cards and pulled her chair up to the table All that ll keep till to morrow mister McNab won t it she asked Have a game of euchre with Steve and me now Let s play cut throat it s more exciting Father can think over what you ve said and tell you in the morning Yes yes you think it over Farrel McNab said eagerly He was glad enough to shelve discussion of this urgent matter which had brought him from the Wirree to talk to the Schoolmaster seeing that it was not at all urgent and did not look like it Deirdre pushed the bottle of rum between him and Steve She sat opposite to them the broad yellow glare of the dip on her face The liquor was already beginning to warm McNab s brain His head was steady enough on his shoulders but there was a glow within him He watched the face of the girl before him as in a dream Farrel saw the arabesques of red and blue the cards made under the light as she threw them on the table He heard her gleeful and triumphant exclamations He realised what she was doing for him was sore and angry but there was nothing to do but to play up to her He sat at the far end of the table just out of the light after a while his head drooped Deirdre s laughter flashed Look at father she cried he s dead with sleep Farrel started and stared at her sleepily It s no good your blinking like an owl and pretending you weren t taking forty winks You d better go to bed and have done with it she said He struggled to his feet I m dog weary he muttered Think I will Good night he added after a moment And be sure you see the fires are out before you turn in Deirdre You re not to be staying up late either I won t have her getting too fond of the cards Steve He stumbled across the room to the far end where a screen of brushwood and bagging against the back of the shanty made another small room Deirdre laughed again I m winning all the time she said gaily so they won t want to play long The cards went backwards and forwards across the table to the tune of her exclamations and the chime of her laughter the muttered oaths and exclamations of Steve and McNab Steve was soggy with drink but McNab was not as drunk as he seemed His eyes caught hers with a curious expression when the Schoolmaster had gone from the room And who s the man Conal s going to kill for comin between you Deirdre he asked How do I know she said a little nervously P raps it s the man sent you the gold chain McNab murmured His eyes glimmered at her out of the darkness They tell me Conal went round like a madman looking for Pat Glynn to tell him who it was threatening to break the last bone in Pat s body if he wouldn t speak Yes I think it was him Deirdre said meeting his eyes Conal said if ever he found him he d Conal s a hot head doesn t mean half he says McNab muttered But he means that I m sure Deirdre said And Conal s so strong Look at his hands He could put them round a man s throat and wring the life out of it just as easily as you wring a bird s neck mister McNab And he s a dead shot too Conal they say Eh then it s somebody s neck he ll be wringing or somebody he ll be shooting for sure McNab said For it s not him you ll be marrin and it s not him your heart s set on It s the other The quivering of her face a dilating of the pupils of her eyes that were wells of darkness told him that he had scored He leant forward following up his advantage eagerly And it s not Conal for all his blustering I m afraid of my pretty he whispered His eyes were narrowed the smile in them leaping across his face It s not Conal for all his blustering though I dursay y think he d kill me for love of you And you d break his heart for love of somebody else by way of reward But it s me all the same that ll get you Deirdre pushed back her chair Then she remembered the part she had been playing all the evening She steadied herself putting her hands on the edge of the table and looked down into McNab s eyes laughing Why she cried you re as drunk as drunk mister McNab And so is Steve you d better see each other to bed I m going myself She went across to the corner room next the Schoolmaster s where she slept When she had heard Steve shambling before NcNab to the room off the bar where occasional visitors were put she went back to the kitchen raked over the embers of the fire and put out a flare that was burning low in its tin of rancid fat and belching forth streams of heavy black smoke She opened the door of the Schoolmaster s room The bunk against the wall on which he slept was empty the window open She entered closed the door and sat down by the open window The moonlight was waning The silver light in which the forest had been bathed an hour before was dimmer the shadows the house and sheds cast black against it Where the light struck dead trees they stood out wraith like from the dark wave of the forest Listening intently she heard the distant cracking of whips the long lowing belched and terrified cries of cattle CHAPTER XXXII When McNab awakened in the morning he realised that his sleep had been too heavy for him to know what had happened during the night and that much might have occurred while he was snoring Farrel found him snapping and biting like a trapped dingo His voice rasped his inquisitive suspicious eyes were everywhere But the Schoolmaster had none of the air of a victorious gamester and Deirdre s amiability was of a pattern with what he had imagined it the night before He had heard Davey and Conal ride out at dawn with a cracking of whips and yelping of dogs to wake the saints That seemed to negative the suggestion that they had been out all night They were going to muster a couple of hundred of Maitland s cattle in some paddocks near Red Creek he remembered the Schoolmaster had said Yet by the cold light of early morning he had an unaccountable sensation of having been tricked What with the girl s smiles and Steve s grog he had not been as wide awake as he had intended to be he knew Farrel s readiness to consider the school proposition irritated him It had been a pretext his only anxiety was not to discuss it any more He was all fret and fume to get back to the Wirree Nothing would stay him When he was up in his high seated spring cart there was none of the complaisant geniality of the night before about him He gathered up his reins with a sour smile at the little group assembled on Steve s verandah and drove out of sight at a jolting jog trot The boys got the mob Steve asked anxiously The Schoolmaster took off his hat with a sigh Had the time of their lives he exclaimed It was a big mob rolling fat Deirdre s eyes were still on the track down which McNab had gone to the Wirree I won t say good bye Deirdre he had said as his eyes rested on her for a moment I ll be seein you again soon There had been something in the nature of a promise or a threat in his eyes There was no time to fix brands the Schoolmaster was telling Steve Conal s running these with a couple of score of Maitland s store beasts Drafted out about fifty calves clear skins and a couple of dozen cows put them into the Narrow Valley run wants to do some branding when he gets back I thought he ought to let them go with the half dozen scrubbers turned back to the bush but he wouldn t have it says he can take them along branded with Maitland s next bunch It s a bit risky leavin them there Steve s glance wandered in the direction of the valley lying to the westward between the last line of hills that shut the shanty in from the long roll of inland plains It s a bit risky he repeated But Conal knows his business It ll be all right I suppose There s nobody goes Narrow Valley way but Cameron s men and they re not likely to be going this time of the year seeing the rains are due Conal had a look at the fences when he was up a couple of days ago didn t he Though fences aren t much good Seen a wild cow fly like a bird when she wants to Good thing Conal got away before the rains Dan If the rivers were down he d never ve got through Yes said the Schoolmaster It was a case of now or never And after all he added gravely putting his arm out and drawing her to him it was Deirdre saved the situation But I wouldn t have you do what you did again dear not for all the cattle in the world nor all the money in it She clung to him And I wouldn t do it she sobbed breathlessly CHAPTER XXXIII It was nearly two months before Conal and Davey were back in the Wirree again They rode into the township one evening when the sun was sinking behind the purple range of the hills and making a rosy mist of the dust a mob of northern cattle raised Dust grimed and silent their whips curled on their arms their dogs lean and limping at heel they passed McNab s They might have been any of a dozen cattle men who were about the sale yards that day but McNab recognised them It was those cattle of Maitland s that stood between him and his suspicions of the game Conal and the Schoolmaster were on He thought he knew the part they played in it but itched for a straw of proof He hurried to the doorway and stood in it chewing his underlip as he watched the road weary weedy beasts and their drovers trail out of the town Conal saw him Pullin em up and comin back for a drink in a minute McNab he yelled He lost no chances of letting Thad think there was nothing to hide in his movements He returned to the Black Bull a few moments later and Davey went on to Hegarty s Teddy Steve s black boy and the dogs watched the cattle on the edge of the road Conal and Davey spent few words on each other They went their separate ways by mutual consent avoiding the occasions that mean association or talking On the road during the first days when the cattle were fresh they had swung their stock whips keeping the mob going like one man There had been headlong gallops after breakaways the thrashing in of stragglers the crowding of beasts up steep slippery hillsides with curses and yelping dogs the watchfulness that driving a mob of wild cattle short handed meant nerves and muscles were stretched to the job in hand When a halt was made the first night the mob was ringed with brushwood fires The wildest of the scrub bred warrigals broken by the long day s steady trotting hustled up quietly against Maitland s well fattened store beasts Conal and the black boy took the first watch Davey and Conal the second and Davey and the black the third Ordinarily the fires flaring against the darkness were enough to keep the cattle in a bunch during the night Sometimes when a fire died down and there was a longer gap in the links between the fires a restless heifer or steer made a dash for it and the watcher had to be quick with a burning bough brandish and whack it about the head of the runaway before the beast with a moaning bellow and roar turned back to the mob again It was on the second night out when Conal was sleeping and Davey and Teddy watching that the black stupid with sleep let his fires go down and a red bull and half a dozen cows broke through the ring It looked like a stampede Davey dashed after the bull Conal s dog Sally alert at the first rush of the cattle s movement leapt after them Her long yellow shape flashed like a streak of lightning in the wan light over the plains She raced level with the leader s sleek shoulder and laid her teeth in his hide wheeled him snapping at his nose and dragging him by it until he turned in toward the mob again Davey lashed the cows after the leader Sally flew round them a yellow fury yelping and snapping Conal half asleep flung on to his horse and laid about him with his whip cursing He and the black boy had all their work cut out to keep the mob steady It was a near thing and Conal used his tongue pretty freely when he talked of it He had had very little to say to Davey ordinarily The memory of that evening in the kitchen at Steve s rankled It bred a sense of resentment and secret antagonism which he took less pains to hide from that night He used his lungs to curse Teddy and the red steer but did not talk to Davey unless he had something to say about the cattle or the road From dawn till sunset they rode silently within a dozen yards of each other When they came within easy distance of Rane and the lake settlements they kept the mob moving all night The Snowy was swollen with recent rains when they came to it but Conal had set his mind on crossing without delay He rushed the mob down the incline to the river and drove it into the swirling stream Whip thongs swung together ripped and racked in the clear air The struggling terrified beasts were crowded with no more than their heads above water against the strong currents of the stream until with rattling and clashing horns they clambered up the bank on the further side The last days on the road were taken more easily The mob went slowly eastward grazing as it moved and was in prime condition when Conal handed it over to Maitland in Cooburra on the New South Wales side Maitland was a big man in the district head of the well known firm of stock dealers no difficulties were made about the turn over When Conal had had some talk with him and Davey and he had loafed about the town for a day or two they went out again with half a hundred poor beasts from a drought stricken Western run On the road behind the mob despite their secret resentment Long Conal and Davey Cameron had come to the dumb understanding of road mates It did nothing to break the silence between them Davey yielded Conal an unconscious homage He did it with grudging humility but there was no breaking the barrier of Conal s reserve Notwithstanding his blithe recklessness his daring and bragging enthusiasm there was a stern quality an unplumbed depth in Conal He endured Davey s company but there was that in his mind against him which one man does not easily forgive another As they drew nearer Wirreeford and the thoughts of each took the same track the latent animosity vibrated between them again Conal lost no time in getting out of the township and taking the road to the hills Davey conscious that it was Conal and not he who would stand well in the eyes of Deirdre and the Schoolmaster when the story of the road was told lingered at Hegarty s A brooding bitterness possessed him He knew that Conal had wanted him until this deal was fixed up not only because he was short of a man when Pat and Tim Kearney cleared out but because he was afraid how he Davey might use the knowledge he had told the Schoolmaster he possessed about some other of Conal s cattle dealings As for himself Davey knew that not only had his independence demanded a job but something of the spirit of adventure a recklessness of consequences had appealed to him in the moonlighting of a couple of hundred scrub cattle He wondered what he would do when the Schoolmaster and Conal and Deirdre left the hills He knew that a share of the money the cattle had brought would be his He thought that he would go away from the South when he got it and strike out in some new line of life for himself CHAPTER XXXIV Davey was on his way to Steve s when he saw that the wooden church with a zinc roof which had just been built in Wirreeford was lighted and that people were going into it It was early evening the sky clear above the sharp outlines of the building a few stars quivering in the limpid twilight Davey pulled up his horse to stare at the church The place had been building a long while This was the first time he had seen it up and finished In the paddock beside it was his father s carry all and the grey horse beside it was Bessie old Lass s daughter A vague heart pain caught his breath The wind brought the strain of a plaintive hymn They must be inside his mother and father he told himself He got off his horse and led her into the deep shadow the paling fence threw A longing to see them seized him He stood there trying to hear their voices After a moment he thought he could hear his mother s voice frail and sweet in the singing He remembered how she had sung to him once how she had sung over her spinning wheel and the quaint little song it was The tune of it went flying through his brain with the tap tap of the spinning wheel How gay and dear her voice had been He remembered how he used to love as a child to sit clutching at her dress when she sang like that And the old man In that moment of loneliness he forgot the hard speaking and bitterness there had been between him and his father A wave of tenderness overwhelmed him Pride and a longing for their love struggled in him with a physical hurt beyond endurance He determined to stand there and wait to see them come out of church Friday night services after the cattle sales were an institution as new as the church They had been organised so that christenings marriages and some soul saving into the bargain might be done while the hill folk were down for the sales McNab had done his best to move the parson who had accepted the Wirree as his cure of souls but the young man stuck like a limpet and there was no telling the gossips said how moral and church going he might not make Wirreeford before he was done with it Davey waited and watched When the people came filing out of the doorway he edged along the fence so that he could see their faces as they passed under the flare of an oil can over the door There were not many of them two or three women and children and an old man or two They gathered and were talking about the gateway when Mary Cameron came out Davey saw her face under the light for a moment There was a shine of tears on her cheeks Her figure in the grey dress he knew so well seemed thinner than it used to be Her little straw bonnet was pressed down close on her head her shawl drawn over her shoulders She hurried from the church door without speaking to anyone He saw her hand flutter out to the post by the door as she felt for the step She s been crying and saying her prayers for me he told himself with pain and self reproach He waited to see Donald Cameron come from the church and join her A girl a fair haired girl detached herself from the little gathering about the gate and went towards her Oh there you are missus Cameron dear she said I was waiting to help you put Bess in Davey knew her voice It was Jessie Ross His heart gave a throb of gratitude The young parson came out and slammed the church door behind him Davey s glance flew to the paddock He could see his mother s grey clad figure moving about among the vehicles and the horses The old man s not with her She s harnessing up herself he thought Where is he I wonder She wouldn t have come down alone He saw the heavy buggy his mother sitting erect in it go out along the road He followed at a little distance The buggy halted before the Black Bull A dozen horses dogs lying limp and silent at their heels were tethered to the posts before it The bar was open and noisy with men drinking They were gathered about its narrow benches like flies From the gaping doors a garish light fell But it was out of range of the light that Mary Cameron had drawn up her horse She sat very still The outlines of the vehicle were ruled black against the starlight which rested wanly on her figure and on the sturdy grey horse What on earth is she waiting for Davey asked himself He was going to her when the side door of the Black Bull the door of McNab s parlour as he knew opened Donald Cameron stood in it for a moment Davey saw McNab behind him his crooked figure and twisted face with the withered fringe of hair about it Cameron staggered across the stretch of gravel to the buggy in which his wife sat waiting He climbed into it Will you not let me drive Donald The clear sweetness of his mother s voice came to the boy s ears No Donald Cameron said unsteadily There s no woman living will drive me while I can lay hands on the reins The four wheeler moved away over the long winding road to the hills Davey was stupefied So McNab s got him he muttered glancing at the ramshackle shanty The sign board of the Black Bull with red eyes on its dingy white ground was just visible The glare from the bar lighted it That s why she goes to church alone The old man s drinking he thought He turned to look after the buggy It was bumping and jolting over the ruts and barking the roadside Davey held his breath he saw the mare buck and then take the log culvert over the creek two or three hundred yards from McNab s He s not fit to drive he told himself and swinging into his saddle set off down the road He ll turn the wheel on a log or drive off the road She knows That s why she wanted to drive He followed at a little distance all the way through the hills Sometimes he heard his mother s voice patient and yet edged with a weariness and despair exclaiming Mind there s a bad rut to the left or You re driving too near the edge of the road Donald But steadily without reference to either of them the little horse kept to the track Davey followed them all the way home to the very gates of the house in which he was born Then he turned back into the shade of the trees again Once his mother had looked round and seen the watchful horseman She had not been near enough to see his face He rode in the shadows But he had seen her face and it was a revelation to him A woman must have a good deal of courage to drive beside a drunken man in the hills at night he knew The look on her face hurt him There were death gaps at a dozen places on the road and Donald Cameron was as stubborn as a mule Neither the mare nor his wife could have saved him if he had taken it into his head to drive in any given direction Davey wondered how often his mother had driven like this before He vowed that she would never do it again if he could help it CHAPTER XXXV After the sales on the following Friday when the dust of the yards was heavy in the air and the stock horses stood in irregular drooping lines outside the Black Bull and missus Mary Ann Hegarty s Davey made his way to where on an open space of land the church had been built Wirreeford had out its lights garish oil flares and rush candles and the little fires lighted before the doors of the houses to keep off sand flies and mosquitoes smouldered in the dusk sending up wreaths of blue smoke He had made up his mind as to what he was going to do During the week Conal had been mustering and branding the cows and calves drafted from the scrub mob Davey had worked with him and many of the calves he had scarred with Maitland s double M were the progeny of his father s cattle Half a dozen cows bore the D C brand under their thick hair Conal had wanted to pay him off He had told Davey that there was no need for him to burn his fingers with this business and that he could run the mob to the border or to Melbourne across the swamp if the south eastern rivers were down but he was short handed Davey knew a sense of obligation urged him to stick to Conal until the whole of the mob they had moonlighted together was disposed of Conal had insisted on getting the cows and calves into a half timbered paddock below Steve s the day before and had run a hundred of Maitland s fattened beasts with them He meant to make a start and have the mob on the roads early next morning There was a race meeting in the long paddock behind McNab s that Friday Conal and he had come into the Wirree to show themselves before starting off on their overland journey Almost every man in the countryside was there Davey wondered why the Schoolmaster had not come down to the township with Conal and himself He had been a different man since their return very silent scarcely stirring from his chair in the back room while Deirdre hovered never very far from him anxious and protective as a mother bird She had not told him what had happened while Conal and he were away how the Schoolmaster had said to her one day suddenly It s very dark Deirdre Is there going to be a storm The sunshine was blank and golden out of doors No she had said laughing There s not a sign of one Where are you he asked his voice strange and strained Why I m here just beside you she replied He put out his hands I can t see you he said It s the dark Deirdre My God it s the dark For a long time he had sat staring while she knelt beside him crying murmuring eagerly and tenderly trying to soothe and to comfort him But from that time the dimming and obliterating of the whole world had begun for him The heavy darkness had passed It was not all night yet but a misty twilight He had forbidden her to speak of it so that Davey did not know Conal and Steve had guessed but Davey s mind busy with its own problems was slower to realise what was going on about him It had roused every loyal and fighting instinct in him to see his mother with that look of suffering on her face his father in the way of becoming McNab s prey losing all that he had gained through years of toil and harsh integrity by falling into the pigs trough McNab had set for him It was that stern righteousness of his his sober stolid virtue which had given Cameron the place in the respect and grudging homage of the countryside that his wealth and property alone would not have won for him they had cloaked even his meanness with a sombre dignity and brought him the half jesting title of the Laird of Ayrmuir Davey led his horse into the paddock beside the church where the vehicles which had brought the hill folk to the township were standing The horses out of the shafts their heavy harness still on their backs were feeding tethered to the fence or to the wheels of the carts and buggies He stood beside the high old fashioned buggy that had brought Mary and Donald Cameron to Wirreeford He rubbed his hand along Bessie s long coffin box of a nose and told her on a drifting stream of thought that he had decided to go home to ask his father to forgive him and that he meant to try to get on with him again Her attitude of attention and affection comforted him The people began to come from the church They stood in groups by the doorway talking to each other One or two men came into the paddock to harness up for the home journey Davey put the mare into her shafts He was fastening the traces when Mary Cameron came round the back of the buggy A catch of her breath told that she had seen him Davey she cried He saw her face the light of her eyes Mother he sobbed His arms went round her and his face with the rough beard such a man s face it had become since it last brushed her s was crushed against her cheek I m coming home he said his voice breaking Not now not to night but in a little while I ll ask the old man to forgive me and see if we can t get along better Davey Davey she cried softly looking into his face a new joy in her own Oh but they are sad days these Have you heard what they are saying of your father They tell me that you have been over the ranges Yes Davey said She scarcely recognised his voice It s because of father because of what they re saying I m coming home I won t have them say it after all he s done do you think I m going to let him lose it if I can help it There was a passionate vibration in his voice How did it happen I saw you on Friday and followed you home Oh my boy Her hand trembled on his shoulders It was you then What s come to your father I don t know at all He s not the same man he used to be It s that man at the Black Bull He s got hold of him I don t know how but he s been drinking there often now and he never used to be a drinking man your father I think it was his disappointment with you at first I m not blaming you Davey It wasn t to be expected you d do anything but what you did I m not blaming you But there were the long evenings by ourselves after you d gone He sat eating his heart out about it before the fire and I couldn t say a word He was thinking of you all the time but his pride wouldn t let him speak He was seeing the ruin of his hopes for you He meant you to be a great man in the district Then McNab began talking to him Your father thinks McNab s doing him a good turn in some way but I feel it s nothing but evil will come to us from him The sight of the man makes me shiver and I wonder what harm it is he is planning for us Her voice went to Davey s heart I know mother he said But it ll be all right soon The old man ll pull up when I come home I ll tell him I mean to be all he wants me to be I was a fool before though I don t think I could go on in the old way even now But he ll be reasonable if I go the right way about asking him I ve a deal more sense than I had I ve sobered down a lot can see things straighter I won t be having any dealings with McNab again and I ll get father to cut him The pair of us ll be more than equal to him But I ve got to finish my job with Conal first it wouldn t be playing the game to leave him just now Is it Conal you ve been working with Davey her eyes went up to his anxiously Yes he said Your father s been talking a lot about this work of Conal s she went on a troubled line in her forehead He says the Schoolmaster s in it too McNab s been talking to him about it and they mean to interfere in some way He s talked a good deal about it when he didn t know he was talking driving home in the evenings But McNab s making a fool of him for his own purposes and to do harm to mister Farrel I think I was trying to tell your father that but he wouldn t hear me Oh why have you got yourself mixed up with duffing and crooked ways Davey What did he say Davey asked I don t remember all of it She swept her brow with a little weary gesture It was all mumbling and muttering and I couldn t hear half what he said but it was to do with cattle And to day McNab came over to the yards as soon as we arrived and I heard him say I ve got word where there s a mob with brands won t bear lookin into to night I ll tell M Laughlin and he ll get a couple of men to work with him If you ll come round to the parlour we can fix up what s to be done Davey jerked his horse s bridle pulling him round to mount I meant to take you home myself to night mother he said But I ll have to find Conal and tell him this There s no time to lose I ll be all right Davey she said tremulously I ll go and wait for your father at McNab s He s there now And we re quite safe with Bess taking us home She knows every inch of the way Davey kissed her hurriedly He turned out of the church paddock towards Hegarty s There was a dance in full swing and he thought that Conal might be there But although a new fiddler was in his element and most of the young people in the district jigging Conal was not He went back along the road to McNab s Outside in the buggy Mary Cameron was sitting She turned and smiled when he rode up to her Her face had a shy happiness but the patience and humility of her waiting attitude infuriated him He swung off his horse and opened the door of McNab s side parlour Cameron was sitting at the small uneven table a bottle of rum and glasses before him McNab on the other side of the table leaning across it was talking to him his voice running glibly The light of an oil lamp on the table between them showed his yellow eager eyes the scheming intensity of the brain behind them the lurking half smile of triumph about his writhing colourless lips M Laughlin leaning lazily back in his chair his long legs stretched under the table sat watching and listening to him McNab sprang to his feet with an oath when he saw Davey in the doorway Mother s waiting for you outside he said lifting Donald Cameron by the elbows and leading him to the door He turned on McNab with his back to it I ll be looking after my father s affairs from this out he said And you remember what I promised you if you interfered with me again you ll get it sure as I live He slammed the door Donald Cameron stupid with McNab s heavy spirits was unprepared for this masterful young man whose rage was burning to a white heat He went with him as quietly as as a child Davey helped him into the buggy Keep him away from McNab he said to his mother and I ll be home as soon as I can She smiled the shy happy smile of a girl nodded to him and they drove off Davey went back into the bar of the Black Bull with its crowd of stockmen drovers shop keepers and sale yard loungers Where s Conal he asked Does anybody know if he s left the town yet There was a roar of laughter He was looking for you an hour ago Davey a drunken youngster yelled gaily Was in here n McNab gave him a turn about the Schoolmaster s girl McNab was tellin him you d made up to marry her You should have heard Conal go off somebody shouted Where is he There was a sharpness about Young Davey s question that nobody liked Who McNab No Conal McNab had come into the bar and was standing watching him his face livid Round somewhere lookin for your blood the same jovial youngster who had first spoken cried Seen him go up towards the store a while ago Davey Salt Watson said slowly No one smelt mischief brewing quicker than he He had seen McNab s face He knew Young Davey s temper and the sort of man he was growing He knew Conal too and that no love was lost between them It was an urgent matter would send Davey looking through the town for Conal that way he guessed and knowing something of the business they had in hand as an old roadster always does imagined the cause of the urgency McNab looked as if Davey s anxiety to find Conal had taught him something too Davey flung out of the bar He straddled his horse again and went flying off down the road to the store Conal was not there Someone said he had been and set out for the hills an hour earlier Davey made off down the road again doubling on his track past the Black Bull He thought that he would catch up to Conal on the road and that they would be back at Steve s before M Laughlin and his men were out of Wirreeford The culvert over the creek that he had watched Bess shy at and take in her own leisurely fashion a week before was not half a mile from the outskirts of the township The creek banks on either side were fringed I with wattles and light woods As the mare rattled across it there was a whistling crack in the air Davey pitched on her neck Terrified she leapt forward He clung to her swaying for a while yet never losing his grip He knew that someone had shot him from the trees by the culvert There was a sharp pain in his breast blood welled from it CHAPTER XXXVI The little red horse s pace was as swift as a swallow s Sure footed she flashed on over the long winding roads up the steep hillsides and down them slipping and sliding on the loose shingles but keeping her knees in the cunning way that only the mountain horses know Davey heard the beat of her hoofs until the sound became mechanical Though she was moving she seemed to get no further to throw no distance behind her forging ahead through the darkness Fear and a suffocating weakness began to dull his brain he could not see The sagging pain in his breast ate up his strength With a desperate effort he pulled the handkerchief from his throat and thrust it inside his shirt against the wound He dug his heels into Red s side urging her on A diffused glow of lights loomed before him As if wakening from a nightmare in which he had been struggling to get forward and was held back by mysterious unknown forces he realised that they were the lights of the shanty The mare carried him on into the stable yard The welcome yelp of dogs greeted his ears He flung off her staggered across the yard and burst open the back door He was conscious of Farrel and Deirdre springing towards him of Steve behind them Then surging darkness the swirling tides of dreamless darkness that had been pressing close to him all the way closed over him For a moment he struggled against them trying to speak A few muttered incoherent words were all Deirdre and the Schoolmaster caught He pitched forward Deirdre ran to him The Schoolmaster helped her to lift Davey over on his back She moistened his lips with the spirit that Steve brought quickly There s blood on him father she cried There was no tremor in her voice only a tense anxiety Farrel told her what to do to cut away Davey s shirt where the blood oozed on it Steve went for water and rags as she did so The flickering light of the candle the Schoolmaster held showed the broken and blackened flesh He s been shot it s a slug made that mark Steve gasped when he saw it When he had put a basin of cold water beside her she laid soaked rags on the wound The shock brought Davey a moment of consciousness He moaned stirring with pain His eyes opened He saw Deirdre s face above his and the Schoolmaster bending over him He stared at them unseeingly Then the mists cleared from his brain I m all right he muttered all right He lay quite still Have you got the calves out of the paddock he asked a moment later his voice stronger M Laughlin and a couple of men ll be here presently McNab s got wind of their being in the paddock here Get them out to the valley quick or let them go Where s Conal Steve asked eagerly he ought to be in by now There was a crooked furrow of pain on Davey s face I looked for him before I came out he said Couldn t find him thought he must have gone on ahead I got this his hand went to his breast crossing the culvert over the creek They said at McNab s Conal had been swearing to do for me but I didn t believe it His body sagged and his head went back but Deirdre was behind him she rested his head on her knees Her eyes flew to the Schoolmaster It was Conal she breathed He said he would do it Farrel s face whitened He put no man before Long Conal Deirdre put a pack of wet rags over the wound again and bound it on with a piece of unbleached linen Her eyes went anxiously to Steve He s not going to die is he she asked No Steve muttered cheerfully His eyes travelled the length of the boy s sturdy frame It s not much more than a surface wound though it s cut up the flesh a good deal He d look different if he was goin to kick the bucket If we could lift him into the other room it would be better she suggested The men from the Wirree may be coming Yes the Schoolmaster said As they tried to move him Davey regained consciousness Have you got those beasts out he asked querulously There s no time to lose I m all right Deirdre on one side the Schoolmaster on the other they led him to the room in which Farrel slept He sank wearily on the bunk against the wall The Schoolmaster went back to the kitchen for a moment Deirdre bent over the bunk gazing at Davey s still face anxiously intently It was no time for weeping or exclamation She realised the danger that threatened If M Laughlin and the men from the Wirree came and found the cattle in the paddock below Steve s not only Davey but also the Schoolmaster would have to pay the penalty She went back to the kitchen He s sleeping she said The Schoolmaster and Steve were standing by the door arguing in an undertone together The Schoolmaster turned to go out Where are you going she asked Let those animals out he said briefly It s no good Teddy won t go with them alone He s as afraid of the dark as they are And if M Laughlin s coming we ve got to get them out of the way He s going to try and take them himself to the valley and it s madness he can t see cried Steve Conal was a fool to bring them near the place I told him this morning but he ll take his own way and nobody else s the Schoolmaster replied If he were here now I m going to take them father Deirdre said They re easy enough to drive at night and Teddy ll work with me You watch Davey He ll be right now but in case Besides the place has got to look peaceable and ordinary if M Laughlin comes I can t let you do it Deirdre The Schoolmaster s voice was harsh and peremptory I m going to He recognised his own spirit in her There s no time to lose she said and I know the track to the Valley Conal showed it to me I helped him to bring in the calves yesterday and I haven t been on the roads with you both for the last year without knowing how to manage a handful of old cows I tell you I ll not have it the Schoolmaster interrupted passionately It means as much to me as to any of you she said a little breathless sob in her voice You don t know how much You can t have these beasts with the new brands running the hills now Conal ought to be responsible for them but that won t help us much if they re found here Davey s known to have been working with him and you were suspected of being with him even when you weren t The door slammed behind her Steve followed her out of doors He pulled the chestnut s girths when she had thrown a saddle across his back You can manage the calves of course Deirdre he said Keep m quiet as you can No shouting mind The dogs know night work with cattle s mostly quiet work keep m back You ll not be raising a whip yourself I ll tell Teddy the less crackin the better These beasts ll go quiet enough He and the Schoolmaster watched her flying out across the faintly moonlit paddocks The dogs were soon working round the mob in a far corner where the fence panels were down Deirdre drove them through the opening The black boy was on the road waiting to keep the beasts noses northwards with an adroit flick of his whip It was with an occasional lowing and rattling of horns the brush and rattle of hoofs on the dry timber that they passed out into the shadows of the road The Schoolmaster had no fear that Deirdre could not manage this handful of yearlings and old cows She had chased calves from paddock to paddock when she was big enough to straddle a pot bellied pony and had cracked a light whip which Conal had made for her with a fall a couple of inches shorter than his own round many a restless herd when Conal and he were droving and she was on the roads with them It was the bitterness of not being able to drive himself that plagued Farrel the consciousness of having to stand by and let her do what there was danger in doing incensed him Steve watched the road for sound or sign of men and horses from Wirreeford Then he chased his own two milkers up from the cow paddock and ran them backwards and forwards along the road where the mob had passed to obliterate its tracks A weight was off the Schoolmaster s mind when Steve said that Deirdre and the black were out of sight He knew that by taking the cattle along the narrow tracks on the ledges of the hills she would save them Narrow Valley scrubs would screen them from curious eyes If M Laughlin came the road would tell no tales Steve s cows had made it look as if a mob had passed in the opposite direction beyond the shanty and he and the Schoolmaster had a story to fit the tracks They did not think that anybody but themselves knew the way under the trees on the Valley hillsides Only if M Laughlin brought a tracker would he be able to follow Deirdre Farrel wondered how word had reached McNab and what foolhardiness had led Conal to bring these branded calves to the paddock below Steve s For a moment the idea that Conal baited and maddened with drink might have given some hint at McNab s of the beasts being in Steve s paddock occurred to him And then there was Davey For a while his mind brooded over what had happened to him It was only mad with drink Conal could have shot at a man in the dark he told himself The open fight is his way Conal and he had been friends a good many years and there was something in his estimate of the man which defied the idea that he had shot Davey And yet it looked as if he had Why was he not in He had left Wirreeford an hour before Davey Conal was on the road before Davey And he had been drinking at McNab s He had been taunted with Deirdre s name It was only mad with drink he could have done it the Schoolmaster told himself again And even then a fierce contempt and condemnation surged within him The memory of Deirdre s fired young womanhood of the look in her face of the glow in her eyes told him what this hurt to Davey meant to her Steve watched in the room beside Davey His shrunken crippled limbs ached His head sank on his breast He drooped and slept forgetfully The Schoolmaster strode the length of the kitchen The fire smouldered low He threw some wood on it The crackling flames flashed and played freakishly across the room He wondered if Conal would come where he was The hours passed There was no sound or sign of late riders from the Wirree He opened the door of the hut The night was very still Only a mopoke called plaintively in the distance There was a stir in the room in which Davey was sleeping Farrel heard Steve s voice in startled and sleepy protest The door opened Davey stood on the threshold his eyes with a delirious brightness in them What have you done about those calves he asked his voice quick and clear We are going to let em go Steve gasped You go back and lie down now Davey You can t do that with the new brands on them Davey brushed him aside irritably I m all right now I can take them to the Valley It s a bit of luck M Laughlin hasn t turned up yet P raps I upset his calculations his and McNab s He s not so fond of gettin a move on Johnny Mac Might ve guessed I d got a notion he was going to be busy when I went round asking for Conal Thought we d give him the slip anyway and he d save himself the trouble of coming He laughed a little unsteadily Think I ll get the calves along to the Valley all the same The Schoolmaster took his arm Go and lie down Davey he said If you go wandering about like this you ll bring on the bleeding again Besides Deirdre Where is she His eyes flew searching the room for her She it seemed difficult to say She has gone down to the Valley so it ll be all right he said Davey turned towards the door Don t be a fool Davey The Schoolmaster intercepted him Davey pushed him aside He strode into the stable yard as though nothing had happened to disable him A moment later the Schoolmaster heard the rattle of hoofs on the road Every fibre of him shivered at the boy s contempt the blazing amazement of his eyes He sank into a chair covering his face with his hands CHAPTER XXXVII Deirdre and the black boy drove their straggling herd into the stockyard in the narrow bush clearing walled by trees an hour or two before dawn The stock yards which Conal had put up at the end of Narrow Valley were invisible to any but those who knew the winding track that led over the brow of the hill and through the heavy timber on the spur to the old hut at the foot of it Teddy was pulling the rails of the outer yard into place and Deirdre was going towards the hut Socks at her heels his bridle over her arm when a horseman rode out of the opening into the valley by which they had come She recognised the red horse but did not know that it was Davey riding till he was almost level and dropped to his feet He swayed against the horse s side clutching his reins It s a shame no one to bring the brutes but you he said weakly I came soon as I knew Deirdre put her arm out to him They walked slowly towards the hut Davey became weaker She drew the horses by their reins behind them keeping her eyes on him The ground rocked under his feet We re just there another minute and it ll be all right she said and called Teddy He had seen Davey Cameron s red horse coming into the clearing and ran up to her chattering with fright at the sight of Davey s limp figure Put the horses up in the shed leave the saddles on she said quickly You go back tell boss cows all right Davey very sick man here Although an hour earlier nothing would have induced the boy to brave the darkness alone it was not many moments before he was up on his weedy half wild nag and streaking away towards the cover of the trees and the threadlike track which wound uphill along the spur Deirdre opened the door of the hut Davey took a step or two into it and fell forward She set the brushwood on the hearth alight and threw some broken branches over it to make a blaze There was no stir in Davey when she knelt beside him and a pool of blood lay on the floor where he had fallen She ran out of doors for water In the semi darkness of the hut it was difficult to find anything to put water in but there was a pannikin near the water barrel and she filled that and tore pieces of calico from her petticoat to bathe his wound Groping along the shelves near the fireplace she found the end of a thick rush and tallow candle She did not light it at first because the fire had sprung up and was lighting the room showing its meagre equipment the branding irons and a saddle flung down in a corner a bunk against the wall with a couple of sheepskins over it a table with two or three pannikins and a black bottle on it There was a drain of some spirit in the bottle She poured it carefully into a pannikin and held it to Davey s lips His immobility frightened her She lit the candle and held it close to his face Under the leaping yellow flames it had the mask like stillness and pallor of death Davey Davey she screamed with terror creeping up beside his heavy still body Oh you mustn t die Davey you mustn t Even as she sobbed she thought he was dead She put the spirit on his lips again Oh I ve done all that I can all that I know to do Won t you look at me Davey My heart s breaking You ve not gone Davey You wouldn t leave me It s me Deirdre your sweetheart that s with you Won t you look at me Won t you open your eyes I can t bear it if you don t speak to me Davey She caught him by the shoulder shaking him roughly I won t let you go I won t let you die she cried He fell back from her hands She threw herself across him sobbing brokenly Pressing her face close to his she leant over him murmuring and trying to revive him with a breathless agony of grief and tenderness Oh come back to me Oh you will not die You will not die and leave me she moaned Deirdre that loves you Your sweetheart Davey The cry died away In her frenzy she had not heard the door open Spent with anguish she laid her head against Davey s still one She felt rather than saw that someone was there in the hut behind her She turned Conal was standing in the doorway She stared at him He might have been an aparition so strange he looked there in the doorway with the glimmering night behind him There was something stricken aghast about him He gazed at her as if the tragic woe of her face were a revelation to him He s dead and it s you that have killed him Conal she said at length You love him Deirdre Conal asked So slow and dreary their voices were that they seemed to be talking in their sleep Yes she said and it s my heart that s dead with him I didn t know you felt like that about him Deirdre Conal said a humble awkward air about him That it was Davey lay there dead did not seem to trouble him It was of Deirdre he was thinking in a mazed dazed way and the thing she had said to him You ve done what no woman could forgive you Conal A vibrating passion had come to her voice I never want to see you again as long as I live Conal stared at her a moment then he swung heavily out of the hut into the yard He had the gait of a drunken man She heard him stumble over something in the yard strike his head against a post Then the sound of his horse s hoof beats in the clearing died away Deirdre looked down at the still figure beside her In spite of what she had said she could not believe that Davey was dead that all that young strong body would not move again that Davey s eyes would not open and look at her with the eager questioning glance she had known Something of the horror of his stillness had passed she moistened his lips with the spirit Putting her arms round him she gathered him up against her put his head on her bosom and leaned over him crooning softly as though he were asleep She beguiled herself by saying that he was only asleep and would waken presently What a long time it is she murmured Do you remember Davey dear the night before father and I went away and I ran over the paddock to the corner of the road to see you I was angry you had gone away without wanting to see me yourself You kissed me and I kissed you and I promised to come back and be your sweetheart and we d be married some day And the birds laughed And the red runners were out by the road There was a beautiful sunset and it got dark soon You said it was me you loved and not Jessie Then I went away and it has never been the same since But it will be when you are well and I can tell you how much I want you to love me again She laughed softly Do you remember how we used to go home in the cart from school together and how we used to trot Lass up the hillsides to make her poor old sides go like bellows and you showed me how to blow birds eggs and Jess said I wasn t a little lady to blow birds eggs Her voice ran on with a brooklike tenderness If you d come back we could have all those times again Davey she whispered looking down into his face beneath hers Just when there was the faintest shimmer of dawn in the dim windows a fluttering breath caught her face She put the spirit to his lips again So chafing his hands and calling him with tearful and eager little cries she led him as a mother leads a child just learning to walk from the valley of the shadows Davey opened his eyes They dwelt on her with a deep serene gaze She smiled and went on crooning to him half singing half sighing that beguiling little melody of tenderness and entreaty Warmth came back to him His breath fell regularly and sweetly Deirdre took the sheepskins out of the bunk and put them under him on the floor He slept A faint smile on his mouth his hand sought hers the fingers curled round it She sat watching him a mist of awe and joy and thankfulness gathering in her eyes because it seemed to her that a miracle had been accomplished that night in Narrow Valley hut CHAPTER XXXVIII When the broad glare of the morning sun broke through the dingy windows of the hut Deirdre started from the cramped position in which she had fallen her head leaning wearily against a box She was aghast to find that she had been asleep As she woke with a startled exclamation a hand went out to her Her eyes met Davey s It was as if that encounter in the valley of shadows had brushed all misunderstandings from the love that was like the sun between them Deirdre had wrestled with death for possession of him Her eyes still bore the shadow of the conflict Davey was wan and vanquished He knew that she had wrested his spirit from the darkness on which it had been drifting and the knowledge made a serene joyousness in him Speech deserted them they had no voices to talk with Just this gazing of eyes on eyes told all that there was to tell Later on she went from his side and began to move about the hut gathering the brushwood into the hearth raking over the ashes and making the fire again His eyes followed her The hut was shabby and disorderly by daylight Conal had used it when he was mustering and there was a heap of rusty irons in the corner a few hoarded tins and half empty jars of grease on the shelves some old clothes worn out boots and green hide thongs behind the door The bunk with its sheepskins and a table made of a rough hewn plank on three poles set in the floor were the only furniture Deirdre found a bundle of rags on the shelf near the hearth and searched for the bottle of liniment which she knew was kept for use if any of the men got a broken hand or a kick from a beast in the stock yards Davey knew where Conal had stowed these things while they were working there together He tried to help Deirdre to find them She was at his side in an instant You mustn t move she said a compelling tenderness in her voice He fell back The touch of her hands was a shock of joy His face turned up to her wan with weakness radiant at her near presence His eyes went through hers Deirdre The cry was a prayer also She bent over him her arms encircled him From that first kiss of conscious lovers she withdrew a little tremulously Oh you must be still she cried If the bleeding begins again you ll never be strong You must lie quiet now and I ll see if I can find some food There s sure to be flour and some oatmeal about On the shelf in the corner by the hearth Davey said And there was tea in a tin there a day or two ago She found them and they breakfasted on a weak gruel and tea without milk She had helped Davey on to the bunk against the wall and spread the sheepskins under him when the Schoolmaster and Teddy came into the yard Farrel carried a bag of food and a couple of blankets strapped to his saddle Deirdre met him out of doors The sight of her reassured him She told him what had happened during the night of Davey s long stillness and insensibility and of Conal s coming a few hours before the dawn The Schoolmaster went into the hut Father says Deirdre went straight to Davey he doesn t believe it was Conal fired that shot at you Her eyes went out to him troubled and beseeching I can t help thinking it was myself though I d be glad not to He s been such a big brotherly sort of man to me always Conal and it hurts to think he could do a thing like that She continued after a moment Father says Conal came in after you d gone last night He d been drinking but his voice told him that he didn t do it As soon as he knew you d come after me the way you were he rode out after you for fear you mightn t have been able to reach here Do do you think it was Conal Davey Davey turned his face to the wall He could not bear to hear her defence of Conal her solicitude and desire to think well of him in spite of everything He had no doubt in his own mind The memory of that whistling shot from the dark trees the agony of his long ride through the hills came back to him All I know he said bitterly is that I was looking for him before I left the town to tell him what mother had told me about the raid McNab and the old man and M Laughlin were getting up At the Black Bull they said they d been baiting Conal about me and he d gone out looking for me promising to do for me Some one said he d gone to the store I went there and Joe Wilson told me he d seen Conal riding out an hour earlier I thought I d catch him up on the road It was from the trees by the creek the shot came and Red took fright There s nobody else got a grudge against you Davey Not that I know who d want to settle me that way McNab of course hasn t got any love for me You went up to the store and straight out along the road past the Bull the Schoolmaster asked Yes but I d seen McNab in the bar a couple of minutes before It couldn t have been him Farrel threw out his hand with a gesture of doubt and disappointment Deirdre says she s heard Conal say that he d do for you Davey he said but she didn t think he meant it Just his hot headed way of talking McNab must have maddened him filled him up with drink I can t tell you how it goes against the grain to believe he could have done a thing like this and yet it looks like it Was he back when you came away this morning Deirdre asked No the Schoolmaster replied Ask him when he comes in whether he did or did not fire at Davey she said I ll take his word Will you Davey Yes Davey s tone was a little uncertain The Schoolmaster went to the door again Davey called him back with a restless movement What are you going to do about those beasts he asked querulously They re better here than at Steve s but of course if M Laughlin gets a tracker it wouldn t take him long to find them Teddy s got them in the four mile paddock this morning but they ought to be moving Perhaps Conal the Schoolmaster began Oh yes I forgot Conal he ll take them Davey fell back Why can t you take them yourself he inquired The Schoolmaster met his eyes for a moment Lost my nerve he said with a little grating laugh and turned out of doors Deirdre s eyes sparkled with anger Oh she gasped breathlessly how dare you Davey How dare you Davey morose anger in his eyes stared at her You re angry because he let me go out last night she said Don t you know he s almost helpless that he can just see dimly in the broad daylight All the world s going dark to him and it s breaking his heart eating the strength and the soul and the courage out of him to stand by and let others do things for him Consciousness of what he had done came slowly to Davey Oh it was mean and cruel and cowardly to hurt him like that Deirdre cried passionately and ran out into the sunshine after her father When she came back into the hut Davey with a tense white face was standing near the door I ought to be flayed alive but I didn t know I didn t understand he said There was no quieting or comforting him Will he ever forgive me Do you think he will Deirdre His face was clammy with the sweat of weakness It was more than Conal did that Conal wouldn t have done it Deirdre went for the Schoolmaster He came into the hut again He and Davey gripped hands Then the Schoolmaster led him to the bunk again and stretched him out on it It s all right my boy All right he said brokenly You lie still now and let Deirdre look after you Davey s vigorous youth rebelled at the days of idleness which followed The wound knitted quickly his weakness vanished as it mended Conal had disappeared No one had seen or heard of him since the night of the Wirree races The Schoolmaster and Deirdre had accepted his disappearance as silent proof of his having fired the shot that had almost cost Davey his life When they went back to the shanty Steve talked incessantly about Conal Although no more had been heard of M Laughlin and the threatened raid had never been made he was not easy about that half hundred head of newly branded beasts in the Narrow Valley paddock At the end of the week Davey took the bit between his teeth I m going to take that mob to the Melbourne yards he said We can t run them any longer in the Valley It s too risky Davey the Schoolmaster said McNab s too quiet to be harmless and there s only one man could run the mob with safety And that s Conal Davey asked There s not a man in the country like Conal with cattle He knows every by path and siding on the ranges Then he s hail fellow well met with the men on the roads There s not one of them would give him away the Schoolmaster said I could run them The line on Davey s mouth tightened And safer than Conal I ve been thinking Some of the cows have father s brand on them Most of the calves ought to have the D C by rights I suppose They ve got the cut of our Ayrshires though Conal s done the double M s pretty neatly on them What s the old man s will be mine some day and so they re in a sort of way my cattle too I can say I don t think Ayrmuir had any right not much anyway to them if we couldn t get them The old man wouldn t risk a couple of horses on the off chance Rosses and Morrisons lost three horses when they had a go for em besides there isn t a man on our place could have yarded them Conal got them We were with him You can hold his share for this batch when I bring it to you But I m going to drive saying they are Donald Cameron s cattle So they are most of them I ll be driving my own cattle as a matter of fact though it may be realising on the estate a forced loan from the old man you may say My name will carry me through and when the deal s over I can make it right with father I m going home Can t think what Conal means leavin em so long Steve muttered irritably We can t have them on our hands any longer Davey s voice was short and irritable too You re right Davey The Schoolmaster spoke slowly thoughtfully What you say makes the getting rid of them sound easy but I hardly like the idea of Taking your share after the way I ve put it Davey interrupted But as far as I m concerned they re Conal s beasts and your s and mine because we got them Nobody else could and they weren t any good to anybody eating their heads off in the hills But for all the world it s as if I had contracted with you to do it on behalf of the estate Ayrmuir gets a third of the profits I ll hand it over to the old man and as likely as not he ll be glad enough to see it for a couple of dozen breakaways and scrubbers he never expected to make a penny out of again The Schoolmaster s gesture of impatience was one of resignation also It s a specious argument Davey he said but I wish to heaven you d kept clear of the whole business That evening Davey called Deirdre and they wandered down the hillside watching the sun set on the distant edge of the plains that stretched northwards and inland from the rise beyond Steve s I m going to morrow he said and told her of the promise he had made his mother I feel it s up to me to carry this job through but when it s over I m coming back going home When I come back will you marry me Deirdre Yes she said simply But if you d only give up going Davey Davey s face had a look of his father for the moment a sombre obstinacy There s something in the game he said You re on your mettle to carry it through when you ve begun But you needn t worry I ll be all right My story ll be good enough if there is any trouble Deirdre sighed But I can t bear the thought of your going she said If only you wouldn t CHAPTER XXXIX Deirdre watched Davey going out of Narrow Valley in the dim starlight of the early spring morning the mob hustled by Teddy and the dogs a stream of red and brown and dappled hides before him The cows lifted their heads bellowing protestingly their breath steamed before them in the chill air The horses and dogs heeling and wheeling them and the trampling hoofs of the herd beat a wraith like mist from the cold and still sleeping earth Davey was to steer by the stars till he came to a point on the road that would give him a clear and easy descent to the sale yards on the outskirts of Melbourne It was too late in the year to try the usual route He was to take a winding track on the edge of the swamp that lay between the southern hills and Port Phillip Only the blacks knew the paths through the brown feathered reeds and dense ti tree scrubs Conal had tried to cross it once in the summer and got bogged there losing a score of fine beasts If Conal could not find his way across it the Schoolmaster did not think that Davey could It was only in case of untoward happenings that he advised trusting to the black boy s knowledge of the tracks through the swamp and taking to the cover of the moss dark almost impenetrable scrub that covered it Davey had given his word to the Schoolmaster that if he met Conal he would give the cattle over to him and return to the hills I d give everything I ve got in the world if you d never been brought into this business he had said deeply moved just before Davey rode out Father s blaming himself Davey Deirdre said Davey wrung the Schoolmaster s hand I wouldn t have been in it if I hadn t broken my word to you he said I promised you when I brought up that first mob for Conal I d clear out after didn t I But Conal offered me the job and you bet I wouldn t ve been out of a moonlighting either if I could ve helped it But this business I never meant you to be in it Farrel said bitterly I never meant to be in it myself Davey Circumstances were too strong for me A drowning man clutches a straw they say Deirdre had ridden to the valley She had watched the mob go out across the plains watched until men cattle horses and dogs a moving blur in the mists disappeared altogether and the faint lowing of the beasts came to her no longer She waited impatiently for news of Davey though she knew none could come for weeks There were few travellers on this overland track Conal and one or two others had used it with Teddy to guide them if they wanted to take the short cut across the scrubs of the swamp There were well defined northern paths into New South Wales but it was a long and roundabout journey to Port Phillip from the southern ranges Father Deirdre said impulsively one morning soon after Davey had gone I m going to see missus Cameron I ve been thinking she must be anxious about Davey and wanting news of him She ll be glad to see you no doubt he said There s one subject you won t speak to her of though Deirdre he added after a moment s hesitation She knew what he meant He did not want missus Cameron to know that his sight was almost gone Yes I understand Deirdre said Socks as sensitive to the keen air the sunshine the fluty ripplings and joy callings of the birds as Deirdre was rollicked gaily down the track to Cameron s His white stockings flashed as he thudded along his unshod hoofs fell with a soft beat on the grassy waysides Deirdre sang softly to herself as they passed under the arching trees Her thoughts went drifting away dreamily to the time when Davey would come back and she would call going to Ayrmuir going home It was an eager tremulous greeting that missus Cameron gave her It s you dearie she said I am glad to see you indeed What can you tell me of Davey He was to have come home to us and I haven t seen him for weeks There was much to tell and yet much that the girl in her tender solicitude for Davey s mother could not tell It would terrify her to know that someone had shot at and nearly killed him that Davey had an enemy who would go to these lengths When he was back with her he might tell her himself what had kept him away but it would stretch her soul to the limit of anguish Deirdre knew to tell her now Yes Davey told me he was coming home Deirdre said smiling Her eyes met Davey s mother s with their secret no secret but Mary Cameron was thinking only of her boy and in her anxiety although she realised that Davey and Deirdre understood each other she did not ask any questions and Deirdre said nothing thinking it was for Davey to tell his mother I knew you d be anxious about him the girl said with a sigh and that s why I came He s gone overland with some of Maitland s cattle but he ought to be back in a week now and then he ll be coming straight here Ah dear Tears welled in missus Cameron s eyes How glad I ll be Deirdre went with her into the well known parlour and they sat down and talked together awhile There was a new and tender understanding between them missus Cameron talked of her loneliness and the joy Davey s home coming would be to her Oh I have prayed so Deirdre she said It has nearly broken my heart being without him what with the long nights here and the sorrow that has come upon us That was all she said of the other trouble yet it had almost broken her and had taken all her fortitude and patient wifeliness to endure An instinct of blind fidelity was part of Mary Cameron When Deirdre was going she kissed her There was lingering affection in the pressure of her lips My heart goes out to you dear she said It s almost as if you were my own child I love you like that Deirdre It was good of you to come to day Now I will get Davey s room ready for him and the little room you used to sleep in You ll be coming to stay with us again when he comes home won t you Oh I could laugh and cry with happiness to think the old times will come again Deirdre laughed a little laugh of shy joyousness She could not tell missus Cameron that she would be coming to stay with her altogether soon Davey will be able to get on better with his father now missus Cameron continued giving expression to her dreams He will be able to get Donald to do what he wants without angering him His father has lost many of the ways he had and you wouldn t believe how he loves the boy in spite of everything It s a strange dour way a man has of loving sometimes dear hard to bear It s love all the same not love the way women love that tries to make life easy for the dear one It s all tenderness and sacrifice a woman s love Deirdre Sometimes a man loves that way too Deirdre said She had swung into her saddle and was looking away before her over the mist wreathed hills For a moment her eyes lay on missus Cameron s face with its grey green eyes delicate contour exquisite line of lips loving and lovable Her face had lost its youthful freshness but its beauty was unimpaired so tender its expression so compelling and pure the light of her eyes though a lonely soul looked out of them pained and wondering Deirdre pressed her heels into the chestnut she and the horse disappeared among the trees She talked of missus Cameron to her father It would break your heart to see the change in her she said But I can t see her any more he said brusquely Deirdre realised the wound that she had opened She had never quite forgiven Davey s mother for the fact that Dan had lost his sight on her account missus Cameron never seemed to realise it and that had angered the girl Perhaps missus Cameron did not know what the Schoolmaster had done for her Deirdre told herself sometimes But Davey knew and she could hardly believe that missus Cameron was ignorant though she never seemed to take the Schoolmaster s injury as a personal matter Deirdre looked down on his face dark and sombre now Scarcely anything of its old reckless gaiety was left Lines had been carved on it by bitter thought and brooding on the utter night he was travelling into She rubbed her soft cheek against his Tell me he said with an effort how she looks Deirdre She looks the girl said hesitatingly She looks I can t explain how as if something that burned inside of her had gone out But she s beautiful like she used to be he begged She used to have a way of looking at you that I never saw with anybody else His voice was trembling Yes Deirdre said slowly She s beautiful like she used to be though her hair s got grey in it and the colour of the pink orchids has gone out of her skin And she looks at you that way I know what you mean as if she were seeing not only the outside you It s her eyes and the way her lips lie together tell you about her real self and make you love her even when you don t want to The Schoolmaster threw himself back in his chair Deirdre gazed at him then she turned away with a little sigh His face was almost a mirror to her now that he was blind She could see his thoughts in it It was sacred to her that thin lined face all its reverence and emotion but she could not bear to look at it and feel that she was stealing his secrets when his eyes could not guard them from her She went to the seat under the window and sat there thinking idly aimlessly for awhile Recollections of missus Cameron were always those of a woman occupied with her home her husband and son Deirdre wondered how her father came to be in missus Cameron s debt as he had said he was how it was he owed her anything at all She seemed to owe him so much The cows had gathered up to the fence near the bails for the milking They were lowing quietly the sunshine making a luminous mist behind them the birds were laughing and hooting among the trees Deirdre rose to go and do the milking but Steve burst open the door from the tap room A moment before there had been a clatter of hoofs on the shingle Steve stood on the threshold the muscles of his face twitching It s Pete M Coll from the Wirree he gasped He says they ve got Davey at Port Phillip for duffing CHAPTER XL It was early next morning that Cameron s cart with its slowly moving heavy grey horse drew up before Steve s and missus Cameron herself got down from it The Schoolmaster was pacing the long kitchen He had not been still a moment since Pete M Coll brought his news Pete had gone back to the Wirree to see if anything more had been heard of Davey whether he was to be brought back to the district for trial or was being held in Melbourne The story of his arrest had come through on the vessel that brought stores to Port Southern but it was very vague A rumour had reached the Albatross an hour or two before she was sailing that a young man saying he was David Cameron Young Davey Cameron of Ayrmuir s son had been arrested for cattle stealing and that he and a nigger were being detained on the charge Pete had not returned but the Schoolmaster set about making preparations for a journey Deirdre had packed his tucker bag his blanket was rolled up to strap on his saddle Which way are you going Deirdre asked She knew that the schooner would probably be gone before he could reach the Port and that it would continue its passage along the coast to Rane before turning back and making for Port Phillip He had thought of all that too I ll ride he said What are you going to do she asked anxiously I don t know Out of the chaos of his thoughts no plan of action had yet formed Then missus Cameron came Deirdre brought her into the kitchen It s missus Cameron father she said and left them Farrel turned in the direction of her voice He made a movement towards missus Cameron who was standing just within the doorway His hand went out with a seeking motion I I can t see you he said a little querulously Her hand met his She knew from his face the desperate and troubled state of mind he was in and he hers from her fluttered breath and the sob that went with it I ve come to ask you to keep a promise she said Yes You remember the promise For a moment he did not remember any words any formal undertaking but he knew to what she referred You said long ago her voice was scarcely audible that if ever you could do anything for me or mine Yes he said If ever I can do anything I want to She sank into a chair Her hands flew to her bonnet strings She untied them You know what it is I want you to do she asked Yes He felt for his chair It was near the one she had taken He sat down and turned his face towards her He could just see a dim outline of her against the morning brightness To him she was a grey figure with a heavy black shadow about her He strained to meet her eyes again The very magic of them seemed to illumine her face for him show him its beautiful outlines And yet perhaps he did not see them at all It was all memory and vivid imagining that gave him the illusion He did not see her face thin and lined with pain and loneliness the patience and vague disappointment that had come to dwell in her eyes I want you to get the boy off for me to have this charge removed she said tremulously The Schoolmaster knew that this was what he had meant to try to do but now that she had asked him he told himself that it must be done The means employed to lift the burden of blame from Davey s shoulders he knew would have to be very sure ones Davey himself would not say anything to implicate Conal or anyone else Evidently the story of his droving for Donald Cameron had not carried much weight Yes the Schoolmaster said I will He had no doubt of himself now that she had appealed to him Oh she cried after a few moments I knew that it was some mischief to us McNab was planning I can see it all now I thought it was you or Conal he was trying to get at McNab told Donald that cattle were being moonlighted most of them Ayrmuir breakaways and wild cattle at the back of our hills But he did not know that Davey was droving for Conal not till he asked me this morning and I told him I didn t know myself till a few days ago when Davey came to me after church Then he said he d been working with Conal and I begged him not to any more and told him what his father and McNab were trying to do He promised to come home but he never came I was afraid to tell his father for fear he d never forgive him and every day I thought Davey d be coming in the gate McNab knew of course Everybody else in the Wirree seems to have known but us that Davey was with Conal It was to bring our pride in the dust to make Davey s father the shamed and disgraced man he is he did it But Where s Conal How is it he s not there with Davey Why did Davey ever go in for this business Why are you in it I thought that you would never be doing anything again that would bring you under the law The distress and reproach in her voice hurt him I thought so too he said bitterly He did not attempt to excuse himself and the sightless eyes that gazed at her did not accuse His mind was back to the subject between them This is the concern of two men I and another he said Davey was no more than a hired drover Besides Where is Conal missus Cameron asked Away His tone forbade further inquiry There was silence a moment How does mister Cameron take it He s broken altogether Would he the Schoolmaster hesitated would he consent to say that Davey was droving for him There were D C cows in the mob missus Cameron hesitated I think he would do anything anything in the world to get the boy off she said I don t know that it would do whether it would work the Schoolmaster said a little wearily Probably Davey has said that he was putting the mob through for his father He said he would if anything happened If inquiries are made will you tell mister Cameron to back up the story it s the only chance Davey may have been only detained until it could be ascertained whether he is Donald Cameron s son and whether Cameron authorised him to sell the cattle It would be a splendid opportunity to spoil McNab s game if it could be done But if for some reason I don t know of yet it can t be worked there s another way You mean you ll say you were responsible Davey was only a drover with you missus Cameron asked Yes She uttered a little cry It was what I meant you to do but I can t bear to think of it she said She covered her face with her hands The Schoolmaster was thinking deeply too the iron of despair had entered his soul What will it mean she asked looking up at him Three years hard labour on the roads of the Colony or other place as the judge may direct he quoted his voice a little uncertain Tell me she said rising a tide of feeling carrying fire to her eyes dignity to her figure and a subtle timbre to her voice would you rather I had not come Would you rather I had let Davey take his punishment I m not sure that he does not deserve it in spite of what you say No Farrel cried passionately He grasped her hand His face fell over it It is the best thing in the world for me to do something for you he said missus Cameron caught her breath when for a moment he carried her fingers to his lips You ll look after Deirdre he said if Yes She stood uncertainly looking at him a pitiful quivering emotion in her eyes then she moved away Good bye he said mechanically hearing the brush of her garments as she left the room Good bye she said Deirdre saw that missus Cameron s cheeks were wet with tears when she climbed into the buggy again She did not speak but drove silently away Deirdre had been rubbing Bess s nose and feeding her with handfuls of grass When she went back to the kitchen her father was sitting with his arms over the side of his chair his head on them She flew to him her arms entwined him But he pushed her away with unconscious roughness Go away he whispered An angry pain at his grief at missus Cameron who in some way had been the cause of it surged through Deirdre Pete M Coll rode into the yard He threw his bridle over the hitching post Any news Deirdre asked He shook his head and went into the kitchen Later the Schoolmaster called Steve in She heard Steve s voice raised complainingly her father s with settled determination against it Her heart was sore Why was he not telling her his plans as he was telling Steve She heard him arranging to take Pete with him to Melbourne I m going too father she cried flashing into the kitchen What have I done that you shouldn t tell me what you are going to do You re talking to every one else and my heart s breaking The Schoolmaster drew her into his arms You re not coming dear he said You re best out of this I want you to wait here with Steve till Davey comes back And you too father He held her close in his arms Yes me too of course darling He crushed her face against his It s great times we ve had together my darling isn t it he asked I don t like going without you but it s better It s great times we ve had together and now I m an old blind devil that wouldn t be able to look after you properly in the town It s not a nice place for a girl to be going about in and I d be no good to look after you no more than a burden Pete here ll be my guide and take me by the track round the swamp to Melbourne He says he couldn t do the short cut across the swamp but he knows the roundabout track all right We ll have to be busy on Davey s account then You ll be a good wife to Davey won t you darling And happy as the day s long when he gets back But you do love me too don t you darling black head For God s sake say you love me His voice broke Deirdre flung her arms about him reckless of all but that some trouble within had forced that cry There was a bitter undertone in his words that she did not understand although she associated them in some way with Davey s mother and the disturbance and mental turmoil into which Davey s arrest had put him I love you she cried more than all the world more than Davey more than anyone or anything in it He stooped and kissed her What a jealous brute I am he murmured to have taken that from you There s nothing you haven t told me she asked searching his face No he replied turning his face from her and burying it in her hair You haven t told me anything at all of what you re going to do to get Davey off she said sharply Oh well he parried I don t know I haven t decided it will depend upon circumstances He recognised the anxiety of her voice You aren t going to try and get him off by putting yourself in his place are you she asked doubtfully You ve really been less in the thing than he has and he s young and strong and Oh no the Schoolmaster laughed lightly I wouldn t try to do that He went out to the stable yard When the Kangaroo was saddled he took Deirdre in his arms again She watched him cantering down the road on the great raking grey towards the inland plains Pete M Coll on one of Steve s horses a few yards behind him The thought of that cry of his troubled her Why had he said For God s sake say you love me The flood of her love for him rose and filled her the love of all those early years when he had been mother brother and playfellow Little pictures of his tenderness of his gay good fellowship of his care flitted before her Because for years it had moved so tranquilly she had scarcely realised the depth and power of that passionate affection but now that he had called for it showed his need of it as he had never done even in the old days it surged tempestuously CHAPTER XLI So the Schoolmaster s swearin young Davey Cameron was no more than a hired drover to him said McNab He was talking to Steve What s that you re saying Deirdre came to the doorway McNab had just arrived A skinny raw boned boy from the Wirree was taking his horse and cart to the stables She had seen it draw up a few minutes before and wondered why McNab had come She had heard Steve s greeting to him and McNab s reply Oh there you are Deirdre he said shuffling towards her and holding out his hand She disregarded it looking into his eyes McNab was in a good temper The smile wrinkling the skin about his mouth told that he had some secret cause for being well pleased with himself and the world at large He could afford to forgive her What s that you were saying about father she asked Haven t you heard Why it s out of the world you are here Steve It s the talk of Wirreeford this business of young Davey duffin And the Schoolmaster says it s none of Davey Cameron s business but his I wasn t sure Farrel was in it meself before had me suspicions of course but nothing to go on Conal s business I knew it was but the devil who gave him long legs knows where he is He knew when to leave Smells a sinking ship like a rat at sea Conal does Neither Deirdre nor Steve spoke McNab s eyes wandered from one to the other of them He continued chuckling as though enjoying the joke He s saying the Schoolmaster that Young Davey was a good stockman and when he quarrelled with his father he gave him a job and was paying him wages reg lar till he got something else to do or went home again And there was no more to it than that Davey of course tried to bluff things out at first but there was an information out signed by Cameron so the story wouldn t wash that he was on D C s business Deirdre clenched her hands as McNab giggled there was a malicious slow glimmer in his eyes as they rested on her When Cameron got a suspicion someone was liftin cattle from the back hills he was busy enough givin information keen enough to catch the moonlighters But he didn t reck n on his boy being taken in charge of a mob Troopers in Melbourne didn t believe Davey s yarn about being his father s son seein they d got Donald Cameron s written word against mobs coming from the South to the markets thereabouts Farrel s story is a good un He says he struck a bargain with Donald Cameron as agent for Maitland company stock and store dealers of Cooburra New South Wales a couple of years ago These beasts were to have gone over the border when next some of Maitland s stockmen were in the South but the rivers were down the stock rollin fat and prices up so he thought it a pity to lose the market and sent Young Davey with m round the swamp to Melbourne yards not telling him details of the deal Davey havin had a difference with his father was glad of the job it s a sort of challenge to Cameron Clever of the Schoolmaster I wonder what D C ll do about it He can see it s a let off for Davey if he stands to it a let off for the Schoolmaster too If he doesn t well I think Davey n your father my dear ll spend a bit of time on the roads The queer part of the business is that though half a dozen men s beasts may be in the mob the brands ve been so neatly faked no one can swear to em All the clear skins ve got Maitland s brand on So the charge of cattle stealin ll stand or fall be what Cameron says or does A couple of white faced cows with D C on m are the only give aways in the lot He won t put his own son away blurted Steve P raps P raps not McNab fidgeted Hardly likely Deirdre cried Mick Ross n Bud Morrison were in here couple of nights ago Steve went on And they said they d swear blind none of their beasts were in the lot All the hill settler s d be prepared to do the same they said rather than put Davey or the Schoolmaster in a fix Y es snarled McNab so I m told Deirdre laughed His disgust and disappointment delighted her You didn t reckon on that did you mister McNab she said She went off down the road to the paddock where Steve s two milking cows were and presently drove them one swinging before the other into the yard at the back of the shanty She was easier in her mind than she had been since the Schoolmaster had gone even since Davey rode out of Narrow Valley But the sight of McNab disturbed her She bailed and leg roped the cows Wondering why he had come as she milked and the milk fell with a gentle swish into the pail between her knees she could not believe that it was merely to bring them the good news that Davey and the Schoolmaster were likely to get off She turned the cows into the paddock beside the bails and took the pail of warm sweet smelling milk indoors When she went into the kitchen McNab was sitting in the big chair by the fire He looked up at her The firelight showed his face and the smile that glimmered on it He seemed to be remembering and with triumph that other night when he had sat there Steve crouched on the bench opposite him was shivering and sobbing Deirdre put the milk in its place What s the matter What have you done to him she cried facing McNab He took a heavy chain from his pocket It clanked with a dull slow sound Steve started from his chair Oh send him away Deirdre send him away he sobbed Deirdre knew the meaning of the trick She had heard it often It was an old dodge to discover escaped convicts this clanking of a chain near them A man who had worn irons never forgot the sound they made and whenever he heard it would start and tremble The rage that burned to a white heat kept her silent a moment You d never ve thought it would you Deirdre Him a lag and you a lag s daughter McNab chuckled It s a lie Is it You ask Uncle Steve It s been a puzzle to me more n eighteen years why two chaps from the Island never came for the help that was promised m and they with a reward out against them I knew they d got safe up the river because a boat was found on the bank beyond where M Laughlin s is now I meant to touch a bit of that reward too but it s never too late to mend as they say You d never send us back to the Island Steve cried You d never do that McNab Wouldn t I McNab laughed softly He was enjoying the spectacle of Steve s whimpering the trembling of his withered limbs the sense of power that it gave him You Deirdre gasped but anger choked her There now he interrupted I wouldn t be calling me names if I were you Deirdre After the pretty way you treated me a month or two ago too Would you be forgettin my dear It would be a pity to make an enemy of me as I said once before It s a bad enemy I make they say and a nasty temper I ve got when I m roused But there s nothing I wouldn t do for you Deirdre You can twist me round your little finger if you like The firelight was in his eyes See here Steve he said I ve got something to say to Deirdre She s a sensible girl got her head well screwed on We re old pals me n Deirdre You go outside while I talk things over with her We ll see what can be done Steve scuttled across the room He was crying helplessly and pulled his coat sleeve across his nose as he went to the door Now McNab said genially you sit there Deirdre and we can talk Deirdre took the chair Steve had left She sat very stiff and straight in it She knew what was coming There were fear and loathing in her eyes But McNab only saw how great and dark they were how red the curve of her lips how full of vigour and grace the lines of her strong young body You know what ll happen if it s known Farrel s an escaped convict he asked Yes Port Arthur irons n the rest of it Well nobody need know lest I like There s a couple of lads can prove who Steve and y r father are but they won t lest I like What are you going to like That s what I want to know Deirdre cried her hands gripping the arms of the chair Depends on you my dear He leant forward There was appeal in her eyes But her eagerness her hunted wild bird air only stirred in McNab a lust for the capture and taming of her If you promise to marry me nothing ll be heard of it he said Deirdre was not surprised She had expected something like what he had said The sound of it stunned her nevertheless P raps the Schoolmaster ll get off this affair of the cattle but that s only three years McNab said The other d be till the expiration of his sentence probably for the end of his life my dear n Steve a month or two d be the end of him You re the price of their freedom You pays y r money and takes y r choice Deirdre Deirdre did not hear him After all she was thinking this was a proposition She was even grateful for it Anything seemed better than helplessness hopelessness the terrible prospect of not being able to avert this ultimate catastrophe which threatened Dan All that had been sensitive to joy or sorrow in her seemed dead She realised only one overwhelming necessity One fact crowding out all others filled her mind Thad McNab had said that Dan would have to go back to the Island and that she could prevent it She did not think of Davey at all except to remember vaguely that she had promised to marry him and that now she was going to break her promise and say that she would marry McNab if She looked at him as he sat by the hearth Misshapen with unkempt brakish hair and beard turning grey wrinkled and withered he was no mate for her glowing youth But what did that matter She saw the Schoolmaster s face as she had last seen it the dear thin eager face with deep lines drawn by the sleepless ache of his heart on it She knew now why there had been an underlying grief and bitterness in what he said when he went away knew that he must have been afraid of recognition and its consequences But missus Cameron had required him to save Davey It was all plain now Yet Deirdre realised that what he had done he would probably have done without her having to ask for it What part had missus Cameron had in his life that she could command him that she dared ask him to lay down his life for her What had she done for him In the old time the Schoolmaster had said We owe her more than either you or I can hope to repay Deirdre But surely he had paid on the night of the fires if at no other time And now McNab s gaze on her recalled her mind to what he had said She met it steadily unwaveringly Yes She would marry him if Her thought went back on its track If what Yes if Dan got off if he did not get the three years If he had to go to prison for three years then it would be no use to marry McNab He could not help Dan then For three years he would have to live in a prison wear filthy hideous clothes work like a beast of burden I ll tell you this day week she said Think you ll know then how the trial s goin he snarled Well there s an end to three years don t forget my pretty and if he gets an acquittal on this the other ll come out unless She measured him with her eyes You marry me the day he is free of this charge if he gets free or on the day he gets his three years if he s goin to get them and you don t want m to be for life He leaned forward his voice husky with eagerness If you change y r mind my dear of course I can change mine He laughed uneasily his fingers twitching But I ll give you till this day week to make up y r mind which it is to be Then you give me y r answer Is it a bargain Yes Deirdre said She was dull and weary beaten He rose from his chair and shuffled towards the door Then I ll go and get the house ready for you he cried gleefully I m not afraid what y r answer ll be Oh you re snared my pretty bird and there s no way out for you if you d keep Dan Farrel as he calls himself out of the darbies and him in his blindness going to the Island again It s taken a heap of schemin to get you but I set my mind on you when I saw you a slip of a girl coquettin with Conal at Hegarty s the night you came back to the Wirree The desolation of her attitude reassured him Good bye my pretty he said in the doorway And someday when y r my wife Deirdre you ll kiss me good bye He went out with a chattering clatter of laughter Steve came back to the kitchen Have you been able to manage him Deirdre he asked feverishly What have you said to him To go back there His face worked pitifully his hands twisted over each other You don t know what it is like I d kill myself rather than go back Deirdre And your father What ll he do It ll be worse for him than for me He s got you to think of What did McNab say Will he do anything for you Deirdre He said he would do anything in the world for you And you d want him to help us wouldn t you You wouldn t let Dan and y r old Uncle Stevie go over there again It ll be all right she said looking past him You mustn t think of it any more Stevie It was just to worry you he said that Oh it s a wonderful girl you are He clung to her hand fondling it tears streaming down his cheeks Nobody here to save us your father and me but you Deirdre And you to deal with McNab send him away with a smile pleased with himself No idea of the terms McNab was likely to have made with her occurred to him If only there d been someone here to help us she cried passionately If only father or Davey or even Conal had been here But to have had to meet it alone Her voice broke She began to cry finding relief in utter abandonment Steve put his arms round her trying to comfort her Deirdre Deirdre he muttered distressfully Don t cry It s your father s own girl you are So brave Meetin the devil himself with your clear eyes n me no more than a shiverin old corpse where he is Deirdre lifted her eyes She looked into the pathetic quiveringly childish old face bent over her It s the best thing you could have said to me that I m my father s own girl Uncle Stevie she said My father s girl shouldn t be crying like this when there s work and a lot of thinking to do CHAPTER XLII There s bad news from Cameron s Deirdre Steve came in from the road A bullock wagon had just passed from the Wirree Deirdre had seen it halt up She had seen the bullocks standing with dumb dull patience under the yoke swinging their tails to keep the flies off Some of them had gone down on their knees by the roadside while the teamster had a drink and yarned with Steve Then she had heard the cracking of the teamster s whip his oaths and calls to the beasts and the creaking of the heavy blue washed cart as it went on again What is it she asked breathlessly thinking of Davey Old Cameron Steve said Johnny Watson says he was found dead on the road by Long Gully a tree fallen on him this morning Steve There was horror and yet a vague relief in her exclamation Johnny says Cameron went down to the Black Bull yesterday evening and there was trouble between him and McNab McNab having let him in for this cattle stealin case knowing Davey was in it Steve went on But Thad got round him somehow telling him that he didn t know Davey was in it and he d get off anyhow bein Cameron s son Buttered the old man up that way Conal and the Schoolmaster d be nabbed for sure he made out They were good enough friends when they parted only he d had more n a jugful and a couple of the boys had to give him a leg up to his horse The brute must ve shied at the dead tree near the gully the ground was cut up round it It fell on them both missus Cameron found m this morning I ll go and see if there s anything I can do for her Deirdre took her hat down from behind the door Steve went on talking of Donald Cameron muttering in his vague childish fashion However he came to get in with McNab I can t make out he said There weren t no two greater enemies a while back Oh he was as mean as you make them D C but he made his mark in the country Deirdre had on her hat I m going Steve she said I won t stay unless missus Cameron s got no one with her but the Rosses and missus Morrison are sure to be there Right Deirdre he replied She took her bridle from its nail by the door and went into the paddock beyond the stable calling the chestnut He heard her cry Coup lad coup laddie and saw the white stocking at her call come galloping across the newly green grass gilded with sunshine She slipped the bridle over his head brought him into the yard saddled him and turned out to the road With thoughts of the tragedy that had befallen missus Cameron as she went along the winding track under the trees were woven wonderings as to how Donald Cameron s sudden death would affect Davey and the Schoolmaster It was on the roadside by the Long Gully that mister Cameron had died The old tree by the gully had fallen at last and on Donald Cameron At Rane while Dan and she were living there a man had been killed by a falling tree but it was strange that Davey s father should have died in this way she thought he who had been the first settler in the hills She wondered if he had ring barked the tree score its living green wood if he had killed it and in turn it had killed him pinning him to the earth with its great bulk of dead and rotting timber She could see Davey s father heavy squarely built in shabby dark clothes lying beneath it his grey hair blood dabbled his face bruised and blackened The man who had conquered the wilderness had lain there on the very road he had made broken cast aside a thing that life had done with It was as if the wilderness had taken its revenge She slipped from the chestnut s back in a sunny clearing and gathered a handful of freckled and golden eyed white honey flowers twisted some tendrils of creepers and blades of ferns among them and tied them together with a long piece of grass When she came in sight of the weatherboard house crouching against the purple wall of the hills Deirdre realised again what Donald Cameron had done The cleared paddocks spread round it on every side An orchard climbing the slope to the left showed in dark leafage against the grey and green of the forest Cattle dappled the furthest hillside The barns and sheds and stables behind the house formed a small village He had made it cleared the forest for it He had done all this she realised and so much besides and now he was dead the man of iron will and indefatigable energy There were two or three of the neighbours carts in Cameron s yard Deirdre opened the gate and shut it when she and White Socks had passed through She hung the chestnut s bridle over a post by the barn and lifted his saddle Speckled fowls and handsome buff and yellow pullets stalked about the yard pecking industriously even under the legs of the Ross s and Morrison s horses which with harness looped back on them their noses deep in fodder bags stood beside the carts In the brilliant sunshine on a wood stack struck against the clear blue sky a black rooster crowed at intervals missus Cameron s sitting room was in semi darkness Deirdre heard the hushed talking exclamations and sound of weeping as she went into it It s you Deirdre missus Cameron said when she saw the girl Her voice was flat and tired she seemed to have scarcely strength enough to speak Deirdre kissed her with quivering lips and eyes welling The room was full of people She did not see who they were at first in the half dark If only Davey were here missus Cameron cried Deirdre knelt beside her Perhaps he ll come she whispered Did you gather the flowers for his father missus Cameron s eyes had fallen on the little bouquet in Deirdre s hands I brought them for Davey Deirdre said missus Cameron s hands quivered in hers We must keep her cheerful not let her spirits get down one of the visitors said in Deirdre s ear Jessie Ross brought in tea and some newly made scones You must eat this now dear to keep up your strength missus Ross said to missus Cameron taking a chair beside her missus Ross talked of her milking and the calves she had poddied during the wet weather and the other women gathering round talked in serious and melancholy fashion of their milking and the calves they had had trouble with during the winter They gave each other recipes for cream cheese and jam and cakes to be made without eggs And I ve discovered a sure way of making hens lay in the winter said missus Ross Have you replied missus Cameron listlessly Yes indeed and I ll tell you just what it is Mary Oh it s of no interest to me now with Davey away and his father gone missus Cameron cried She kept her hold of Deirdre s hand To think of him Davey s father in there Deirdre lying so still and cold he that was so strong and nobody could break or turn she said You haven t seen him yet You must come with me Presently dearie but you must drink your tea and eat this little bit of scone first missus Ross said The neighbours talked again nervously cheerfully in subdued tones of the weather the sales and what the men of their households were saying about things in general We mustn t let her brood they said anxiously to each other missus Cameron did not seem to hear or notice them When she stood in the silent room with Deirdre looking down on the white sheeted figure of Davey s father she turned to the girl with a sharp cry It s a sad sad thing to be parting from your life s mate Deirdre she said To think that he should have died like that after all that he s done he that made this hill country To have gone without a word from anyone or a clearing up of the misunderstandings between us And Davey not to see him again She broke down and sobbed utterly missus Ross and missus Morrison took her each by an arm and led her back to the sitting room The hum of strained subdued and cheerful conversation began again missus Cameron went to the door with Deirdre If only they d let me be child she cried kissing her If only they d let me be It s very good of them all to bother but if only they d let me be As the chestnut padded softly along the track home to Steve s Deirdre wondered again what effect Donald Cameron s death would have on Davey and Dan It would make Davey a rich man she knew Donald Cameron had been reputed wealthy when she and the Schoolmaster first came to the hills and he had not been drinking long enough to have squandered much money It would take more than a gallon of rum to make old Cameron loosen his purse strings she remembered having heard Conal say To Dan and to her it would make very little difference in the end There would still be McNab The train of her thought snapped For a moment with all her passionate youth she envied Donald Cameron his stillness A night and a day remained before she would have to tell McNab that she had made her choice Every beat of the chestnut s hoofs on the soft roadside drove what he had said into her brain She knew no more now than she did a week ago what was going to happen to Davey and the Schoolmaster or how the case was going Perhaps less since Donald Cameron s death But her mind was made up as to what McNab s answer would be She had never really had any doubt as to what it must be and had asked for time as one asks to have the window open before settling down to passing the day in a dark and airless room Deep in her mind there was still however a vagrant hope a fairy child like thing a phantom assurance of the impossibility of what was demanded of her a belief like thistle down as faint and fragile that something unheard of miraculous would happen to help her and at the same time save Dan and Steve and Davey CHAPTER XLIII The big kitchen was very quiet The log that had been smouldering on the open hearth all day broke Deirdre swept back the scattered embers and thrust the broken ends of wood together Flames leapt over them lighting the room They penetrated the shadows that bulked huge and shapeless at the end of it revealing a hoard of store casks and boxes piled almost to the roof and half cloaked with hessian bags sewed together The barrel of a rifle slung on the walls glimmered for a moment the firelight showed stirrup irons and miscellaneous harnessing gear halters and bridles hung over a peg near the door a couple of horse shoes nailed to it and two or three hams in smoke blackened bags with bunches of herbs beside them strung up to the rafters A tallow dip cast a halo of garish light about Deirdre where she sat sewing a broad gleam touched the crockery on the shelves behind her The high backed arm chair in which Steve lay slack and nodding drowsily was drawn up before the fire The door to the bar reached by a step from the kitchen was open A dip burned on the bench there too giving the dingy windows of the shanty a gleam for wayfarers It was a wild night the wind blowing from the south west beat against the doors and rattled the windows of the frail building The doors were all shut though it was still early Steve at last fell asleep in his chair His heavy laboured breathing had the sound of a child sobbing Deirdre looked up from her work again and again troubled by it It increased her sense of desperation to hear him The sound became unendurable She got up at last and awakened him Hadn t you better go to bed Uncle Steve she said impatiently You ll catch your death of cold like this It s too late for anybody to be coming our way now and a bad night I ll lock up Yes Deirdre he murmured sleepily it s a bad night and too late for anybody to be coming our way She pulled the bolts across the doors at the front of the shanty and locked and bolted the door from the bar into the kitchen then she took his arm and helped him out of his chair He had fallen back into it nodding drowsily again She led him over to his room which opened off the kitchen I ll see the lights and the fires are out she said but I want to finish a bit of mending before I go to bed Right he murmured Right Deirdre The noise of the wind carried off the droning tones of his voice but it was only a few moments before she heard his heavy breathing again The Schoolmaster s sock which she was darning dropped from her hand She stared into the darkness beyond the dip light She did not want to go to bed to be alone in the darkness with her thoughts In the kitchen she heard the creaking gossip of the fire and the whisper of falling embers Besides she wanted to keep her hands and brain busy In the darkness there would be only the voice of the wind in her ears and that was like the crying of her heart She listened to the wind now A mournful passionate thing it murmured about the house rising wildly desperately in blasts of sudden rage and fell back into a thin pitiful wailing of helplessness and despair She was afraid to listen long afraid of what this communicating interpreting murmur might do with her reason Yet the wind was with her she thought The wind knew her heart the wind was the voice of her heart crying out there in the darkness She shivered trying to banish the strange fantastical ideas that swarmed upon her How to pass the night this long night in which she must not think or feel To morrow McNab would be coming You pays y r money and you takes y r choice Deirdre he had said She saw his face as he had spoken his twisted sallow face the glimmering of his malicious eyes with the smile that spilled over from them She had made her choice She had set her mind to it There must be no wavering If the Schoolmaster got off she must marry McNab if he was sentenced to three years imprisonment there would perhaps be time to scheme and out manoeuvre him She would set her wits to that But she could not think of the next day She must think of Davey or Dan or Steve any of them There must be no shrinking shrieking or failing What had to be done had to be done and the first thing that had to be done was to give McNab her word She picked up the sock she had been mending again The needle slipped backwards and forwards across under and over the dark threads She worked steadily The voice of the wind drew her mind again It tugged gently and then carried her away on its plaintive wailing Her hands fell in her lap as she listened Her heart swayed it went out to the wind again There was a clatter of a horse s hoofs on the road The sound startled her but it was not until she heard the dogs barking in the yard that she realised some late rider had come to Steve s that there would be food and drink and probably a shakedown to get ready She waited for the sound of footsteps on the verandah and a rap on the door of the bar The back door flung open and on a gust of wind and rain a tall gaunt figure swung into the kitchen Conal Deirdre cried and flew to him In her gladness at seeing him the past was a blurred page She forgot it when she saw him in the doorway his weather beaten face turned to her Her confidence in him all the old joyous affection rushed over her His face was shining with rain his hair and beard wet From the way his breath came and went and the muscles were whipped out from his neck she knew that he had been riding hard They tell me Davey and Dan are on trial in Melbourne he said Yes What happened What s been doing Deirdre he gasped I ve only just heard of it It s taken me a couple of days to get here I don t know anything but what I ve told you Thought p raps you could tell me something before I go up to them And give me something to eat and drink I haven t had anything since yesterday morning He wrenched off his wet coat and dropped into Steve s chair He had a gauntness that Conal used not to have But his eyes those eyes of fierce tenderness were the eyes of the big brotherly man who had been the companion of so many of her and the Schoolmaster s wanderings She quickly put some food on the table for him set the kettle on the bar over the fire and while he was eating told him what she knew of Davey s arrest and Dan s going to swear Davey s innocence of the charge brought against him Why did he do that Davey was more in it than he was Conal asked savagely I don t know Deirdre hesitated Yes I do Conal It was because missus Cameron Oh that was it was it Conal went on eating hungrily What do they say about here Do they think Davey ll get off and Dan ll have to pay You ve heard of mister Cameron s death Conal Deirdre asked They say that ll make all the difference Davey can t very well be accused of stealing his own cattle and McNab What has he got to say about it Of course it s his hand in it all He says I m the cause Her voice faltered What s that Conal s knife and fork clattered to the table Did you know she asked did you know Conal Steve and father came from the Island over there He moved uneasily No he said but uncertainly Who says so McNab He did the chain trick here on Steve scared him to death when he was by himself one afternoon Seems he wasn t quite sure before but Steve in his fright gave him all the proofs he wanted And McNab s promised to use all he knows against father and Steve unless Says he only put the troopers on to this cattle business to get you and Davey out of the way though he had another score to work off against mister Cameron too But he says he always suspected about Steve and father and was only waiting for a chance to be sure of it to make me make me marry him By God Conal spun from his chair His oaths startled the birds from their night perches under the roof He ll not do that Deirdre he cried Not while there s life in me Rot him the crawler To come here scaring the wits out of you I ll screw the last breath out of him before He made for the door Deirdre went after him She put her hand on his arm You ll do no good now Conal she said You re done yourself Rest till morning Then you can go to McNab If he knows there s a man about to stand by me p raps he won t dare to do what he said Conal jerked himself away from her No I ll swear he won t But you ll do nothing at all if you go now she urged and I ll have nobody without you If you ll only rest and sleep now and go in the morning it ll be better You ll be able to put the fear of God into McNab perhaps if he sees you strong and ready to make him do what you want Sleep He cursed under his breath Do you think there s any sleep ll come to me when I think that McNab a filthy damned swine like McNab could come near you I d kill him kill him if he touched a hair of your head Her hands fell from him Conal s face was distorted with rage His words brought back memory of the shot that had almost killed Davey Conal guessed what her movement meant Do you still believe he lifted her chin and looked into her eyes Do you still believe I fired that shot in the dark Deirdre Did you Conal she asked simply He turned from her with a gesture of disappointment Oh it was in anger and when you weren t sure of what you were doing I know she cried He opened the door You re not going to night she asked No You re right It ll be better to wait till the morning he said with for Conal a strange quietude I want to give the mare a rub down and a feed Are there any bones for Sally Throw a shakedown by the fire for me I ll be in directly CHAPTER XLIV Conal was early astir Deirdre heard him moving in the kitchen and then out of doors When he came in again she had spread a cloth on the end of the table Bacon and eggs were spluttering in a shallow pan on the hearth a pot of porridge was ready for him the kettle steaming Conal s face was sombre it was easy to see that he had not slept and that his mind was set to a plan of action He ate without speaking and got up to go Ginger was standing saddled by the door her reins trailing beside her She cropped the young grass that showed vivid green blades about the water barrel and was nourished by the drips from the roof spouts and leakages from the barrel itself Deirdre heard the click click of Ginger s snaffle the chirping of young birds under the roof while Conal was eating There was a solemnity a wrapped up purposefulness about him this morning she dared not ask him what he was going to do It was a fresh morning with frost in the air A sparkling rime lay out on the grass in the paddocks and spread under the straggling shade of the sheds and the stables in crisp white patches The sunshine splashed golden over the hills it lay in long shafts of purest brilliance on the paddocks and across the stable yard Conal went out of doors Deirdre followed him Conal she cried There was appeal in her voice He had gathered Ginger s reins in his hand The mare turned her head her great beautiful eyes on Deirdre It s no good you re saying anything Deirdre telling me what to do and what not to do Conal said roughly I ve thought it all out I know what s got to be done I ll do it the best way I can He understood the prayer of her eyes D you think I want his blood on my hands he asked irritably But he s got to let you go Deirdre He s got to There s no two ways about it and if he says a word about the Schoolmaster or Steve he ll have to reck n with me then and the reckoning ll be a short one That s the bargain I m going to make with him And I ll hold him responsible if ever the story gets out He ll pay all the same and I ll swear that on the soul of my mother Do you think my life s worth a straw to me Do you think if it is a question of yours and Dan s life against McNab s I can hesitate He threw back his head with the old reckless movement Not much Lord I d take what was coming to me cheerin if I thought I d put things right for the Schoolmaster and you But if a knocking about ll do Thad any good instead he s welcome to it If I can get what I want out of him with a scarin there ll be no need to go further If I promise him on the reddest oath under the sun and he s pretty sure I mean it it ll do instead perhaps But I m not taking any chances of his trickin me I can t afford to take chances Deirdre If I don t feel I ve got him that way She knew what he meant It ll be a long day till you re back Conal she said He swung into his saddle and went out to the road She watched the bay with her long easy stride and Conal swinging above her till the trees hid them There was no doubt in her mind that when Conal let his tongue loose unleashed the rage in him McNab would do what he wanted Conal was not known as Fighting Conal for nothing and he was credited with being a man of his word Reckless and dare devil as he was none knew better than McNab that he cared neither for God nor man when his blood was up and that he would assuredly do as he said though the heavens fell Everybody knew the cringing coward McNab was More than one of the men he had sold had threatened to wipe off old scores without leave or licence A threat more or less might not have mattered but each one intensified McNab s terror of the clutch of iron finger in the night the swift blade of a knife the short bark of a pistol It was easy to scare Steve with a clank of a chain but the click of a pistol behind McNab turned him livid a greenish hue spread on his face Deirdre knew the frenzy of McNab s fear but she knew too his shrewd brain While Conal was there he would dominate convert him into the shaking shrieking thing McNab became when the fear of violence or a violent death took possession of him but afterwards when Conal was gone his brain would get to work that cunning brain of his quickened by a sense of his injuries and his spluttering passionate fear and hate of the man who had humiliated and thwarted him Deirdre wondered how it would fare with Conal then whether McNab would outwit him He would try He was made that way McNab to scheme out of holes and corners If Conal would have to reckon with him in the end she realised that it would have been better to let the reckoning be now before any further mischief was done Yet her mind shuddered at the thought She knew that she had meant to delay it When Steve came shambling into the yard blinking at the sunlight she told him that Conal had returned and that he had gone down to the Black Bull but would be back by the evening He exclaimed all the morning about Conal s coming and had a thousand questions to ask Where had Conal been What had he been doing Why was it he had gone off the way he did without saying a word to anybody All of which Deirdre had not thought to ask But they talked about Conal all the morning Steve came in from cutting ferns for the cow shed to ask if Conal was going to stay long What was he going to do Was he going up to the trial Had she told him what McNab had said to them Deirdre wanted to be very busy all day so that the time would not seem long till Conal returned Steve with his questions made a little current of joyous excitement Ordinarily the days were very still and empty She swept and dusted cooked their food washed the dishes and sewed with latterly only anxious thoughts to occupy her mind How is he lookin Conal Steve asked coming to the door when she was beating cream into butter in a delft bowl He had come in as the idea for a new question occurred to him Oh well she said but he d been riding hard and was tired out I think he s a bit thinner than he used to be and he was awfully hungry You gave him a drop of grog he asked anxiously Deirdre nodded He was wet through I thought he d have his death of cold to day But he was all right this morning Oh yes Where did he come from She shook her head Hadn t you better finish laying down the ferns she said He may be back sooner than we think and then you ll want to talk to him Oh yes He shuffled out of doors again A moment later he put his head in the window His shabby drooping hat was outlined against the blank of sunshine His face looked in at her under the shadow of his hat bright with a question What did he go to the Wirree for Deirdre Oh She hesitated He wanted to see McNab Why Steve chewed the cud of a wondering thought Why did he want to see McNab Deirdre He ll tell you when he comes she said The bare kitchen had the musky warm smell of newly baked bread and of curdy sweet buttermilk by the afternoon Deirdre had made bread and new butter for Conal She had prepared a good meal for him when he came home in the evening After she had scrubbed the wooden table until it was of a weathered whiteness and redded the bricks round the hearth she looked about for other household tasks to work at so that the day would seem shorter It was late in the afternoon when she brushed her hair twisted it up anew put on a fresh frock and sat down to sew until Conal came Steve went out to the road every now and then to see if there were any signs of him Deirdre glanced at the shadows the trees cast She dared not expect Conal before sunset Her needle flew in and out of a piece of stiff unbleached linen missus Cameron had given her some time ago She thought of her when she was afraid to think of Conal and what was happening in Wirreeford The sun sank behind the distant line of hills and the Jackasses on the high branches of a tree by the road laughed their good night to the sun She could not restrain her impatience any longer and went to the road Her eyes strained to see Conal and his bay horse forging out of the gloom that was beginning to gather amongst the trees hanging mysterious impalpable veils across the ends of the track where the trees met over it and it dwindled into a wavering thread She lay down by the roadside and pressed her ear to the earth to listen for the sound of hoof beats but only the forest murmurs came to her the moan of the wind in the valleys the leafy murmur of the trees the creaking of broken and swaying branches the faint calling of birds all confused and mingled in a vague wave of sound The last hoot hoot of the jackasses in the misty depths of the hills drifted across the quiet evening air The cows had gathered against the paddock fence and were lowing plaintively for the evening milking Deirdre drove them into the yard and milked When she had taken the pails indoors she went again to the road gazed down into the darkness that had now gathered over the track and listened for the rapid beat of hoofs on the road A glimmer of light in the shanty windows told Deirdre that Steve had lighted up He came to the door Conal s late Deirdre he called Yes she replied She stood there quite still staring down the road What do you think can have kept him Steve had come out and was standing beside her Her face was very wan to his old eyes her dark hair blew in tendrils about it I don t know She saw the anxiety start in his eyes Oh it s all right She took his arm and they went towards the house again He ll be having a game of cards with the boys It s too soon to expect him that s all We ll go in and have supper She spread the table and put out the hot dinner she had made for Conal Steve s hunger increased at the savoury smell of it and because it was later than they usually had their meal he ate steadily and with ready relish Deirdre sat down at the table with him Aren t you going to have anything he asked when he saw that she was not eating I ll wait for Conal she said Steve dozed in his chair afterwards The night that closed in on the forest was of a soft thick darkness Deirdre stood in the doorway looking out into it for while Not a star hung its silver lamp over the hills The wind crept with slow uncertain breaths about the shanty She shut the door She carried her work basket with the socks that she had been mending the night before to the table But she could not work her hands would not stir She sat listening listening listening Steve had taken out his pipe and sucked it nodding in his chair by the fire His teeth relaxed their grip as he dozed the pipe fell on the floor Deirdre started to her feet as the sound broke the stillness It wakened him too He stared stupidly about him with sleep dazed eyes What s that he asked Has Conal come yet No she said picking up the pipe Perhaps you d better not wait up for him Yes Yes he muttered testily Of course I ll wait He sank back into his chair and presently was sleeping again Deirdre went back to the table and sat there staring before her listening fixedly Hour after hour went by A quick breath crossed her lips she ran to the door and threw it open A gust of wind rushed into the room and it brought the sound of a horse on the road She slammed the door and went back to the hearth raked the embers and pulled back the log so that it fell with a shower of sparks and the flames leapt up over the new wood She moved the pots with Conal s dinner in them nearer the fire and opening the door again stood by it waiting Ginger swung round the corner and Conal on her He was riding low huddled against her neck The way he dropped from the saddle drove the breath from Deirdre s body He threw out his arms and staggered forward He would have fallen if she had not been there to hold him She dragged him indoors leaning against her Steve Steve she called The old man was beside her in an instant Conal had fallen his legs crumpling up under him There was a stain of blood on his clothes Deirdre tore them from the place where the blood welled She put the brandy Steve brought to Conal s lips and sent Steve for water and rags telling him where to find the soft scraps she kept together for burns or cuts It s like the wound Davey had Steve cried when he saw the way the flesh was ploughed up on Conal s breast only nearer the heart Conal moaned as the cold water struck him A damp sweat lay on his forehead It s all up I m done for he muttered Give me your hand Deirdre never never thought I d reach you but I couldn t die there in the dark down by the creek His voice failed Don t try to talk Conal dear she begged You ll be all right if you keep quiet lie still Davey was But there was a greyness about Conal s face a dimness that Davey s had not had Davey he muttered Davey His eyes opened they were the wild bright eyes reckless and challenging of Fighting Conal You believe I shot Davey No Deirdre bent over him her breath coming sobbingly I don t believe it now Conal The same hands that did this to you did it to Davey too A damn whispering slug in the dark he gasped It was by the culvert over the creek too from the cover of the trees And I know whose hand it was I saw the slinking hound By God why did I let him off Why did I think I d got him tight enough He sank back against her arm with a spasm of pain She put the spirit to his lips If only I d choked the life out of him I could die easy But the mare bolted I couldn t get her back to him The lying cur The bargain was made I thought I d got him that he d ve made over his last penny to me Someone kept me talking outside the Bull it was that kid minds his horses saying that Ginger d gone lame and the next thing was a shot from the creek and McNab scuttling among the trees Paugh he moved impatiently Why didn t I do for him while I had the chance Superhuman strength animating him for a moment he struggled up his swart face stiffening his eyes flashing I can I m alive yet I can Deirdre He swayed and she caught him breaking the shock of his fall backwards Blood welled from the open wound the wet pads had staunched the flow for a moment Steve brought more water She dipped fresh linen and rags in it and bound them into place Conal lay heavy and still She bent over him her eyes turned questioningly to Steve She lifted Conal s head on to her knees The silence was unbroken Conal she whispered as though she were calling him Conal That you Deirdre he asked huskily but he did not open his eyes If if you could kiss me it s so hard to go feeling you near and that you don t care for me at all If only I hadn t failed you this time If only But it was because of you I didn t want to kill him unless unless it was necessary It seemed all right the other way You won t think badly of me Deirdre No no Conal dear but don t try to talk now I ve been hard on you Deirdre But you won t think ill of me It s the way men are made and I didn t understand how it was with you and Davey not till that night in the hut If I hadn t brought trouble between you you might forgive me Conal Conal Deirdre sobbed the tears streaming over her face You re dear to me yourself dear in your own way Haven t you always been and I haven t been good to you always My heart s breaking to hear you talk like this She bent over and kissed him Conal opened his eyes The mellow light of serene happiness had drifted into them They rested on her face as though they were loath to leave it His long fingers were knotted about her hands I m happier than ever I was in my life Deirdre darling he whispered She had to stoop over him to catch the words on his lips so faint and hoarsely uttered they were as though the thoughts left him without his lips having power to form them Never expected to put my head on your knees hold your hand like this It would never have happened if I d lived so it s good to die You ll look after Ginger ginger for pluck dear old devil never ve got here but for her And Sally good old Sally not a cattle mong Like her countryside The ghost of a smile flitted over his lips If only Recollection of McNab came banishing the peaceful happiness from his face His eyes blazed There was a momentary struggle for breath and he fell back fighting for life Then on a long sigh he was still Deirdre tried the brandy again She called him She felt for his heart His head was very heavy on her knees She stared down on the finely chiselled features so still upraised before her Her tears rained over them The quiet was unbroken but for Steve s crying like a child Then Sally lying crouched against the door of the hut lifted her voice in a long mournful howl that told the shrouded hills and all the creatures of them that the soul of her master Long Conal Conal the Fighter had passed on CHAPTER XLV Deirdre knew that McNab would not come near Steve s while the dead body of Conal lay there In the morning she saddled the chestnut and rode into Wirreeford It was you shot Conal and I m going to let all the countryside know it she said facing McNab in the reeking parlour of the Black Bull And who do y think will believe you McNab sidled up to her his eyes kindling Everybody who knows you And they ll say to you How do y know What proof have you got Deirdre Nobody ll want to go agen Thad McNab lest they re sure and nobody ll want to be gettin up and givin evidence against McNab lest they re sure they re comin out on the right side of the business Proof there s proof enough Deirdre s voice rang clear though her heart was beginning to quail She knew that what he said was true She had come with the idea of using Conal s death as a weapon against McNab but it had suddenly become empty and useless in her hands Now look here my dear it s no use bein nasty McNab said You know and I know there s no man in the Wirree would go against me less he was pretty sure of getting somebody stronger than himself to back him Well is he going to get anybody That s the question Deirdre thought of M Laughlin sodden with drink and as much McNab s creature as any other man in the Wirree McNab chuckled though there was a nervous edge to his voice There s Sergeant M Laughlin of course he s police officer for the district You can tell him your story if you like But he s a hard headed man M Laughlin He ll want proofs And then don t forget I ve still the trump card up me sleeve Her immobility maddened him See here Deirdre he said shaking with rage I ve been patient with you till now and I m not a patient man Y may not ve liked the ways of my love makin but they re my ways Either you take my terms or you leave them And if you send any more jackanapes to me y ll find them served as was Conal Maybe y re waitin and hopin young Davey ll come overland he rasped on to to help you Don t let him get in my way again Deirdre Don t let him If he gets in my way he ll have to get out of it Or you will have to get out of his way Deirdre s eyes flashed into his She saw the mean cunning soul in them She knew that it would be Davey who would get out that there was no fighting McNab Davey would die as Conal had died of a shot in the dark or a death dealing stab in the back McNab realised that she had measured his chances against Davey Cameron Davey s chances against him in that moment for all her proud look There s a boat just in the Port takin on some cattle brought news from Melbourne he said Davey s acquitted So is the Schoolmaster Jury didn t find there was evidence enough to convict They ll be coming along by the Albatross She s due in a couple of days Johnson Cameron s man brought word If you don t marry me if y re not missus McNab before that boat gets in it can take y r father and Steve along with it It goes right on to Hobart Town after calling here Deirdre stumbled out of the room McNab did not follow her He knew that she would not fight any more He watched her swing into her saddle and ride out along the flat dun coloured road to the hills missus Mary Ann driving a string of snow white geese along the green ledges of the wayside called to her but Deirdre fled on past the cottage that the Schoolmaster and she had lived in past the out croppings of gorse beginning to bud goldenly on the edge of the plains And McNab chuckled softly rubbing his hands together CHAPTER XLVI The Albatross was in Just before midday carts and carry alls had clattered along the road to the Port Deirdre riding down from the hills at dawn had seen the schooner on the dim shining screen of sea and sky There was no wind and like a great white bird she hovered outside the bar waiting for the wind and tide to carry her into the quiet waters of the inlet It was not until midday that a breeze sprang up sending white curled breakers high over the bar and the Albatross on the crest of them came sailing into the harbour She rode furling her sails to the log wood wharf on its further side A crowd had gathered to meet her and it was early afternoon before the vehicles began to rattle back along the road to the hills and Wirreeford Deirdre stood at the window of McNab s parlour behind the curtains that had been hung up in her honour watching them She saw none of the curious looks and gestures that went her way the pitiful glances that covered her For the news of the Port that morning beat any the boat had brought Those who saw the dim white face of the girl at the window and her shadowy eyes knew that she was Thad McNab s wife They knew that McNab had driven Deirdre Farrel into the Port before any of them were astir and that a clergyman had married them in the church there Why did she do it What could have made her they asked each other It wasn t for love of his beautiful face be sure snarled Salt Watson It s hard on the Schoolmaster He ll not know of it yet somebody else said Deirdre neither heard nor saw them She was watching for Davey and Dan to pass She had seen missus Ross and Jessie go by to the Port in Cameron s double seated buggy She thought they would ride together to the hills in that Davey and her father If they knew they would stop at the Black Bull if no one had told them they would go on she had decided They would wonder why she was not on the wharf when the boat got in to meet them But McNab would not have that He would not lose sight of her Besides she did not want to meet the eyes of the men and women who would be there and hear what they had to say She was cut off from the world as she stood at the window of McNab s house Her mind was too utterly weary to reason further As she watched and waited a sense of bleak desolation closed in on her Her eyes ached for sight of the Schoolmaster s form against the clear sky although she knew she would hardly see it above the buggy and among other people She asked herself what he would do when he found that she was not waiting for him at Steve s what he would think when he found the letter that was lying for him there Steve would have to read it for him It would break his heart the letter that she had wept and prayed over but it was better that his heart should break than that he should go to the Island again And Steve poor old Steve would die in peace some day and be put to rest where they had put Conal A magistrate assisted in a fashion by M Laughlin and a jury had duly investigated and found that his tragic death was an impenetrable mystery An open verdict they called the finding Conal s resting place was on a sunny hillside under a blossoming white gum in which the bees hummed drowsily in the spring time and through which the green parrots flashed all the year It was good to think that Steve would draw his last breath in freedom and then sleep there under the blue sky But for her there would be no freedom no open spaces Life had become a prison from which there was only one gate Death and that she would not be able to open because she was a hostage for other lives Dan s and Steve s perhaps Davey s Cameron s buggy rounded a turn in the road missus Ross and Jessie were in it and there was a man s figure beside theirs only one though The horse moving at her slow steady jog trot drew nearer Deirdre saw clearly the man who was driving It was Davey The Schoolmaster was not with him A panic seized her She flew out to the road the horse stopped automatically Where s father she cried Davey stared at her He scarcely knew her this wild white faced creature with burning eyes and colourless lips Hasn t he come she asked No he said slowly He got down from the buggy His heart ached at the sight of her He hardly knew how to speak He moved to take her hands She shrank from him Why didn t he come Because Oh Deirdre it breaks my heart to tell you he broke out Don t look at me like that I did all I could but it was no good Some cursed brute gave information Oh she whispered It was that then And after a moment They took him again for being at large before the expiration of sentence Yes His eyes were all tenderness and pity for her When Davey Just before we were leaving four days ago Don t look like that Deirdre I won t leave a stone unturned to get him back And I promised him that we She laughed a strange cracking little laugh Deirdre He was perplexed and hurt Don t come near me She turned away from him and ran into the house under the swinging sign of the black bull with red rimmed eyes Davey attempted to follow her He saw McNab in the doorway What the hell s she doing there he muttered missus Ross and Jessie eyed each other anxiously They did not speak for a minute Then the elder woman said nervously uncertainly P raps p raps she came down with Steve to meet the Schoolmaster But we d better be going on Davey Don t risk any trouble with Thad McNab to day Your mother s waiting eagerly for you You re her only thought now All she has got Davey climbed into the buggy again His face was sombre He had not got over the shock of his father s death and Deirdre s manner wounded and bewildered him He thought that she was distraught with agony and disappointment on the Schoolmaster s account He had imagined how tenderly he would tell her what had happened and comfort her Now to find her at the Black Bull not at Steve s where he had thought she would be and missus Ross and Jessie beside him when he wanted to fold her in his arms and assure her that he would never rest until Dan was with them again He swore at every jolt and jar on the road to relieve his impatience It was missus Ross who said to Mary Cameron taking her aside when mother and son had met and Davey was turning Bess into the paddock again It s true what we heard about Deirdre Farrel going to marry McNab She was married to him this morning You d better break the news to Davey He doesn t know yet I dursn t tell him for fear he d go to McNab I wanted to bring him safe to you Jessie and I ll go home now No doubt you ll like to have the house to yourself but if you want anything or there s anything we can do for you We re always glad to do anything for you missus Cameron dear Jessie said softly It s a queer heartless girl Deirdre is to play fast and loose with the love of a fine fellow like Davey missus Ross said when Jess was outside setting their bundles and baskets into the cart Oh she wouldn t do that Deirdre missus Cameron replied It s something dreadful that s driven her to it Yes I suppose it is missus Ross sighed Poor child Perhaps I m spiteful about it Mary But maybe now that she is out of the way Davey may think of my Jessie again Davey s mother smiled sadly I d be sorry for any woman he married but Deirdre for she has the whole of him heart and soul she said Oh well it s a pity missus Ross kissed her good bye Jess had better make up her mind to have Buddy Morrison then and that s what I ve been telling her this long time He s a good lad very fond of her and been wanting to marry her for the last five years When Jess and her mother had gone driving off in their high jolting buggy Davey and missus Cameron went indoors together He had aged considerable since she last saw him It was a stern strange face to her this her boy s There were sorrow self repression a bitter realisation of life and what it means in heartache and disappointment in his expression something of power and assurance too She was wondering how she could tell him covering him with tender pitiful glances and praying that he would not leave her that no hurt might come to him when he asked suddenly Have you seen anything of Deirdre mother He had been moving restlessly about the room lifting things from their place on the mantelpiece and putting them back again She called him to her and putting her hands on his head told him what missus Ross had said Davey s face hardened and whitened slowly He put her hands away from him and wheeled unsteadily from the room She heard him go across the yard and saw him stumbling up the narrow track to the trees on the far side of the hill CHAPTER XLVII missus Cameron was feeding her chickens when she thought she heard someone calling She listened and decided that it was only a whispering of wind in the trees that had caught her ear The mild light of the evening lingered about her Her eyes lay on the hill that rose with a gentle slope beyond the yard the barns and stable and a score of low built brushwood sheds Mists were beginning to gather among the trees that fringed the top on either side Davey had gone up among those trees The sound of her name called faintly again disturbed her She looked down towards the road that wound uphill out of the forest It was wraith like in the twilight the long white gate that barred it from the paddock about the house growing dim The gum saplings of two or three years growth with their powdery grey leaves pressing on the far side of the fence behind the barn shivered as the surface of still water shivers when something stirs beneath it Her eyes were directed towards the centre of the almost imperceptible movement Someone called her faintly whisperingly Going towards the fence she saw a wan face and wide eyes among the leaves The lines of a long dark dress went off into the shadows among the trees Deirdre she cried The girl came towards her Her dress was draggled and torn There was a red line on her cheek where a broken branch had caught and scratched it Where s Davey she asked Deirdre what has happened missus Cameron recognised a tragic urgency in her face Come in you re exhausted You don t mean to say you ve walked from the Wirree She took her hand and led her into the kitchen The fire was sending long ruddy beams of light over the bricked floor glimmering on the rows of polished metal covers on the walls and the crockery on the wooden dresser at the far end of the room It was very homely and peaceful missus Cameron s kitchen She pushed Deirdre gently into the big arm chair by the fire Sit there dearie till I get you a hot drink she said Deirdre sat very still gazing before her It s this marriage with McNab is too much for her missus Cameron thought Oh child why did you do it What could have driven you to it she asked The shadow of a slow and subtle smile crept for a moment about Deirdre s lips and vanished again If only you d have told me your trouble missus Cameron cried I might have been able to help you Oh no you wouldn t Deirdre said You couldn t have married McNab for any reason of choice missus Cameron was torn between grief bewilderment and compassion Davey is breaking his heart about it out on the hills somewhere now I had to tell him when he came in for fear What s to be done about it Deirdre Oh I m not wanting to blame you You did it for a good reason I m sure and you love Davey It s hard on you Deirdre You do love him Yes Deirdre said slowly missus Cameron knelt beside the chair Her hands trembled on the girl s arm Don t touch me Deirdre gasped moving out of the reach of her hands Don t touch me she whispered again eyeing her strangely Davey I m afraid what he ll do if he sees you missus Cameron hesitated Deirdre sprang out of the chair her eyes blazing Davey Davey It s all Davey with you she cried You sacrificed father to him You sent him to that trial I know now And Davey why couldn t he have gone to gaol instead He s young and strong and it wouldn t have mattered so much to him He s got all his life before him But father hadn t he done enough for you Hasn t he given his eyes for you Hasn t he worshipped you all these years I ve seen it since I was a child And is this all you could do for him send him to the Law Courts to get Davey off knowing that it would be worse than death to him to have to go to prison again Oh you knew what he d have to suffer in Davey s place missus Cameron put her hands over her face You knew he couldn t afford to come under the notice of the law Deirdre said But I shouldn t talk like this Her voice trailed wearily Only I had to choose between father and Davey McNab knows all the old story You do I know Steve told me McNab scared the wits out of Steve one day when he was by himself and got all the proofs he wanted though he seems to have had the facts most of them anyway before Then he told me what being at large before the expiration of sentence meant and what his information would do if he used it about father when the trial was on He said that he wouldn t use it if I d marry him missus Cameron stared at her Deirdre went on her voice dragging as if she could scarcely put into words the pain and trouble of her mind I couldn t let father suffer any more I couldn t bear to think what it would be for him to go back there to the Island she said He blind and loving me so and you and both of us willing to sacrifice him to Davey I could see him going over there hurt and alone in the dark the dear great gentle heart of him crying crying for those he loved to be near him to hear the sound of their voices to touch their hands I couldn t endure it Oh I couldn t Her head dropped He has made sacrifices all his life His eyes for you Don t say that Deirdre It s the truth the girl said fiercely That night of the fixes he saw the branch falling It would have hit you if he had not put up his arm and it came down on him on his face all the red hot embers missus Cameron uttered a low cry And now at the end of his days you took this last scrap of freedom from him But I wouldn t have it I knew that the time had come for somebody to do something for him There was a few moments silence Only after all a weary bitterness surged in her voice it was no good McNab was too clever for me He trapped me and sold father all the same and Steve poor old Stevie too M Laughlin took him down to the Port this afternoon I heard him crying like a baby When I asked McNab why he had broken his word to me he said a little sick laughter struggled from her that blind as father was he knew he d have to reckon with him for having taken me if he ever came back to the Wirree She sank back in the chair shivering and sobbing missus Cameron leant towards her Don t touch me Deirdre shrank from her I haven t told you all yet McNab locked me in a room when he knew that I knew what he d done It was when he came to me there and called me his wife I killed him missus Cameron fell back from her Oh I didn t mean to kill him the girl cried distractedly He came near me I told him not to but he did He talked of his rights I hit at him to keep him away from me with something that was lying on the table I don t know what it was but it was heavy and he fell down I knew he was dead by the way he lay there without moving and then I ran out of the room and came here Oh I didn t mean to do it but I m not sorry it s done that he is dead and can do no more harm to any of us He killed Conal And it was he that shot at Davey He would have again too He was afraid of Davey what he would do when he found out about father and me She was sobbing breathlessly her hands went out before her with a desperate despairing gesture She moved towards the door Where are you going What are you going to do Deirdre missus Cameron followed her I don t know The girl stood quivering by the doorpost Only I must go They may come from the Wirree and find me here And I don t want to be hanged that s what they do with people who have done what I ve done isn t it I want to go Davey mustn t see me It s no good No good There would be the great gulf between us always and as long as I lived to the day of my death I d be on the other side of it with my arms out to him Oh you mustn t keep me Can t you see it s best that I should go now like this before You re not thinking of doing any harm to yourself Deirdre The anguished eyes of the woman beside her reached the girl through the maze and terror of her thoughts They calmed the tumult within her The Long Gully she said simply wearily the mists are so deep in it to night and there would be no waking in the morning missus Cameron took her hand You say I ve never done anything for your father Deirdre I want to do something for him now Come back and listen to me for a moment She led the girl back to the chair and forced her into it But they ll be coming for me soon Deirdre cried fretfully looking back at the door She hardly heard what missus Cameron was saying for awhile Her tired bright eyes wandered restlessly up and down the room The pain in her head prevented her thinking Deirdre darling missus Cameron said her voice trembling there s not a man or woman in the country would not say you were justified And no woman is better able to understand than I am I m not afraid for you and there s no one I d rather have for Davey s wife than you You were willing to sacrifice yourself But when treachery had been proved against you there was that within you would not let evil come near you Do you mean you d be satisfied for Davey to have me Deirdre asked Yes missus Cameron s eyes were on hers You d not be throwing it up at me that I that I did this Deirdre inquired And that father No missus Cameron s voice was very low Because if I had been served as your father was I d have been a convict too In the shock of what she had said Deirdre forgot her own trouble You she whispered That s what I wanted to tell you it s been locked in my heart so long and nobody else knows missus Cameron said It s because I think it may help you Deirdre now that your soul is in the deep waters I want you to know that something like what has happened to you happened to me long ago Only I had less excuse Her face was torn with grief she turned from the girl overwhelmed by the flood tide of dark memories Oh I can t think of it without all the agony again she cried And after a moment continued I didn t want to bring shame on my people by having it known I had been the cause of death to a man but the weight was on my soul I had heard of people escaping public trial by condemning themselves to transportation It was the only way I could have any peace of mind I thought taking on myself the punishment other women had got for doing what I did But it was never as bad for me as for them Davey s father saw me on the wharf among the emigrant women and he wanted to marry me There was a Government bounty thirty pounds I think it was given to married couples coming to the colony and he wanted the money to begin with in the new country I told him why I was going out and he was willing to take me There were terrible days of fear among all the rough people I found myself with till he came I was grateful to him and swore to be a good and faithful wife to him I ve not spoken of this since then Deirdre I m telling you because I want you not to throw your life away not to waste it I know I was wrong There was this difference between what you did and what I did I was not in a corner fighting for my life as you were I did not mean to take life I did not mean to It was an accident really Right was on my side but I was angry or the accident would never have happened I have suffered from knowing that All these years have made little difference That s why I was always wanting to help convicts and prisoners in the old days and it angered Davey s father so I felt that they were suffering what I ought to have been suffering too But with you it was different Your own instinct tells you the difference It does not accuse you No one else will either And there s your father to think of It would take the last gleam of happiness from him to know you had ended your own life Deirdre And there s Davey and me to love you and care for you always Deirdre stared at her then the tears came she cried quietly missus Cameron put her arms round her She comforted her with tender little murmurings Deirdre raised her head and put her off from her gazing into her face with drenched eyes I understand ever so much better now she said And a moment later Have I been mad with fright What ll I do My head aches so I scarcely know what I am saying I can t think What shall I do What is going to happen to me There s no jury in the country that would not acquit you missus Cameron said McNab was well known Oh people were afraid of him but they will speak now You re young and beautiful and if your story is not a justification there s no God watching over the world But what will Davey think of me Deirdre cried I m afraid to see him I wanted to when I came here but I m afraid now I thought it would be to say good bye They ll be coming for me soon too Oh I ll go now missus Cameron If Davey looked at my hands and knew what they had done Conflicting thoughts whipping each other were driving her like a leaf first one way and then the other There was a heavy step on the threshold Davey s figure loomed against the doorway Coming in from the light it was a few minutes before his eyes accustomed to the gloom saw that there was someone with his mother He stared at Deirdre as though they were ghosts who were meeting after death beyond the world She shrank from the stare of his eyes putting up her arms to hide her face with a little pitiful cry She moved along the wall towards the door as if to go out and escape them Davey Davey Don t let her go missus Cameron cried Although his eyes followed her and he seemed to guess her intention he did not stir Davey missus Cameron cried a pang in her heart like the blade of a knife She has killed McNab and is going to her death because of it Deirdre stood still Her arms dropped from her face She threw back her head her eyes met his unflinchingly You you have killed him His voice was harsh with the effort to speak Yes she said A gust of passion rushed over him It flooded him with a vigour and exultation that transformed him He strode towards her His arms imprisoned her He held her and kissed her with the hungry kiss of a lover long denied Deirdre Deirdre he sobbed That you should have It was for me to do that I meant to to night Do you think I could have lived breathed been sane while you were near him He crushed her in his arms again They sobbed together childishly missus Cameron went into the other room her sitting room with its shiny black horse hair furniture and the cupboard in which her spinning wheel had stood since the days of Donald Cameron s greatness The beloved blue vase that she had saved from the fire was still on the chiffonier She sat in the room she had been so proud of a long time her hands clasped in her lap reviewing her memories They came in straggling lines and phalanxes memories of her youth of an old sad time of her voyage across the seas beside Donald Cameron of their journey into the hills of the days of struggle and toil and domestic tranquility that had given her a son of her first fear and loneliness in the silent world of the trees and of the gaunt men who had come to her out of them The complexities of human emotion were a mystery and a distress to her She had the momentary vision of a prison yard its grim walls trains of sullen men in grimy grey and yellow clothes all of the same pattern and of one who walked among them wearily a little uncertainly singing faintly as she had often heard him singing on the hill roads Her eyes went down the slope of the hill to the spot under the light leafed trees where Donald Cameron had been laid to rest her heart crying an assurance of loyalty and fidelity to the yoke mate They had set a seed in the country that would bear fruit in the union of the two in the next room she knew All the labour of their pioneering had not been in vain Donald Cameron had done what he set out to do though his last days had been darkened with disappointment the bitter sense of disgrace and the futility of all his long years of toil But his name would go on she realised and his children s children would talk with pride of their grandfather who had come from the old country a poor man and had made a great name for himself in the new land Of the spiritual undertow which bound Deirdre and Davey she could not think That was entwined with the subtle inexplicable currents of her own soul She had turned her face from them shut her eyes and ears to the sight and sound of them She had never allowed herself to recognise their existence even yet she knew that they were there rushing on silently irresistibly into eternity A vision of the prison yard came again shaping itself slowly vaguely and with it a sound of chains the harsh voices of warders and gaolers Her thoughts went back to the lovers in the other room She folded her hands with a little passionate gesture the light of her whole soul shone in her eyes Oh God she whispered breathlessly we broke the earth we sowed the seed Let theirs be the harvest the joy of life and the fullness thereof CHAPTER XLVIII Fifteen Years After A boy pushed the bracken and ferny grey and green wattle sprays from before a lichen grown wooden cross He was a sturdy youngster with an eager sensitive face and dropped on one knee beside the mound the parted ferns and branches revealed to read the inscription on the cross The path that wound uphill through the trees behind him was an old one overgrown with mosses Scraps of bark and sear leaves were matted across it The weathered rambling homestead of Ayrmuir was just visible through the trees and a cornfield waving down the slope of the hill showed golden through a gap in the waving leafage Donald Cameron had marked the place long before and said that there where the wagon had come to a standstill he must be laid to rest And it was within memory of the boy that his grandmother Mary Cameron had been laid beside him A voice floating down the hillside from the house called Dan Dan Deirdre came down the path towards him an older graver Deirdre with peace in her deep welled eyes though an undefinable shadow rested on her face Here you are dear she said It ll be time to be getting ready soon Mick has the horses in and your father won t like to be kept waiting There was so much I wanted to say to you too before you go up to this big school It won t be a bit like going to the school down here or doing Latin with me going to the Grammar School Dan No of course mother I wonder sometimes if I ve been wrong to keep you so much with me she said wistfully You had to be told all the terrible old story I told you myself because I wanted you to understand Mother There were reverence and adoration in his eyes as they rested on her You re sure sure you don t feel strange about your mother Dan she asked A jury acquitted me but I know I was right myself There was nothing else to do She was quivering to the shock of startled memories I can t feel that I could have done anything else than I did she cried passionately but I can t forget Dan The horror of it all shadows me still it always will The boy slipped his arms through hers and pressed against her Whenever I read in history or a story of people who had to do terrible things for those they loved I think Like my mother But no one I ve ever read or heard of was like you he said shyly Dan A smile of melting eager tenderness suffused her eyes As they turned away he looked back at the grave under the trees I thought I d like to say good bye to them he said They were pioneers weren t they grandfather and grandmother Makes me feel like being a bit of history myself to think that my grandfather and grandmother were pioneers I was saying to myself just now They did so much against such big odds what a lot I ought to be able to do with everything made easy for me I wish your father and mother were down here too he added I never knew my mother Dan Deirdre said dreamily You know I ve told you all about that She died when I was born and it was because I was such a wailing baby that my father called me Deirdre Deirdre of the griefs And he lies over there in the Island I remember him the boy said eagerly his voice hushed When I was a little kid we went you and I and father to see him didn t we And I sort of remember a tall thin man who had white hair quite white hair and was blind he was always singing so as you could scarcely hear him and once he said suddenly when I was on his knee don t you remember He s got her eyes Deirdre Yes Deirdre murmured the pain in her eyes deepening I ve wondered I ve often wondered what he meant mother How could he know what my eyes were like He was blind He meant your grandmother Mary Cameron Dan He used to say she had twilight eyes and that the light of them pierced his darkness Deirdre said The boy puzzled over that I remember she said to me once he said thoughtfully You ought to be a great man Dan because four great nations have gone to the making of you I didn t know what she meant at first Then she told me that my four grandparents were English Irish Scottish and Welsh They have quarrelled and fought among themselves but you are a gathering of them in a new country Dan she said There will be a great future for the nation that comes of you and the boys and girls like you It will be a nation of pioneers with all the adventurous toiling strain of the men and women who came over the sea and conquered the wilderness You belong to the hunted too and suffering has taught you Then she told me about prisons here in the early days mother and terrible stories of how people lived in the old country They may talk about your birthstain by and by Dan she said but that will not trouble you because it was not this country made the stain This country has been the redeemer and blotted out all those old stains Deirdre gazing into the eager wistful face of her son realised that he was unfolding a dream to her She smiled into his eyes and he back to her with a consciousness of the serene understanding and sympathy between them You will be a pioneer too Dan grandmother said the boy continued with a shy reverence a pioneer of paths that will make the world a better happier place for everybody to live in You will because you won t be able to help it There s the blood of pioneers in you END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PIONEERS This file should be named thirty four thousand six hundred sixty one txt or thirty four thousand six
