EBOOK RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM Produced by Judy Boss and Gregory Walker RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM By Omar Khayyam Rendered into English Verse by Edward Fitzgerald Contents Introduction First Edition Fifth Edition Notes Introduction Omar Khayyam The Astronomer Poet of Persia Omar Khayyam was born at Naishapur in Khorassan in the latter half of our Eleventh and died within the First Quarter of our Twelfth Century The Slender Story of his Life is curiously twined about that of two other very considerable Figures in their Time and Country one of whom tells the Story of all Three This was Nizam ul Mulk Vizier to Alp Arslan the Son and Malik Shah the Grandson of Toghrul Beg the Tartar who had wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of Mahmud the Great and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which finally roused Europe into the Crusades This Nizam ul Mulk in his Wasiyat or Testament which he wrote and left as a Memorial for future Statesmen relates the following as quoted in the Calcutta Review No fifty nine from Mirkhond s History of the Assassins One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassan was the Imam Mowaffak of Naishapur a man highly honored and reverenced may God rejoice his soul his illustrious years exceeded eighty five and it was the universal belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied the traditions in his presence would assuredly attain to honor and happiness For this cause did my father send me from Tus to Naishapur with Abd us samad the doctor of law that I might employ myself in study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher Towards me he ever turned an eye of favor and kindness and as his pupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion so that I passed four years in his service When I first came there I found two other pupils of mine own age newly arrived Hakim Omar Khayyam and the ill fated Ben Sabbah Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the highest natural powers and we three formed a close friendship together When the Imam rose from his lectures they used to join me and we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard Now Omar was a native of Naishapur while Hasan Ben Sabbah s father was one Ali a man of austere life and practise but heretical in his creed and doctrine One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam It is a universal belief that the pupils of the Imam Mowaffak will attain to fortune Now even if we all do not attain thereto without doubt one of us will what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond We answered Be it what you please Well he said let us make a vow that to whomsoever this fortune falls he shall share it equally with the rest and reserve no pre eminence for himself Be it so we both replied and on those terms we mutually pledged our words Years rolled on and I went from Khorassan to Transoxiana and wandered to Ghazni and Cabul and when I returned I was invested with office and rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp Arslan He goes on to state that years passed by and both his old school friends found him out and came and claimed a share in his good fortune according to the school day vow The Vizier was generous and kept his word Hasan demanded a place in the government which the Sultan granted at the Vizier s request but discontented with a gradual rise he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an oriental court and failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor he was disgraced and fell After many mishaps and wanderings Hasan became the head of the Persian sect of the Ismailians a party of fanatics who had long murmured in obscurity but rose to an evil eminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will In A D ten ninety he seized the castle of Alamut in the province of Rudbar which lies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian Sea and it was from this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the Crusaders as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS and spread terror through the Mohammedan world and it is yet disputed where the word Assassin which they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark memorial is derived from the hashish or opiate of hemp leaves the Indian bhang with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch of oriental desperation or from the name of the founder of the dynasty whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days at Naishapur One of the countless victims of the Assassin s dagger was Nizam ul Mulk himself the old school boy friend one Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier to claim his share but not to ask for title or office The greatest boon you can confer on me he said is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune to spread wide the advantages of Science and pray for your long life and prosperity The Vizier tells us that when he found Omar was really sincere in his refusal he pressed him no further but granted him a yearly pension of twelve hundred mithkals of gold from the treasury of Naishapur At Naishapur thus lived and died Omar Khayyam busied adds the Vizier in winning knowledge of every kind and especially in Astronomy wherein he attained to a very high pre eminence Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah he came to Merv and obtained great praise for his proficiency in science and the Sultan showered favors upon him When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar Omar was one of the eight learned men employed to do it the result was the Jalali era so called from Jalal ud din one of the king s names a computation of time says Gibbon which surpasses the Julian and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style He is also the author of some astronomical tables entitled Ziji Malikshahi and the French have lately republished and translated an Arabic Treatise of his on Algebra His Takhallus or poetical name Khayyam signifies a Tent maker and he is said to have at one time exercised that trade perhaps before Nizam ul Mulk s generosity raised him to independence Many Persian poets similarly derive their names from their occupations thus we have Attar a druggist Assar an oil presser et cetera two Omar himself alludes to his name in the following whimsical lines Khayyam who stitched the tents of science Has fallen in grief s furnace and been suddenly burned The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life and that relates to the close it is told in the anonymous preface which is sometimes prefixed to his poems it has been printed in the Persian in the Appendix to Hyde s Veterum Persarum Religio p four hundred ninety nine and D Herbelot alludes to it in his Bibliotheque under Khiam three It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of the Wise Omar Khayyam died at Naishapur in the year of the Hegira five hundred seventeen A D eleven twenty three in science he was unrivaled the very paragon of his age Khwajah Nizami of Samarcand who was one of his pupils relates the following story I often used to hold conversations with my teacher Omar Khayyam in a garden and one day he said to me My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it I wondered at the words he spake but I knew that his were no idle words four Years after when I chanced to revisit Naishapur I went to his final resting place and lo it was just outside a garden and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden wall and dropped their flowers upon his tomb so that the stone was hidden under them Thus far without fear of Trespass from the Calcutta Review The writer of it on reading in India this story of Omar s Grave was reminded he says of Cicero s Account of finding Archimedes Tomb at Syracuse buried in grass and weeds I think Thorwaldsen desired to have roses grow over him a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the present day I believe However to return to Omar Though the Sultan shower d Favors upon him Omar s Epicurean Audacity of Thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in his own Time and Country He is said to have been especially hated and dreaded by the Sufis whose Practise he ridiculed and whose Faith amounts to little more than his own when stript of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide Their Poets including Hafiz who are with the exception of Firdausi the most considerable in Persia borrowed largely indeed of Omar s material but turning it to a mystical Use more convenient to Themselves and the People they addressed a People quite as quick of Doubt as of Belief as keen of Bodily sense as of Intellectual and delighting in a cloudy composition of both in which they could float luxuriously between Heaven and Earth and this World and the Next on the wings of a poetical expression that might serve indifferently for either Omar was too honest of Heart as well of Head for this Having failed however mistakenly of finding any Providence but Destiny and any World but This he set about making the most of it preferring rather to soothe the Soul through the Senses into Acquiescence with Things as he saw them than to perplex it with vain disquietude after what they might be It has been seen however that his Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant and he very likely takes a humorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the gratification of Sense above that of the Intellect in which he must have taken great delight although it failed to answer the Questions in which he in common with all men was most vitally interested For whatever Reason however Omar as before said has never been popular in his own Country and therefore has been but scantily transmitted abroad The MSS of his Poems mutilated beyond the average Casualties of Oriental Transcription are so rare in the East as scarce to have reacht Westward at all in spite of all the acquisitions of Arms and Science There is no copy at the India House none at the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris We know but of one in England No one hundred forty of the Ouseley MSS at the Bodleian written at Shiraz A D fourteen sixty This contains but one hundred fifty eight Rubaiyat One in the Asiatic Society s Library at Calcutta of which we have a Copy contains and yet incomplete five hundred sixteen though swelled to that by all kinds of Repetition and Corruption So Von Hammer speaks of his Copy as containing about two hundred while doctor Sprenger catalogues the Lucknow MS at double that number five The Scribes too of the Oxford and Calcutta MSS seem to do their Work under a sort of Protest each beginning with a Tetrastich whether genuine or not taken out of its alphabetical order the Oxford with one of Apology the Calcutta with one of Expostulation supposed says a Notice prefixed to the MS to have arisen from a Dream in which Omar s mother asked about his future fate It may be rendered thus O Thou who burn saint in Heart for those who burn In Hell whose fires thyself shall feed in turn How long be crying Mercy on them God Why who art Thou to teach and He to learn The Bodleian Quatrain pleads Pantheism by way of Justification If I myself upon a looser Creed Have loosely strung the Jewel of Good deed Let this one thing for my Atonement plead That One for Two I never did misread The Reviewer six to whom I owe the Particulars of Omar s Life concludes his Review by comparing him with Lucretius both as to natural Temper and Genius and as acted upon by the Circumstances in which he lived Both indeed were men of subtle strong and cultivated Intellect fine Imagination and Hearts passionate for Truth and Justice who justly revolted from their Country s false Religion and false or foolish Devotion to it but who fell short of replacing what they subverted by such better Hope as others with no better Revelation to guide them had yet made a Law to themselves Lucretius indeed with such material as Epicurus furnished satisfied himself with the theory of a vast machine fortuitously constructed and acting by a Law that implied no Legislator and so composing himself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean severity of Attitude sat down to contemplate the mechanical drama of the Universe which he was part Actor in himself and all about him as in his own sublime description of the Roman Theater discolored with the lurid reflex of the Curtain suspended between the Spectator and the Sun Omar more desperate or more careless of any so complicated System as resulted in nothing but hopeless Necessity flung his own Genius and Learning with a bitter or humorous jest into the general Ruin which their insufficient glimpses only served to reveal and pretending sensual pleasure as the serious purpose of Life only diverted himself with speculative problems of Deity Destiny Matter and Spirit Good and Evil and other such questions easier to start than to run down and the pursuit of which becomes a very weary sport at last With regard to the present Translation The original Rubaiyat as missing an Arabic Guttural these Tetrastichs are more musically called are independent Stanzas consisting each of four Lines of equal though varied Prosody sometimes all rhyming but oftener as here imitated the third line a blank Somewhat as in the Greek Alcaic where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend the Wave that falls over in the last As usual with such kind of Oriental Verse the Rubaiyat follow one another according to Alphabetic Rhyme a strange succession of Grave and Gay Those here selected are strung into something of an Eclogue with perhaps a less than equal proportion of the Drink and make merry which genuine or not recurs over frequently in the Original Either way the Result is sad enough saddest perhaps when most ostentatiously merry more apt to move Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tentmaker who after vainly endeavoring to unshackle his Steps from Destiny and to catch some authentic Glimpse of TO MORROW fell back upon TO DAY which has outlasted so many To morrows as the only Ground he had got to stand upon however momentarily slipping from under his Feet From the Third Edition While the second Edition of this version of Omar was preparing Monsieur Nicolas French Consul at Resht published a very careful and very good Edition of the Text from a lithograph copy at Teheran comprising four hundred sixty four Rubaiyat with translation and notes of his own Mons Nicolas whose Edition has reminded me of several things and instructed me in others does not consider Omar to be the material Epicurean that I have literally taken him for but a Mystic shadowing the Deity under the figure of Wine Wine bearer c as Hafiz is supposed to do in short a Sufi Poet like Hafiz and the rest I cannot see reason to alter my opinion formed as it was more than a dozen years ago when Omar was first shown me by one to whom I am indebted for all I know of Oriental and very much of other literature He admired Omar s Genius so much that he would gladly have adopted any such Interpretation of his meaning as Mons Nicolas if he could seven That he could not appears by his Paper in the Calcutta Review already so largely quoted in which he argues from the Poems themselves as well as from what records remain of the Poet s Life And if more were needed to disprove Mons Nicolas Theory there is the Biographical Notice which he himself has drawn up in direct contradiction to the Interpretation of the Poems given in his Notes See pp thirteen fourteen of his Preface Indeed I hardly knew poor Omar was so far gone till his Apologist informed me For here we see that whatever were the Wine that Hafiz drank and sang the veritable Juice of the Grape it was which Omar used not only when carousing with his friends but says Mons Nicolas in order to excite himself to that pitch of Devotion which others reached by cries and hurlemens And yet whenever Wine Wine bearer c occur in the Text which is often enough Mons Nicolas carefully annotates Dieu La Divinite c so carefully indeed that one is tempted to think that he was indoctrinated by the Sufi with whom he read the Poems Note to Rub ii p eight A Persian would naturally wish to vindicate a distinguished Countryman and a Sufi to enroll him in his own sect which already comprises all the chief Poets of Persia What historical Authority has Mons Nicolas to show that Omar gave himself up avec passion a l etude de la philosophie des Soufis Preface p xiii The Doctrines of Pantheism Materialism Necessity c were not peculiar to the Sufi nor to Lucretius before them nor to Epicurus before him probably the very original Irreligion of Thinking men from the first and very likely to be the spontaneous growth of a Philosopher living in an Age of social and political barbarism under shadow of one of the Two and Seventy Religions supposed to divide the world Von Hammer according to Sprenger s Oriental Catalogue speaks of Omar as a Free thinker and a great opponent of Sufism perhaps because while holding much of their Doctrine he would not pretend to any inconsistent severity of morals Sir W Ouseley has written a note to something of the same effect on the fly leaf of the Bodleian MS And in two Rubaiyat of Mons Nicolas own Edition Suf and Sufi are both disparagingly named No doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable unless mystically interpreted but many more as unaccountable unless literally Were the Wine spiritual for instance how wash the Body with it when dead Why make cups of the dead clay to be filled with La Divinite by some succeeding Mystic Mons Nicolas himself is puzzled by some bizarres and trop Orientales allusions and images d une sensualite quelquefois revoltante indeed which les convenances do not permit him to translate but still which the reader cannot but refer to La Divinite eight No doubt also many of the Quatrains in the Teheran as in the Calcutta Copies are spurious such Rubaiyat being the common form of Epigram in Persia But this at best tells as much one way as another nay the Sufi who may be considered the Scholar and Man of Letters in Persia would be far more likely than the careless Epicure to interpolate what favours his own view of the Poet I observed that very few of the more mystical Quatrains are in the Bodleian MS which must be one of the oldest as dated at Shiraz A H eight hundred sixty five A D fourteen sixty And this I think especially distinguishes Omar I cannot help calling him by his no not Christian familiar name from all other Persian Poets That whereas with them the Poet is lost in his Song the Man in Allegory and Abstraction we seem to have the Man the Bon homme Omar himself with all his Humours and Passions as frankly before us as if we were really at Table with him after the Wine had gone round I must say that I for one never wholly believed in the Mysticism of Hafiz It does not appear there was any danger in holding and singing Sufi Pantheism so long as the Poet made his Salaam to Mohammed at the beginning and end of his Song Under such conditions Jelaluddin Jami Attar and others sang using Wine and Beauty indeed as Images to illustrate not as a Mask to hide the Divinity they were celebrating Perhaps some Allegory less liable to mistake or abuse had been better among so inflammable a People much more so when as some think with Hafiz and Omar the abstract is not only likened to but identified with the sensual Image hazardous if not to the Devotee himself yet to his weaker Brethren and worse for the Profane in proportion as the Devotion of the Initiated grew warmer And all for what To be tantalized with Images of sensual enjoyment which must be renounced if one would approximate a God who according to the Doctrine is Sensual Matter as well as Spirit and into whose Universe one expects unconsciously to merge after Death without hope of any posthumous Beatitude in another world to compensate for all one s self denial in this Lucretius blind Divinity certainly merited and probably got as much self sacrifice as this of the Sufi and the burden of Omar s Song if not Let us eat is assuredly Let us drink for To morrow we die And if Hafiz meant quite otherwise by a similar language he surely miscalculated when he devoted his Life and Genius to so equivocal a Psalmody as from his Day to this has been said and sung by any rather than spiritual Worshippers However as there is some traditional presumption and certainly the opinion of some learned men in favour of Omar s being a Sufi and even something of a Saint those who please may so interpret his Wine and Cup bearer On the other hand as there is far more historical certainty of his being a Philosopher of scientific Insight and Ability far beyond that of the Age and Country he lived in of such moderate worldly Ambition as becomes a Philosopher and such moderate wants as rarely satisfy a Debauchee other readers may be content to believe with me that while the Wine Omar celebrates is simply the Juice of the Grape he bragg d more than he drank of it in very defiance perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its Votaries sunk in Hypocrisy or Disgust Edward J Fitzgerald Footnotes Footnote one Some of Omar s Rubaiyat warn us of the danger of Greatness the instability of Fortune and while advocating Charity to all Men recommending us to be too intimate with none Attar makes Nizam ul Mulk use the very words of his friend Omar Rub xxviii When Nizam ul Mulk was in the Agony of Death he said Oh God I am passing away in the hand of the wind Footnote two Though all these like our Smiths Archers Millers Fletchers et cetera may simply retain the Surname of an hereditary calling Footnote three Philosophe Musulman qui a vecu en Odeur de Saintete dans sa Religion vers la Fin du premier et le Commencement du second Siecle no part of which except the Philosophe can apply to our Khayyam Footnote four The Rashness of the Words according to D Herbelot consisted in being so opposed to those in the Koran No Man knows where he shall die This story of Omar reminds me of another so naturally and when one remembers how wide of his humble mark the noble sailor aimed so pathetically told by Captain Cook not by Doctor Hawkworth in his Second Voyage i three hundred seventy four When leaving Ulietea Oreo s last request was for me to return When he saw he could not obtain that promise he asked the name of my Marai burying place As strange a question as this was I hesitated not a moment to tell him Stepney the parish in which I live when in London I was made to repeat it several times over till they could pronounce it and then Stepney Marai no Toote was echoed through an hundred mouths at once I afterwards found the same question had been put to mister Forster by a man on shore but he gave a different and indeed more proper answer by saying No man who used the sea could say where he should be buried Footnote five Since this paper was written adds the Reviewer in a note we have met with a Copy of a very rare Edition printed at Calcutta in eighteen thirty six This contains four hundred thirty eight Tetrastichs with an Appendix containing fifty four others not found in some MSS Footnote six Professor Cowell Footnote seven Perhaps would have edited the Poems himself some years ago He may now as little approve of my Version on one side as of Mons Nicolas Theory on the other Footnote eight A note to Quatrain two hundred thirty four admits that however clear the mystical meaning of such Images must be to Europeans they are not quoted without rougissant even by laymen in Persia Quant aux termes de tendresse qui commencent ce quatrain comme tant d autres dans ce recueil nos lecteurs habitues maintenant

jogg d each other Brother Brother Hark to the Porter s Shoulder knot a creaking LXVII Ah with the Grape my fading Life provide And wash my Body whence the life has died And in a Windingsheet of Vineleaf wrapt So bury me by some sweet Gardenside LXVIII That ev n my buried Ashes such a Snare Of Perfume shall fling up into the Air As not a True Believer passing by But shall be overtaken unaware LXIX Indeed the Idols I have loved so long Have done my Credit in Men s Eye much wrong Have drown d my Honour in a shallow Cup And sold my Reputation for a Song LXX Indeed indeed Repentance oft before I swore but was I sober when I swore And then and then came Spring and Rose in hand My thread bare Penitence a pieces tore LXXI And much as Wine has play d the Infidel And robb d me of my Robe of Honour well I often wonder what the Vintners buy One half so precious as the Goods they sell LXXII Alas that Spring should vanish with the Rose That Youth s sweet scented Manuscript should close The Nightingale that in the Branches sang Ah whence and whither flown again who knows LXXIII Ah Love could thou and I with Fate conspire To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire Would not we shatter it to bits and then Re mould it nearer to the Heart s Desire LXXIV Ah Moon of my Delight who know saint no wane The Moon of Heav n is rising once again How oft hereafter rising shall she look Through this same Garden after me in vain LXXV And when Thyself with shining Foot shall pass Among the Guests Star scatter d on The Grass And in Thy joyous Errand reach the Spot Where I made one turn down an empty Glass TAMAM SHUD Fifth Edition I WAKE For the Sun who scatter d into flight The Stars before him from the Field of Night Drives Night along with them from Heav n and strikes The Sultan s Turret with a Shaft of Light II Before the phantom of False morning died Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried When all the Temple is prepared within Why nods the drowsy Worshiper outside III And as the Cock crew those who stood before The Tavern shouted Open then the Door You know how little while we have to stay And once departed may return no more IV Now the New Year reviving old Desires The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough Puts out and Jesus from the Ground suspires V Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose And Jamshyd s Sev n ring d Cup where no one knows But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine And many a Garden by the Water blows VI And David s lips are lockt but in divine High piping Pehlevi with Wine Wine Wine Red Wine the Nightingale cries to the Rose That sallow cheek of hers to incarnadine VII Come fill the Cup and in the fire of Spring Your Winter garment of Repentance fling The Bird of Time has but a little way To flutter and the Bird is on the Wing VIII Whether at Naishapur or Babylon Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one IX Each Morn a thousand Roses brings you say Yes but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday And this first Summer month that brings the Rose Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away X Well let it take them What have we to do With Kaikobad the Great or Kaikhosru Let Zal and Rustum bluster as they will Or Hatim call to Supper heed not you XI With me along the strip of Herbage strown That just divides the desert from the sown Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot And Peace to Mahmud on his golden Throne XII A Book of Verses underneath the Bough A Jug of Wine a Loaf of Bread and Thou Beside me singing in the Wilderness Oh Wilderness were Paradise enow XIII Some for the Glories of This World and some Sigh for the Prophet s Paradise to come Ah take the Cash and let the Credit go Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum XIV Look to the blowing Rose about us Lo Laughing she says into the world I blow At once the silken tassel of my Purse Tear and its Treasure on the Garden throw XV And those who husbanded the Golden grain And those who flung it to the winds like Rain Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn d As buried once Men want dug up again XVI The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon Turns Ashes or it prospers and anon Like Snow upon the Desert s dusty Face Lighting a little hour or two is gone XVII Think in this batter d Caravanserai Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp Abode his destined Hour and went his way XVIII They say the Lion and the Lizard keep The courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep And Bahram that great Hunter the Wild Ass Stamps o er his Head but cannot break his Sleep XIX I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head XX And this reviving Herb whose tender Green Fledges the River Lip on which we lean Ah lean upon it lightly for who knows From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen XXI Ah my Beloved fill the Cup that clears TO DAY of past Regrets and future Fears To morrow Why To morrow I may be Myself with Yesterday s Sev n thousand Years XXII For some we loved the loveliest and the best That from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before And one by one crept silently to rest XXIII And we that now make merry in the Room They left and Summer dresses in new bloom Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth Descend ourselves to make a Couch for whom XXIV Ah make the most of what we yet may spend Before we too into the Dust descend Dust into Dust and under Dust to lie Sans Wine sans Song sans Singer and sans End XXV Alike for those who for TO DAY prepare And those that after some TO MORROW stare A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries Fools your Reward is neither Here nor There XXVI Why all the Saints and Sages who discuss d Of the Two Worlds so wisely they are thrust Like foolish Prophets forth their Words to Scorn Are scatter d and their Mouths are stopt with Dust XXVII Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and Saint and heard great argument About it and about but evermore Came out by the same door where in I went XXVIII With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow And this was all the Harvest that I reap d I came like Water and like Wind I go XXIX Into this Universe and Why not knowing Nor Whence like Water willy nilly flowing And out of it as Wind along the Waste I know not Whither willy nilly blowing XXX What without asking hither hurried Whence And without asking Whither hurried hence Oh many a Cup of this forbidden Wine Must drown the memory of that insolence XXXI Up from Earth s Center through the Seventh Gate I rose and on the Throne of Saturn sate And many a Knot unravel d by the Road But not the Master knot of Human Fate XXXII There was the Door to which I found no Key There was the Veil through which I might not see Some little talk awhile of ME and THEE There was and then no more of THEE and ME XXXIII Earth could not answer nor the Seas that mourn In flowing Purple of their Lord Forlorn Nor rolling Heaven with all his Signs reveal d And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn XXXIV Then of the THEE IN ME who works behind The Veil I lifted up my hands to find A lamp amid the Darkness and I heard As from Without THE ME WITHIN THEE BLIND XXXV Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn I lean d the Secret of my Life to learn And Lip to Lip it murmur d While you live Drink for once dead you never shall return XXXVI I think the Vessel that with fugitive Articulation answer d once did live And drink and Ah the passive Lip I kiss d How many Kisses might it take and give XXXVII For I remember stopping by the way To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay And with its all obliterated Tongue It murmur d Gently Brother gently pray XXXVIII And has not such a Story from of Old Down Man s successive generations roll d Of such a clod of saturated Earth Cast by the Maker into Human mold XXXIX And not a drop that from our Cups we throw For Earth to drink of but may steal below To quench the fire of Anguish in some Eye There hidden far beneath and long ago XL As then the Tulip for her morning sup Of Heav nly Vintage from the soil looks up Do you devoutly do the like till Heav n To Earth invert you like an empty Cup XLI Perplext no more with Human or Divine To morrow s tangle to the winds resign And lose your fingers in the tresses of The Cypress slender Minister of Wine XLII And if the Wine you drink the Lip you press End in what All begins and ends in Yes Think then you are TO DAY what YESTERDAY You were TO MORROW you shall not be less XLIII So when that Angel of the darker Drink At last shall find you by the river brink And offering his Cup invite your Soul Forth to your Lips to quaff you shall not shrink XLIV Why if the Soul can fling the Dust aside And naked on the Air of Heaven ride Were t not a Shame were t not a Shame for him In this clay carcass crippled to abide XLV Tis but a Tent where takes his one day s rest A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest The Sultan rises and the dark Ferrash Strikes and prepares it for another Guest XLVI And fear not lest Existence closing your Account and mine should know the like no more The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pour d Millions of Bubbles like us and will pour XLVII When You and I behind the Veil are past Oh but the long long while the World shall last Which of our Coming and Departure heeds As the Sea s self should heed a pebble cast XLVIII A Moment s Halt a momentary taste Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste And Lo the phantom Caravan has reach d The NOTHING it set out from Oh make haste XLIX Would you that spangle of Existence spend About THE SECRET quick about it Friend A Hair perhaps divides the False from True And upon what prithee may life depend L A Hair perhaps divides the False and True Yes and a single Alif were the clue Could you but find it to the Treasure house And peradventure to THE MASTER too LI Whose secret Presence through Creation s veins Running Quicksilver like eludes your pains Taking all shapes from Mah to Mahi and They change and perish all but He remains LII A moment guessed then back behind the Fold Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll d Which for the Pastime of Eternity He doth Himself contrive enact behold LIII But if in vain down on the stubborn floor Of Earth and up to Heav n s unopening Door You gaze TO DAY while You are You how then TO MORROW when You shall be You no more LIV Waste not your Hour nor in the vain pursuit Of This and That endeavor and dispute Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape Than sadden after none or bitter Fruit LV You know my Friends with what a brave Carouse I made a Second Marriage in my house Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse LVI For Is and Is not though with Rule and Line And UP AND DOWN by Logic I define Of all that one should care to fathom I was never deep in anything but Wine LVII Ah by my Computations People say Reduce the Year to better reckoning Nay Twas only striking from the Calendar Unborn To morrow and dead Yesterday LVIII And lately by the Tavern Door agape Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder and He bid me taste of it and twas the Grape LIX The Grape that can with Logic absolute The Two and Seventy jarring Sects confute The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice Life s leaden metal into Gold transmute LX The mighty Mahmud Allah breathing Lord That all the misbelieving and black Horde Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword LXI Why be this Juice the growth of God who dare Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare A Blessing we should use it should we not And if a Curse why then Who set it there LXII I must abjure the Balm of Life I must Scared by some After reckoning ta en on trust Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink To fill the Cup when crumbled into Dust LXIII Of threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise One thing at least is certain This Life flies One thing is certain and the rest is Lies The Flower that once has blown for ever dies LXIV Strange is it not that of the myriads who Before us pass d the door of Darkness through Not one returns to tell us of the Road Which to discover we must travel too LXV The Revelations of Devout and Learn d Who rose before us and as Prophets burn d Are all but Stories which awoke from Sleep They told their comrades and to Sleep return d LXVI I sent my Soul through the Invisible Some letter of that After life to spell And by and by my Soul return d to me And answer d I Myself am Heav n and Hell LXVII Heav n but the Vision of fulfill d Desire And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves So late emerged from shall so soon expire LXVIII We are no other than a moving row Of Magic Shadow shapes that come and go Round with the Sun illumined Lantern held In Midnight by the Master of the Show LXIX But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays Upon this Chequer board of Nights and Days Hither and thither moves and checks and slays And one by one back in the Closet lays LXX The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes But Here or There as strikes the Player goes And He that toss d you down into the Field He knows about it all HE knows HE knows LXXI The Moving Finger writes and having writ Moves on nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it LXXII And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky Whereunder crawling coop d we live and die Lift not your hands to It for help for It As impotently moves as you or I LXXIII With Earth s first Clay They did the Last Man knead And there of the Last Harvest sow d the Seed And the first Morning of Creation wrote What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read LXXIV YESTERDAY This Day s Madness did prepare TO MORROW s Silence Triumph or Despair Drink for you not know whence you came nor why Drink for you know not why you go nor where LXXV I tell you this When started from the Goal Over the flaming shoulders of the Foal Of Heav n Parwin and Mushtari they flung In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul LXXVI The Vine had struck a fiber which about It clings my Being let the Dervish flout Of my Base metal may be filed a Key That shall unlock the Door he howls without LXXVII And this I know whether the one True Light Kindle to Love or Wrath consume me quite One Flash of It within the Tavern caught Better than in the Temple lost outright LXXVIII What out of senseless Nothing to provoke A conscious Something to resent the yoke Of unpermitted Pleasure under pain Of Everlasting Penalties if broke LXXIX What from his helpless Creature be repaid Pure Gold for what he lent him dross allay d Sue for a Debt he never did contract And cannot answer Oh the sorry trade LXXX Oh Thou who didst with pitfall and with gin Beset the Road I was to wander in Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round Enmesh and then impute my Fall to Sin LXXXI Oh Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make And ev n with Paradise devise the Snake For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blacken d Man s forgiveness give and take LXXXII As under cover of departing Day Slunk hunger stricken Ramazan away Once more within the Potter s house alone I stood surrounded by the Shapes of Clay LXXXIII Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes great and small That stood along the floor and by the wall And some loquacious Vessels were and some Listen d perhaps but never talk d at all LXXXIV Said one among them Surely not in vain My substance of the common Earth was ta en And to this Figure molded to be broke Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again LXXXV Then said a Second Ne er a peevish Boy Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy And He that with his hand the Vessel made Will surely not in after Wrath destroy LXXXVI After a momentary silence spake Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make They sneer at me for leaning all awry What did the Hand then of the Potter shake LXXXVII Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot I think a Sufi pipkin waxing hot All this of Pot and Potter Tell me then Who is the Potter pray and who the Pot LXXXVIII Why said another Some there are who tell Of one who

But fill me with the old familiar Juice Methinks I might recover by and by XC So while the Vessels one by one were speaking The little Moon look d in that all were seeking And then they jogg d each

some not unfrequented Garden side XCII That ev n buried Ashes such a snare Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air As not a True believer passing by But shall be overtaken unaware XCIII Indeed the Idols I have loved so long Have done my credit in this World much wrong Have drown d my Glory in a shallow Cup And sold my reputation for a Song XCIV Indeed indeed Repentance oft before I swore but was I sober when I swore And then and then came Spring and Rose in hand My thread bare Penitence apieces tore XCV And much as Wine has play d the Infidel And robb d me of my Robe of Honor Well I

Guests Star scatter d on the Grass And in your joyous errand reach the spot Where I made One turn down an empty Glass TAMAM Notes The references are except in the first note only to the stanzas of the Fifth edition Stanza I Flinging a Stone into the Cup was the signal for To Horse in the Desert II The False Dawn Subhi Kazib a transient Light on the Horizon about an hour before the Subhi sadik or True Dawn a well known Phenomenon in the East IV New Year Beginning with the Vernal Equinox it must be remembered and howsoever the old Solar Year is practically superseded by the clumsy Lunar Year that dates from the Mohammedan Hijra still commemorated by a Festival that is said to have been appointed by the very Jamshyd whom Omar so often talks of and whose yearly Calendar he helped to rectify The sudden approach and rapid advance of the Spring says mister Binning are very striking Before the Snow is well off the Ground the Trees burst into Blossom and the Flowers start from the Soil At Naw Rooz their New Year s Day the Snow was lying in patches on the Hills and in the shaded Vallies while the Fruit trees in the Garden were budding beautifully and green Plants and Flowers springing upon the Plains on every side And on old Hyems Chin and icy Crown An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds Is as in mockery set Among the Plants newly appear d I recognized some Acquaintances I had not seen for many a Year among these two varieties of the Thistle a coarse species of the Daisy like the Horse gowan red and white clover the Dock the blue Cornflower and that vulgar Herb the Dandelion rearing its yellow crest on the Banks of the Water courses The Nightingale was not yet heard for the Rose was not yet blown but an almost identical Blackbird and Woodpecker helped to make up something of a North country Spring The White Hand of Moses Exodus iv six where Moses draws forth his Hand not according to the Persians leprous as Snow but white as our May blossom in Spring perhaps According to them also the Healing Power of Jesus resided in his Breath V Iram planted by King Shaddad and now sunk somewhere in the Sands of Arabia Jamshyd s Seven ring d Cup was typical of the seven Heavens seven Planets seven Seas c and was a Divining Cup VI Pehlevi the old Heroic Sanskrit of Persia Hafiz also speaks of the Nightingale s Pehlevi which did not change with the People s I am not sure if the fourth line refers to the Red Rose looking sickly or to the Yellow Rose that ought to be Red Red White and Yellow Roses all common in Persia I think that Southey in his Common Place Book quotes from some Spanish author about the Rose being White till ten o clock Rosa Perfecta at two and perfecta incarnada at five X Rustum the Hercules of Persia and Zal his Father whose exploits are among the most celebrated in the Shahnama Hatim Tai a well known type of Oriental Generosity XIII A Drum beaten outside a Palace XIV That is the Rose s Golden Centre XVIII Persepolis call d also Takht i Jam shyd THE THRONE OF JAMSHYD King Splendid of the mythical Peshdadian Dynasty and supposed according to the Shah nama to have been founded and built by him Others refer it to the Work of the Genie King Jan Ibn Jan who also built the Pyramids before the time of Adam BAHRAM GUR Bahram of the Wild Ass a Sassanian Sovereign had also his Seven Castles like the King of Bohemia each of a different Colour each with a Royal Mistress within each of whom tells him a Story as told in one of the most famous Poems of Persia written by Amir Khusraw all these Sevens also figuring according to Eastern Mysticism the Seven Heavens and perhaps the Book itself that Eighth into which the mystical Seven transcend and within which they revolve The Ruins of Three of those Towers are yet shown by the Peasantry as also the Swamp in which Bahram sunk like the Master of Ravenswood while pursuing his Gur The Palace that to Heav n his pillars threw And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew I saw the solitary Ringdove there And Coo coo coo she cried and Coo coo coo Included in Nicolas s edition as No three hundred fifty of the Rubaiyat and also in mister Whinfield s translation This Quatrain mister Binning found among several of Hafiz and others inscribed by some stray hand among the ruins of Persepolis The Ringdove s ancient Pehlevi Coo Coo Coo signifies also in Persian Where Where Where In Attar s Bird parliament she is reproved by the Leader of the Birds for sitting still and for ever harping on that one note of lamentation for her lost Yusuf Apropos of Omar s Red Roses in Stanza xix I am reminded of an old English Superstition that our Anemone Pulsatilla or purple Pasque Flower which grows plentifully about the Fleam Dyke near Cambridge grows only where Danish Blood has been spilt XXI A thousand years to each Planet XXXI Saturn Lord of the Seventh Heaven XXXII ME AND THEE some dividual Existence or Personality distinct from the Whole XXXVII One of the Persian Poets Attar I think has a pretty story about this A thirsty Traveller dips his hand into a Spring of Water to drink from By and by comes another who draws up and drinks from an earthen bowl and then departs leaving his Bowl behind him The first Traveller takes it up for another draught but is surprised to find that the same Water which had tasted sweet from his own hand tastes bitter from the earthen Bowl But a Voice from Heaven I think tells him the clay from which the Bowl is made was once Man and into whatever shape renew d can never lose the bitter flavour of Mortality XXXIX The custom of throwing a little Wine on the ground before drinking still continues in Persia and perhaps generally in the East Mons Nicolas considers it un signe de liberalite et en meme temps un avertissement que le buveur doit vider sa coupe jusqu a la derniere goutte Is it not more likely an ancient Superstition a Libation to propitiate Earth or make her an Accomplice in the illicit Revel Or perhaps to divert the Jealous Eye by some sacrifice of superfluity as with the Ancients of the West With Omar we see something more is signified the precious Liquor is not lost but sinks into the ground to refresh the dust of some poor Wine worshipper foregone Thus Hafiz copying Omar in so many ways When thou drinkest Wine pour a draught on the ground Wherefore fear the Sin which brings to another Gain XLIII According to one beautiful Oriental Legend Azrael accomplishes his mission by holding to the nostril an Apple from the Tree of Life This and the two following Stanzas would have been withdrawn as somewhat de trop from the Text but for advice which I least like to disregard LI From Mah to Mahi from Fish to Moon LVI A Jest of course at his Studies A curious mathematical Quatrain of Omar s has been pointed out to me the more curious because almost exactly parallel d by some Verses of Doctor Donne s that are quoted in Izaak Walton s Lives Here is Omar You and I are the image of a pair of compasses though we have two heads sc our feet we have one body when we have fixed the centre for our circle we bring our heads sc feet together at the end doctor Donne If we be two we two are so As stiff twin compasses are two Thy Soul the fixt foot makes no show To move but does if the other do And though thine in the centre sit Yet when my other far does roam Thine leans and hearkens after it And rows erect as mine comes home Such thou must be to me who must Like the other foot obliquely run Thy firmness makes my circle just And me to end where I begun LIX The Seventy two Religions supposed to divide the World including Islamism as some think but others not LX Alluding to Sultan Mahmud s Conquest of India and its dark people LXVIII Fanusi khiyal a Magic lanthorn still used in India the cylindrical Interior being painted with various Figures and so lightly poised and ventilated as to revolve round the lighted Candle within LXX A very mysterious Line in the Original O danad O danad O danad O breaking off something like our Wood pigeon s Note which she is said to take up just where she left off LXXV Parwin and Mushtari The Pleiads and Jupiter LXXXVII This Relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker figures far and wide in the Literature of the World from the time of the Hebrew Prophets to the present when it may finally take the name of Pot theism by which mister Carlyle ridiculed Sterling s Pantheism My Sheikh whose knowledge flows in from all quarters writes to me Apropos of old Omar s Pots did I ever tell you the sentence I found in Bishop Pearson on the Creed Thus are we wholly at the disposal of His will and our present and future condition framed and ordered by His free but wise and just decrees Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour Rom ix twenty one And can that earth artificer have a freer power over his brother potsherd both being made of the same metal than God hath over him who by the strange fecundity of His omnipotent power first made the clay out of nothing and then him out of that And again from a very different quarter I had to refer the other day to Aristophanes and came by chance on a curious Speaking pot story in the Vespae which I had quite forgotten Greek text deleted from etext The Pot calls a bystander to be a witness to his bad treatment The woman says If by Proserpine instead of all this testifying comp Cuddie and his mother in Old Mortality you would buy yourself a rivet it would show more sense in you The Scholiast explains echinus as Greek phrase deleted from etext One more illustration for the oddity s sake from the Autobiography of a Cornish Rector by the late James Hamley Tregenna eighteen seventy one There was one odd Fellow in our Company he was so like a Figure in the Pilgrim s Progress that Richard always called him the ALLEGORY with a long white beard a rare Appendage in those days and a Face the colour of which seemed to have been baked in like the Faces one used to see on Earthenware Jugs In our Country dialect Earthenware is called Clome so the Boys of the Village used to shout out after him Go back to the Potter Old Clomeface and get baked over again For the Allegory though shrewd enough in most things had the reputation of being saift baked i e of weak intellect XC At the Close of the Fasting Month Ramazan which makes the Mussulman unhealthy and unamiable the first Glimpse of the New Moon who rules their division of the Year is looked for with the utmost Anxiety and hailed with Acclamation Then it is that the Porter s Knot maybe heard toward the Cellar Omar has elsewhere a pretty Quatrain about the same Moon Be of Good Cheer the sullen Month will die And a young Moon requite us by and by Look how
