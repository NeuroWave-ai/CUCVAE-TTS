3526_176651_000012_000000	train-clean-100	She sat at the base of the big tree her little sunbonnet pushed back her arms locked about her knees her bare feet gathered under her crimson gown and her deep eyes fixed on the smoke in the valley below Her breath was still coming fast between her parted lips 
none	none	There were tiny drops along the roots of her shining hair for the climb had been steep and now the shadow of disappointment darkened her eyes 
3526_176651_000012_000002	train-clean-100	The mountains ran in limitless blue waves towards the mounting sun but at birth her eyes had opened on them as on the white mists trailing up the steeps below her 
3526_176651_000012_000003	train-clean-100	Beyond them was a gap in the next mountain chain and down in the little valley just visible through it were trailing blue mists as well and she knew that they were smoke 
3526_176653_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Where 
3526_176651_000012_000004	train-clean-100	Where was the great glare of yellow light that the circuit rider had told about and the leaping tongues of fire 
3526_176651_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Where was the shrieking monster that ran without horses like the wind and tossed back rolling black plumes all streaked with fire 
3526_176651_000012_000006	train-clean-100	For many days now she had heard stories of the furriners who had come into those hills and were doing strange things down there and so at last she had climbed up through the dewy morning from the cove on the other side to see the wonders for herself 
3526_176651_000012_000007	train-clean-100	She had never been up there before 
3526_176651_000012_000008	train-clean-100	She had no business there now and if she were found out when she got back she would get a scolding and maybe something worse from her step mother and all that trouble and risk for nothing but smoke 
3526_176651_000012_000009	train-clean-100	So she lay back and rested her little mouth tightening fiercely 
none	none	It was a big world though that was spread before her and a vague awe of it seized her straightway and held her motionless and dreaming 
3526_176651_000012_000011	train-clean-100	Beyond those white mists trailing up the hills beyond the blue smoke drifting in the valley those limitless blue waves must run under the sun on and on to the end of the world 
3526_176651_000012_000012	train-clean-100	Her dead sister had gone into that far silence and had brought back wonderful stories of that outer world and she began to wonder more than ever before whether she would ever go into it and see for herself what was there 
3526_176653_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 what 
none	none	was there 
3526_176651_000012_000013	train-clean-100	With the thought she rose slowly to her feet moved slowly to the cliff that dropped sheer ten feet aside from the trail and stood there like a great scarlet flower in still air 
none	none	There was the way at her feet that path that coiled under the cliff and ran down loop by loop through majestic oak and poplar and masses of rhododendron 
3526_176651_000012_000015	train-clean-100	She drew a long breath and stirred uneasily she d better go home now but the path had a snake like charm for her and still she stood following it as far down as she could with her eyes 
3526_176651_000012_000016	train-clean-100	Down it went writhing this way and that to a spur that had been swept bare by forest fires 
3526_176651_000012_000017	train-clean-100	Along this spur it travelled straight for a while and as her eyes eagerly followed it to where it sank sharply into a covert of maples the little creature dropped of a sudden to the ground and like something wild lay flat 
none	none	A human figure had filled the leafy mouth that swallowed up the trail and it was coming towards her With a thumping heart she pushed slowly forward through the brush until her face fox like with cunning and screened by a blueberry bush hung just over the edge of the cliff and there she lay like a crouched panther cub looking down For a moment all that was human seemed gone from her eyes but as she watched all that was lost came back to them and something more 
3526_176651_000013_000003	train-clean-100	She had seen that it was a man but she had dropped so quickly that she did not see the big black horse that unled was following him 
3526_176651_000013_000004	train-clean-100	Now both man and horse had stopped 
3526_176651_000013_000005	train-clean-100	The stranger had taken off his gray slouched hat and he was wiping his face with something white 
3526_176651_000013_000006	train-clean-100	Something blue was tied loosely about his throat 
none	none	She had never seen a man like that before 
3526_176651_000013_000008	train-clean-100	His face was smooth and looked different as did his throat and his hands 
3526_176651_000013_000009	train-clean-100	His breeches were tight and on his feet were strange boots that were the colour of his saddle which was deep in seat high both in front and behind and had strange long hooded stirrups 
3526_176651_000013_000010	train-clean-100	Starting to mount the man stopped with one foot in the stirrup and raised his eyes towards her so suddenly that she shrank back again with a quicker throbbing at her heart and pressed closer to the earth 
3526_176651_000013_000011	train-clean-100	Still seen or not seen flight was easy for her so she could not forbear to look again 
3526_176651_000013_000012	train-clean-100	Apparently he had seen nothing only that the next turn of the trail was too steep to ride and so he started walking again and his walk as he strode along the path was new to her as was the erect way with which he held his head and his shoulders 
none	none	In her wonder over him she almost forgot herself forgot to wonder where he was going and why he was coming into those lonely hills until as his horse turned a bend of the trail she saw hanging from the other side of the saddle something that looked like a gun He was a raider that man so cautiously and swiftly then she pushed herself back from the edge of the cliff sprang to her feet dashed past the big tree and winged with fear sped down the mountain leaving in a spot of sunlight at the base of the pine the print of one bare foot in the black earth II He had seen the big pine when he first came to those hills one morning at daybreak when the valley was a sea of mist that threw soft clinging spray to the very mountain tops for even above the mists that morning its mighty head arose sole visible proof that the earth still slept beneath Straightway he wondered how it had ever got there so far above the few of its kind that haunted the green dark ravines far below Some whirlwind doubtless had sent a tiny cone circling heavenward and dropped it there It had sent others too no doubt but how had this tree faced wind and storm alone and alone lived to defy both so proudly Some day he would learn Thereafter he had seen it at noon but little less majestic among the oaks that stood about it had seen it catching the last light at sunset clean cut against the after glow and like a dark silent mysterious sentinel guarding the mountain pass under the moon He had seen it giving place with sombre dignity to the passing burst of spring had seen it green among dying autumn leaves green in the gray of winter trees and still green in a shroud of snow a changeless promise that the earth must wake to life again The Lonesome Pine the mountaineers called it and the Lonesome Pine it always looked to be From the beginning it had a curious fascination for him and straightway within him half exile that he was there sprang up a sympathy for it as for something that was human and a brother And now he was on the trail of it at last From every point that morning it had seemed almost to nod down to him as he climbed and when he reached the ledge that gave him sight of it from base to crown the winds murmured among its needles like a welcoming voice At once he saw the secret of its life On each side rose a cliff that had sheltered it from storms until its trunk had shot upwards so far and so straight and so strong that its green crown could lift itself on and on and bend blow what might as proudly and securely as a lily on its stalk in a morning breeze Dropping his bridle rein he put one hand against it as though on the shoulder of a friend Old Man he said You must be pretty lonesome up here and I m glad to meet you For a while he sat against it resting He had no particular purpose that day no particular destination His saddle bags were across the cantle of his cow boy saddle His fishing rod was tied under one flap He was young and his own master Time was hanging heavy on his hands that day and he loved the woods and the nooks and crannies of them where his own kind rarely made its way Beyond the cove looked dark forbidding mysterious and what was beyond he did not know So down there he would go As he bent his head forward to rise his eye caught the spot of sunlight and he leaned over it with a smile In the black earth was a human foot print too small and slender for the foot of a man a boy or a woman Beyond the same prints were visible wider apart and he smiled again A girl had been there She was the crimson flash that he saw as he started up the steep and mistook for a flaming bush of sumach She had seen him coming and she had fled Still smiling he rose to his feet III 
3526_176653_000001_000000	train-clean-100	On one side he had left the earth yellow with the coming noon but it was still morning as he went down on the other side 
3526_176653_000001_000001	train-clean-100	The laurel and rhododendron still reeked with dew in the deep ever shaded ravine The ferns drenched his stirrups as he brushed through them and each dripping tree top broke the sunlight and let it drop in tent like beams through the shimmering undermist 
none	none	A bird flashed here and there through the green gloom but there was no sound in the air but the footfalls of his horse and the easy creaking of leather under him the drip of dew overhead and the running of water below 
3526_176653_000001_000003	train-clean-100	Now and then he could see the same slender foot prints in the rich loam and he saw them in the sand where the first tiny brook tinkled across the path from a gloomy ravine There the little creature had taken a flying leap across it and beyond he could see the prints no more 
3526_176653_000001_000004	train-clean-100	He little guessed that while he halted to let his horse drink the girl lay on a rock above him looking down She was nearer home now and was less afraid so she had slipped from the trail and climbed above it there to watch him pass 
3526_176653_000001_000005	train-clean-100	As he went on she slid from her perch and with cat footed quiet followed him 
3526_176653_000001_000006	train-clean-100	When he reached the river she saw him pull in his horse and eagerly bend forward looking into a pool just below the crossing 
3526_176653_000001_000007	train-clean-100	There was a bass down there in the clear water a big one and the man whistled cheerily and dismounted tying his horse to a sassafras bush and unbuckling a tin bucket and a curious looking net from his saddle 
none	none	With the net in one hand and the bucket in the other he turned back up the creek and passed so close to where she had slipped aside into the bushes that she came near shrieking but his eyes were fixed on a pool of the creek above and to her wonder he strolled straight into the water with his boots on pushing the net in front of him 
3526_176653_000002_000000	train-clean-100	He was a raider sure she thought now and he was looking for a moonshine still and the wild little thing in the bushes smiled cunningly there was no still up that creek and as he had left his horse below and his gun she waited for him to come back which he did by and by dripping and soaked to his knees 
3738_176682_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 sure 
none	none	she thought now and he was looking for a moonshine still and the wild little thing in the bushes smiled cunningly there was no still up that creek and as he had left his horse below and his gun she waited for him to come back which he did by and by dripping and soaked to his knees 
3526_176653_000002_000001	train-clean-100	Then she saw him untie the queer gun on his saddle pull it out of a case and her eyes got big with wonder take it to pieces and make it into a long limber rod 
3526_176653_000002_000002	train-clean-100	In a moment he had cast a minnow into the pool and waded out into the water up to his hips 
3526_176653_000002_000003	train-clean-100	She had never seen so queer a fishing pole so queer a fisherman 
3526_176653_000002_000004	train-clean-100	How could he get a fish out with that little switch she thought contemptuously 
3526_176653_000002_000005	train-clean-100	By and by something hummed queerly the man gave a slight jerk and a shining fish flopped two feet into the air 
3526_176653_000002_000006	train-clean-100	It was surely very queer for the man didn t put his rod over his shoulder and walk ashore as did the mountaineers but stood still winding something with one hand and again the fish would flash into the air and then that humming would start again while the fisherman would stand quiet and waiting for a while and then he would begin to wind again 
3526_176653_000002_000007	train-clean-100	In her wonder she rose unconsciously to her feet and a stone rolled down to the ledge below her 
3526_176653_000002_000008	train-clean-100	The fisherman turned his head and she started to run but without a word he turned again to the fish he was playing Moreover he was too far out in the water to catch her so she advanced slowly even to the edge of the stream watching the fish cut half circles about the man 
none	none	If he saw her he gave no notice and it was well that he did not 
3526_176653_000002_000010	train-clean-100	He was pulling the bass to and fro now through the water tiring him out drowning him stepping backward at the same time and a moment later the fish slid easily out of the edge of the water gasping along the edge of a low sand bank and the fisherman reaching down with one hand caught him in the gills 
none	none	Then he looked up and smiled and she had seen no smile like that before Howdye Little Girl One bare toe went burrowing suddenly into the sand one finger went to her red mouth and that was all 
3526_176653_000004_000001	train-clean-100	She merely stared him straight in the eye and he smiled again 
3526_176653_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Cat got your tongue 
3526_176653_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Her eyes fell at the ancient banter but she lifted them straightway and stared again 
none	none	You live around here She stared on Where No answer What s your name little girl 
3526_176653_000012_000000	train-clean-100	And still she stared 
3526_176653_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh well of course you can t talk if the cat s got your tongue 
3526_176653_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The steady eyes leaped angrily but there was still no answer and he bent to take the fish off his hook put on a fresh minnow turned his back and tossed it into the pool 
3526_176653_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Hit hain t 
3526_176653_000016_000000	train-clean-100	He looked up again 
none	none	She surely was a pretty little thing and more now that she was angry
3526_176653_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 I should say not he said teasingly 
none	none	What did you say your name was What s YO name 
3526_176653_000019_000000	train-clean-100	The fisherman laughed 
3526_176653_000019_000001	train-clean-100	He was just becoming accustomed to the mountain etiquette that commands a stranger to divulge himself first 
none	none	My name s Jack An mine s Jill She laughed now and it was his time for surprise where could she have heard of Jack and Jill His line rang suddenly Jack she cried you got a bite 
3526_176653_000024_000000	train-clean-100	He pulled missed the strike and wound in 
3526_176653_000024_000001	train-clean-100	The minnow was all right so he tossed it back again 
3526_176653_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 That isn t your name he said 
none	none	If tain t then that ain t your n
3526_176653_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes tis he said shaking his head affirmatively 
none	none	A long cry came down the ravine J u n e eh oh J u n e 
3526_176653_000029_000001	train-clean-100	That was a queer name for the mountains and the fisherman wondered if he had heard aright June 
3526_176653_000030_000000	train-clean-100	The little girl gave a shrill answering cry but she did not move 
none	none	Thar now she said
3526_176653_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Who s that your Mammy 
none	none	No tain t hit s my step mammy I m a goin to ketch hell now Her innocent eyes turned sullen and her baby mouth tightened
3526_176653_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Good Lord said the fisherman startled and then he stopped the words were as innocent on her lips as a benediction 
3526_176653_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Have you got a father Like a flash her whole face changed 
none	none	I reckon I have
3526_176653_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Where is he 
none	none	Hyeh he is drawled a voice from the bushes and it had a tone that made the fisherman whirl suddenly 
3526_176653_000038_000001	train-clean-100	A giant mountaineer stood on the bank above him with a Winchester in the hollow of his arm 
3526_176653_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 How are you The giant s heavy eyes lifted quickly but he spoke to the girl 
none	none	You go on home what you doin hyeh gassin with furriners 
3526_176653_000041_000000	train-clean-100	The girl shrank to the bushes but she cried sharply back 
none	none	Don t you hurt him now Dad He ain t even got a pistol He ain t no
3526_176653_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Shet up 
none	none	The little creature vanished and the mountaineer turned to the fisherman who had just put on a fresh minnow and tossed it into the river Purty well thank you he said shortly How are you Fine was the nonchalant answer 
3526_176653_000045_000001	train-clean-100	For a moment there was silence and a puzzled frown gathered on the mountaineer s face 
3526_176653_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a bright little girl of yours What did she mean by telling you not to hurt me 
none	none	You haven t been long in these mountains have ye
3526_176653_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 No not in THESE mountains why 
3526_176653_000048_000001	train-clean-100	The fisherman looked around and was almost startled by the fierce gaze of his questioner 
3526_176653_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Stop that please he said with a humourous smile 
3526_176653_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 You make me nervous 
3526_176653_000050_000000	train-clean-100	The mountaineer s bushy brows came together across the bridge of his nose and his voice rumbled like distant thunder 
none	none	What s yo name stranger an what s yo business over hyeh Dear me there you go 
3526_176653_000052_000001	train-clean-100	You can see I m fishing but why does everybody in these mountains want to know my name 
3526_176653_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 You heerd me 
3526_176653_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes The fisherman turned again and saw the giant s rugged face stern and pale with open anger now and he too grew suddenly serious 
3526_176653_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Suppose I don t tell you he said gravely 
none	none	What Git said the mountaineer with a move of one huge hairy hand up the mountain An git quick 
3526_176653_000057_000000	train-clean-100	The fisherman never moved and there was the click of a shell thrown into place in the Winchester and a guttural oath from the mountaineer s beard 
none	none	Damn ye he said hoarsely raising the rifle I ll give ye
3526_176653_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t Dad shrieked a voice from the bushes 
none	none	I know his name hit s Jack the rest of the name was unintelligible 
3526_176653_000059_000002	train-clean-100	The mountaineer dropped the butt of his gun to the ground and laughed 
none	none	Illustration Don t Dad shrieked a voice from the bushes thirty four Oh air YOU the engineer The fisherman was angry now 
3526_176653_000062_000001	train-clean-100	He had not moved hand or foot and he said nothing but his mouth was set hard and his bewildered blue eyes had a glint in them that the mountaineer did not at the moment see 
3526_176653_000062_000002	train-clean-100	He was leaning with one arm on the muzzle of his Winchester his face had suddenly become suave and shrewd and now he laughed again 
none	none	So you re Jack Hale air ye The fisherman spoke
3526_176653_000064_000001	train-clean-100	 JOHN Hale except to my friends He looked hard at the old man 
none	none	Do you know that s a pretty dangerous joke of yours my friend I might have a gun myself sometimes 
3526_176653_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Did you think you could scare me The mountaineer stared in genuine surprise 
3526_176653_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Twusn t no joke he said shortly 
none	none	An I don t waste time skeering folks 
3526_176653_000066_000002	train-clean-100	I reckon you don t know who I be 
none	none	I don t care who you are Again the mountaineer stared
3526_176653_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 No use gittin mad young feller he said coolly 
none	none	I mistaken ye fer somebody else an I axe yer pardon 
3526_176653_000068_000002	train-clean-100	When you git through fishin come up to the house right up the creek thar an I ll give ye a dram 
3526_176653_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you said the fisherman stiffly and the mountaineer turned silently away 
3526_176653_000069_000001	train-clean-100	At the edge of the bushes he looked back the stranger was still fishing and the old man went on with a shake of his head 
none	none	He ll come he said to himself Oh he ll come 
3526_176653_000071_000000	train-clean-100	That very point Hale was debating with himself as he unavailingly cast his minnow into the swift water and slowly wound it in again 
3526_176653_000071_000001	train-clean-100	How did that old man know his name 
none	none	And would the old savage really have hurt him had he not found out who he was 
3526_176653_000071_000003	train-clean-100	The little girl was a wonder evidently she had muffled his last name on purpose not knowing it herself and it was a quick and cunning ruse 
3526_176653_000071_000004	train-clean-100	He owed her something for that why did she try to protect him 
3526_176653_000071_000005	train-clean-100	Wonderful eyes too the little thing had deep and dark and how the flame did dart from them when she got angry 
3526_176653_000071_000006	train-clean-100	He smiled remembering he liked that

none	none	Well it was noon now the fish had stopped biting after the wayward fashion of bass he was hungry and thirsty and he would go up and see the little girl and the giant again and get that promised dram Once more however he let his minnow float down into the shadow of a big rock and while he was winding in he looked up to see in the road two people on a gray horse a man with a woman behind him both old and spectacled all three motionless on the bank and looking at him and he wondered if all three had stopped to ask his name and his business 
3526_176653_000071_000010	train-clean-100	No they had just come down to the creek and both they must know already 
none	none	Ketching any called out the old man cheerily Only one answered Hale with equal cheer The old woman pushed back her bonnet as he waded through the water towards them and he saw that she was puffing a clay pipe 
3526_176653_000073_000002	train-clean-100	She looked at the fisherman and his tackle with the naive wonder of a child and then she said in a commanding undertone 
3526_176653_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 Go on Billy 
none	none	Now ole honorable I wish ye d jes wait a minute Hale smiled 
3526_176653_000075_000001	train-clean-100	He loved old people and two kinder faces he had never seen two gentler voices he had never heard 
none	none	I reckon you got the only green pyerch up hyeh said the old man chuckling but thar s a sight of em down thar below my old mill Quietly the old woman hit the horse with a stripped branch of elm and the old gray with a switch of his tail started Wait a minute honorable he said again appealingly won t ye but calmly she hit the horse again and the old man called back over his shoulder You come on down to the mill an I ll show ye whar you can ketch a mess All right shouted Hale holding back his laughter and on they went the old man remonstrating in the kindliest way the old woman silently puffing her pipe and making no answer except to flay gently the rump of the lazy old gray Hesitating hardly a moment Hale unjointed his pole left his minnow bucket where it was mounted his horse and rode up the path About him the beech leaves gave back the gold of the autumn sunlight and a little ravine high under the crest of the mottled mountain was on fire with the scarlet of maple Not even yet had the morning chill left the densely shaded path 
3526_176653_000080_000003	train-clean-100	When he got to the bare crest of a little rise he could see up the creek a spiral of blue rising swiftly from a stone chimney 
3526_176653_000080_000004	train-clean-100	Geese and ducks were hunting crawfish in the little creek that ran from a milk house of logs half hidden by willows at the edge of the forest and a turn in the path brought into view a log cabin well chinked with stones and plaster and with a well built porch 
none	none	A fence ran around the yard and there was a meat house near a little orchard of apple trees under which were many hives of bee gums This man had things hung up and was well to do 
3526_176653_000080_000007	train-clean-100	Down the rise and through a thicket he went and as he approached the creek that came down past the cabin there was a shrill cry ahead of him 
none	none	Whoa thar Buck Gee haw I tell ye An ox wagon evidently was coming on and the road was so narrow that he turned his horse into the bushes to let it pass Whoa Haw Gee Gee Buck Gee I tell ye I ll knock yo fool head off the fust thing you know 
3526_176653_000083_000000	train-clean-100	Still there was no sound of ox or wagon and the voice sounded like a child s 
none	none	So he went on at a walk in the thick sand and when he turned the bushes he pulled up again with a low laugh 
3526_176653_000083_000002	train-clean-100	In the road across the creek was a chubby tow haired boy with a long switch in his right hand and a pine dagger and a string in his left 
3526_176653_000083_000003	train-clean-100	Attached to the string and tied by one hind leg was a frog 
3526_176653_000083_000004	train-clean-100	The boy was using the switch as a goad and driving the frog as an ox and he was as earnest as though both were real 
none	none	I give ye a little rest now Buck he said shaking his head earnestly Hit s a purty hard pull hyeh but I know by Gum you can make hit if you hain t too durn lazy Now git up Buck he yelled suddenly flaying the sand with his switch Git up Whoa Haw Gee Gee 
3526_176653_000084_000004	train-clean-100	The frog hopped several times 
none	none	Whoa now said the little fellow panting in sympathy I knowed you could do it Then he looked up 
3526_176653_000085_000002	train-clean-100	For an instant he seemed terrified but he did not run 
3526_176653_000085_000003	train-clean-100	Instead he stealthily shifted the pine dagger over to his right hand and the string to his left 
3526_176653_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 Here boy said the fisherman with affected sternness What are you doing with that dagger 
3526_176653_000087_000000	train-clean-100	The boy s breast heaved and his dirty fingers clenched tight around the whittled stick 
none	none	Don t you talk to me that a way he said with an ominous shake of his head I ll gut ye 
3526_176653_000089_000000	train-clean-100	The fisherman threw back his head and his peal of laughter did what his sternness failed to do 
3526_176653_000089_000001	train-clean-100	The little fellow wheeled suddenly and his feet spurned the sand around the bushes for home the astonished frog dragged bumping after him 
none	none	Well said the fisherman IV Even the geese in the creek seemed to know that he was a stranger and to distrust him for they cackled and spreading their wings fled cackling up the stream As he neared the house the little girl ran around the stone chimney stopped short shaded her eyes with one hand for a moment and ran excitedly into the house A moment later the bearded giant slouched out stooping his head as he came through the door Hitch that ar post to yo hoss and come right in he thundered cheerily I m waitin fer ye The little girl came to the door pushed one brown slender hand through her tangled hair caught one bare foot behind a deer like ankle and stood motionless Behind her was the boy his dagger still in hand Come right in said the old man we are purty pore folks but you re welcome to what we have The fisherman too had to stoop as he came in for he too was tall The interior was dark in spite of the wood fire in the big stone fireplace Strings of herbs and red pepper pods and twisted tobacco hung from the ceiling and down the wall on either side of the fire and in one corner near the two beds in the room hand made quilts of many colours were piled several feet high On wooden pegs above the door where ten years before would have been buck antlers and an old fashioned rifle lay a Winchester on either side of the door were auger holes through the logs he did not understand that they were port holes and another Winchester stood in the corner From the mantel the butt of a big forty four Colt s revolver protruded ominously On one of the beds in the corner he could see the outlines of a figure lying under a brilliantly figured quilt and at the foot of it the boy with the pine dagger had retreated for refuge From the moment he stooped at the door something in the room had made him vaguely uneasy and when his eyes in swift survey came back to the fire they passed the blaze swiftly and met on the edge of the light another pair of eyes burning on him Howdye said Hale Howdye was the low unpropitiating answer The owner of the eyes was nothing but a boy in spite of his length so much of a boy that a slight crack in his voice showed that it was just past the throes of changing but those black eyes burned on without swerving except once when they flashed at the little girl who with her chin in her hand and one foot on the top rung of her chair was gazing at the stranger with equal steadiness She saw the boy s glance she shifted her knees impatiently and her little face grew sullen Hale smiled inwardly for he thought he could already see the lay of the land and he wondered that at such an age such fierceness could be so every now and then he looked at the boy and every time he looked the black eyes were on him The mountain youth must have been almost six feet tall young as he was and while he was lanky in limb he was well knit His jean trousers were stuffed in the top of his boots and were tight over his knees which were well moulded and that is rare with a mountaineer A loop of black hair curved over his forehead down almost to his left eye His nose was straight and almost delicate and his mouth was small but extraordinarily resolute Somewhere he had seen that face before and he turned suddenly but he did not startle the lad with his abruptness nor make him turn his gaze Why haven t I he said And then he suddenly remembered He had seen that boy not long since on the other side of the mountains riding his horse at a gallop down the county road with his reins in his teeth and shooting a pistol alternately at the sun and the earth with either hand Perhaps it was as well not to recall the incident He turned to the old mountaineer Do you mean to tell me that a man can t go through these mountains without telling everybody who asks him what his name is The effect of his question was singular The old man spat into the fire and put his hand to his beard The boy crossed his legs suddenly and shoved his muscular fingers deep into his pockets The figure shifted position on the bed and the infant at the foot of it seemed to clench his toy dagger a little more tightly Only the little girl was motionless she still looked at him unwinking What sort of wild animals had he fallen among No he can t an keep healthy The giant spoke shortly Why not Well if a man hain t up to some devilment what reason s he got fer not tellin his name That s his business Tain t over hyeh Hit s mine Ef a man don t want to tell his name over hyeh he s a spy or a raider or a officer looking fer somebody or he added carelessly but with a quick covert look at his visitor he s got some kind o business that he don t want nobody to know about Well I came over here just to well I hardly know why I did come Jess so said the old man dryly An if ye ain t looking fer trouble you d better tell your name in these mountains whenever you re axed Ef enough people air backin a custom anywhar hit goes don t hit His logic was good and Hale said nothing Presently the old man rose with a smile on his face that looked cynical picked up a black lump and threw it into the fire It caught fire crackled blazed almost oozed with oil and Hale leaned forward and leaned back Pretty good coal Hain t it though The old man picked up a sliver that had flown to the hearth and held a match to it The piece blazed and burned in his hand I never seed no coal in these mountains like that did you Not often find it around here Right hyeh on this farm about five feet thick What An no partin No partin it was not often that he found a mountaineer who knew what a parting in a coal bed was A friend o mine on t other side a light dawned for the engineer Oh he said quickly That s how you knew my name Right you air stranger He tol me you was a expert The old man laughed loudly An that s why you come over hyeh No it isn t company se not the old fellow laughed again Hale shifted the talk Well now that you know my name suppose you tell me what yours is Tolliver Judd Tolliver Hale started Not Devil Judd That s what some evil folks calls me Again he spoke shortly The mountaineers do not like to talk about their feuds Hale knew this and the subject was dropped But he watched the huge mountaineer with interest There was no more famous character in all those hills than the giant before him yet his face was kind and was good humoured but the nose and eyes were the beak and eyes of some bird of prey The little girl had disappeared for a moment She came back with a blue backed spelling book a second reader and a worn copy of Mother Goose and she opened first one and then the other until the attention of the visitor was caught the black haired youth watching her meanwhile with lowering brows Where did you learn to read Hale asked The old man answered A preacher come by our house over on the Nawth Fork bout three year ago and afore I knowed it he made me promise to send her sister Sally to some school up thar on the edge of the settlements And after she come home Sal larned that little gal to read and spell Sal died bout a year ago Hale reached over and got the spelling book and the old man grinned at the quick unerring responses of the little girl and the engineer looked surprised She read too with unusual facility and her pronunciation was very precise and not at all like her speech You ought to send her to the same place he said but the old fellow shook his head I couldn t git along without her The little girl s eyes began to dance suddenly and without opening Mother Goose she began Jack and Jill went up a hill and then she broke into a laugh and Hale laughed with her Abruptly the boy opposite rose to his great length I reckon I better be goin That was all he said as he caught up a Winchester which stood unseen by his side and out he stalked There was not a word of good by not a glance at anybody A few minutes later Hale heard the creak of a barn door on wooden hinges a cursing command to a horse and four feet going in a gallop down the path and he knew there went an enemy That s a good looking boy who is he The old man spat into the fire It seemed that he was not going to answer and the little girl broke in Hit s my cousin Dave he lives over on the Nawth Fork That was the seat of the Tolliver Falin feud Of that feud too Hale had heard and so no more along that line of inquiry He too soon rose to go Why ain t ye goin to have something to eat Oh no I ve got something in my saddlebags and I must be getting back to the Gap Well I reckon you ain t You re jes goin to take a snack right here Hale hesitated but the little girl was looking at him with such unconscious eagerness in her dark eyes that he sat down again All right I will thank you At once she ran to the kitchen and the old man rose and pulled a bottle of white liquid from under the quilts I reckon I can trust ye he said The liquor burned Hale like fire and the old man with a laugh at the face the stranger made tossed off a tumblerful Gracious said Hale can you do that often Afore breakfast dinner and supper said the old man but I don t Hale felt a plucking at his sleeve It was the boy with the dagger at his elbow Less see you laugh that a way agin said Bub with such deadly seriousness that Hale unconsciously broke into the same peal Now said Bub unwinking I ain t afeard o you no more V Awaiting dinner the mountaineer and the furriner sat on the porch while Bub carved away at another pine dagger on the stoop As Hale passed out the door a querulous voice said Howdye from the bed in the corner and he knew it was the step mother from whom the little girl expected some nether world punishment for an offence of which he was ignorant He had heard of the feud that had been going on between the red Falins and the black Tollivers for a quarter of a century and this was Devil Judd who had earned his nickname when he was the leader of his clan by his terrible strength his marksmanship his cunning and his courage Some years since the old man had retired from the leadership because he was tired of fighting or because he had quarrelled with his brother Dave and his foster brother Bad Rufe known as the terror of the Tollivers or from some unknown reason and in consequence there had been peace for a long time the Falins fearing that Devil Judd would be led into the feud again the Tollivers wary of starting hostilities without his aid After the last trouble Bad Rufe Tolliver had gone West and old Judd had moved his family as far away as possible Hale looked around him this then was the home of Devil Judd Tolliver the little creature inside was his daughter and her name was June All around the cabin the wooded mountains towered except where straight before his eyes Lonesome Creek slipped through them to the river and the old man had certainly picked out the very heart of silence for his home There was no neighbour within two leagues Judd said except old Squire Billy Beams who ran a mill a mile down the river No wonder the spot was called Lonesome Cove You must ha seed Uncle Billy and ole honorable passin he said I did Devil Judd laughed and Hale made out that honorable was short for Honey Uncle Billy used to drink right smart Ole honorable broke him She followed him down to the grocery one day and walked in Come on boys let s have a drink and she set em up an set em up until Uncle Billy most went crazy He had hard work gittin her home an Uncle Billy hain t teched a drap since And the old mountaineer chuckled again All the time Hale could hear noises from the kitchen inside The old step mother was abed he had seen no other woman about the house and he wondered if the child could be cooking dinner Her flushed face answered when she opened the kitchen door and called them in She had not only cooked but now she served as well and when he thanked her as he did every time she passed something to him she would colour faintly Once or twice her hand seemed to tremble and he never looked at her but her questioning dark eyes were full upon him and always she kept one hand busy pushing her thick hair back from her forehead He had not asked her if it was her footprints he had seen coming down the mountain for fear that he might betray her but apparently she had told on herself for Bub after a while burst out suddenly June thar thought you was a raider The little girl flushed and the old man laughed So d you pap she said quietly That s right he said So d anybody I reckon you re the first man that ever come over hyeh jus to go a fishin and he laughed again The stress on the last words showed that he believed no man had yet come just for that purpose and Hale merely laughed with him The old fellow gulped his food pushed his chair back and when Hale was through he wasted no more time Want to see that coal Yes I do said Hale All right I ll be ready in a minute The little girl followed Hale out on the porch and stood with her back against the railing Did you catch it he asked She nodded unsmiling I m sorry What were you doing up there She showed no surprise that he knew that she had been up there and while she answered his question he could see that she was thinking of something else I d heerd so much about what you furriners was a doin over thar You must have heard about a place farther over but it s coming over there too some day And still she looked an unspoken question The fish that Hale had caught was lying where he had left it on the edge of the porch That s for you June he said pointing to it and the name as he spoke it was sweet to his ears I m much obleeged she said shyly I d a cooked hit fer ye if I d a knowed you wasn t goin to take hit home That s the reason I didn t give it to you at first I was afraid you d do that I wanted you to have it Much obleeged she said again still unsmiling and then she suddenly looked up at him the deeps of her dark eyes troubled Air ye ever comin back agin Jack Hale was not accustomed to the familiar form of address common in the mountains independent of sex or age and he would have been staggered had not her face been so serious And then few women had ever called him by his first name and this time his own name was good to his ears Yes June he said soberly Not for some time maybe but I m coming back again sure She smiled then with both lips and eyes radiantly I ll be lookin fer ye she said simply VI The old man went with him up the creek and passing the milk house turned up a brush bordered little branch in which the engineer saw signs of coal Up the creek the mountaineer led him some thirty yards above the water level and stopped An entry had been driven through the rich earth and ten feet within was a shining bed of coal There was no parting except two inches of mother of coal midway which would make it but easier to mine Who had taught that old man to open coal in such a way to make such a facing It looked as though the old fellow were in some scheme with another to get him interested As he drew closer he saw radiations of some twelve inches all over the face of the coal star shaped and he almost gasped It was not only cannel coal it was bird s eye cannel Heavens what a find Instantly he was the cautious man of business alert cold uncommunicative That looks like a pretty good he drawled the last two words vein of coal I d like to take a sample over to the Gap and analyze it His hammer which he always carried was in his saddle pockets but he did not have to go down to his horse There were pieces on the ground that would suit his purpose left there no doubt by his predecessor Now I reckon you know that I know why you came over hyeh Hale started to answer but he saw it was no use Yes and I m coming again for the same reason

none	none	come agin and come often The little girl was standing on the porch as he rode past the milk house He waved his hand to her but she did not move nor answer What a life for a child for that keen eyed sweet faced child But that coal cannel rich as oil above water five feet in thickness easy to mine with a solid roof and perhaps self drainage if he could judge from the dip of the vein and a market everywhere England Spain Italy Brazil The coal to be sure might not be persistent thirty yards within it might change in quality to ordinary bituminous coal but he could settle that only with a steam drill A steam drill He would as well ask for the wagon that he had long ago hitched to a star and then there might be a fault in the formation But why bother now The coal would stay there and now he had other plans that made even that find insignificant And yet if he bought that coal now what a bargain It was not that the ideals of his college days were tarnished but he was a man of business now and if he would take the old man s land for a song it was because others of his kind would do the same But why bother he asked himself again when his brain was in a ferment with a colossal scheme that would make dizzy the magnates who would some day drive their roadways of steel into those wild hills So he shook himself free of the question which passed from his mind only with a transient wonder as to who it was that had told of him to the old mountaineer and had so paved his way for an investigation and then he wheeled suddenly in his saddle The bushes had rustled gently behind him and out from them stepped an extraordinary human shape wearing a coon skin cap belted with two rows of big cartridges carrying a big Winchester over one shoulder and a circular tube of brass in his left hand With his right leg straight his left thigh drawn into the hollow of his saddle and his left hand on the rump of his horse Hale simply stared his eyes dropping by and by from the pale blue eyes and stubbly red beard of the stranger down past the cartridge belts to the man s feet on which were moccasins with the heels forward Into what sort of a world had he dropped So nary a soul can tell which way I m going said the red haired stranger with a grin that loosed a hollow chuckle far behind it Would you mind telling me what difference it can make to me which way you are going Every moment he was expecting the stranger to ask his name but again that chuckle came It makes a mighty sight o difference to some folks But none to me I hain t wearin em fer you I know YOU Oh you do The stranger suddenly lowered his Winchester and turned his face with his ear cocked like an animal There was some noise on the spur above Nothin but a hickory nut said the chuckle again But Hale had been studying that strange face One side of it was calm kindly philosophic benevolent but when the other was turned a curious twitch of the muscles at the left side of the mouth showed the teeth and made a snarl there that was wolfish Yes and I know you he said slowly Self satisfaction straightway was ardent in the face I knowed you would git to know me in time if you didn t now This was the Red Fox of the mountains of whom he had heard so much yarb doctor and Swedenborgian preacher revenue officer and some said cold blooded murderer He would walk twenty miles to preach or would start at any hour of the day or night to minister to the sick and would charge for neither service At other hours he would be searching for moonshine stills or watching his enemies in the valley from some mountain top with that huge spy glass Hale could see now that the brass tube was a telescope that he might slip down and unawares take a pot shot at them The Red Fox communicated with spirits had visions and superhuman powers of locomotion stepping mysteriously from the bushes people said to walk at the traveller s side and as mysteriously disappearing into them again to be heard of in a few hours an incredible distance away I ve been watchin ye from up thar he said with a wave of his hand I seed ye go up the creek and then the bushes hid ye I know what you was after but did you see any signs up thar of anything you wasn t looking fer Hale laughed Well I ve been in these mountains long enough not to tell you if I had The Red Fox chuckled I wasn t sure you had Hale coughed and spat to the other side of his horse When he looked around the Red Fox was gone and he had heard no sound of his going Well I be Hale clucked to his horse and as he climbed the last steep and drew near the Big Pine he again heard a noise out in the woods and he knew this time it was the fall of a human foot and not of a hickory nut He was right and as he rode by the Pine saw again at its base the print of the little girl s foot wondering afresh at the reason that led her up there and dropped down through the afternoon shadows towards the smoke and steam and bustle and greed of the Twentieth Century A long lean black eyed boy with a wave of black hair over his forehead was pushing his horse the other way along the Big Black and dropping down through the dusk into the Middle Ages both all but touching on either side the outstretched hands of the wild little creature left in the shadows of Lonesome Cove VII Past the Big Pine swerving with a smile his horse aside that he might not obliterate the foot print in the black earth and down the mountain his brain busy with his big purpose went John Hale by instinct inheritance blood and tradition pioneer One of his forefathers had been with Washington on the Father s first historic expedition into the wilds of Virginia His great grandfather had accompanied Boone when that hunter first penetrated the Dark and Bloody Ground had gone back to Virginia and come again with a surveyor s chain and compass to help wrest it from the red men among whom there had been an immemorial conflict for possession and a never recognized claim of ownership That compass and that chain his grandfather had fallen heir to and with that compass and chain his father had earned his livelihood amid the wrecks of the Civil War Hale went to the old Transylvania University at Lexington the first seat of learning planted beyond the Alleghanies He was fond of history of the sciences and literature was unusually adept in Latin and Greek and had a passion for mathematics He was graduated with honours he taught two years and got his degree of Master of Arts but the pioneer spirit in his blood would still out and his polite learning he then threw to the winds Other young Kentuckians had gone West in shoals but he kept his eye on his own State and one autumn he added a pick to the old compass and the ancestral chain struck the Old Wilderness Trail that his grandfather had travelled to look for his own fortune in a land which that old gentleman had passed over as worthless At the Cumberland River he took a canoe and drifted down the river into the wild coal swollen hills Through the winter he froze starved and prospected and a year later he was opening up a region that became famous after his trust and inexperience had let others worm out of him an interest that would have made him easy for life With the vision of a seer he was as innocent as Boone Stripped clean he got out his map such geological reports as he could find and went into a studious trance for a month emerging mentally with the freshness of a snake that has shed its skin What had happened in Pennsylvania must happen all along the great Alleghany chain in the mountains of Virginia West Virginia Kentucky Alabama Tennessee Some day the avalanche must sweep south it must it must That he might be a quarter of a century too soon in his calculations never crossed his mind Some day it must come Now there was not an ounce of coal immediately south east of the Cumberland Mountains not an ounce of iron ore immediately north east all the coal lay to the north east all of the iron ore to the south east So said Geology For three hundred miles there were only four gaps through that mighty mountain chain three at water level and one at historic Cumberland Gap which was not at water level and would have to be tunnelled So said Geography All railroads to east and to west would have to pass through those gaps through them the coal must be brought to the iron ore or the ore to the coal Through three gaps water flowed between ore and coal and the very hills between were limestone Was there any such juxtaposition of the four raw materials for the making of iron in the known world When he got that far in his logic the sweat broke from his brows he felt dizzy and he got up and walked into the open air As the vastness and certainty of the scheme what fool could not see it rushed through him full force he could scarcely get his breath There must be a town in one of those gaps but in which No matter he would buy all of them all of them he repeated over and over again for some day there must be a town in one and some day a town in all and from all he would reap his harvest He optioned those four gaps at a low purchase price that was absurd He went back to the Bluegrass he went to New York in some way he managed to get to England It had never crossed his mind that other eyes could not see what he so clearly saw and yet everywhere he was pronounced crazy He failed and his options ran out but he was undaunted He picked his choice of the four gaps and gave up the other three This favourite gap he had just finished optioning again and now again he meant to keep at his old quest That gap he was entering now from the north side and the North Fork of the river was hurrying to enter too On his left was a great gray rock projecting edgewise covered with laurel and rhododendron and under it was the first big pool from which the stream poured faster still There had been a terrible convulsion in that gap when the earth was young the strata had been tossed upright and planted almost vertical for all time and a little farther one mighty ledge moss grown bush covered sentinelled with grim pines their bases unseen seemed to be making a heavy flight toward the clouds Big bowlders began to pop up in the river bed and against them the water dashed and whirled and eddied backward in deep pools while above him the song of a cataract dropped down a tree choked ravine Just there the drop came and for a long space he could see the river lashing rock and cliff with increasing fury as though it were seeking shelter from some relentless pursuer in the dark thicket where it disappeared Straight in front of him another ledge lifted itself Beyond that loomed a mountain which stopped in mid air and dropped sheer to the eye Its crown was bare and Hale knew that up there was a mountain farm the refuge of a man who had been involved in that terrible feud beyond Black Mountain behind him Five minutes later he was at the yawning mouth of the gap and there lay before him a beautiful valley shut in tightly for all the eye could see with mighty hills It was the heaven born site for the unborn city of his dreams and his eyes swept every curve of the valley lovingly The two forks of the river ran around it he could follow their course by the trees that lined the banks of each curving within a stone s throw of each other across the valley and then looping away as from the neck of an ancient lute and like its framework coming together again down the valley where they surged together slipped through the hills and sped on with the song of a sweeping river Up that river could come the track of commerce out the South Fork too it could go though it had to turn eastward back through that gap it could be traced north and west and so none could come as heralds into those hills but their footprints could be traced through that wild rocky water worn chasm Hale drew breath and raised in his stirrups It s a cinch he said aloud It s a shame to take the money Yet nothing was in sight now but a valley farmhouse above the ford where he must cross the river and one log cabin on the hill beyond Still on the other river was the only woollen mill in miles around farther up was the only grist mill and near by was the only store the only blacksmith shop and the only hotel That much of a start the gap had had for three quarters of a century only from the south now a railroad was already coming from the east another was travelling like a wounded snake and from the north still another creeped to meet them Every road must run through the gap and several had already run through it lines of survey The coal was at one end of the gap and the iron ore at the other the cliffs between were limestone and the other elements to make it the iron centre of the world flowed through it like a torrent Selah It s a shame to take the money He splashed into the creek and his big black horse thrust his nose into the clear running water Minnows were playing about him A hog fish flew for shelter under a rock and below the ripples a two pound bass shot like an arrow into deep water Above and below him the stream was arched with beech poplar and water maple and the banks were thick with laurel and rhododendron His eye had never rested on a lovelier stream and on the other side of the town site which nature had kindly lifted twenty feet above the water level the other fork was of equal clearness swiftness and beauty Such a drainage murmured his engineering instinct Such a drainage It was Saturday Even if he had forgotten he would have known that it must be Saturday when he climbed the bank on the other side Many horses were hitched under the trees and here and there was a farm wagon with fragments of paper bits of food and an empty bottle or two lying around It was the hour when the alcoholic spirits of the day were usually most high Evidently they were running quite high that day and something distinctly was going on up town A few yells the high clear penetrating yell of a fox hunter rent the air a chorus of pistol shots rang out and the thunder of horses hoofs started beyond the little slope he was climbing When he reached the top a merry youth with a red hatless head was splitting the dirt road toward him his reins in his teeth and a pistol in each hand which he was letting off alternately into the inoffensive earth and toward the unrebuking heavens that seemed a favourite way in those mountains of defying God and the devil and behind him galloped a dozen horsemen to the music of throat pistol and iron hoof The fiery headed youth s horse swerved and shot by Hale hardly knew that the rider even saw him but the coming ones saw him afar and they seemed to be charging him in close array Hale stopped his horse a little to the right of the centre of the road and being equally helpless against an inherited passion for maintaining his own rights and a similar disinclination to get out of anybody s way he sat motionless Two of the coming horsemen side by side were a little in advance Git out o the road they yelled Had he made the motion of an arm they might have ridden or shot him down but the simple quietness of him as he sat with hands crossed on the pommel of his saddle face calm and set eyes unwavering and fearless had the effect that nothing else he could have done would have brought about and they swerved on either side of him while the rest swerved too like sheep one stirrup brushing his as they swept by Hale rode slowly on He could hear the mountaineers yelling on top of the hill but he did not look back Several bullets sang over his head Most likely they were simply bantering him but no matter he rode on The blacksmith the storekeeper and one passing drummer were coming in from the woods when he reached the hotel A gang o those Falins said the storekeeper they come over lookin for young Dave Tolliver They didn t find him so they thought they d have some fun and he pointed to the hotel sign which was punctuated with pistol bullet periods Hale s eyes flashed once but he said nothing He turned his horse over to a stable boy and went across to the little frame cottage that served as office and home for him While he sat on the veranda that almost hung over the mill pond of the other stream three of the Falins came riding back One of them had left something at the hotel and while he was gone in for it another put a bullet through the sign and seeing Hale rode over to him Hale s blue eye looked anything than friendly Don t ye like it asked the horseman I do not said Hale calmly The horseman seemed amused Well whut you goin to do about it Nothing at least not now All right whenever you git ready You ain t ready now No said Hale not now The fellow laughed Hit s a damned good thing for you that you ain t Hale looked long after the three as they galloped down the road When I start to build this town he thought gravely and without humour I ll put a stop to all that VIII On a spur of Black Mountain beyond the Kentucky line a lean horse was tied to a sassafras bush and in a clump of rhododendron ten yards away a lean black haired boy sat with a Winchester between his stomach and thighs waiting for the dusk to drop His chin was in both hands the brim of his slouch hat was curved crescent wise over his forehead and his eyes were on the sweeping bend of the river below him That was the Bad Bend down there peopled with ancestral enemies and the head quarters of their leader for the last ten years Though they had been at peace for some time now it had been Saturday in the county town ten miles down the river as well and nobody ever knew what a Saturday might bring forth between his people and them So he would not risk riding through that bend by the light of day All the long way up spur after spur and along ridge after ridge all along the still tree crested top of the Big Black he had been thinking of the man the furriner whom he had seen at his uncle s cabin in Lonesome Cove He was thinking of him still as he sat there waiting for darkness to come and the two vertical little lines in his forehead that had hardly relaxed once during his climb got deeper and deeper as his brain puzzled into the problem that was worrying it who the stranger was what his business was over in the Cove and his business with the Red Fox with whom the boy had seen him talking He had heard of the coming of the furriners on the Virginia side He had seen some of them he was suspicious of all of them he disliked them all but this man he hated straightway He hated his boots and his clothes the way he sat and talked as though he owned the earth and the lad snorted contemptuously under his breath He called pants trousers It was a fearful indictment and he snorted again Trousers The furriner might be a spy or a revenue officer but deep down in the boy s heart the suspicion had been working that he had gone over there to see his little cousin the girl whom boy that he was he had marked when she was even more of a child than she was now for his own His people understood it as did her father and child though she was she too understood it The difference between her and the furriner difference in age condition way of life education meant nothing to him and as his suspicion deepened his hands dropped and gripped his Winchester and through his gritting teeth came vaguely By God if he does if he just does Away down at the lower end of the river s curving sweep the dirt road was visible for a hundred yards or more and even while he was cursing to himself a group of horsemen rode into sight All seemed to be carrying something across their saddle bows and as the boy s eyes caught them he sank sidewise out of sight and stood upright peering through a bush of rhododendron Something had happened in town that day for the horsemen carried Winchesters and every foreign thought in his brain passed like breath from a window pane while his dark thin face whitened a little with anxiety and wonder Swiftly he stepped backward keeping the bushes between him and his far away enemies Another knot he gave the reins around the sassafras bush and then Winchester in hand he dropped noiseless as an Indian from rock to rock tree to tree down the sheer spur on the other side Twenty minutes later he lay behind a bush that was sheltered by the top boulder of the rocky point under which the road ran His enemies were in their own country they would probably be talking over the happenings in town that day and from them he would learn what was going on So long he lay that he got tired and out of patience and he was about to creep around the boulder when the clink of a horseshoe against a stone told him they were coming and he flattened to the earth and closed his eyes that his ears might be more keen The Falins were riding silently but as the first two passed under him one said I d like to know who the hell warned em Whar s the Red Fox was the significant answer The boy s heart leaped There had been deviltry abroad but his kinsmen had escaped No one uttered a word as they rode two by two under him but one voice came back to him as they turned the point I wonder if the other boys ketched young Dave He could not catch the answer to that only the oath that was in it and when the sound of the horses hoofs died away he turned over on his back and stared up at the sky Some trouble had come and through his own caution and the mercy of Providence that had kept him away from the Gap he had had his escape from death that day He would tempt that Providence no more even by climbing back to his horse in the waning light and it was not until dusk had fallen that he was leading the beast down the spur and into a ravine that sank to the road There he waited an hour and when another horseman passed he still waited a while Cautiously then with ears alert eyes straining through the darkness and Winchester ready he went down the road at a slow walk There was a light in the first house but the front door was closed and the road was deep with sand as he knew so he passed noiselessly At the second house light streamed through the open door he could hear talking on the porch and he halted He could neither cross the river nor get around the house by the rear the ridge was too steep so he drew off into the bushes where he had to wait another hour before the talking ceased There was only one more house now between him and the mouth of the creek where he would be safe and he made up his mind to dash by it That house too was lighted and the sound of fiddling struck his ears He would give them a surprise so he gathered his reins and Winchester in his left hand drew his revolver with his right and within thirty yards started his horse into a run yelling like an Indian and firing his pistol in the air As he swept by two or three figures dashed pell mell indoors and he shouted derisively Run damn ye run They were running for their guns he knew but the taunt would hurt and he was pleased As he swept by the edge of a cornfield there was a flash of light from the base of a cliff straight across and a bullet sang over him then another and another but he sped on cursing and yelling and shooting his own Winchester up in the air all harmless useless but just to hurl defiance and taunt them with his safety His father s house was not far away there was no sound of pursuit and when he reached the river he drew down to a walk and stopped short in a shadow Something had clicked in the bushes above him and he bent over his saddle and lay close to his horse s neck The moon was rising behind him and its light was creeping toward him through the bushes In a moment he would be full in its yellow light and he was slipping from his horse to dart aside into the bushes when a voice ahead of him called sharply That you Dave It was his father and the boy s answer was a loud laugh Several men stepped from the bushes they had heard firing and fearing that young Dave was the cause of it they had run to his help What the hell you mean boy kickin up such a racket Oh I knowed somethin d happened an I wanted to skeer em a leetle Yes an you never thought o the trouble you might be causin us Don t you bother about me I can take keer o myself Old Dave Tolliver grunted though at heart he was deeply pleased Well you come on home All went silently the boy getting meagre monosyllabic answers to his eager questions but by the time they reached home he had gathered the story of what had happened in town that day There were more men in the porch of the house and all were armed The women of the house moved about noiselessly and with drawn faces There were no lights lit and nobody stood long even in the light of the fire where he could be seen through a window and doors were opened and passed through quickly The Falins had opened the feud that day for the boy s foster uncle Bad Rufe Tolliver contrary to the terms of the last truce had come home from the West and one of his kinsmen had been wounded The boy told what he had heard while he lay over the road along which some of his enemies had passed and his father nodded The Falins had learned in some way that the lad was going to the Gap that day and had sent men after him Who was the spy You TOLD me you was a goin to the Gap said old Dave Whar was ye I didn t git that far said the boy The old man and Loretta young Dave s sister laughed and quiet smiles passed between the others Well you d better be keerful bout gittin even as far as you did git wharever that was from now on I ain t afeered the boy said sullenly and he turned into the kitchen Still sullen he ate his supper in silence and his mother asked him no questions He was worried that Bad Rufe had come back to the mountains for Rufe was always teasing June and there was something in his bold black eyes that made the lad furious even when the foster uncle was looking at Loretta or the little girl in Lonesome Cove And yet that was nothing to his new trouble for his mind hung persistently to the stranger and to the way June had behaved in the cabin in Lonesome Cove Before he went to bed he slipped out to the old well behind the house and sat on the water trough in gloomy unrest looking now and then at the stars that hung over the Cove and over the Gap beyond where the stranger was bound It would have pleased him a good deal could he have known that the stranger was pushing his big black horse on his way under those stars toward the outer world IX It was court day at the county seat across the Kentucky line Hale had risen early as everyone must if he would get his breakfast in the mountains even in the hotels in the county seats and he sat with his feet on the railing of the hotel porch which fronted the main street of the town He had had his heart breaking failures since the autumn before but he was in good cheer now for his feverish enthusiasm had at last clutched a man who would take up not only his options on the great Gap beyond Black Mountain but on the cannel coal lands of Devil Judd Tolliver as well He was riding across from the Bluegrass to meet this man at the railroad in Virginia nearly two hundred miles away he had stopped to examine some titles at the county seat and he meant to go on that day by way of Lonesome Cove Opposite was the brick Court House every window lacking at least one pane the steps yellow with dirt and tobacco juice the doorway and the bricks about the upper windows bullet dented and eloquent 
3783-176659-0000	train-other-500	with memories of the feud which had long embroiled the whole county Not that everybody took part in it but on the matter everybody as an old woman told him had feelin s It had begun so he learned just after the war
3783-176659-0001	train-other-500	Two boys were playing marbles in the road along the Cumberland River and one had a patch on the seat of his trousers The other boy made fun of it and the boy with the patch went home and told his father As a result there had already been thirty years of local war
3783-176659-0002	train-other-500	In the last race for legislature political issues were submerged and the feud was the sole issue And a Tolliver had carried that boy s trouser patch like a flag to victory and was sitting in the lower House at that time helping to make laws for the rest of the State Now Bad Rufe Tolliver
3783-176659-0003	train-other-500	was in the hills again and the end was not yet Already people were pouring in men women and children the men slouch hatted and stalking through the mud in the rain or filing in on horseback riding double sometimes two men or two women
none	none	 or a man with his wife or daughter behind him 
3783-176659-0004	train-other-500	or a woman with a baby in her lap and two more children behind all dressed in homespun or store clothes and the paint from artificial flowers on her hat streaking the face of every girl who had unwisely scanned the heavens that morning
3783-176659-0005	train-other-500	Soon the square was filled with hitched horses and an auctioneer was bidding off cattle sheep hogs and horses to the crowd of mountaineers about him while the women sold eggs and butter and bought things for use at home
3783-176659-0006	train-other-500	Now and then an open feudsman with a Winchester passed and many a man was belted with cartridges for the big pistol dangling at his hip When court opened the rain ceased the sun came out and Hale made his way through the crowd to the battered temple of justice
3783-176659-0007	train-other-500	On one corner of the square he could see the chief store of the town marked Buck Falin General Merchandise and the big man in the door with the bushy redhead he guessed was the leader of the Falin clan Outside the door stood a smaller replica of the same figure
3783-176659-0008	train-other-500	whom he recognized as the leader of the band that had nearly ridden him down at the Gap when they were looking for young Dave Tolliver the autumn before That doubtless was young Buck
none	none	 For a moment he stood at the door of the court room A Falin was on trial 
3783-176659-0009	train-other-500	and the grizzled judge was speaking angrily This is the third time you ve had this trial postponed because you hain t got no lawyer I ain t goin to put it off Have you got you a lawyer now Yes jedge said the defendant
none	none	 Well whar is he Over thar on the jury The judge looked at the man on the jury Well I reckon you better leave him whar he is 
3783-176659-0010	train-other-500	He ll do you more good thar than any whar else Hale laughed aloud the judge glared at him and he turned quickly upstairs to his work in the deed room Till noon he worked and yet there was no trouble After dinner he went back and in two hours his work was done
3783-176659-0011	train-other-500	An atmospheric difference he felt as soon as he reached the door The crowd had melted from the square There were no women in sight but eight armed men were in front of the door and two of them a red Falin and a black Tolliver Bad Rufe it was were quarrelling
3783-176659-0012	train-other-500	In every doorway stood a man cautiously looking on and in a hotel window he saw a woman s frightened face It was so still that it seemed impossible that a tragedy could be imminent and yet while he was trying to take the conditions in one of the quarrelling men
3783-176659-0013	train-other-500	Bad Rufe Tolliver whipped out his revolver and before he could level it a Falin struck the muzzle of a pistol into his back Another Tolliver flashed his weapon on the Falin This Tolliver was covered by another Falin and in so many flashes of lightning
3783-176659-0014	train-other-500	the eight men in front of him were covering each other every man afraid to be the first to shoot since he knew that the flash of his own pistol meant instantaneous death for him As Hale shrank back he pushed against somebody who thrust him aside It was the judge
3783-176659-0015	train-other-500	Why don t somebody shoot he asked sarcastically You re a purty set o fools ain t you
none	none	 I want you all to stop this damned foolishness 
3783-176659-0016	train-other-500	Now when I give the word I want you Jim Falin and Rufe Tolliver thar to drap yer guns Already Rufe was grinning like a devil over the absurdity of the situation Now said the judge and the two guns were dropped Put em in yo pockets They did Drap
3783-176659-0017	train-other-500	All dropped and with those two all put up their guns each man however watching now the man who had just been covering him It is not wise for the stranger to show too much interest in the personal affairs of mountain men
3783-176659-0018	train-other-500	and Hale left the judge berating them and went to the hotel to get ready for the Gap little dreaming how fixed the faces of some of those men were in his brain and how later they were to rise in his memory again His horse was lame but he must go on
none	none	 so he hired a yaller mule 
3783-176659-0019	train-other-500	from the landlord and when the beast was brought around he overheard two men talking at the end of the porch
none	none	 You don t mean to say they ve made peace Yes Rufe s going away agin and they shuk hands all of em The other laughed Rufe ain t gone yit The Cumberland River was rain swollen 
3783-176659-0020	train-other-500	The home going people were helping each other across it and as Hale approached the ford of a creek half a mile beyond the river a black haired girl was standing on a boulder looking helplessly at the yellow water and two boys were on the ground below her One of them looked up at Hale
3783-176659-0021	train-other-500	I wish ye d help this lady cross Certainly said Hale and the girl giggled when he laboriously turned his old mule up to the boulder Not accustomed to have ladies ride behind him Hale had turned the wrong side
none	none	 Again he laboriously wheeled about and then into the yellow torrent he went with the girl behind him 
3783-176659-0022	train-other-500	the old beast stumbling over the stones whereat the girl unafraid made sounds of much merriment Across Hale stopped and said courteously If you are going up this way you are quite welcome to ride on
3783-176659-0023	train-other-500	Well I wasn t crossin that crick jes exactly fer fun said the girl demurely and then she murmured something about her cousins and looked back They had gone down to a shallower ford and when they too had waded across they said nothing and the girl said nothing
3783-176659-0024	train-other-500	so Hale started on the two boys following The mule was slow and being in a hurry Hale urged him with his whip Every time he struck the beast would kick up and once the girl came near going off You must watch out when I hit him said Hale
3783-176659-0025	train-other-500	I don t know when you re goin to hit him she drawled unconcernedly Well I ll let you know said Hale laughing Now And as he whacked the beast again the girl laughed and they were better acquainted Presently they passed two boys Hale was wearing riding boots and tight breeches
3783-176659-0026	train-other-500	and one of the boys ran his eyes up boot and leg and if they were lifted higher Hale could not tell Whar d you git him he squeaked The girl turned her head as the mule broke into a trot Ain t got time to tell They are my cousins explained the girl
3783-176659-0027	train-other-500	What is your name asked Hale Loretty Tolliver Hale turned in his saddle Are you the daughter of Dave Tolliver Yes Then you ve got a brother named Dave Yes This then was the sister of the black haired boy he had seen in the Lonesome Cove
3783-176659-0028	train-other-500	Haven t you got some kinfolks over the mountain Yes I got an uncle livin over thar Devil Judd folks calls him said the girl simply This girl was cousin to little June in Lonesome Cove
3783-176659-0029	train-other-500	Every now and then she would look behind them and when Hale turned again inquiringly she explained I m worried about my cousins back thar I m afeered somethin mought happen to em Shall we wait for them Oh no I reckon not
3783-176659-0030	train-other-500	Soon they overtook two men on horseback and after they passed and were fifty yards ahead of them one of the men lifted his voice jestingly Is that your woman stranger or have you just borrowed her Hale shouted back No I m sorry to say I ve just borrowed her
none	none	 and he turned to see how she would take this answering pleasantry 
3783-176659-0031	train-other-500	She was looking down shyly and she did not seem much pleased They are kinfolks o mine too she said
none	none	 and whether it was in explanation or as a rebuke Hale could not determine 
3783-176659-0032	train-other-500	You must be kin to everybody around here Most everybody she said simply By and by they came to a creek
none	none	 I have to turn up here said Hale 
3783-176659-0033	train-other-500	So do I she said smiling now directly at him Good he said and they went on Hale asking more questions She was going to school at the county seat the coming winter and she was fifteen years old
3783-176659-0034	train-other-500	That s right The trouble in the mountains is that you girls marry so early that you don t have time to get an education She wasn t going to marry early she said but Hale learned now that she had a sweetheart who had been in town that day and apparently the two had had a quarrel Who it was she would not tell
3783-176659-0035	train-other-500	and Hale would have been amazed had he known the sweetheart was none other than young Buck Falin and that the quarrel between the lovers had sprung from the opening quarrel that day between the clans Once again she came near going off the mule
3783-176659-0036	train-other-500	and Hale observed that she was holding to the cantel of his saddle Look here he said suddenly hadn t you better catch hold of me She shook her head vigorously and made two not to be rendered sounds that meant No indeed Well if this were your sweetheart
3783-176659-0037	train-other-500	you d take hold of him wouldn t you Again she gave a vigorous shake of the head Well if he saw you riding behind me he wouldn t like it would he She didn t keer she said but Hale did and when he heard the galloping of horses behind him saw two men coming and heard one of them shouting
none	none	 Hyeh you man on that yaller mule stop thar 
3783-176659-0038	train-other-500	he shifted his revolver pulled in and waited with some uneasiness They came up reeling in their saddles neither one the girl s sweetheart as he saw at once from her face and began to ask what the girl characterized afterward as unnecessary questions who he was
none	none	 who she was and where they were going 
3783-176659-0039	train-other-500	Hale answered so shortly that the girl thought there was going to be a fight
none	none	 and she was on the point of slipping from the mule 
3783-176659-0040	train-other-500	Sit still said Hale quietly There s not going to be a fight so long as you are here Thar hain t said one of the men Well then he looked sharply at the girl and turned his horse Come on Bill that s ole Dave Tolliver s gal The girl s face was on fire Them mean Falins
3783-176659-0041	train-other-500	she said contemptuously and somehow the mere fact that Hale had been even for the moment antagonistic to the other faction seemed to put him in the girl s mind at once on her side and straightway she talked freely of the feud
none	none	 Devil Judd had taken no active part in it for a long time she said 
3783-176659-0042	train-other-500	except to keep it down especially since he and her father had had a fallin out and the two families did not visit much though she and her cousin June sometimes spent the night with each other
none	none	 You won t be able to git over thar till long atter dark she said 
3783-176659-0043	train-other-500	and she caught her breath so suddenly and so sharply that Hale turned to see what the matter was She searched his face with her black eyes which were like June s without the depths of June s I was just a wonderin if mebbe you wasn t the same feller that was over in Lonesome last fall
3783-176659-0044	train-other-500	Maybe I am my name s Hale The girl laughed Well if this ain t the beatenest I ve heerd June talk about you
none	none	 My brother Dave don t like you overmuch she added frankly 
3783-176659-0045	train-other-500	I reckon we ll see Dave purty soon If this ain t the beatenest she repeated and she laughed again as she always did laugh it seemed to Hale when there was any prospect of getting him into trouble
none	none	 You can t git over thar till long atter dark she said again presently 
3783-176659-0046	train-other-500	Is there any place on the way where I can get to stay all night You can stay all night with the Red Fox on top of the mountain The Red Fox repeated Hale Yes he lives right on top of the mountain You can t miss his house Oh yes I remember him
3783-176659-0047	train-other-500	I saw him talking to one of the Falins in town to day behind the barn when I went to get my horse You seed him a talkin to a Falin AFORE the trouble come up
none	none	 the girl asked slowly and with such significance that Hale turned to look at her He felt straightway that he ought not to have said that and the day was to come when he would remember it to his cost 
3783-176659-0048	train-other-500	He knew how foolish it was for the stranger to show sympathy with or interest in one faction or another in a mountain feud but to give any kind of information of one to the other that was unwise indeed Ahead of them now a little stream ran from a ravine across the road
3783-176659-0049	train-other-500	Beyond was a cabin in the doorway were several faces and sitting on a horse at the gate was young Dave Tolliver Well I git down here said the girl and before his mule stopped she slid from behind him and made for the gate without a word of thanks or good by
3783-176659-0050	train-other-500	Howdye said Hale taking in the group with his glance but leaving his eyes on young Dave The rest nodded but the boy was too surprised for speech and the spirit of deviltry took the girl when she saw her brother s face and at the gate she turned Much obleeged she said
3783-176659-0051	train-other-500	Tell June I m a comin over to see her next Sunday I will said Hale and he rode on To his surprise when he had gone a hundred yards he heard the boy spurring after him and he looked around inquiringly as young Dave drew alongside but the boy said nothing and Hale
3783-176659-0052	train-other-500	amused kept still wondering when the lad would open speech At the mouth of another little creek the boy stopped his horse as though he was to turn up that way You ve come back agin he said searching Hale s face with his black eyes Yes said Hale
none	none	 I ve come back again You goin over to Lonesome Cove 
3783-176659-0053	train-other-500	Yes The boy hesitated and a sudden change of mind was plain to Hale in his face
none	none	 I wish you d tell Uncle Judd about the trouble in town to day he said still looking fixedly at Hale 
3783-176659-0054	train-other-500	Certainly Did you tell the Red Fox that day you seed him when you was goin over to the Gap last fall that you seed me at Uncle Judd s No said Hale But how did you know that I saw the Red Fox that day The boy laughed unpleasantly
3783-176659-0055	train-other-500	So long he said See you agin some day The way was steep and the sun was down and darkness gathering before Hale reached the top of the mountain so he hallooed at the yard fence of the Red Fox who peered cautiously out of the door
none	none	 and asked his name before he came to the gate 
3783-176659-0056	train-other-500	And there with a grin on his curious mismatched face he repeated young Dave s words You ve come back agin
none	none	 And Hale repeated his Yes I ve come back again You goin over to Lonesome Cove 
3783-176659-0057	train-other-500	Yes said Hale impatiently I m going over to Lonesome Cove Can I stay here all night Shore said the old man hospitably That s a fine hoss you got thar he added with a chuckle Been swappin
3783-176659-0058	train-other-500	Hale had to laugh as he climbed down from the bony ear flopping beast I left my horse in town he s lame Yes I seed you thar Hale could not resist Yes and I seed you The old man almost turned
3783-176659-0059	train-other-500	Whar Again the temptation was too great Talking to the Falin who started the row This time the Red Fox wheeled sharply and his pale blue eyes filled with suspicion I keeps friends with both sides he said Ain t many folks can do that I reckon not
3783-176659-0060	train-other-500	said Hale calmly but in the pale eyes he still saw suspicion When they entered the cabin a little old woman in black dumb and noiseless was cooking supper The children of the two he learned had scattered and they lived there alone

3783-176659-0062	train-other-500	were drying herbs and roots of all kinds and about the fireplace were bottles of liquids that had been stewed from them The little old woman served and opened her lips not at all Supper was eaten with no further reference to the doings in town that day
3783-176659-0063	train-other-500	and no word was said about their meeting when Hale first went to Lonesome Cove until they were smoking on the porch I heerd you found some mighty fine coal over in Lonesome Cove Yes Young Dave Tolliver thinks you found somethin else thar too chuckled the Red Fox
3783-176659-0064	train-other-500	I did said Hale coolly and the old man chuckled again She s a purty leetle gal shore Who is asked Hale looking calmly at his questioner and the Red Fox lapsed into baffled silence
none	none	 The moon was brilliant and the night was still 
3783-176659-0065	train-other-500	Suddenly the Red Fox cocked his ear like a hound and without a word slipped swiftly within the cabin A moment later Hale heard the galloping of a horse and from out the dark woods loped a horseman with a Winchester across his saddle bow
3783-176659-0066	train-other-500	He pulled in at the gate but before he could shout Hello the Red Fox had stepped from the porch into the moonlight and was going to meet him Hale had never seen a more easy graceful daring figure on horseback
none	none	 and in the bright light he could make out the reckless face of the man who had been the first to flash his pistol in town that day Bad Rufe Tolliver For ten minutes the two talked in whispers Rufe bent forward with one elbow on the withers of his horse but lifting his eyes every now and then to the stranger seated in the porch and then the horseman turned with an oath and galloped into the darkness whence he came while the Red Fox slouched back to the porch and dropped silently into his seat Who was that asked Hale Bad Rufe Tolliver
3738_176682_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve heard 
none	none	of him Most everybody in these mountains has He s the feller that s always causin trouble Him and Joe Falin agreed to go West last fall to end the war Joe was killed out thar and now Rufe claims Joe don t count now an he s got the right to come back

3783-176659-0069	train-other-500	keep peace or mischief with or against anybody with that face of his That was a common type of the bad man that horseman who had galloped away from the gate but this old man with his dual face who preached the Word on Sundays and on other days was a walking arsenal
3783-176659-0070	train-other-500	who dreamed dreams and had visions and slipped through the hills in his mysterious moccasins on errands of mercy or chasing men from vanity personal enmity or for fun and still appeared so sane he was a type that confounded No wonder
none	none	 for these reasons and as a tribute to his infernal shrewdness 
3783-176659-0071	train-other-500	he was known far and wide as the Red Fox of the Mountains
none	none	 But Hale was too tired for further speculation and presently he yawned 
3783-176659-0072	train-other-500	Want to lay down asked the old man quickly I think I do said Hale and they went inside
none	none	 The little old woman had her face to the wall in a bed in one corner and the Red Fox pointed to a bed in the other

3783-176659-0076	train-other-500	Man cannot live by bread alone in these mountains said the Red Fox grimly When Hale lay down he could hear the old man quavering out a hymn or two on the porch outside and when worn out with the day he went to sleep the Red Fox was reading his Bible by the light of a tallow dip
3783-176659-0077	train-other-500	It is fatefully strange when people whose lives tragically intersect look back to their first meetings with one another and Hale never forgot that night in the cabin of the Red Fox For had Bad Rufe Tolliver while he whispered at the gate known the part

none	none	A wood thrush was singing when he stepped out on the porch and its cool notes had the liquid freshness of the morning Breakfast over he concluded to leave the yellow mule with the Red Fox to be taken back to the county town and to walk down the mountain but before he got away the landlord s son turned up with his own horse still lame but well enough to limp along without doing himself harm So leading the black horse Hale started down The sun was rising over still seas of white mist and wave after wave of blue Virginia hills In the shadows below it smote the mists into tatters leaf and bush glittered as though after a heavy rain and down Hale went under a trembling dew drenched world and along a tumbling series of water falls that flashed through tall ferns blossoming laurel and shining leaves of rhododendron Once he heard something move below him and then the crackling of brush sounded far to one side of the road He knew it was a man who would be watching him from a covert and straightway to prove his innocence of any hostile or secret purpose he began to whistle Farther below two men with Winchesters rose from the bushes and asked his name and his business He told both readily Everybody it seemed was prepared for hostilities and though the news of the patched up peace had spread it was plain that the factions were still suspicious and on guard Then the loneliness almost of Lonesome Cove itself set in For miles he saw nothing alive but an occasional bird and heard no sound but of running water or rustling leaf At the mouth of the creek his horse s lameness had grown so much better that he mounted him and rode slowly up the river Within an hour he could see the still crest of the Lonesome Pine At the mouth of a creek a mile farther on was an old gristmill with its water wheel asleep and whittling at the door outside was the old miller Uncle Billy Beams who when he heard the coming of the black horse s feet looked up and showed no surprise at all when he saw Hale I heard you was comin he shouted hailing him cheerily by name Ain t fishin this time No said Hale not this time Well git down and rest a spell June ll be here in a minute an you can ride back with her I reckon you air goin that a way June Shore My but she ll be glad to see ye She s always talkin about ye You told her you was comin back an ever body told her you wasn t but that leetle gal al ays said she KNOWED you was because you SAID you was

3792_176660_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Uncle Billy was bewildered 
none	none	Why June hit s mister Hale why Howdye June said Hale who was no less puzzled and still she gave no sign that she had ever seen him before except reluctantly to give him her hand Then she turned sullenly away and sat down in the door of the mill with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands Dumfounded the old miller pulled the sack of corn from the horse and leaned it against the mill Then he took out his pipe filled and lighted it slowly and turned his perplexed eyes to the sun Well honey he said as though he were doing the best he could with a difficult situation I ll have to git you that meal at the house Bout dinner time now You an mister Hale thar come on and git somethin to eat afore ye go back I got to get on back home said June rising No you ain t I bet you got dinner fer yo step mammy afore you left an I jes know you was aimin to take a snack with me an ole honorable The little girl hesitated she had no denial and the old fellow smiled kindly Come on now Little June walked on the other side of the miller from Hale back to the old man s cabin two hundred yards up the road answering his questions but not Hale s and never meeting the latter s eyes with her own Ole honorable the portly old woman whom Hale remembered with brass rimmed spectacles and a clay pipe in her mouth came out on the porch and welcomed them heartily under the honeysuckle vines Her mouth and face were alive with humour when she saw Hale and her eyes took in both him and the little girl keenly The miller and Hale leaned chairs against the wall while the girl sat at the entrance of the porch Suddenly Hale went out to his horse and took out a package from his saddle pockets I ve got some candy in here for you he said smiling I don t want no candy she said still not looking at him and with a little movement of her knees away from him Why honey said Uncle Billy again whut IS the matter with ye I thought ye was great friends The little girl rose hastily No we ain t nuther she said and she whisked herself indoors Hale put the package back with some embarrassment and the old miller laughed Well well she s a quar little critter mebbe she s mad because you stayed away so long At the table June wanted to help ole honorable and wait to eat with her but Uncle Billy made her sit down with him and Hale and so shy was she that she hardly ate anything Once only did she look up from her plate and that was when Uncle Billy with a shake of his head said He s a bad un He was speaking of Rufe Tolliver and at the mention of his name there was a frightened look in the little girl s eyes when she quickly raised them that made Hale wonder An hour later they were riding side by side Hale and June on through the lights and shadows toward Lonesome Cove

3792_176660_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed she ain t

3792_176660_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Hale watched her while she munched a striped stick of peppermint 
none	none	Her crimson bonnet had fallen from her sunlit hair and straight down from it to her bare little foot with its stubbed toe just darkening with dried blood a sculptor would have loved the rounded slenderness in the curving long lines that shaped her brown throat her arms and her hands which were prettily shaped but so very dirty as to the nails and her dangling bare leg 
3792_176660_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Her teeth were even and white and most of them flashed when her red lips smiled 
none	none	Her lashes were long and gave a touching softness to her eyes even when she was looking quietly at him but there were times as he had noticed already when a brooding look stole over them and then they were the lair for the mysterious loneliness that was the very spirit of Lonesome Cove Some day that little nose would be long enough and some day he thought she would be very beautiful Your cousin Loretta said she was coming over to see you June s teeth snapped viciously through the stick of candy and then she turned on him and behind the long lashes and deep down in the depth of those wonderful eyes he saw an ageless something that bewildered him more than her words
3792_176660_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate her she said fiercely 
none	none	Why little girl he said gently I don t know she said and then the tears came in earnest and she turned her head sobbing Hale helplessly reached over and patted her on the shoulder but she shrank away from him
3792_176660_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Go away she said digging her fist into her eyes until her face was calm again 
3792_176660_000066_000000	train-clean-360	They had reached the spot on the river where he had seen her first and beyond the smoke of the cabin was rising above the undergrowth

none	none	She stopped suddenly and pulled in her horse but Hale had heard nothing Hello shouted a voice from the bushes and Devil Judd Tolliver issued from them with an axe on his shoulder I heerd you d come back an I m glad to see ye He came down to the road and shook Hale s hand heartily Whut you been cryin about he added turning his hawk like eyes on the little girl Nothin she said sullenly Did she git mad with ye bout somethin said the old man to Hale She never cries cept when she s mad Hale laughed You jes hush up both of ye said the girl with a sharp kick of her right foot I reckon you can t stamp the ground that fer away from it said the old man dryly If you don t git the better of that all fired temper o yourn hit s goin to git the better of you an then I ll have to spank you agin I reckon you ain t goin to whoop me no more pap

3792_176660_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 I reckon you can laughed Hale 
none	none	The liquor was as fiery as ever but it was grateful and again the old man took nearly a tumbler full plying Hale meanwhile about the happenings in town the day before but Hale could tell him nothing that he seemed not already to know It was quar the old mountaineer said I ve seed two men with the drap on each other and both afeerd to shoot but I never heerd of sech a ring around the rosy as eight fellers with bead on one another and not a shoot shot I m glad I wasn t thar He frowned when Hale spoke of the Red Fox You can t never tell whether that ole devil is fer ye or agin ye but I ve been plum sick o these doin s a long time now and sometimes I think I ll just pull up stakes and go West and git out of hit altogether How did you learn so much about yesterday so soon Oh we hears things purty quick in these mountains Little Dave Tolliver come over here last night Yes broke in Bub and he tol us how you carried Loretty from town on a mule behind ye and she jest a sassin you an as how she said she was a goin to git you fer HER sweetheart Hale glanced by chance at the little girl Her face was scarlet and a light dawned An sis thar said he was a tellin lies an when she growed up she said she was a goin to marry Something snapped like a toy pistol and Bub howled A little brown hand had whacked him across the mouth and the girl flashed indoors without a word Bub got to his feet howling with pain and rage and started after her but the old man caught him Set down boy

none	none	I ve got something for her Go on baby the old man said and the little girl came shyly down to the gate Hale took a brown paper parcel from his saddle bags unwrapped it and betrayed the usual blue eyed flaxen haired rosy cheeked doll Only June did not know the like of it was in all the world And as she caught it to her breast there were tears once more in her uplifted eyes How about going over to the Gap with me little girl some day He never guessed it but there were a child and a woman before him now and both answered I ll go with ye anywhar Hale stopped a while to rest his horse at the base of the big pine He was practically alone in the world The little girl back there was born for something else than slow death in that God forsaken cove and whatever it was why not help her to it if he could 
3792_176660_000104_000003	train-clean-360	With this thought in his brain he rode down from the luminous upper world of the moon and stars toward the nether world of drifting mists and black ravines 
none	none	She belonged to just such a night that little girl she was a part of its mists its lights and shadows its fresh wild beauty and its mystery Only once did his mind shift from her to his great purpose and that was when the roar of the water through the rocky chasm of the Gap made him think of the roar of iron wheels that rushing through some day would drown it into silence At the mouth of the Gap he saw the white valley lying at peace in the moonlight and straightway from it sprang again as always his castle in the air but before he fell asleep in his cottage on the edge of the millpond that night he heard quite plainly again I ll go with ye anywhar XI Spring was coming and meanwhile that late autumn and short winter things went merrily on at the gap in some ways and in some ways not Within eight miles of the place for instance the man fell ill the man who was to take up Hale s options and he had to be taken home Still Hale was undaunted here he was and here he would stay and he would try again Two other young men Bluegrass Kentuckians Logan and Macfarlan had settled at the gap both lawyers and both of pioneer Indian fighting blood The report of the State geologist had been spread broadcast A famous magazine writer had come through on horseback and had gone home and given a fervid account of the riches and the beauty of the region Helmeted Englishmen began to prowl prospectively around the gap sixty miles to the southwest New surveying parties were directing lines for the rocky gateway between the iron ore and the coal Engineers and coal experts passed in and out There were rumours of a furnace and a steel plant when the railroad should reach the place Capital had flowed in from the East and already a Pennsylvanian was starting a main entry into a ten foot vein of coal up through the gap and was coking it His report was that his own was better than the Connellsville coke which was the standard it was higher in carbon and lower in ash The Ludlow brothers from Eastern Virginia had started a general store Two of the Berkley brothers had come over from Bluegrass Kentucky and their family was coming in the spring The bearded Senator up the valley who was also a preacher had got his Methodist brethren interested and the community was further enriched by the coming of the honorable Samuel Budd lawyer and budding statesman As a recreation the honorable Sam was an anthropologist he knew the mountaineers from Virginia to Alabama and they were his pet illustrations of his pet theories of the effect of a mountain environment on human life and character Hale took a great fancy to him from the first moment he saw his smooth ageless kindly face surmounted by a huge pair of spectacles that were hooked behind two large ears above which his pale yellow hair parted in the middle was drawn back with plaster like precision A mayor and a constable had been appointed and the honorable Sam had just finished his first case Squire Morton and the Widow Crane who ran a boarding house each having laid claim to three pigs that obstructed traffic in the town The honorable Sam was sitting by the stove deep in thought when Hale came into the hotel and he lifted his great glaring lenses and waited for no introduction Brother he said do you know twelve reliable witnesses come on the stand and SWORE them pigs belonged to the squire s sow and twelve equally reliable witnesses SWORE them pigs belonged to the Widow Crane s sow I shorely was a heap perplexed That was curious The honorable Sam laughed Well sir them intelligent pigs used both them sows as mothers and may be they had another mother somewhere else They would breakfast with the Widow Crane s sow and take supper with the squire s sow And so them witnesses too was naturally perplexed Hale waited while the honorable Sam puffed his pipe into a glow Believin as I do that the most important principle in law is mutually forgivin and a square division o spoils I suggested a compromise The widow said the squire was an old rascal an thief and he d never sink a tooth into one of them shoats but that her lawyer was a gentleman meanin me and the squire said the widow had been blackguardin him all over town and he d see her in heaven before she got one but that HIS lawyer was a prince of the realm so the other lawyer took one and I got the other What became of the third The honorable Sam was an ardent disciple of Sir Walter Scott Well just now the mayor is a playin Gurth to that little runt for costs Outside the wheels of the stage rattled and as half a dozen strangers trooped in the honorable Sam waved his hand Things is comin Things were coming The following week the booming editor brought in a printing press and started a paper An enterprising Hoosier soon established a brick plant A geologist Hale s predecessor in Lonesome Cove made the Gap his headquarters and one by one the vanguard of engineers surveyors speculators and coalmen drifted in The wings of progress began to sprout but the new town constable soon tendered his resignation with informality and violence He had arrested a Falin whose companions straightway took him from custody and set him free Straightway the constable threw his pistol and badge of office to the ground I ve fit an I ve hollered fer help he shouted almost crying with rage an I ve fit agin Now this town can go to hell and he picked up his pistol but left his symbol of law and order in the dust Next morning there was a new constable and only that afternoon when Hale stepped into the Ludlow Brothers store he found the constable already busy A line of men with revolver or knife in sight was drawn up inside with their backs to Hale and beyond them he could see the new constable with a man under arrest Hale had not forgotten his promise to himself and he began now Come on he called quietly and when the men turned at the sound of his voice the constable who was of sterner stuff than his predecessor pushed through them dragging his man after him Look here boys said Hale calmly Let s not have any row Let him go to the mayor s office If he isn t guilty the mayor will let him go If he is the mayor will give him bond I ll go on it myself But let s not have a row Now to the mountain eye Hale appeared no more than the ordinary man and even a close observer would have seen no more than that his face was clean cut and thoughtful that his eye was blue and singularly clear and fearless and that he was calm with a calmness that might come from anything else than stolidity of temperament and that by the way is the self control which counts most against the unruly passions of other men but anybody near Hale at a time when excitement was high and a crisis was imminent would have felt the resultant of forces emanating from him that were beyond analysis And so it was now the curious power he instinctively had over rough men had its way Go on he continued quietly and the constable went on with his prisoner his friends following still swearing and with their weapons in their hands When constable and prisoner passed into the mayor s office Hale stepped quickly after them and turned on the threshold with his arm across the door Hold on boys he said still good naturedly The mayor can attend to this If you boys want to fight anybody fight me I m unarmed and you can whip me easily enough he added with a laugh but you mustn t come in here he concluded as though the matter was settled beyond further discussion For one instant the crucial one of course the men hesitated for the reason that so often makes superior numbers of no avail among the lawless the lack of a leader of nerve and without another word Hale held the door But the frightened mayor inside let the prisoner out at once on bond and Hale combining law and diplomacy went on the bond Only a day or two later the mountaineers who worked at the brick plant with pistols buckled around them went on a strike and that night shot out the lights and punctured the chromos in their boarding house Then armed with sticks knives clubs and pistols they took a triumphant march through town That night two knives and two pistols were whipped out by two of them in the same store One of the Ludlows promptly blew out the light and astutely got under the counter When the combatants scrambled outside he locked the door and crawled out the back window Next morning the brick yard malcontents marched triumphantly again and Hale called for volunteers to arrest them To his disgust only Logan Macfarlan the honorable Sam Budd and two or three others seemed willing to go but when the few who would go started Hale leading them looked back and the whole town seemed to be strung out after him Below the hill he saw the mountaineers drawn up in two bodies for battle and as he led his followers towards them the Hoosier owner of the plant rode out at a gallop waving his hands and apparently beside himself with anxiety and terror Don t he shouted somebody ll get killed Wait they ll give up So Hale halted and the Hoosier rode back After a short parley he came back to Hale to say that the strikers would give up but when Logan started again they broke and ran and only three or four were captured The Hoosier was delirious over his troubles and straightway closed his plant See said Hale in disgust We ve got to do something now We have said the lawyers and that night on Hale s porch the three with the honorable Sam Budd pondered the problem They could not build a town without law and order they could not have law and order without taking part themselves and even then they plainly would have their hands full And so that night on the tiny porch of the little cottage that was Hale s sleeping room and office with the creaking of the one wheel of their one industry the old grist mill making patient music through the rhododendron darkness that hid the steep bank of the stream the three pioneers forged their plan There had been gentlemen regulators a plenty vigilance committees of gentlemen and the Ku Klux clan had been originally composed of gentlemen as they all knew but they meant to hew to the strict line of town ordinance and common law and do the rough everyday work of the common policeman So volunteer policemen they would be and in order to extend their authority as much as possible as county policemen they would be enrolled Each man would purchase his own Winchester pistol billy badge and a whistle to call for help and they would begin drilling and target shooting at once The honorable Sam shook his head dubiously The natives won t understand We can t help that said Hale I know I m with you Hale was made captain Logan first lieutenant Macfarlan second and the honorable Sam third Two rules Logan who too knew the mountaineer well suggested as inflexible One was never to draw a pistol at all unless necessary never to pretend to draw as a threat or to intimidate and never to draw unless one meant to shoot if need be And the other added Logan always go in force to make an arrest never alone unless necessary The honorable Sam moved his head up and down in hearty approval Why is that asked Hale To save bloodshed he said These fellows we will have to deal with have a pride that is morbid A mountaineer doesn t like to go home and have to say that one man put him in the calaboose but he doesn t mind telling that it took several to arrest him Moreover he will give in to two or three men when he would look on the coming of one man as a personal issue and to be met as such Hale nodded Oh there ll be plenty of chances Logan added with a smile for everyone to go it alone Again the honorable Sam nodded grimly It was plain to him that they would have all they could do but no one of them dreamed of the far reaching effect that night s work would bring They were the vanguard of civilization crusaders of the nineteenth century against the benighted of the Middle Ages said the honorable Sam and when Logan and Macfarlan left he lingered and lit his pipe The trouble will be he said slowly that they won t understand our purpose or our methods They will look on us as a lot of meddlesome furriners who have come in to run their country as we please when they have been running it as they please for more than a hundred years You see you mustn t judge them by the standards of to day you must go back to the standards of the Revolution Practically they are the pioneers of that day and hardly a bit have they advanced They are our contemporary ancestors And then the honorable Sam having dropped his vernacular lounged ponderously into what he was pleased to call his anthropological drool You see mountains isolate people and the effect of isolation on human life is to crystallize it Those people over the line have had no navigable rivers no lakes no wagon roads except often the beds of streams They have been cut off from all communication with the outside world They are a perfect example of an arrested civilization and they are the closest link we have with the Old World They were Unionists because of the Revolution as they were Americans in the beginning because of the spirit of the Covenanter They live like the pioneers the axe and the rifle are still their weapons and they still have the same fight with nature This feud business is a matter of clan loyalty that goes back to Scotland They argue this way You are my friend or my kinsman your quarrel is my quarrel and whoever hits you hits me If you are in trouble I must not testify against you If you are an officer you must not arrest me you must send me a kindly request to come into court If I m innocent and it s perfectly convenient why maybe I ll come Yes we re the vanguard of civilization all right all right but I opine we re goin to have a hell of a merry time Hale laughed but he was to remember those words of the honorable Samuel Budd Other members of that vanguard began to drift in now by twos and threes from the bluegrass region of Kentucky and from the tide water country of Virginia and from New England strong bold young men with the spirit of the pioneer and the birth breeding and education of gentlemen and the war between civilization and a lawlessness that was the result of isolation and consequent ignorance and idleness started in earnest A remarkable array murmured the honorable Sam when he took an inventory one night with Hale I m proud to be among em Many times Hale went over to Lonesome Cove and with every visit his interest grew steadily in the little girl and in the curious people over there until he actually began to believe in the honorable Sam Budd s anthropological theories In the cabin on Lonesome Cove was a crane swinging in the big stone fireplace and he saw the old step mother and June putting the spinning wheel and the loom to actual use Sometimes he found a cabin of unhewn logs with a puncheon floor clapboards for shingles and wooden pin and auger holes for nails a batten wooden shutter the logs filled with mud and stones and holes in the roof for the wind and the rain Over a pair of buck antlers sometimes lay the long heavy home made rifle of the backwoodsman sometimes even with a flintlock and called by some pet feminine name Once he saw the hominy block that the mountaineers had borrowed from the Indians and once a handmill like the one from which the one woman was taken and the other left in biblical days He struck communities where the medium of exchange was still barter and he found mountaineers drinking metheglin still as well as moonshine Moreover there were still log rollings house warmings corn shuckings and quilting parties and sports were the same as in pioneer days wrestling racing jumping and lifting barrels Often he saw a cradle of beegum and old Judd had in his house a fox horn made of hickory bark which even June could blow He ran across old world superstitions too and met one seventh son of a seventh son who cured children of rash by blowing into their mouths And he got June to singing transatlantic songs after old Judd said one day that she knowed the miserablest song he d ever heerd meaning the most sorrowful And thereupon with quaint simplicity June put her heels on the rung of her chair and with her elbows on her knees and her chin on both bent thumbs sang him the oldest version of Barbara Allen in a voice that startled Hale by its power and sweetness She knew lots more song ballets she said shyly and the old man had her sing some songs that were rather rude but were as innocent as hymns from her lips Everywhere he found unlimited hospitality Take out stranger said one old fellow when there was nothing on the table but some bread and a few potatoes have a tater Take two of em take damn nigh ALL of em Moreover their pride was morbid and they were very religious Indeed they used religion to cloak their deviltry as honestly as it was ever used in history He had heard old Judd say once when he was speaking of the feud Well I ve al ays laid out my enemies The Lord s been on my side an I gits a better Christian every year Always Hale took some children s book for June when he went to Lonesome Cove and she rarely failed to know it almost by heart when he went again She was so intelligent that he began to wonder if in her case at least another of the honorable Sam s theories might not be true that the mountaineers were of the same class as the other westward sweeping emigrants of more than a century before that they had simply lain dormant in the hills and a century counting for nothing in the matter of inheritance that their possibilities were little changed and that the children of that day would if given the chance wipe out the handicap of a century in one generation and take their place abreast with children of the outside world The Tollivers were of good blood they had come from Eastern Virginia and the original Tolliver had been a slave owner The very name was undoubtedly a corruption of Tagliaferro So when the Widow Crane began to build a brick house for her boarders that winter and the foundations of a school house were laid at the Gap Hale began to plead with old Judd to allow June to go over to the Gap and go to school but the old man was firm in refusal He couldn t git along without her he said he was afeerd he d lose her an he reckoned June was a larnin enough without goin to school she was a studyin them leetle books o hers so hard But as his confidence in Hale grew and as Hale stated his intention to take an option on the old man s coal lands he could see that Devil Judd though his answer never varied was considering the question seriously Through the winter then Hale made occasional trips to Lonesome Cove and bided his time Often he met young Dave Tolliver there but the boy usually left when Hale came and if Hale was already there he kept outside the house until the engineer was gone Knowing nothing of the ethics of courtship in the mountains how when two men meet at the same girl s house they makes the gal say which one she likes best and t other one gits Hale little dreamed that the first time Dave stalked out of the room he threw his hat in the grass behind the big chimney and executed a war dance on it cursing the blankety blank furriner within from Dan to Beersheba Indeed he never suspected the fierce depths of the boy s jealousy at all and he would have laughed incredulously if he had been told how time after time as he climbed the mountain homeward the boy s black eyes burned from the bushes on him while his hand twitched at his pistol butt and his lips worked with noiseless threats For Dave had to keep his heart burnings to himself or he would have been laughed at through all the mountains and not only by his own family but by June s so he too bided his time In late February old Buck Falin and old Dave Tolliver shot each other down in the road and the Red Fox who hated both and whom each thought was his friend dressed the wounds of both with equal care The temporary lull of peace that Bad Rufe s absence in the West had brought about gave way to a threatening storm then and then it was that old Judd gave his consent when the roads got better June could go to the Gap to school A month later the old man sent word that he did not want June in the mountains while the trouble was going on and that Hale could come over for her when he pleased and Hale sent word back that within three days he would meet the father and the little girl at the big Pine That last day at home June passed in a dream She went through her daily tasks in a dream and she hardly noticed young Dave when he came in at mid day and Dave when he heard the news left in sullen silence In the afternoon she went down to the mill to tell Uncle Billy and ole honorable good by and the three sat in the porch a long time and with few words Ole honorable had been to the Gap once but there was so much bustle over thar it made her head ache Uncle Billy shook his head doubtfully over June s going and the two old people stood at the gate looking long after the little girl when she went homeward up the road Before supper June slipped up to her little hiding place at the pool and sat on the old log saying good by to the comforting spirit that always brooded for her there and when she stood on the porch at sunset a new spirit was coming on the wings of the South wind Hale felt it as he stepped into the soft night air he heard it in the piping of frogs Marsh birds as he always called them he could almost see it in the flying clouds and the moonlight and even the bare trees seemed tremulously expectant An indefinable happiness seemed to pervade the whole earth and Hale stretched his arms lazily Over in Lonesome Cove little June felt it more keenly than ever in her life before She did not want to go to bed that night and when the others were asleep she slipped out to the porch and sat on the steps her eyes luminous and her face wistful looking towards the big Pine which pointed the way towards the far silence into which she was going at last XII June did not have to be awakened that morning At the first clarion call of the old rooster behind the cabin her eyes opened wide and a happy thrill tingled her from head to foot why she didn t at first quite realize and then she stretched her slender round arms to full length above her head and with a little squeal of joy bounded out of the bed dressed as she was when she went into it and with no changes to make except to push back her tangled hair Her father was out feeding the stock and she could hear her step mother in the kitchen Bub still slept soundly and she shook him by the shoulder Git up Bub Go way said Bub fretfully Again she started to shake him but stopped Bub wasn t going to the Gap so she let him sleep For a little while she looked down at him at his round rosy face and his frowsy hair from under which protruded one dirty fist She was going to leave him and a fresh tenderness for him made her breast heave but she did not kiss him for sisterly kisses are hardly known in the hills Then she went out into the kitchen to help her step mother Gittin mighty busy all of a sudden ain t ye said the sour old woman now that ye air goin away Tain t costin you nothin answered June quietly and she picked up a pail and went out into the frosty shivering daybreak to the old well The chain froze her fingers the cold water splashed her feet and when she had tugged her heavy burden back to the kitchen she held her red chapped hands to the fire I reckon you ll be mighty glad to git shet o me The old woman sniffled and June looked around with a start Pears like I m goin to miss ye right smart she quavered and June s face coloured with a new feeling towards her step mother I m goin ter have a hard time doin all the work and me so poorly Lorrety is a comin over to he p ye if ye git sick said June hardening again Or I ll come back myself She got out the dishes and set them on the table You an me don t git along very well together she went on placidly I never heerd o no step mother and children as did an I reckon you ll be might glad to git shet o me Pears like I m going to miss ye a right smart repeated the old woman weakly June went out to the stable with the milking pail Her father had spread fodder for the cow and she could hear the rasping of the ears of corn against each other as he tumbled them into the trough for the old sorrel She put her head against the cow s soft flank and under her sinewy fingers two streams of milk struck the bottom of the tin pail with such thumping loudness that she did not hear her father s step but when she rose to make the beast put back her right leg she saw him looking at her Who s goin ter milk pap atter I m gone This the fust time you thought o that June put her flushed cheek back to the flank of the cow It was not the first time she had thought of that her step mother would milk and if she were ill her father or Loretta She had not meant to ask that question she was wondering when they would start That was what she meant to ask and she was glad that she had swerved Breakfast was eaten in the usual silence by the boy and the man June and the step mother serving it and waiting on the lord that was and the lord that was to be and then the two females sat down Hurry up June said the old man wiping his mouth and beard with the back of his hand Clear away the dishes an git ready Hale said he would meet us at the Pine an hour by sun fer I told him I had to git back to work Hurry up now June hurried up She was too excited to eat anything so she began to wash the dishes while her step mother ate Then she went into the living room to pack her things and it didn t take long She wrapped the doll Hale had given her in an extra petticoat wound one pair of yarn stockings around a pair of coarse shoes tied them up into one bundle and she was ready Her father appeared with the sorrel horse caught up his saddle from the porch threw it on and stretched the blanket behind it as a pillion for June to ride on Let s go he said There is little or no demonstrativeness in the domestic relations of mountaineers The kiss of courtship is the only one known There were no good bys only that short Let s go June sprang behind her father from the porch The step mother handed her the bundle which she clutched in her lap and they simply rode away the step mother and Bub silently gazing after them But June saw the boy s mouth working and when she turned the thicket at the creek she looked back at the two quiet figures and a keen pain cut her heart She shut her mouth closely gripped her bundle more tightly and the tears streamed down her face but the man did not know They climbed in silence Sometimes her father dismounted where the path was steep but June sat on the horse to hold the bundle and thus they mounted through the mist and chill of the morning A shout greeted them from the top of the little spur whence the big Pine was visible and up there they found Hale waiting He had reached the Pine earlier than they and was coming down to meet them Hello little girl called Hale cheerily you didn t fail me did you June shook her head and smiled Her face was blue and her little legs dangling under the bundle were shrinking from the cold Her bonnet had fallen to the back of her neck and he saw that her hair was parted and gathered in a Psyche knot at the back of her head giving her a quaint old look when she stood on the ground in her crimson gown Hale had not forgotten a pillion and there the transfer was made Hale lifted her behind his saddle and handed up her bundle I ll take good care of her he said All right said the old man And I m coming over soon to fix up that coal matter and I ll let you know how she s getting on All right Good by said Hale I wish ye well said the mountaineer Be a good girl Juny and do what mister Hale thar tells ye All right pap And thus they parted June felt the power of Hale s big black horse with exultation the moment he started Now we re off said Hale gayly and he patted the little hand that was about his waist Give me that bundle I can carry it No you can t not with me and when he reached around for it and put it on the cantle of his saddle June thrust her left hand into his overcoat pocket and Hale laughed Loretta wouldn t ride with me this way Loretty ain t got much sense drawled June complacently Tain t no harm But don t you tell me I don t want to hear nothin bout Loretty noway Again Hale laughed and June laughed too Imp that she was she was just pretending to be jealous now She could see the big Pine over his shoulder I ve knowed that tree since I was a little girl since I was a baby she said and the tone of her voice was new to Hale Sister Sally uster tell me lots about that ole tree Hale waited but she stopped again What did she tell you She used to say hit was curious that hit should be way up here all alone that she reckollected it ever since SHE was a baby and she used to come up here and talk to it and she said sometimes she could hear it jus a whisperin to her when she was down home in the cove What did she say it said She said it was always a whisperin come come come June crooned the words an atter she died I heerd the folks sayin as how she riz up in bed with her eyes right wide an sayin I hears it It s a whisperin I hears it come come come And still Hale kept quiet when she stopped again The Red Fox said hit was the sperits but I knowed when they told me that she was a thinkin o that ole tree thar But I never let on I reckon that s ONE reason made me come here that day They were close to the big tree now and Hale dismounted to fix his girth for the descent Well I m mighty glad you came little girl I might never have seen you That s so said June I saw the print of your foot in the mud right there Did ye And if I hadn t I might never have gone down into Lonesome Cove June laughed You ran from me Hale went on Yes I did an that s why you follered me Hale looked up quickly Her face was demure but her eyes danced She was an aged little thing Why did you run I thought yo fishin pole was a rifle gun an that you was a raider Hale laughed I see Member when you let yo horse drink Hale nodded Well I was on a rock above the creek lookin down at ye An I seed ye catchin minners an thought you was goin up the crick lookin fer a still Weren t you afraid of me then Huh she said contemptuously I wasn t afeared of you at all cept fer what you mought find out You couldn t do no harm to nobody without a gun and I knowed thar wasn t no still up that crick I know I knowed whar it was Hale noticed the quick change of tense Won t you take me to see it some time No she said shortly and Hale knew he had made a mistake It was too steep for both to ride now so he tied the bundle to the cantle with leathern strings and started leading the horse June pointed to the edge of the cliff I was a layin flat right thar and I seed you comin down thar My but you looked funny to me You don t now she added hastily You look mighty nice to me now You re a little rascal said Hale that s what you are The little girl bubbled with laughter and then she grew mock serious No I ain t Yes you are he repeated shaking his head and both were silent for a while June was going to begin her education now and it was just as well for him to begin with it now So he started vaguely when he was mounted again June you thought my clothes were funny when you first saw them didn t you Uh huh said June But you like them now Uh huh she crooned again Well some people who weren t used to clothes that people wear over in the mountains might think THEM funny for the same reason mightn t they June was silent for a moment Well mebbe I like your clothes better because I like you better she said and Hale laughed Well it s just the same the way people in the mountains dress and talk is different from the way people outside dress and talk It doesn t make much difference about clothes though I guess you will want to be as much like people over here as you can I don t know interrupted the little girl shortly I ain t seed em yit Well laughed Hale you will want to talk like them anyhow because everybody who is learning tries to talk the same way June was silent and Hale plunged unconsciously on Up at the Pine now you said I SEED you when I was A LAYIN on the edge of the cliff now you ought to have said I SAW you when I was LYING I wasn t she said sharply I don t tell lies her hand shot from his waist and she slid suddenly to the ground He pulled in his horse and turned a bewildered face She had lighted on her feet and was poised back above him like an enraged eaglet her thin nostrils quivering her mouth as tight as a bow string and her eyes two points of fire Why June Ef you don t like my clothes an the way I talk I reckon I d better go back home With a groan Hale tumbled from his horse Fool that he was he had forgotten the sensitive pride of the mountaineer even while he was thinking of that pride He knew that fun might be made of her speech and her garb by her schoolmates over at the Gap and he was trying to prepare her to save her mortification to make her understand Why June little girl I didn t mean to hurt your feelings You don t understand you can t now but you will Trust me won t you I like you just as you are I LOVE the way you talk But other people forgive me won t you he pleaded I m sorry I wouldn t hurt you for the world She didn t understand she hardly heard what he said but she did know his distress was genuine and his sorrow and his voice melted her fierce little heart The tears began to come while she looked and when he put his arms about her she put her face on his breast and sobbed There now he said soothingly It s all right now I m so sorry so very sorry and he patted her on the shoulder and laid his hand across her temple and hair and pressed her head tight to his breast Almost as suddenly she stopped sobbing and loosening herself turned away from him I m a fool that s what I am she said hotly No you aren t Come on little girl We re friends again aren t we June was digging at her eyes with both hands Aren t we Yes she said with an angry little catch of her breath and she turned submissively to let him lift her to her seat Then she looked down into his face Jack she said and he started again at the frank address I ain t NEVER GOIN TO DO THAT NO MORE Yes you are little girl he said soberly but cheerily You re goin to do it whenever I m wrong or whenever you think I m wrong She shook her head seriously No Jack In a few minutes they were at the foot of the mountain and on a level road Hold tight Hale shouted I m going to let him out now At the touch of his spur the big black horse sprang into a gallop faster and faster until he was pounding the hard road in a swift run like thunder At the creek Hale pulled in and looked around June s bonnet was down her hair was tossed her eyes were sparkling fearlessly and her face was flushed with joy Like it June I never did know nothing like it You weren t scared Skeered o what she asked and Hale wondered if there was anything of which she would be afraid They were entering the Gap now and June s eyes got big with wonder over the mighty up shooting peaks and the rushing torrent See that big rock yonder June June craned her neck to follow with her eyes his outstretched finger Uh huh Well that s called Bee Rock because it s covered with flowers purple rhododendrons and laurel and bears used to go there for wild honey They say that once on a time folks around here put whiskey in the honey and the bears got so drunk that people came and knocked em in the head with clubs Well what do you think o that said June wonderingly Before them a big mountain loomed and a few minutes later at the mouth of the Gap Hale stopped and turned his horse sidewise There we are June he said June saw the lovely little valley rimmed with big mountains She could follow the course of the two rivers that encircled it by the trees that fringed their banks and she saw smoke rising here and there and that was all She was a little disappointed It s mighty purty she said I never seed she paused but went on without correcting herself so much level land in all my life The morning mail had just come in as they rode by the post office and several men hailed her escort and all stared with some wonder at her Hale smiled to himself drew up for none and put on a face of utter unconsciousness that he was doing anything unusual June felt vaguely uncomfortable Ahead of them when they turned the corner of the street her eyes fell on a strange tall red house with yellow trimmings that was not built of wood and had two sets of windows one above the other and before that Hale drew up Here we are Get down little girl Good morning said a voice Hale looked around and flushed and June looked around and stared transfixed as by a vision from another world at the dainty figure behind them in a walking suit a short skirt that showed two little feet in laced tan boots and a cap with a plume under which was a pair of wide blue eyes with long lashes and a mouth that suggested active mischief and gentle mockery Oh good morning said Hale and he added gently Get down June The little girl slipped to the ground and began pulling her bonnet on with both hands but the newcomer had caught sight of the Psyche knot that made June look like a little old woman strangely young and the mockery at her lips was gently accentuated by a smile Hale swung from his saddle This is the little girl I told you about Miss Anne he said She s come over to go to school Instantly almost Miss Anne had been melted by the forlorn looking little creature who stood before her shy for the moment and dumb and she came forward with her gloved hand outstretched But June had seen that smile She gave her hand and Miss Anne straightway was no little surprised there was no more shyness in the dark eyes that blazed from the recesses of the sun bonnet and Miss Anne was so startled when she looked into them that all she could say was Dear me A portly woman with a kind face appeared at the door of the red brick house and came to the gate Here she is missus Crane called Hale Howdye June said the Widow Crane kindly Come right in In her June knew straightway she had a friend and she picked up her bundle and followed upstairs the first real stairs she had ever seen and into a room on the floor of which was a rag carpet There was a bed in one corner with a white counterpane and a washstand with a bowl and pitcher which too she had never seen before Make yourself at home right now said the Widow Crane pulling open a drawer under a big looking glass and put your things here That s your bed and out she went How clean it was There were some flowers in a glass vase on the mantel There were white curtains at the big window and a bed to herself her own bed She went over to the window There was a steep bank lined with rhododendrons right under it There was a mill dam below and down the stream she could hear the creaking of a water wheel and she could see it dripping and shining in the sun a gristmill She thought of Uncle Billy and ole honorable and in spite of a little pang of home sickness she felt no loneliness at all I KNEW she would be pretty said Miss Anne at the gate outside I TOLD you she was pretty said Hale But not so pretty as THAT said Miss Anne We will be great friends I hope so for her sake said Hale Hale waited till noon recess was nearly over and then he went to take June to the school house He was told that she was in her room and he went up and knocked at the door There was no answer for one does not knock on doors for entrance in the mountains and thinking he had made a mistake he was about to try another room when June opened the door to see what the matter was She gave him a glad smile Come on he said and when she went for her bonnet he stepped into the room How do you like it June nodded toward the window and Hale went to it That s Uncle Billy s mill out thar Why so it is said Hale smiling That s fine The school house to June s wonder had shingles on the OUTSIDE around all the walls from roof to foundation and a big bell hung on top of it under a little shingled roof of its own A pale little man with spectacles and pale blue eyes met them at the door and he gave June a pale slender hand and cleared his throat before he spoke to her She s never been to school said Hale she can read and spell but she s not very strong on arithmetic Very well I ll turn her over to the primary The school bell sounded Hale left with a parting prophecy You ll be proud of her some day at which June blushed and then with a beating heart she followed the little man into his office A few minutes later the assistant came in and she was none other than the wonderful young woman whom Hale had called Miss Anne There were a few instructions in a halting voice and with much clearing of the throat from the pale little man and a moment later June walked the gauntlet of the eyes of her schoolmates every one of whom looked up from his book or hers to watch her as she went to her seat Miss Anne pointed out the arithmetic lesson and without lifting her eyes June bent with a flushed face to her task It reddened with shame when she was called to the class for she sat on the bench taller by a head and more than any of the boys and girls thereon except one awkward youth who caught her eye and grinned with unashamed companionship The teacher noticed her look and understood with a sudden keen sympathy and naturally she was struck by the fact that the new pupil was the only one who never missed an answer She won t be there long Miss Anne thought and she gave June a smile for which the little girl was almost grateful June spoke to no one but walked through her schoolmates homeward when school was over like a haughty young queen Miss Anne had gone ahead and was standing at the gate talking with missus Crane and the young woman spoke to June most kindly mister Hale has been called away on business she said and June s heart sank and I m going to take care of you until he comes back I m much obleeged she said and while she was not ungracious her manner indicated her belief that she could take care of herself And Miss Anne felt uncomfortably that this extraordinary young person was steadily measuring her from head to foot June saw the smart close fitting gown the dainty little boots and the carefully brushed hair She noticed how white her teeth were and her hands and she saw that the nails looked polished and that the tips of them were like little white crescents and she could still see every detail when she sat at her window looting down at the old mill She SAW mister Hale when he left the young lady had said and she had a headache now and was going home to LIE down She understood now what Hale meant on the mountainside when she was so angry with him She was learning fast and most from the two persons who were not conscious what they were teaching her And she would learn in the school too for the slumbering ambition in her suddenly became passionately definite now She went to the mirror and looked at her hair she would learn how to plait that in two braids down her back as the other school girls did She looked at her hands and straightway she fell to scrubbing them with soap as she had never scrubbed them before As she worked she heard her name called and she opened the door Yes mam she answered for already she had picked that up in the school room Come on June and go down the street with me Yes mam she repeated and she wiped her hands and hurried down missus Crane had looked through the girl s pathetic wardrobe while she was at school that afternoon had told Hale before he left and she had a surprise for little June Together they went down the street and into the chief store in town and to June s amazement missus Crane began ordering things for this little girl Who s a goin to pay fer all these things whispered June aghast Don t you bother honey mister Hale said he would fix all that with your pappy It s some coal deal or something don t you bother And June in a quiver of happiness didn t bother Stockings petticoats some soft stuff for a new dress and TAN shoes that looked like the ones that wonderful young woman wore and then some long white things What s them fer she whispered but the clerk heard her and laughed whereat missus Crane gave him such a glance that he retired quickly Night gowns honey You SLEEP in em said June in an awed voice That s just what you do said the good old woman hardly less pleased than June My but you ve got pretty feet I wish they were half as purty as Well they are interrupted missus Crane a little snappishly apparently she did not like Miss Anne Wrap em up and mister Hale will attend to the bill All right said the clerk looking much mystified Outside the door June looked up into the beaming goggles of the honorable Samuel Budd Is THIS the little girl Howdye June he said and June put her hand in the honorable Sam s with a sudden trust in his voice I m going to help take care of you too said mister Budd and June smiled at him with shy gratitude How kind everybody was I m much obleeged she said and she and missus Crane went on back with their bundles June s hands so trembled when she found herself alone with her treasures that she could hardly unpack them When she had folded and laid them away she had to unfold them to look at them again She hurried to bed that night merely that she might put on one of those wonderful night gowns and again she had to look all her treasures over She was glad that she had brought the doll because HE had given it to her but she said to herself I m a gittin too big now fer dolls and she put it away Then she set the lamp on the mantel piece so that she could see herself in her wonderful night gown She let her shining hair fall like molten gold around her shoulders and she wondered whether she could ever look like the dainty creature that just now was the model she so passionately wanted to be like Then she blew out the lamp and sat a while by the window looking down through the rhododendrons at the shining water and at the old water wheel sleepily at rest in the moonlight She knelt down then at her bedside to say her prayers as her dead sister had taught her to do and she asked God to bless Jack wondering as she prayed that she had heard nobody else call him Jack and then she lay down with her breast heaving She had told him she would never do that again but she couldn t help it now the tears came and from happiness she cried herself softly to sleep XIII Hale rode that night under a brilliant moon to the worm of a railroad that had been creeping for many years toward the Gap The head of it was just protruding from the Natural Tunnel twenty miles away There he sent his horse back slept in a shanty till morning 
3843-176663-0000	train-other-500	and then the train crawled through a towering bench of rock The mouth of it on the other side opened into a mighty amphitheatre with solid rock walls shooting vertically hundreds of feet upward
3843-176663-0001	train-other-500	Vertically he thought with the back of his head between his shoulders as he looked up they were more than vertical they were actually concave The Almighty had not only stored riches immeasurable in the hills behind him
3843-176663-0002	train-other-500	He had driven this passage Himself to help puny man to reach them and yet the wretched road was going toward them like a snail On the fifth night thereafter he was back there at the tunnel again from New York
3843-176663-0003	train-other-500	with a grim mouth and a happy eye He had brought success with him this time and there was no sleep for him that night He had been delayed by a wreck
none	none	 it was two o clock in the morning 
3843-176663-0004	train-other-500	and not a horse was available so he started those twenty miles afoot and day was breaking when he looked down on the little valley shrouded in mist and just wakening from sleep Things had been moving while he was away as he quickly learned
3843-176663-0005	train-other-500	The English were buying lands right and left at the gap sixty miles southwest Two companies had purchased most of the town site where he was HIS town site and were going to pool their holdings and form an improvement company
3843-176663-0006	train-other-500	But a good deal was left and straightway Hale got a map from his office and with it in his hand walked down the curve of the river and over Poplar Hill and beyond Early breakfast was ready when he got back to the hotel
3843-176663-0007	train-other-500	He swallowed a cup of coffee so hastily that it burned him and June when she passed his window on her way to school saw him busy over his desk She started to shout to him but he looked so haggard and grim that she was afraid
none	none	 and went on vaguely hurt by a preoccupation that seemed quite to have excluded her For two hours then Hale haggled and bargained and at ten o clock he went to the telegraph office 
3843-176663-0008	train-other-500	The operator who was speculating in a small way himself smiled when he read the telegram A thousand an acre he repeated with a whistle
none	none	 You could have got that at twenty five per three months ago 
3843-176663-0009	train-other-500	I know said Hale there s time enough yet Then he went to his room pulled the blinds down and went to sleep while rumour played with his name through the town
3843-176663-0010	train-other-500	It was nearly the closing hour of school when dressed and freshly shaven he stepped out into the pale afternoon and walked up toward the schoolhouse
none	none	 The children were pouring out of the doors 
3843-176663-0011	train-other-500	At the gate there was a sudden commotion he saw a crimson figure flash into the group that had stopped there and flash out and then June came swiftly toward him followed closely by a tall boy with a cap on his head
3843-176663-0012	train-other-500	That far away he could see that she was angry and he hurried toward her Her face was white with rage her mouth was tight and her dark eyes were aflame Then from the group another tall boy darted out
3843-176663-0013	train-other-500	and behind him ran a smaller one bellowing Hale heard the boy with the cap call kindly Hold on little girl I won t let em touch you June stopped with him and Hale ran to them Here he called what s the matter
3843-176663-0014	train-other-500	June burst into crying when she saw him and leaned over the fence sobbing The tall lad with the cap had his back to Hale and he waited till the other two boys came up
3843-176663-0015	train-other-500	Then he pointed to the smaller one and spoke to Hale without looking around Why that little skate there was teasing this little girl and She slapped him said Hale grimly The lad with the cap turned
3843-176663-0016	train-other-500	His eyes were dancing and the shock of curly hair that stuck from his absurd little cap shook with his laughter Slapped him She knocked him as flat as a pancake Yes an you said you d stand fer her
none	none	 said the other tall boy who was plainly a mountain lad 
3843-176663-0017	train-other-500	He was near bursting with rage You bet I will said the boy with the cap heartily right now and he dropped his books to the ground Hold on said Hale jumping between them
3843-176663-0018	train-other-500	You ought to be ashamed of yourself he said to the mountain boy I wasn t atter the gal he said indignantly I was comin fer him The boy with the cap tried to get away from Hale s grasp
3843-176663-0019	train-other-500	No use sir he said coolly You d better let us settle it now We ll have to do it some time I know the breed He ll fight all right and there s no use puttin it off It s got to come You bet it s got to come said the mountain lad You can t call my brother names
3843-176663-0020	train-other-500	Well he IS a skate said the boy with the cap with no heat at all in spite of his indignation and Hale wondered at his aged calm Every one of you little tads he went on coolly waving his hand at the gathered group
3843-176663-0021	train-other-500	is a skate who teases this little girl And you older boys are skates for letting the little ones do it the whole pack of you and I m going to spank any little tadpole who does it hereafter and I m going to punch the head off any big one who allows it It s got to stop NOW
none	none	 And as Hale dragged him off he added to the mountain boy and I m going to begin with you whenever you say the word Hale was laughing now You don t seem to understand he said this is my affair I beg your pardon sir I don t understand 
3843-176663-0022	train-other-500	Why I m taking care of this little girl Oh well you see I didn t know that I ve only been here two days But his frank generous face broke into a winning smile
none	none	 you don t go to school 
3843-176663-0023	train-other-500	You ll let me watch out for her there Sure I ll be very grateful Not at all sir not at all It was a great pleasure and I think I ll have lots of fun He looked at June
none	none	 whose grateful eyes had hardly left his face 
3843-176663-0024	train-other-500	So don t you soil your little fist any more with any of em but just tell me er er June she said and a shy smile came through her tears June he finished with a boyish laugh
3843-176663-0025	train-other-500	Good by sir You haven t told me your name I suppose you know my brothers sir the Berkleys I should say so and Hale held out his hand You re Bob Yes sir I knew you were coming
3843-176663-0026	train-other-500	and I m mighty glad to see you I hope you and June will be good friends and I ll be very glad to have you watch over her when I m away I d like nothing better sir he said cheerfully and quite impersonally as far as June was concerned
3843-176663-0027	train-other-500	Then his eyes lighted up My brothers don t seem to want me to join the Police Guard Won t you say a word for me I certainly will Thank you sir That sir no longer bothered Hale
none	none	 At first he had thought it a mark of respect to his superior age 
3843-176663-0028	train-other-500	and he was not particularly pleased but when he knew now that the lad was another son of the old gentleman whom he saw riding up the valley every morning on a gray horse with several dogs trailing after him
3843-176663-0029	train-other-500	he knew the word was merely a family characteristic of old fashioned courtesy Isn t he nice June Yes she said Have you missed me June June slid her hand into his I m so glad you come back
3843-176663-0030	train-other-500	They were approaching the gate now June you said you weren t going to cry any more June s head drooped I know but I jes can t help it when I git mad she said seriously
3843-176663-0031	train-other-500	I d bust if I didn t All right said Hale kindly I ve cried twice she said What were you mad about the other time I wasn t mad Then why did you cry June
none	none	 Her dark eyes looked full at him a moment 
3843-176663-0032	train-other-500	and then her long lashes hid them Cause you was so good to me Hale choked suddenly and patted her on the shoulder Go in now little girl and study Then you must take a walk I ve got some work to do I ll see you at supper time
3738_176682_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Hale choked 
none	none	suddenly and patted her on the shoulder Go in now little girl and study Then you must take a walk I ve got some work to do I ll see you at supper time 
3843-176663-0033	train-other-500	All right said June She turned at the gate to watch Hale enter the hotel and as she started indoors she heard a horse coming at a gallop and she turned again to see her cousin Dave Tolliver pull up in front of the house
3843-176663-0034	train-other-500	She ran back to the gate and then she saw that he was swaying in his saddle Hello June he called thickly Her face grew hard and she made no answer I ve come over to take ye back home
none	none	 She only stared at him rebukingly and he straightened in his saddle with an effort at self control but his eyes got darker and he looked ugly D you hear me 
3843-176663-0035	train-other-500	I ve come over to take ye home You oughter be ashamed o yourself she said hotly and she turned to go back into the house Oh you ain t ready now Well git ready an we ll start in the mornin I ll be aroun fer ye
3843-176663-0036	train-other-500	bout the break o day He whirled his horse with an oath June was gone
none	none	 She saw him ride swaying down the street 
3843-176663-0037	train-other-500	and she ran across to the hotel and found Hale sitting in the office with another man Hale saw her entering the door swiftly he knew something was wrong and he rose to meet her
none	none	 Dave s here she whispered hurriedly an he says he s come to take me home 
3843-176663-0038	train-other-500	Well said Hale he won t do it will he June shook her head and then she said significantly Dave s drinkin Hale s brow clouded
none	none	 Straightway he foresaw trouble 
3843-176663-0039	train-other-500	but he said cheerily All right You go back and keep in the house and I ll be over by and by and we ll talk it over And without another word she went She had meant to put on her new dress and her new shoes and stockings that night
3843-176663-0040	train-other-500	that Hale might see her but she was in doubt about doing it when she got to her room
none	none	 She tried to study her lessons for the next day but she couldn t fix her mind on them 
3843-176663-0041	train-other-500	She wondered if Dave might not get into a fight or perhaps he would get so drunk that he would go to sleep somewhere she knew that men did that after drinking very much and anyhow he would not bother her until next morning
3843-176663-0042	train-other-500	and then he would be sober and would go quietly back home She was so comforted that she got to thinking about the hair of the girl who sat in front of her at school It was plaited and she had studied just how it was done
3843-176663-0043	train-other-500	and she began to wonder whether she could fix her own that way So she got in front of the mirror and loosened hers in a mass about her shoulders the mass that was to Hale like the golden bronze of a wild turkey s wing The other girl s plaits were the same size
none	none	 so that the hair had to be equally divided 
3843-176663-0044	train-other-500	thus she argued to herself but how did that girl manage to plait it behind her back She did it in front of course so June divided the bronze heap behind her and pulled one half of it in front of her and then for a moment she was helpless
3843-176663-0045	train-other-500	Then she laughed it must be done like the grass blades and strings she had plaited for Bub of course so dividing that half into three parts she did the plaiting swiftly and easily When it was finished she looked at the braid much pleased
3843-176663-0046	train-other-500	for it hung below her waist and was much longer than any of the other girls at school The transition was easy now so interested had she become She got out her tan shoes and stockings and the pretty white dress and put them on The millpond
3843-176663-0047	train-other-500	was dark with shadows now and she went down the stairs and out to the gate just as Dave again pulled up in front of it He stared at the vision wonderingly and long and then he began to laugh with the scorn of soberness and the silliness of drink
none	none	 YOU ain t June air ye The girl never moved As if by a preconcerted signal three men moved toward the boy and one of them said sternly Drop that pistol You are under arrest The boy glared like a wild thing trapped from one to another of the three 
3843-176663-0048	train-other-500	a pistol gleamed in the hand of each and slowly thrust his own weapon into his pocket Get off that horse added the stern voice Just then Hale rushed across the street and the mountain youth saw him
3843-176663-0049	train-other-500	Ketch his pistol cried June in terror for Hale for she knew what was coming
none	none	 and one of the men caught with both hands the wrist of Dave s arm as it shot behind him Take him to the calaboose At that June opened the gate that disgrace she could never stand but Hale spoke I know him boys He doesn t mean any harm He doesn t know the regulations yet 
3843-176663-0050	train-other-500	Suppose we let him go home All right said Logan The calaboose or home Will you go home
none	none	 In the moment the mountain boy had apparently forgotten his captors 
3843-176663-0051	train-other-500	he was staring at June with wonder amazement incredulity struggling through the fumes in his brain to his flushed face She a Tolliver had warned a stranger against her own blood cousin
none	none	 Will you go home repeated Logan sternly The boy looked around at the words as though he were half dazed and his baffled face turned sick and white Lemme loose he said sullenly I ll go home And he rode silently away after giving Hale a vindictive look 
3843-176663-0052	train-other-500	that told him plainer than words that more was yet to come Hale had heard June s warning cry but now when he looked for her she was gone He went in to supper and sat down at the table and still she did not come
3843-176663-0053	train-other-500	She s got a surprise for you said missus Crane smiling mysteriously She s been fixing for you for an hour My but she s pretty in them new clothes why June June was coming in
3843-176663-0054	train-other-500	she wore her homespun her scarlet homespun and the Psyche knot She did not seem to have heard missus Crane s note of wonder and she sat quietly down in her seat Her face was pale and she did not look at Hale
none	none	 Nothing was said of Dave in fact June said nothing at all and Hale too vaguely understanding kept quiet Only when he went out Hale called her to the gate and put one hand on her head 
3843-176663-0055	train-other-500	I m sorry little girl The girl lifted her great troubled eyes to him but no word passed her lips and Hale helplessly left her June did not cry that night She sat by the window wretched and tearless
none	none	 She had taken sides with furriners against her own people 
3843-176663-0056	train-other-500	That was why instinctively she had put on her old homespun with a vague purpose of reparation to them She knew the story Dave would take back home the bitter anger that his people and hers
3843-176663-0057	train-other-500	would feel at the outrage done him anger against the town the Guard against Hale because he was a part of both and even against her Dave was merely drunk he had simply shot off his pistol that was no harm in the hills
3843-176663-0058	train-other-500	And yet everybody had dashed toward him as though he had stolen something even Hale Yes even that boy with the cap who had stood up for her at school that afternoon he had rushed up his face aflame with excitement
3843-176663-0059	train-other-500	eager to take part should Dave resist She had cried out impulsively to save Hale but Dave would not understand No in his eyes she had been false to family and friends to the clan she had sided with furriners
3843-176663-0060	train-other-500	What would her father say Perhaps she d better go home next day perhaps for good for there was a deep unrest within her that she could not fathom
none	none	 a premonition that she was at the parting of the ways a vague fear of the shadows that hung about the strange new path 
3843-176663-0061	train-other-500	on which her feet were set The old mill creaked in the moonlight below her Sometimes when the wind blew up Lonesome Cove she could hear Uncle Billy s wheel creaking just that way
3843-176663-0062	train-other-500	A sudden pang of homesickness choked her but she did not cry Yes she would go home next day She blew out the light and undressed in the dark as she did at home and went to bed
3843-176663-0063	train-other-500	And that night the little night gown lay apart from her in the drawer unfolded
none	none	 and untouched XIV But June did not go home Hale anticipated that resolution of hers and forestalled it by being on hand for breakfast and taking June over to the porch of his little office There he tried to explain to her that they were trying to build a town and must have law and order that they must have no personal feeling for or against anybody and must treat everybody exactly alike no other course was fair and though June could not quite understand she trusted him and she said she would keep on at school until her father came for her Do you think he will come June The little girl hesitated I m afeerd he will she said and Hale smiled Well I ll try to persuade him to let you stay if he does come June was quite right She had seen the matter the night before just as it was For just at that hour young Dave sobered but still on the verge of tears from anger and humiliation was telling the story of the day in her father s cabin The old man s brows drew together and his eyes grew fierce and sullen both at the insult to a Tolliver and at the thought of a certain moonshine still up a ravine not far away and the indirect danger to it in any finicky growth of law and order Still he had a keen sense of justice and he knew that Dave had not told all the story and from him Dave to his wonder got scant comfort for another reason as well with a deal pending for the sale of his lands the shrewd old man would not risk giving offence to Hale not until that matter was settled anyway And so June was safer from interference just then than she knew But Dave carried the story far and wide and it spread as a story can only in the hills So that the two people most talked about among the Tollivers and through Loretta among the Falins as well were June and Hale and at the Gap similar talk would come Already Hale s name was on every tongue in the town and there because of his recent purchases of town site land he was already aside from his personal influence a man of mysterious power Meanwhile the prescient shadow of the coming boom had stolen over the hills and the work of the Guard had grown rapidly Every Saturday there had been local lawlessness to deal with The spirit of personal liberty that characterized the spot was traditional Here for half a century the people of Wise County and of Lee whose border was but a few miles down the river came to get their wool carded their grist ground and farming utensils mended Here too elections were held viva voce under the beeches at the foot of the wooded spur now known as Imboden Hill Here were the muster days of wartime Here on Saturdays the people had come together during half a century for sport and horse trading and to talk politics Here they drank apple jack and hard cider chaffed and quarrelled and fought fist and skull Here the bullies of the two counties would come together to decide who was the best man Here was naturally engendered the hostility between the hill dwellers of Wise and the valley people of Lee and here was fought a famous battle between a famous bully of Wise and a famous bully of Lee On election days the country people would bring in gingercakes made of cane molasses bread homemade of Burr flour and moonshine and apple jack which the candidates would buy and distribute through the crowd And always during the afternoon there were men who would try to prove themselves the best Democrats in the State of Virginia by resort to tooth fist and eye gouging thumb Then to these elections sometimes would come the Kentuckians from over the border to stir up the hostility between state and state which makes that border bristle with enmity to this day For half a century then all wild oats from elsewhere usually sprouted at the Gap And thus the Gap had been the shrine of personal freedom the place where any one individual had the right to do his pleasure with bottle and cards and politics and any other the right to prove him wrong if he were strong enough Very soon as the honorable Sam Budd predicted they had the hostility of Lee concentrated on them as siding with the county of Wise and they would gain in addition now the general hostility of the Kentuckians because as a crowd of meddlesome furriners they would be siding with the Virginians in the general enmity already alive Moreover now that the feud threatened activity over in Kentucky more trouble must come too from that source as the talk that came through the Gap after young Dave Tolliver s arrest plainly indicated Town ordinances had been passed The wild centaurs were no longer allowed to ride up and down the plank walks of Saturdays with their reins in their teeth and firing a pistol into the ground with either hand they could punctuate the hotel sign no more they could not ride at a fast gallop through the streets of the town and Lost Spirit of American Liberty they could not even yell But the lawlessness of the town itself and its close environment was naturally the first objective point and the first problem involved was moonshine and its faithful ally the blind tiger The tiger is a little shanty with an ever open mouth a hole in the door like a post office window You place your money on the sill and at the ring of the coin a mysterious arm emerges from the hole sweeps the money away and leaves a bottle of white whiskey Thus you see nobody s face the owner of the beast is safe and so are you which you might not be if you saw and told In every little hollow about the Gap a tiger had his lair and these were all bearded at once by a petition to the county judge for high license saloons which was granted This measure drove the tigers out of business and concentrated moonshine in the heart of the town where its devotees were under easy guard One tiger only indeed was left run by a round shouldered crouching creature whom Bob Berkley now at Hale s solicitation a policeman and known as the Infant of the Guard dubbed Caliban His shanty stood midway in the Gap high from the road set against a dark clump of pines and roared at by the river beneath Everybody knew he sold whiskey but he was too shrewd to be caught until late one afternoon two days after young Dave s arrest Hale coming through the Gap into town glimpsed a skulking figure with a hand barrel as it slipped from the dark pines into Caliban s cabin He pulled in his horse dismounted and deliberated If he went on down the road now they would see him and suspect Moreover the patrons of the tiger would not appear until after dark and he wanted a prisoner or two So Hale led his horse up into the bushes and came back to a covert by the roadside to watch and wait As he sat there a merry whistle sounded down the road and Hale smiled Soon the Infant of the Guard came along his hands in his pockets his cap on the back of his head his pistol bumping his hip in manly fashion and making the ravines echo with his pursed lips He stopped in front of Hale looked toward the river drew his revolver and aimed it at a floating piece of wood The revolver cracked the piece of wood skidded on the surface of the water and there was no splash That was a pretty good shot said Hale in a low voice The boy whirled and saw him Well what are you Easy easy cautioned Hale Listen I ve just seen a moonshiner go into Caliban s cabin The boy s eager eyes sparkled Let s go after him No you go on back If you don t they ll be suspicious Get another man Hale almost laughed at the disappointment in the lad s face at his first words and the joy that came after it and climb high above the shanty and come back here to me Then after dark we ll dash in and cinch Caliban and his customers Yes sir said the lad Shall I whistle going back Hale nodded approval Just the same And off Bob went whistling like a calliope and not even turning his head to look at the cabin In half an hour Hale thought he heard something crashing through the bushes high on the mountain side and a little while afterward the boy crawled through the bushes to him alone His cap was gone there was a bloody scratch across his face and he was streaming with perspiration You ll have to excuse me sir he panted I didn t see anybody but one of my brothers and if I had told him he wouldn t have let ME come And I hurried back for fear for fear something would happen Well suppose I don t let you go Excuse me sir but I don t see how you can very well help You aren t my brother and you can t go alone I was said Hale Yes sir but not now Hale was worried but there was nothing else to be done All right I ll let you go if you stop saying sir to me It makes me feel so old Certainly sir said the lad quite unconsciously and when Hale smothered a laugh he looked around to see what had amused him Darkness fell quickly and in the gathering gloom they saw two more figures skulk into the cabin We ll go now for we want the fellow who s selling the moonshine Again Hale was beset with doubts about the boy and his own responsibility to the boy s brothers The lad s eyes were shining but his face was more eager than excited and his hand was as steady as Hale s own You slip around and station yourself behind that pine tree just behind the cabin the boy looked crestfallen and if anybody tries to get out of the back door you halt him Is there a back door I don t know Hale said rather shortly You obey orders I m not your brother but I m your captain I beg your pardon sir Shall I go now Yes you ll hear me at the front door They won t make any resistance The lad stepped away with nimble caution high above the cabin and he even took his shoes off before he slid lightly down to his place behind the pine There was no back door only a window and his disappointment was bitter Still when he heard Hale at the front door he meant to make a break for that window and he waited in the still gloom He could hear the rough talk and laughter within and now and then the clink of a tin cup By and by there was a faint noise in front of the cabin and he steadied his nerves and his beating heart Then he heard the door pushed violently in and Hale s cry Surrender Hale stood on the threshold with his pistol outstretched in his right hand The door had struck something soft and he said sharply again Come out from behind that door hands up At the same moment the back window flew open with a bang and Bob s pistol covered the edge of the opened door Caliban had rolled from his box like a stupid animal Two of his patrons sat dazed and staring from Hale to the boy s face at the window A mountaineer stood in one corner with twitching fingers and shifting eyes like a caged wild thing and forth issued from behind the door quivering with anger young Dave Tolliver Hale stared at him amazed and when Dave saw Hale such a wave of fury surged over his face that Bob thought it best to attract his attention again which he did by gently motioning at him with the barrel of his pistol Hold on there he said quietly and young Dave stood still Climb through that window Bob and collect the batteries said Hale Sure sir said the lad and with his pistol still prominently in the foreground he threw his left leg over the sill and as he climbed in he quoted with a grunt Always go in force to make an arrest Grim and serious as it was with June s cousin glowering at him Hale could not help smiling You didn t go home after all said Hale to young Dave who clenched his hands and his lips but answered nothing or if you did you got back pretty quick And still Dave was silent Get em all Bob In answer the boy went the rounds feeling the pocket of each man s right hip and his left breast Yes sir Unload em The lad broke each of the four pistols picked up a piece of twine and strung them together through each trigger guard Close that window and stand here at the door With the boy at the door Hale rolled the hand barrel to the threshold and the white liquor gurgled joyously on the steps All right come along he said to the captives and at last young Dave spoke Whut you takin me fer Hale pointed to the empty hand barrel and Dave s answer was a look of scorn I nuvver brought that hyeh You were drinking illegal liquor in a blind tiger and if you didn t bring it you can prove that later Anyhow we ll want you as a witness and Hale looked at the other mountaineer who had turned his eyes quickly to Dave Caliban led the way with young Dave and Hale walked side by side with them while Bob was escort for the other two The road ran along a high bank and as Bob was adjusting the jangling weapons on his left arm the strange mountaineer darted behind him and leaped headlong into the tops of thick rhododendron Before Hale knew what had happened the lad s pistol flashed Stop boy he cried horrified Don t shoot and he had to catch the lad to keep him from leaping after the runaway The shot had missed they heard the runaway splash into the river and go stumbling across it and then there was silence Young Dave laughed Uncle Judd ll be over hyeh to morrow to see about this Hale said nothing and they went on At the door of the calaboose Dave balked and had to be pushed in by main force They left him weeping and cursing with rage Go to bed Bob said Hale Yes sir said Bob just as soon as I get my lessons Hale did not go to the boarding house that night he feared to face June Instead he went to the hotel to scraps of a late supper and then to bed He had hardly touched the pillow it seemed when somebody shook him by the shoulder It was Macfarlan and daylight was streaming through the window A gang of those Falins are here Macfarlan said and they re after young Dave Tolliver about a dozen of em Young Buck is with them and the sheriff They say he shot a man over the mountains yesterday Hale sprang for his clothes here was a quandary If we turn him over to them they ll kill him Macfarlan nodded Of course and if we leave him in that weak old calaboose they ll get more help and take him out to night Then we ll take him to the county jail They ll take him away from us No they won t You go out and get as many shotguns as you can find and load them with buckshot Macfarlan nodded approvingly and disappeared Hale plunged his face in a basin of cold water soaked his hair and as he was mopping his face with a towel there was a ponderous tread on the porch the door opened without the formality of a knock and Devil Judd Tolliver with his hat on and belted with two huge pistols stepped stooping within His eyes red with anger and loss of sleep were glaring and his heavy moustache and beard showed the twitching of his mouth Whar s Dave he said shortly In the calaboose Did you put him in Yes said Hale calmly Well by God the old man said with repressed fury you can t git him out too soon if you want to save trouble Look here Judd said Hale seriously You are one of the last men in the world I want to have trouble with for many reasons but I m an officer over here and I m no more afraid of you Hale paused to let that fact sink in and it did than you are of me Dave s been selling liquor He hain t interrupted the old mountaineer He didn t bring that liquor over hyeh I know who done it All right said Hale I ll take your word for it and I ll let him out if you say so but Right now thundered old Judd Do you know that young Buck Falin and a dozen of his gang are over here after him The old man looked stunned Whut now They re over there in the woods across the river NOW and they want me to give him up to them They say they have the sheriff with them and they want him for shooting a man on Leatherwood Creek day before yesterday It s all a lie burst out old Judd They want to kill him Of course and I was going to take him up to the county jail right away for safe keeping D ye mean to say you d throw that boy into jail and then fight them Falins to pertect him the old man asked slowly and incredulously Hale pointed to a two store building through his window If you get in the back part of that store at a window you can see whether I will or not I can summon you to help and if a fight comes up you can do your share from the window The old man s eyes lighted up like a leaping flame Will you let Dave out and give him a Winchester and help us fight em he said eagerly We three can whip em all No said Hale shortly I d try to keep both sides from fighting and I d arrest Dave or you as quickly as I would a Falin The average mountaineer has little conception of duty in the abstract but old Judd belonged to the better class and there are many of them that does He looked into Hale s eyes long and steadily All right Macfarlan came in hurriedly and stopped short seeing the hatted bearded giant This is mister Tolliver an uncle of Dave s Judd Tolliver said Hale Go ahead I ve got everything fixed but I couldn t get but five of the fellows two of the Berkley boys They wouldn t let me tell Bob All right Can I summon mister Tolliver here Yes said Macfarlan doubtfully but you know He won t be seen interrupted Hale understandingly He ll be at a window in the back of that store and he won t take part unless a fight begins and if it does we ll need him An hour later Devil Judd Tolliver was in the store Hale pointed out and peering cautiously around the edge of an open window at the wooden gate of the ramshackle calaboose Several Falins were there led by young Buck whom Hale recognized as the red headed youth at the head of the tearing horsemen who had swept by him that late afternoon when he was coming back from his first trip to Lonesome Cove The old man gritted his teeth as he looked and he put one of his huge pistols on a table within easy reach and kept the other clenched in his right fist From down the street came five horsemen led by John Hale Every man carried a double barrelled shotgun and the old man smiled and his respect for Hale rose higher high as it already was for nobody mountaineer or not has love for a hostile shotgun The Falins armed only with pistols drew near Keep back he heard Hale say calmly and they stopped young Buck alone going on We want that feller said young Buck Well you don t get him said Hale quietly He s our prisoner Keep back he repeated motioning with the barrel of his shotgun and young Buck moved backward to his own men The old man saw Hale and another man the sergeant go inside the heavy gate of the stockade He saw a boy in a cap with a pistol in one hand and a strapped set of books in the other come running up to the men with the shotguns and he heard one of them say angrily I told you not to come I know you did said the boy imperturbably You go on to school said another of the men but the boy with the cap shook his head and dropped his books to the ground The big gate opened just then and out came Hale and the sergeant and between them young Dave his eyes blinking in the sunlight Damn ye he heard Dave say to Hale I ll get even with you fer this some day and then the prisoner s eyes caught the horses and shotguns and turned to the group of Falins and he shrank back utterly dazed There was a movement among the Falins and Devil Judd caught up his other pistol and with a grim smile got ready Young Buck had turned to his crowd Men he said you know I never back down Devil Judd knew that too and he was amazed by the words that followed an if you say so we ll have him or die but we ain t in our own state now They ve got the law and the shotguns on us an I reckon we d better go slow The rest seemed quite willing to go slow and as they put their pistols up Devil Judd laughed in his beard Hale put young Dave on a horse and the little shotgun cavalcade quietly moved away toward the county seat The crestfallen Falins dispersed the other way after they had taken a parting shot at the honorable Samuel Budd who too had a pistol in his hand Young Buck looked long at him and then he laughed You too Sam Budd he said We folks ll rickollect this on election day The honorable Sam deigned no answer And up in the store Devil Judd lighted his pipe and sat down to think out the strange code of ethics that governed that police guard Hale had told him to wait there and it was almost noon before the boy with the cap came to tell him that the Falins had all left town The old man looked at him kindly Air you the little feller whut fit fer June Not yet said Bob but it s coming Well you ll whoop him I ll do my best Whar is she She s waiting for you over at the boarding house Does she know about this trouble Not a thing she thinks you ve come to take her home The old man made no answer and Bob led him back toward Hale s office June was waiting at the gate and the boy lifting his cap passed on June s eyes were dark with anxiety You come to take me home dad I been thinkin bout it he said with a doubtful shake of his head June took him upstairs to her room and pointed out the old water wheel through the window and her new clothes she had put on her old homespun again when she heard he was in town and the old man shook his head I m afeerd bout all these fixin s you won t never be satisfied agin in Lonesome Cove Why

none	none	reprovingly Jack says I can go over whenever I please as soon as the weather gits warmer and the roads gits good I don t know said the old man still shaking his head All through dinner she was worried Devil Judd hardly ate anything so embarrassed was he by the presence of so many furriners and by the white cloth and table ware and so fearful was he that he would be guilty of some breach of manners Resolutely he refused butter and at the third urging by missus Crane he said firmly but with a shrewd twinkle in his eye No thank ye I never eats butter in town I ve kept store myself and he was no little pleased with the laugh that went around the table The fact was he was generally pleased with June s environment and after dinner he stopped teasing June No honey I ain t goin to take you away I want ye to stay right where ye air Be a good girl now and do whatever Jack Hale tells ye and tell that boy with all that hair to come over and see me June grew almost tearful with gratitude for never had he called her honey before that she could remember and never had he talked so much to her nor with so much kindness Air ye comin over soon Mighty soon dad Well take keer o yourself I will dad she said and tenderly she watched his great figure slouch out of sight An hour after dark as old Judd sat on the porch of the cabin in Lonesome Cove young Dave Tolliver rode up to the gate on a strange horse He was in a surly mood He lemme go at the head of the valley and give me this hoss to git here the boy grudgingly explained I m goin over to git mine termorrer Seems like you d better keep away from that Gap said the old man dryly and Dave reddened angrily Yes and fust thing you know he ll be over hyeh atter YOU The old man turned on him sternly Jack Hale knows that liquer was mine He knows I ve got a still over hyeh as well as you do an he s never axed a question nor peeped an eye I reckon he would come if he thought he oughter but I m on this side of the state line If I was on his side mebbe I d stop Young Dave stared for things were surely coming to a pretty pass in Lonesome Cove An I reckon the old man went on hit ud be better grace in you to stop sayin things agin him fer if it hadn t been fer him you d be laid out by them Falins by this time It was true and Dave silenced was forced into another channel I wonder he said presently how them Falins always know when I go over thar I ve been studyin about that myself said Devil Judd Inside the old step mother had heard Dave s query I seed the Red Fox this afternoon she quavered at the door Whut was he doin over hyeh asked Dave Nothin she said jus a sneakin aroun the way he s al ays a doin Seemed like he was mighty pertickuler to find out when you was comin back Both men started slightly We re all Tollivers now all right said the honorable Samuel Budd that night while he sat with Hale on the porch overlooking the mill pond and then he groaned a little Them Falins have got kinsfolks to burn on the Virginia side and they d fight me tooth and toenail for this a hundred years hence He puffed his pipe but Hale said nothing Yes sir he added cheerily we re in for a hell of a merry time NOW The mountaineer hates as long as he remembers and he never forgets XV Hand in hand Hale and June followed the footsteps of spring from the time June met him at the school house gate for their first walk into the woods Hale pointed to some boys playing marbles That s the first sign he said and with quick understanding June smiled The birdlike piping of hylas came from a marshy strip of woodland that ran through the centre of the town and a toad was croaking at the foot of Imboden Hill And they come next They crossed the swinging foot bridge which was a miracle to June and took the foot path along the clear stream of South Fork under the laurel which June called ivy and the rhododendron which was laurel in her speech and Hale pointed out catkins greening on alders in one swampy place and willows just blushing into life along the banks of a little creek A few yards aside from the path he found under a patch of snow and dead leaves the pink and white blossoms and the waxy green leaves of the trailing arbutus that fragrant harbinger of the old Mother s awakening and June breathed in from it the very breath of spring Near by were turkey peas which she had hunted and eaten many times You can t put that arbutus in a garden said Hale it s as wild as a hawk Presently he had the little girl listen to a pewee twittering in a thorn bush and the lusty call of a robin from an apple tree A bluebird flew over head with a merry chirp its wistful note of autumn long since forgotten These were the first birds and flowers he said and June knowing them only by sight must know the name of each and the reason for that name So that Hale found himself walking the woods with an interrogation point and that he might not be confounded he had later to dip up much forgotten lore For every walk became a lesson in botany for June such a passion did she betray at once for flowers and he rarely had to tell her the same thing twice since her memory was like a vise for everything as he learned in time Her eyes were quicker than his too and now she pointed to a snowy blossom with a deeply lobed leaf Whut s that Bloodroot said Hale and he scratched the stem and forth issued scarlet drops The Indians used to put it on their faces and tomahawks she knew that word and nodded and I used to make red ink of it when I was a little boy No said June With the next look she found a tiny bunch of fuzzy hepaticas Liver leaf Whut s liver Hale looking at her glowing face and eyes and her perfect little body imagined that she would never know unless told that she had one and so he waved one hand vaguely at his chest It s an organ and that herb is supposed to be good for it Organ Whut s that Oh something inside of you June made the same gesture that Hale had Me Yes and then helplessly but not there exactly June s eyes had caught something else now and she ran for it Oh Oh It was a bunch of delicate anemones of intermediate shades between white and red yellow pink and purple blue Those are anemones A nem o nes repeated June Wind flowers because the wind is supposed to open them And almost unconsciously Hale lapsed into a quotation And where a tear has dropped a wind flower blows Whut s that said June quickly That s poetry Whut s po e try Hale threw up both hands I don t know but I ll read you some some day By that time she was gurgling with delight over a bunch of spring beauties that came up root stalk and all when she reached for them Well ain t they purty While they lay in her hand and she looked the rose veined petals began to close the leaves to droop and the stem got limp Ah h crooned June I won t pull up no more o THEM These little dream flowers found in the spring More poetry June A little later he heard her repeating that line to herself It was an easy step to poetry from flowers and evidently June was groping for it A few days later the service berry swung out white stars on the low hill sides but Hale could tell her nothing that she did not know about the sarvice berry Soon the dogwood swept in snowy gusts along the mountains and from a bank of it one morning a red bird flamed and sang What cheer What cheer What cheer And like its scarlet coat the red bud had burst into bloom June knew the red bud but she had never heard it called the Judas tree You see the red bud was supposed to be poisonous It shakes in the wind and says to the bees Come on little fellows here s your nice fresh honey and when they come it betrays and poisons them Well what do you think o that said June indignantly and Hale had to hedge a bit Well I don t know whether it REALLY does but that s what they SAY A little farther on the white stars of the trillium gleamed at them from the border of the woods and near by June stooped over some lovely sky blue blossoms with yellow eyes Forget me nots said Hale June stooped to gather them with a radiant face Oh she said is that what you call em They aren t the real ones they re false forget me nots Then I don t want em said June But they were beautiful and fragrant and she added gently Tain t their fault I m agoin to call em jus forget me nots an I m givin em to you she said so that you won t Thank you said Hale gravely I won t They found larkspur too Blue as the heaven it gazes at quoted Hale Whut s gazes Looks June looked up at the sky and down at the flower Tain t she said hit s bluer When they discovered something Hale did not know he would say that it was one of those Wan flowers without a name My said June at last seems like them wan flowers is a mighty big fambly They are laughed Hale for a bachelor like me Huh said June Later they ran upon yellow adder s tongues in a hollow each blossom guarded by a pair of ear like leaves Dutchman s breeches and wild bleeding hearts a name that appealed greatly to the fancy of the romantic little lady and thus together they followed the footsteps of that spring And while she studied the flowers Hale was studying the loveliest flower of them all little June About ferns plants and trees as well he told her all he knew and there seemed nothing in the skies the green world of the leaves or the under world at her feet to which she was not magically responsive Indeed Hale had never seen a man woman or child so eager to learn and one day when she had apparently reached the limit of inquiry she grew very thoughtful and he watched her in silence a long while What s the matter June he asked finally I m just wonderin why I m always axin why said little June She was learning in school too and she was happier there now for there had been no more open teasing of the new pupil Bob s championship saved her from that and thereafter school changed straightway for June Before that day she had kept apart from her school fellows at recess times as well as in the school room Two or three of the girls had made friendly advances to her but she had shyly repelled them why she hardly knew and it was her lonely custom at recess times to build a play house at the foot of a great beech with moss broken bits of bottles and stones Once she found it torn to pieces and from the look on the face of the tall mountain boy Cal Heaton who had grinned at her when she went up for her first lesson and who was now Bob s arch enemy she knew that he was the guilty one Again a day or two later it was destroyed and when she came down from the woods almost in tears Bob happened to meet her in the road and made her tell the trouble she was in Straightway he charged the trespasser with the deed and was lied to for his pains So after school that day he slipped up on the hill with the little girl and helped her rebuild again Now I ll lay for him said Bob and catch him at it All right said June and she looked both her worry and her gratitude so that Bob understood both and he answered both with a nonchalant wave of one hand Never you mind and don t you tell mister Hale and June in dumb acquiescence crossed heart and body But the mountain boy was wary and for two or three days the play house was undisturbed and so Bob himself laid a trap He mounted his horse immediately after school rode past the mountain lad who was on his way home crossed the river made a wide detour at a gallop and hitching his horse in the woods came to the play house from the other side of the hill And half an hour later when the pale little teacher came out of the school house he heard grunts and blows and scuffling up in the woods and when he ran toward the sounds the bodies of two of his pupils rolled into sight clenched fiercely with torn clothes and bleeding faces Bob on top with the mountain boy s thumb in his mouth and his own fingers gripped about his antagonist s throat Neither paid any attention to the school master who pulled at Bob s coat unavailingly and with horror at his ferocity Bob turned his head shook it as well as the thumb in his mouth would let him and went on gripping the throat under him and pushing the head that belonged to it into the ground The mountain boy s tongue showed and his eyes bulged Nough he yelled Bob rose then and told his story and the school master from New England gave them a short lecture on gentleness and Christian charity and fixed on each the awful penalty of staying in after school for an hour every day for a week Bob grinned All right professor it was worth it he said but the mountain lad shuffled silently away An hour later Hale saw the boy with a swollen lip one eye black and the other as merry as ever but after that there was no more trouble for June Bob had made his promise good and gradually she came into the games with her fellows there after while Bob stood or sat aside encouraging but taking no part for was he not a member of the Police Force Indeed he was already known far and wide as the Infant of the Guard and always he carried a whistle and usually outside the school house a pistol bumped his hip while a Winchester stood in one corner of his room and a billy dangled by his mantel piece The games were new to June and often Hale would stroll up to the school house to watch them Prisoner s Base Skipping the Rope Antny Over Cracking the Whip and Lifting the Gate and it pleased him to see how lithe and active his little protege was and more than a match in strength even for the boys who were near her size June had to take the penalty of her greenness too when she was introduced to the King and Queen and bumped the ground between the make believe sovereigns or got a cup of water in her face when she was trying to see stars through a pipe And the boys pinned her dress to the bench through a crack and once she walked into school with a placard on her back which read June Bug But she was so good natured that she fast became a favourite Indeed it was noticeable to Hale as well as Bob that Cal Heaton the mountain boy seemed always to get next to June in the Tugs of War and one morning June found an apple on her desk She swept the room with a glance and met Cal s guilty flush and though she ate the apple she gave him no thanks in word look or manner It was curious to Hale moreover to observe how June s instinct deftly led her to avoid the mistakes in dress that characterized the gropings of other girls who like her were in a stage of transition They wore gaudy combs and green skirts with red waists their clothes bunched at the hips and to their shoes and hands they paid no attention at all None of these things for June and Hale did not know that the little girl had leaped her fellows with one bound had taken Miss Anne Saunders as her model and was climbing upon the pedestal where that lady justly stood The two had not become friends as Hale hoped June was always silent and reserved when the older girl was around but there was never a move of the latter s hand or foot or lip or eye that the new pupil failed to see Miss Anne rallied Hale no little about her but he laughed good naturedly and asked why SHE could not make friends with June She s jealous said Miss Saunders and Hale ridiculed the idea for not one sign since she came to the Gap had she shown him It was the jealousy of a child she had once betrayed and that she had outgrown he thought but he never knew how June stood behind the curtains of her window with a hungry suffering in her face and eyes to watch Hale and Miss Anne ride by and he never guessed that concealment was but a sign of the dawn of womanhood that was breaking within her And she gave no hint of that breaking dawn until one day early in May when she heard a woodthrush for the first time with Hale for it was the bird she loved best and always its silver fluting would stop her in her tracks and send her into dreamland Hale had just broken a crimson flower from its stem and held it out to her Here s another of the wan ones June Do you know what that is Hit s she paused for correction with her lips drawn severely in for precision IT S a mountain poppy Pap says it kills goslings her eyes danced for she was in a merry mood that day and she put both hands behind her if you air any kin to a goose you better drap it That s a good one laughed Hale but it s so lovely I ll take the risk I won t drop it Drop it caught June with a quick upward look and then to fix the word in her memory she repeated drop it drop it DROP it Got it now June Uh huh It was then that a woodthrush voiced the crowning joy of spring and with slowly filling eyes she asked its name That bird she said slowly and with a breaking voice sung just that a way the mornin my sister died She turned to him with a wondering smile Somehow it don t make me so miserable like it useter Her smile passed while she looked she caught both hands to her heaving breast and a wild intensity burned suddenly in her eyes Why June Tain t nothin she choked out and she turned hurriedly ahead of him down the path Startled Hale had dropped the crimson flower to his feet He saw it and he let it lie Meanwhile rumours were brought in that the Falins were coming over from Kentucky to wipe out the Guard and so straight were they sometimes that the Guard was kept perpetually on watch Once while the members were at target practice the shout arose The Kentuckians are coming The Kentuckians are coming And at double quick the Guard rushed back to find it a false alarm and to see men laughing at them in the street The truth was that while the Falins had a general hostility against the Guard their particular enmity was concentrated on John Hale as he discovered when June was to take her first trip home one Friday afternoon Hale meant to carry her over but the morning they were to leave old Judd Tolliver came to the Gap himself He did not want June to come home at that time and he didn t think it was safe over there for Hale just then Some of the Falins had been seen hanging around Lonesome Cove for the purpose Judd believed of getting a shot at the man who had kept young Dave from falling into their hands and Hale saw that by that act he had as Budd said arrayed himself with the Tollivers in the feud In other words he was a Tolliver himself now and as such the Falins meant to treat him Hale rebelled against the restriction for he had started some work in Lonesome Cove and was preparing a surprise over there for June but old Judd said Just wait a while and he said it so seriously that Hale for a while took his advice So June stayed on at the Gap with little disappointment apparently that she could not visit home And as spring passed and the summer came on the little girl budded and opened like a rose To the pretty school teacher she was a source of endless interest and wonder for while the little girl was reticent and aloof Miss Saunders felt herself watched and studied in and out of school and Hale often had to smile at June s unconscious imitation of her teacher in speech manners and dress And all the time her hero worship of Hale went on fed by the talk of the boardinghouse her fellow pupils and of the town at large and it fairly thrilled her to know that to the Falins he was now a Tolliver himself Sometimes Hale would get her a saddle and then June would usurp Miss Anne s place on a horseback ride up through the gap to see the first blooms of the purple rhododendron on Bee Rock or up to Morris s farm on Powell s mountain from which with a glass they could see the Lonesome Pine And all the time she worked at her studies tirelessly and when she was done with her lessons she read the fairy books that Hale got for her read them until Paul and Virginia fell into her hands and then there were no more fairy stories for little June Often late at night Hale from the porch of his cottage could see the light of her lamp sending its beam across the dark water of the mill pond and finally he got worried by the paleness of her face and sent her to the doctor She went unwillingly and when she came back she reported placidly that organatically she was all right the doctor said but Hale was glad that vacation would soon come At the beginning of the last week of school he brought a little present for her from New York a slender necklace of gold with a little reddish stone pendant that was the shape of a cross Hale pulled the trinket from his pocket as they were walking down the river bank at sunset and the little girl quivered like an aspen leaf in a sudden puff of wind Hit s a fairy stone she cried excitedly Why where on earth did you Why sister Sally told me about em She said folks found em somewhere over here in Virginny an all her life she was a wishin fer one an she never could git it her eyes filled seems like ever thing she wanted is a comin to me Do you know the story of it too asked Hale June shook her head Sister Sally said it was a luck piece Nothin could happen to ye when ye was carryin it but it was awful bad luck if you lost it Hale put it around her neck and fastened the clasp and June kept hold of the little cross with one hand Well you mustn t lose it he said

none	none	she repeated breathlessly and Hale told her the pretty story of the stone as they strolled back to supper The little crosses were to be found only in a certain valley in Virginia so perfect in shape that they seemed to have been chiselled by hand and they were a great mystery to the men who knew all about rocks the geologists The ge ol o gists repeated June These men said there was no crystallization nothing like them amended Hale elsewhere in the world and that just as crosses were of different shapes Roman Maltese and saint Andrew s so too these crosses were found in all these different shapes And the myth the story was that this little valley was once inhabited by fairies June s eyes lighted for it was a fairy story after all and that when a strange messenger brought them the news of Christ s crucifixion they wept and their tears as they fell to the ground were turned into tiny crosses of stone Even the Indians had some queer feeling about them and for a long long time people who found them had used them as charms to bring good luck and ward off harm And that s for you he said because you ve been such a good little girl and have studied so hard School s most over now and I reckon you ll be right glad to get home again June made no answer but at the gate she looked suddenly up at him Have you got one too she asked and she seemed much disturbed when Hale shook his head Well I LL git GET you one some day All right laughed Hale There was again something strange in her manner as she turned suddenly from him and what it meant he was soon to learn It was the last week of school and Hale had just come down from the woods behind the school house at little recess time in the afternoon The children were playing games outside the gate and Bob and Miss Anne and the little Professor were leaning on the fence watching them The little man raised his hand to halt Hale on the plank sidewalk I ve been wanting to see you he said in his dreamy abstracted way You prophesied you know that I should be proud of your little protege some day and I am indeed She is the most remarkable pupil I ve yet seen here and I have about come to the conclusion that there is no quicker native intelligence in our country than you shall find in the children of these mountaineers and Miss Anne was gazing at the children with an expression that turned Hale s eyes that way and the Professor checked his harangue Something had happened They had been playing Ring Around the Rosy and June had been caught She stood scarlet and tense and the cry was Who s your beau who s your beau And still she stood with tight lips flushing You got to tell you got to tell The mountain boy Cal Heaton was grinning with fatuous consciousness and even Bob put his hands in his pockets and took on an uneasy smile Who s your beau came the chorus again The lips opened almost in a whisper but all could hear Jack Jack who But June looked around and saw the four at the gate Almost staggering she broke from the crowd and with one forearm across her scarlet face rushed past them into the school house Miss Anne looked at Male s amazed face and she did not smile Bob turned respectfully away ignoring it all and the little Professor whose life purpose was psychology murmured in his ignorance Very remarkable very remarkable Through that afternoon June kept her hot face close to her books Bob never so much as glanced her way little gentleman that he was but the one time she lifted her eyes she met the mountain lad s bent in a stupor like gaze upon her In spite of her apparent studiousness however she missed her lesson and automatically the little Professor told her to stay in after school and recite to Miss Saunders And so June and Miss Anne sat in the school room alone the teacher reading a book and the pupil her tears unshed with her sullen face bent over her lesson In a few moments the door opened and the little Professor thrust in his head The girl had looked so hurt and tired when he spoke to her that some strange sympathy moved him mystified though he was to say gently now and with a smile that was rare with him You might excuse June I think Miss Saunders and let her recite some time to morrow and gently he closed the door Miss Anne rose Very well June she said quietly June rose too gathering up her books and as she passed the teacher s platform she stopped and looked her full in the face She said not a word and the tragedy between the woman and the girl was played in silence for the woman knew from the searching gaze of the girl and the black defiance in her eyes as she stalked out of the room that her own flush had betrayed her secret as plainly as the girl s words had told hers Through his office window a few minutes later Hale saw June pass swiftly into the house In a few minutes she came swiftly out again and went back swiftly toward the school house He was so worried by the tense look in her face that he could work no more and in a few minutes he threw his papers down and followed her When he turned the corner Bob was coming down the street with his cap on the back of his head and swinging his books by a strap and the boy looked a little conscious when he saw Hale coming Have you seen June Hale asked No sir said Bob immensely relieved Did she come up this way I don t know but Bob turned and pointed to the green dome of a big beech I think you ll find her at the foot of that tree he said That s where her play house is and that s where she goes when she s that s where she usually goes Oh yes said Hale her play house Thank you Not at all sir Hale went on turned from the path and climbed noiselessly When he caught sight of the beech he stopped still June stood against it like a wood nymph just emerged from its sun dappled trunk stood stretched to her full height her hands behind her her hair tossed her throat tense under the dangling little cross her face uplifted At her feet the play house was scattered to pieces She seemed listening to the love calls of a woodthrush that came faintly through the still woods and then he saw that she heard nothing saw nothing that she was in a dream as deep as sleep Hale s heart throbbed as he looked June he called softly She did not hear him and when he called again she turned her face unstartled and moving her posture not at all Hale pointed to the scattered play house I done it she said fiercely I done it myself Her eyes burned steadily into his even while she lifted her hands to her hair as though she were only vaguely conscious that it was all undone YOU heerd me she cried and before he could answer SHE heerd me and again not waiting for a word from him she cried still more fiercely I don t keer I don t keer WHO knows Her hands were trembling she was biting her quivering lip to keep back the starting tears and Hale rushed toward her and took her in his arms June June he said brokenly You mustn t little girl I m proud proud why little sweetheart She was clinging to him and looking up into his eyes and he bent his head slowly Their lips met and the man was startled He knew now it was no child that answered him Hale walked long that night in the moonlit woods up and around Imboden Hill along a shadow haunted path between silvery beech trunks past the big hole in the earth from which dead trees tossed out their crooked arms as if in torment and to the top of the ridge under which the valley slept and above which the dark bulk of Powell s Mountain rose It was absurd but he found himself strangely stirred She was a child he kept repeating to himself in spite of the fact that he knew she was no child among her own people and that mountain girls were even wives who were younger still Still she did not know what she felt how could she and she would get over it and then came the sharp stab of a doubt would he want her to get over it Frankly and with wonder he confessed to himself that he did not know he did not know But again why bother He had meant to educate her anyhow That was the first step no matter what happened June must go out into the world to school He would have plenty of money Her father would not object and June need never know He could include for her an interest in her own father s coal lands that he meant to buy and she could think that it was her own money that she was using So with a sudden rush of gladness from his brain to his heart he recklessly yoked himself then and there under all responsibility for that young life and the eager sensitive soul that already lighted it so radiantly And June Her nature had opened precisely as had bud and flower that spring The Mother of Magicians had touched her as impartially as she had touched them with fairy wand and as unconsciously the little girl had answered as a young dove to any cooing mate With this Hale did not reckon and this June could not know For a while that night she lay in a delicious tremor listening to the bird like chorus of the little frogs in the marsh the booming of the big ones in the mill pond the water pouring over the dam with the sound of a low wind and as had all the sleeping things of the earth about her she too sank to happy sleep XVI The in sweep of the outside world was broadening its current now

3843-176666-0001	train-other-500	more entries were driven into the coal and on the Virginia side were signs of stripping for iron ore A furnace was coming in just as soon as the railroad could bring it in and the railroad was pushing ahead with genuine vigor
none	none	 Speculators were trooping in and the town had been divided off into lots a few of which had already changed hands One agent had brought in a big steel safe and a tent and was buying coal lands right and left 
3843-176666-0002	train-other-500	More young men drifted in from all points of the compass A tent hotel was put at the foot of Imboden Hill and of nights there were under it much poker and song The lilt of a definite optimism was in every man s step
3843-176666-0003	train-other-500	and the light of hope was in every man s eye And the Guard went to its work in earnest Every man now had his Winchester his revolver his billy and his whistle Drilling and target shooting became a daily practice
3843-176666-0004	train-other-500	Bob who had been a year in a military school was drill master for the recruits and very gravely he performed his duties and put them through the skirmishers drill advancing in rushes throwing themselves in the new grass
3843-176666-0005	train-other-500	and very gravely he commended one enthusiast none other than the honorable Samuel Budd who rather than lose his position in line threw himself into a pool of water all to the surprise scorn and anger
3843-176666-0006	train-other-500	of the mountain onlookers who dwelled about the town Many were the comments the members of the Guard heard from them
none	none	 even while they were at drill I d like to see one o them fellers hit me with one of them locust posts 
3843-176666-0007	train-other-500	Huh I could take two good men an run the whole batch out o the county Look at them dudes and furriners They come into our country and air tryin to larn us how to run it Our boys air only tryin to have their little fun
3843-176666-0008	train-other-500	They don t mean nothin but someday some fool young guard ll hurt somebody and then thar ll be hell to pay Hale could not help feeling considerable sympathy for their point of view
none	none	 particularly when he saw the mountaineers watching the Guard at target practice 
3843-176666-0009	train-other-500	each volunteer policeman with his back to the target and at the word of command wheeling and firing six shots in rapid succession and he did not wonder at their snorts of scorn at such bad shooting
3843-176666-0010	train-other-500	and their open anger that the Guard was practising for THEM But sometimes he got an unexpected recruit One bully who had been conspicuous in the brickyard trouble after watching a drill went up to him with a grin Hell he said cheerily
none	none	 I believe you fellers air goin to have more fun than we air 
3843-176666-0011	train-other-500	an danged if I don t jine you if you ll let me Sure said Hale
none	none	 And others who might have been bad men 
3843-176666-0012	train-other-500	became members and thus getting a vent for their energies were as enthusiastic for the law as they might have been against it Of course the antagonistic element in the town lost no opportunity to plague and harass the Guard
3843-176666-0013	train-other-500	and after the destruction of the blind tigers mischief was naturally concentrated in the high license saloons particularly in the one run by Jack Woods whose local power for evil and cackling laugh
3843-176666-0014	train-other-500	seemed to mean nothing else than close personal communion with old Nick himself Passing the door of his saloon one day Bob saw one of Jack s customers trying to play pool with a Winchester in one hand
none	none	 and an open knife between his teeth 
3843-176666-0015	train-other-500	and the boy stepped in and halted
none	none	 The man had no weapon concealed and was making no disturbance 
3843-176666-0016	train-other-500	and Bob did not know whether or not he had the legal right to arrest him so he turned
none	none	 and while he was standing in the door Jack winked at his customer who with a grin put the back of his knife blade between Bob s shoulders and pushing closed it The boy looked over his shoulder without moving a muscle but the honorable Samuel Budd who came in at that moment 
3843-176666-0017	train-other-500	pinioned the fellow s arms from behind and Bob took his weapon away Hell said the mountaineer I didn t aim to hurt the little feller I jes wanted to see if I could skeer him Well brother tis scarce a merry jest
3843-176666-0018	train-other-500	quoth the honorable Sam and he looked sharply at Jack through his big spectacles as the two led the man off to the calaboose for he suspected that the saloon keeper was at the bottom of the trick Jack s time came only the next day
3843-176666-0019	train-other-500	He had regarded it as the limit of indignity when an ordinance was up that nobody should blow a whistle except a member of the Guard and it was great fun for him to have some drunken customer blow a whistle
3843-176666-0020	train-other-500	and then stand in his door and laugh at the policemen running in from all directions That day Jack tried the whistle himself and Hale ran down Who did that he asked Jack felt bold that morning I blowed it
3843-176666-0021	train-other-500	Hale thought for a moment The ordinance against blowing a whistle had not yet been passed but he made up his mind that under the circumstances Jack s blowing was a breach of the peace since the Guard had adopted that signal So he said
3843-176666-0022	train-other-500	You mustn t do that again Jack had doubtless been going through precisely the same mental process and on the nice legal point involved he seemed to differ I ll blow it when I damn please he said Blow it again and I ll arrest you
3843-176666-0023	train-other-500	said Hale Jack blew He had his right shoulder against the corner of his door at the time and when he raised the whistle to his lips Hale drew and covered him before he could make another move Woods backed slowly into his saloon
3843-176666-0024	train-other-500	to get behind his counter Hale saw his purpose and he closed in taking great risk as he always did to avoid bloodshed
none	none	 and there was a struggle 
3843-176666-0025	train-other-500	Jack managed to get his pistol out
none	none	 but Hale caught him by the wrist 
3843-176666-0026	train-other-500	and held the weapon away so that it was harmless as far as he was concerned but a crowd was gathering at the door toward which the saloon keeper s pistol was pointed and he feared that somebody out there might be shot so he called out Drop that pistol
3843-176666-0027	train-other-500	The order was not obeyed and Hale raised his right hand high above Jack s head and dropped the butt of his weapon on Jack s skull hard Jack s head dropped back between his shoulders his eyes closed and his pistol clicked on the floor
3843-176666-0028	train-other-500	Hale knew how serious a thing a blow was in that part of the world and what excitement it would create and he was uneasy at Jack s trial for fear that the saloon keeper s friends would take the matter up but they didn t
3843-176666-0029	train-other-500	and to the surprise of everybody Jack quietly paid his fine and thereafter the Guard had little active trouble from the town itself for it was quite plain there at least that the Guard meant business
3843-176666-0030	train-other-500	Across Black Mountain old Dave Tolliver and old Buck Falin had got well of their wounds by this time and though each swore to have vengeance against the other as soon as he was able to handle a Winchester
3843-176666-0031	train-other-500	both factions seemed waiting for that time to come Moreover the Falins because of a rumour that Bad Rufe Tolliver might come back and because of Devil Judd s anger at their attempt to capture young Dave
3843-176666-0032	train-other-500	grew wary and rather pacificatory and so beyond a little quarrelling a little threatening and the exchange of a harmless shot or two sometimes in banter sometimes in earnest nothing had been done
3843-176666-0033	train-other-500	Sternly however though the Falins did not know the fact Devil Judd continued to hold aloof in spite of the pleadings of young Dave and so confident was the old man in the balance of power that lay with him that he sent June word
3843-176666-0034	train-other-500	that he was coming to take her home And in truth with Hale going away again on a business trip and Bob too gone back home to the Bluegrass and school closed the little girl was glad to go
none	none	 and she waited for her father s coming eagerly 
3843-176666-0035	train-other-500	Miss Anne was still there to be sure and if she too had gone
none	none	 June would have been more content 
3843-176666-0036	train-other-500	The quiet smile of that astute young woman had told Hale plainly and somewhat to his embarrassment that she knew something had happened between the two but that smile she never gave to June
3843-176666-0037	train-other-500	Indeed she never encountered aught else than the same silent searching gaze from the strangely mature little creature s eyes and when those eyes met the teacher s always June s hand would wander unconsciously to the little cross at her throat
none	none	 as though to invoke its aid against anything that could come between her and its giver The purple rhododendrons on Bee Rock had come and gone 
3843-176666-0038	train-other-500	and the pink flecked laurels were in bloom when June fared forth one sunny morning of her own birth month behind old Judd Tolliver home Back up through the wild Gap they rode in silence past Bee Rock
3843-176666-0039	train-other-500	out of the chasm and up the little valley toward the Trail of the Lonesome Pine into which the father s old sorrel nag with a switch of her sunburnt tail turned leftward June leaned forward a little
3843-176666-0040	train-other-500	and there was the crest of the big tree motionless in the blue high above and sheltered by one big white cloud It was the first time she had seen the pine since she had first left it
3843-176666-0041	train-other-500	and little tremblings went through her from her bare feet to her bonneted head Thus was she unclad for Hale had told her that to avoid criticism she must go home clothed just as she was when she left Lonesome Cove
3843-176666-0042	train-other-500	She did not quite understand that and she carried her new clothes in a bundle in her lap but she took Hale s word unquestioned So she wore her crimson homespun and her bonnet
3843-176666-0043	train-other-500	with her bronze gold hair gathered under it in the same old Psyche knot She must wear her shoes she told Hale until she got out of town else someone might see her but Hale had said she would be leaving too early for that
3843-176666-0044	train-other-500	and so she had gone from the Gap as she had come into it with unmittened hands and bare feet The soft wind was very good to those dangling feet and she itched to have them on the green grass or in the cool waters
none	none	 through which the old horse splashed Yes she was going home again the same June as far as mountain eyes could see though she had grown perceptibly and her little face had blossomed from her heart almost into a woman s but she knew that while her clothes were the same they covered quite another girl 
3843-176666-0045	train-other-500	Time wings slowly for the young and when the sensations are many and the experiences are new slowly even for all and thus there was a double reason why it seemed an age to June since her eyes had last rested on the big Pine
none	none	 Here was the place 
3843-176666-0046	train-other-500	where Hale had put his big black horse into a dead run and as vivid a thrill of it came back to her now as had been the thrill of the race Then they began to climb laboriously up the rocky creek the water singing a joyous welcome to her along the path
3843-176666-0047	train-other-500	ferns and flowers nodding to her from dead leaves and rich mould and peeping at her from crevices between the rocks on the creek banks as high up as the level of her eyes up under bending branches full leafed
none	none	 with the warm sunshine darting down through them upon her as she passed 
3843-176666-0048	train-other-500	and making a playfellow of her sunny hair
none	none	 Here was the place where she had got angry with Hale 
3843-176666-0049	train-other-500	had slid from his horse and stormed with tears What a little fool she had been when Hale had meant only to be kind He was never anything but kind Jack was dear dear Jack That wouldn t happen NO more she thought
3843-176666-0050	train-other-500	and straightway she corrected that thought It won t happen ANY more she said aloud Whut d you say June The old man lifted his bushy beard from his chest and turned his head Nothin dad
3843-176666-0051	train-other-500	she said and old Judd himself in a deep study dropped back into it again How often she had said that to herself that it would happen no more she had stopped saying it to Hale because he laughed and forgave her
3843-176666-0052	train-other-500	and seemed to love her mood whether she cried from joy or anger and yet she kept on doing both just the same Several times Devil Judd stopped to let his horse rest and each time of course the wooded slopes of the mountains
none	none	 stretched downward in longer sweeps of summer green 
3843-176666-0053	train-other-500	and across the widening valley the tops of the mountains beyond dropped nearer to the straight level of her eyes while beyond them vaster blue bulks became visible and ran on and on as they always seemed
3843-176666-0054	train-other-500	to the farthest limits of the world Even out there Hale had told her she would go some day The last curving up sweep came finally and there stood the big Pine majestic unchanged
3843-176666-0055	train-other-500	and murmuring in the wind like the undertone of a far off sea As they passed the base of it she reached out her hand and let the tips of her fingers brush caressingly across its trunk turned quickly
none	none	 for a last look at the sunlit valley and the hills of the outer world 
3843-176666-0056	train-other-500	and then the two passed into a green gloom of shadow and thick leaves that shut her heart in as suddenly as though some human hand had clutched it She was going home to see Bub and Loretta and Uncle Billy and old honorable
3843-176666-0057	train-other-500	and her step mother and Dave and yet she felt vaguely troubled The valley on the other side was in dazzling sunshine she had seen that The sun must still be shining over there it must be shining above her over here
none	none	 for here and there shot a sunbeam message from that outer world down through the leaves and yet it seemed that black night had suddenly fallen about her and helplessly she wondered about it all with her hands gripped tight and her eyes wide 
3843-176666-0058	train-other-500	But the mood was gone when they emerged at the deadening on the last spur and she saw Lonesome Cove and the roof of her little home peacefully asleep in the same sun that shone on the valley over the mountain
3843-176666-0059	train-other-500	Colour came to her face and her heart beat faster At the foot of the spur the road had been widened and showed signs of heavy hauling There was sawdust in the mouth of the creek and from coal dust the water was black
3843-176666-0060	train-other-500	The ring of axes and the shouts of ox drivers came from the mountain side Up the creek above her father s cabin three or four houses were being built of fresh boards and there in front of her was a new store
3843-176666-0061	train-other-500	To a fence one side of it two horses were hitched and on one horse was a side saddle Before the door stood the Red Fox and Uncle Billy the miller who peered at her for a moment through his big spectacles
3843-176666-0062	train-other-500	and gave her a wondering shout of welcome that brought her cousin Loretta to the door
none	none	 where she stopped a moment anchored with surprise Over her shoulder peered her cousin Dave 
3843-176666-0063	train-other-500	and June saw his face darken while she looked Why Honey said the old miller have ye really come home agin While Loretta simply said My Lord and came out and stood with her hands on her hips looking at June
3843-176666-0064	train-other-500	Why ye ain t a bit changed I knowed ye wasn t goin to put on no airs like Dave thar said she turned on Dave who with a surly shrug wheeled and went back into the store Uncle Billy was going home Come down to see us right away now he called back
none	none	 Ole honorable s might nigh crazy to git her eyes on ye 
3843-176666-0065	train-other-500	All right Uncle Billy said June early termorrer The Red Fox did not open his lips but his pale eyes searched the girl from head to foot Git down June said Loretta and I ll walk up to the house with ye
3843-176666-0066	train-other-500	June slid down Devil Judd started the old horse and as the two girls with their arms about each other s waists followed the wolfish side of the Red Fox s face lifted in an ironical snarl
3843-176666-0067	train-other-500	Bub was standing at the gate and when he saw his father riding home alone his wistful eyes filled and his cry of disappointment brought the step mother to the door Whar s June he cried and June heard him
3843-176666-0068	train-other-500	and loosening herself from Loretta she ran round the horse and had Bub in her arms Then she looked up into the eyes of her step mother The old woman s face looked kind so kind
3843-176666-0069	train-other-500	that for the first time in her life June did what her father could never get her to do she called her Mammy and then she gave that old woman the surprise of her life she kissed her Right away she must see everything and Bub in ecstasy
3843-176666-0070	train-other-500	wanted to pilot her around to see the new calf and the new pigs and the new chickens but dumbly June looked to a miracle that had come to pass to the left of the cabin
none	none	 a flower garden the like of which she had seen only in her dreams XVII Twice her lips opened soundlessly and dazed she could only point dumbly The old step mother laughed Jack Hale done that He pestered yo pap to let him do it fer ye an anything Jack Hale wants from yo pap he gits I thought hit was plum foolishness but he s got things to eat planted thar too an I declar hit s right purty That wonderful garden June started for it on a run There was a broad grass walk down through the middle of it and there were narrow grass walks running sidewise just as they did in the gardens which Hale told her he had seen in the outer world The flowers were planted in raised beds and all the ones that she had learned to know and love at the Gap were there and many more besides The hollyhocks bachelor s buttons and marigolds she had known all her life The lilacs touch me nots tulips and narcissus she had learned to know in gardens at the Gap Two rose bushes were in bloom and there were strange grasses and plants and flowers that Jack would tell her about when he came One side was sentinelled by sun flowers and another side by transplanted laurel and rhododendron shrubs and hidden in the plant and flower bordered squares were the vegetables that won her step mother s tolerance of Hale s plan Through and through June walked her dark eyes flashing joyously here and there when they were not a little dimmed with tears with Loretta following her unsympathetic in appreciation wondering that June should be making such a fuss about a lot of flowers but envious withal when she half guessed the reason and impatient Bub eager to show her other births and changes And over and over all the while June was whispering to herself My garden MY garden When she came back to the porch after a tour through all that was new or had changed Dave had brought his horse and Loretta s to the gate No he wouldn t come in and rest a spell they must be gittin along home he said shortly But old Judd Tolliver insisted that he should stay to dinner and Dave tied the horses to the fence and walked to the porch not lifting his eyes to June Straightway the girl went into the house company help her step mother with dinner but the old woman told her she reckoned she needn t start in yit adding in the querulous tone June knew so well I ve been mighty po ly an thar ll be a mighty lot fer you to do now So with this direful prophecy in her ears the girl hesitated The old woman looked at her closely Ye ain t a bit changed she said They were the words Loretta had used and in the voice of each was the same strange tone of disappointment June wondered were they sorry she had not come back putting on airs and fussed up with ribbons and feathers that they might hear her picked to pieces and perhaps do some of the picking themselves Not Loretta surely but the old step mother June left the kitchen and sat down just inside the door The Red Fox and two other men had sauntered up from the store and all were listening to his quavering chat I seed a vision last night and thar s trouble a comin in these mountains The Lord told me so straight from the clouds These railroads and coal mines is a goin to raise taxes so that a pore man ll have to sell his hogs and his corn to pay em an have nothin left to keep him from starvin to death Them police fellers over thar at the Gap is a stirrin up strife and a runnin things over thar as though the earth was made fer em an the citizens ain t goin to stand it An this war s a comin on an thar ll be shootin an killin over thar an over hyeh I seed all this devilment in a vision last night as shore as I m settin hyeh Old Judd grunted shifted his huge shoulders parted his mustache and beard with two fingers and spat through them Well I reckon you didn t see no devilment Red that you won t take a hand in if it comes The other men laughed but the Red Fox looked meek and lowly I m a servant of the Lord He says do this an I does it the best I know how I goes about a preachin the word in the wilderness an a healin the sick with soothin yarbs and sech An a makin compacts with the devil said old Judd shortly when the eye of man is a lookin t other way The left side of the Red Fox s face twitched into the faintest shadow of a snarl but shaking his head he kept still Well said Sam Barth who was thin and long and sandy I don t keer what them fellers do on t other side o the mountain but what air they a comin over here fer Old Judd spoke again To give you a job if you wasn t too durned lazy to work Yes said the other man who was dark swarthy and whose black eyebrows met across the bridge of his nose and that damned Hale who s a tearin up Hellfire here in the cove The old man lifted his eyes Young Dave s face wore a sudden malignant sympathy which made June clench her hands a little more tightly What about him You must have been over to the Gap lately like Dave thar did you git board in the calaboose It was a random thrust but it was accurate and it went home and there was silence for a while Presently old Judd went on Taxes hain t goin to be raised and if they are folks will be better able to pay em Them police fellers at the Gap don t bother nobody if he behaves himself This war will start when it does start an as for Hale he s as square an clever a feller as I ve ever seed His word is just as good as his bond I m a goin to sell him this land It ll be his n an he can do what he wants to with it I m his friend and I m goin to stay his friend as long as he goes on as he s goin now an I m not goin to see him bothered as long as he tends to his own business The words fell slowly and the weight of them rested heavily on all except on June Her fingers loosened and she smiled The Red Fox rose shaking his head All right Judd Tolliver he said warningly Come in and git something to eat Red No he said I ll be gittin along and he went still shaking his head The table was covered with an oil cloth spotted with drippings from a candle The plates and cups were thick and the spoons were of pewter The bread was soggy and the bacon was thick and floating in grease The men ate and the women served as in ancient days They gobbled their food like wolves and when they drank their coffee the noise they made was painful to June s ears There were no napkins and when her father pushed his chair back he wiped his dripping mouth with the back of his sleeve And Loretta and the step mother they too ate with their knives and used their fingers Poor June quivered with a vague newborn disgust Ah had she not changed in ways they could not see June helped clear away the dishes the old woman did not object to that listening to the gossip of the mountains courtships marriages births deaths the growing hostility in the feud the random killing of this man or that Hale s doings in Lonesome Cove He s comin over hyeh agin next Saturday said the old woman Is he said Loretta in a way that made June turn sharply from her dishes toward her She knew Hale was not coming but she said nothing The old woman was lighting her pipe Yes you better be over hyeh in yo best bib and tucker Pshaw said Loretta but June saw two bright spots come into her pretty cheeks and she herself burned inwardly The old woman was looking at her Pears like you air mighty quiet June That s so said Loretta looking at her too June still silent turned back to her dishes They were beginning to take notice after all for the girl hardly knew that she had not opened her lips Once only Dave spoke to her and that was when Loretta said she must go June was out in the porch looking at the already beloved garden and hearing his step she turned He looked her steadily in the eyes She saw his gaze drop to the fairy stone at her throat and a faint sneer appeared at his set mouth a sneer for June s folly and what he thought was uppishness in furriners like Hale So you ain t good enough fer him jest as ye air air ye he said slowly He s got to make ye all over agin so s you ll be fitten fer him He turned away without looking to see how deep his barbed shaft went and startled June flushed to her hair In a few minutes they were gone Dave without the exchange of another word with June and Loretta with a parting cry that she would come back on Saturday The old man went to the cornfield high above the cabin the old woman groaning with pains real and fancied lay down on a creaking bed and June with Dave s wound rankling went out with Bub to see the new doings in Lonesome Cove The geese cackled before her the hog fish darted like submarine arrows from rock to rock and the willows bent in the same wistful way toward their shadows in the little stream but its crystal depths were there no longer floating sawdust whirled in eddies on the surface and the water was black as soot Here and there the white belly of a fish lay upturned to the sun for the cruel deadly work of civilization had already begun Farther up the creek was a buzzing monster that creaking and snorting sent a flashing disk rimmed with sharp teeth biting a savage way through a log that screamed with pain as the brutal thing tore through its vitals and gave up its life each time with a ghost like cry of agony Farther on little houses were being built of fresh boards and farther on the water of the creek got blacker still June suddenly clutched Bud s arms Two demons had appeared on a pile of fresh dirt above them sooty begrimed with black faces and black hands and in the cap of each was a smoking little lamp Huh said Bub that ain t nothin Hello Bill he called bravely Hello Bub answered one of the two demons and both stared at the lovely little apparition who was staring with such naive horror at them It was all very wonderful though and it was all happening in Lonesome Cove but Jack Hale was doing it all and therefore it was all right thought June no matter what Dave said Moreover the ugly spot on the great beautiful breast of the Mother was such a little one after all and June had no idea how it must spread Above the opening for the mines the creek was crystal clear as ever the great hills were the same and the sky and the clouds and the cabin and the fields of corn Nothing could happen to them but if even they were wiped out by Hale s hand she would have made no complaint A wood thrush flitted from a ravine as she and Bub went back down the creek and she stopped with uplifted face to listen All her life she had loved its song and this was the first time she had heard it in Lonesome Cove since she had learned its name from Hale She had never heard it thereafter without thinking of him and she thought of him now while it was breathing out the very spirit of the hills and she drew a long sigh for already she was lonely and hungering for him The song ceased and a long wavering cry came from the cabin So o o cow S o o kee S o o kee The old mother was calling the cows It was near milking time and with a vague uneasiness she hurried Bub home She saw her father coming down from the cornfield She saw the two cows come from the woods into the path that led to the barn switching their tails and snatching mouthfuls from the bushes as they swung down the hill and when she reached the gate her step mother was standing on the porch with one hand on her hip and the other shading her eyes from the slanting sun waiting for her Already kindness and consideration were gone Whar you been June Hurry up now You ve had a long restin spell while I ve been a workin myself to death It was the old tone and the old fierce rebellion rose within June but Hale had told her to be patient She could not check the flash from her eyes but she shut her lips tight on the answer that sprang to them and without a word she went to the kitchen for the milking pails The cows had forgotten her They eyed her with suspicion and were restive The first one kicked at her when she put her beautiful head against its soft flank Her muscles had been in disuse and her hands were cramped and her forearms ached before she was through but she kept doggedly at her task When she finished her father had fed the horses and was standing behind her Hit s mighty good to have you back agin little gal It was not often that he smiled or showed tenderness much less spoke it thus openly and June was doubly glad that she had held her tongue Then she helped her step mother get supper The fire scorched her face that had grown unaccustomed to such heat and she burned one hand but she did not let her step mother see even that Again she noticed with aversion the heavy thick dishes and the pewter spoons and the candle grease on the oil cloth and she put the dishes down and while the old woman was out of the room attacked the spots viciously Again she saw her father and Bub ravenously gobbling their coarse food while she and her step mother served and waited and she began to wonder The women sat at the table with the men over in the Gap why not here Then her father went silently to his pipe and Bub to playing with the kitten at the kitchen door while she and her mother ate with never a word Something began to stifle her but she choked it down There were the dishes to be cleared away and washed and the pans and kettles to be cleaned Her back ached her arms were tired to the shoulders and her burned hand quivered with pain when all was done The old woman had left her to do the last few little things alone and had gone to her pipe Both she and her father were sitting in silence on the porch when June went out there Neither spoke to each other nor to her and both seemed to be part of the awful stillness that engulfed the world Bub fell asleep in the soft air and June sat and sat and sat That was all except for the stars that came out over the mountains and were slowly being sprayed over the sky and the pipings of frogs from the little creek Once the wind came with a sudden sweep up the river and she thought she could hear the creak of Uncle Billy s water wheel It smote her with sudden gladness not so much because it was a relief and because she loved the old miller but such is the power of association because she now loved the mill more loved it because the mill over in the Gap had made her think more of the mill at the mouth of Lonesome Cove A tapping vibrated through the railing of the porch on which her cheek lay Her father was knocking the ashes from his pipe A similar tapping sounded inside at the fireplace The old woman had gone and Bub was in bed and she had heard neither move The old man rose with a yawn Time to lay down June The girl rose They all slept in one room She did not dare to put on her night gown her mother would see it in the morning So she slipped off her dress as she had done all her life and crawled into bed with Bub who lay in the middle of it and who grunted peevishly when she pushed him with some difficulty over to his side There were no sheets not even one and the coarse blankets which had a close acrid odour that she had never noticed before seemed almost to scratch her flesh She had hardly been to bed that early since she had left home and she lay sleepless watching the firelight play hide and seek with the shadows among the aged smoky rafters and flicker over the strings of dried things that hung from the ceiling In the other corner her father and stepmother snored heartily and Bub beside her was in a nerveless slumber that would not come to her that night tired and aching as she was So quietly by and by she slipped out of bed and out the door to the porch The moon was rising and the radiant sheen of it had dropped down over the mountain side like a golden veil and was lighting up the white rising mists that trailed the curves of the river It sank below the still crests of the pines beyond the garden and dropped on until it illumined one by one the dewy heads of the flowers She rose and walked down the grassy path in her bare feet through the silent fragrant emblems of the planter s thought of her touching this flower and that with the tips of her fingers And when she went back she bent to kiss one lovely rose and as she lifted her head with a start of fear the dew from it shining on her lips made her red mouth as flower like and no less beautiful A yell had shattered the quiet of the world not the high fox hunting yell of the mountains but something new and strange Up the creek were strange lights A loud laugh shattered the succeeding stillness a laugh she had never heard before in Lonesome Cove Swiftly she ran back to the porch Surely strange things were happening there A strange spirit pervaded the Cove and the very air throbbed with premonitions What was the matter with everything what was the matter with her She knew that she was lonely and that she wanted Hale but what else was it She shivered and not alone from the chill night air and puzzled and wondering and stricken at heart she crept back to bed XVIII Pausing at the Pine to let his big black horse blow a while Hale mounted and rode slowly down the green and gold gloom of the ravine In his pocket was a quaint little letter from June to John Hail thanking him for the beautiful garden saying she was lonely and wanting him to come soon From the low flank of the mountain he stopped looking down on the cabin in Lonesome Cove It was a dreaming summer day Trees air blue sky and white cloud were all in a dream and even the smoke lazing from the chimney seemed drifting away like the spirit of something human that cared little whither it might be borne Something crimson emerged from the door and stopped in indecision on the steps of the porch It moved again stopped at the corner of the house and then moving on with a purpose stopped once more and began to flicker slowly to and fro like a flame June was working in her garden Hale thought he would halloo to her and then he decided to surprise her and he went on down hitched his horse and stole up to the garden fence On the way he pulled up a bunch of weeds by the roots and with them in his arms he noiselessly climbed the fence June neither heard nor saw him Her underlip was clenched tight between her teeth the little cross swung violently at her throat and she was so savagely wielding the light hoe he had given her that he thought at first she must be killing a snake but she was only fighting to death every weed that dared to show its head Her feet and her head were bare her face was moist and flushed and her hair was a tumbled heap of what was to him the rarest gold under the sun The wind was still the leaves were heavy with the richness of full growth bees were busy about June s head and not another soul was in sight Good morning little girl he called cheerily The hoe was arrested at the height of a vicious stroke and the little girl whirled without a cry but the blood from her pumping heart crimsoned her face and made her eyes shine with gladness Her eyes went to her feet and her hands to her hair You oughtn t to slip up an s startle a lady that a way she said with grave rebuke and Hale looked humbled Now you just set there and wait till I come back No no I want you to stay just as you are Honest Hale gravely crossed heart and body and June gave out a happy little laugh for he had caught that gesture a favourite one from her Then suddenly How long She was thinking of what Dave said but the subtle twist in her meaning passed Hale by He raised his eyes to the sun and June shook her head You got to go home fore sundown She dropped her hoe and came over toward him Whut you doin with them those weeds Going to plant em in our garden Hale had got a theory from a garden book that the humble burdock pig weed and other lowly plants were good for ornamental effect and he wanted to experiment but June gave a shrill whoop and fell to scornful laughter Then she snatched the weeds from him and threw them over the fence Why June Not in MY garden Them s stagger weeds they kill cows and she went off again I reckon you better c consult me bout weeds next time I don t know much bout flowers but I ve knowed all my life bout WEEDS She laid so much emphasis on the word that Hale wondered for the moment if her words had a deeper meaning but she went on Ever spring I have to watch the cows fer two weeks to keep em from eatin those weeds Her self corrections were always made gravely now and Hale consciously ignored them except when he had something to tell her that she ought to know Everything it seemed she wanted to know Do they really kill cows June snapped her fingers Like that But you just come on here she added with pretty imperiousness I want to axe ask you some things what s that Scarlet sage Scarlet sage repeated June An that Nasturtium and that s Oriental grass Nas tur tium Oriental An what s that vine That comes from North Africa they call it matrimonial vine Whut fer asked June quickly Because it clings so Hale smiled but June saw none of his humour the married people she knew clung till the finger of death unclasped them She pointed to a bunch of tall tropical looking plants with great spreading leaves and big green white stalks They re called Palmae Christi Whut That s Latin It means Hands of Christ said Hale with reverence You see how the leaves are spread out don t they look like hands Not much said June frankly What s Latin Oh that s a dead language that some people used a long long time ago What do folks use it nowadays fer Why don t they just say Hands o Christ I don t know he said helplessly but maybe you ll study Latin some of these days June shook her head Gettin YOUR language is a big enough job fer me she said with such quaint seriousness that Hale could not laugh She looked up suddenly You been a long time git gettin over here Yes and now you want to send me home before sundown I m afeer I m afraid for you Have you got a gun Hale tapped his breast pocket Always What are you afraid of The Falins She clenched her hands I d like to SEE one o them Falins tech ye she added fiercely and then she gave a quick look at the sun You better go now Jack I m afraid fer you Where s your horse Hale waved his hand Down there All right little girl he said I ought to go anyway And to humour her he started for the gate There he bent to kiss her but she drew back I m afraid of Dave she said but she leaned on the gate and looked long at him with wistful eyes Jack she said and her eyes swam suddenly it ll most kill me but I reckon you better not come over here much Hale made light of it all Nonsense I m coming just as often as I can June smiled then All right I ll watch out fer ye He went down the path her eyes following him and when he looked back from the spur he saw her sitting in the porch and watching that she might wave him farewell Hale could not go over to Lonesome Cove much that summer for he was away from the mountains a good part of the time and it was a weary racking summer for June when he was not there The step mother was a stern taskmistress and the girl worked hard but no night passed that she did not spend an hour or more on her books and by degrees she bribed and stormed Bub into learning his A B C s and digging at a blue back spelling book But all through the day there were times when she could play with the boy in the garden and every afternoon when it was not raining she would slip away to a little ravine behind the cabin where a log had fallen across a little brook and there in the cool sun pierced shadows she would study read and dream with the water bubbling underneath and wood thrushes singing overhead For Hale kept her well supplied with books He had given her children s books at first but she outgrew them when the first love story fell into her hands and then he gave her novels good old ones and the best of the new ones and they were to her what water is to a thing athirst But the happy days were when Hale was there She had a thousand questions for him to answer whenever he came about birds trees and flowers and the things she read in her books The words she could not understand in them she marked so that she could ask their meaning and it was amazing how her vocabulary increased Moreover she was always trying to use the new words she learned and her speech was thus a quaint mixture of vernacular self corrections and unexpected words Happening once to have a volume of Keats in his pocket he read some of it to her and while she could not understand the music of the lines fascinated her and she had him leave that with her too She never tired hearing him tell of the places where he had been and the people he knew and the music and plays he had heard and seen And when he told her that she too should see all those wonderful things some day her deep eyes took fire and she dropped her head far back between her shoulders and looked long at the stars that held but little more wonder for her than the world of which he told But each time he was there she grew noticeably shyer with him and never once was the love theme between them taken up in open words Hale was reluctant if only because she was still such a child and if he took her hand or put his own on her wonderful head or his arm around her as they stood in the garden under the stars he did it as to a child though the leap in her eyes and the quickening of his own heart told him the lie that he was acting rightly to her and to himself And no more now were there any breaking downs within her there was only a calm faith that staggered him and gave him an ever mounting sense of his responsibility for whatever might through the part he had taken in moulding her life be in store for her When he was not there life grew a little easier for her in time because of her dreams the patience that was built from them and Hale s kindly words the comfort of her garden and her books and the blessed force of habit For as time went on she got consciously used to the rough life the coarse food and the rude ways of her own people and her own home And though she relaxed not a bit in her own dainty cleanliness the shrinking that she felt when she first arrived home came to her at longer and longer intervals Once a week she went down to Uncle Billy s where she watched the water wheel dripping sun jewels into the sluice the kingfisher darting like a blue bolt upon his prey and listening to the lullaby that the water played to the sleepy old mill and stopping both ways to gossip with old honorable in her porch under the honeysuckle vines Uncle Billy saw the change in her and he grew vaguely uneasy about her she dreamed so much she was at times so restless she asked so many questions he could not answer and she failed to ask so many that were on the tip of her tongue He saw that while her body was at home her thoughts rarely were and it all haunted him with a vague sense that he was losing her But old honorable laughed at him and told him he was an old fool and to git another pair o specs and maybe he could see that the little gal was in love This startled Uncle Billy for he was so like a father to June that he was as slow as a father in recognizing that his child has grown to such absurd maturity But looking back to the beginning how the little girl had talked of the furriner who had come into Lonesome Cove all during the six months he was gone how gladly she had gone away to the Gap to school how anxious she was to go still farther away again and remembering all the strange questions she asked him about things in the outside world of which he knew nothing Uncle Billy shook his head in confirmation of his own conclusion and with all his soul he wondered about Hale what kind of a man he was and what his purpose was with June and of every man who passed his mill he never failed to ask if he knew that ar man Hale and what he knew All he had heard had been in Hale s favour except from young Dave Tolliver the Red Fox or from any Falin of the crowd which Hale had prevented from capturing Dave Their statements bothered him especially the Red Fox s evil hints and insinuations about Hale s purposes one day at the mill The miller thought of them all the afternoon and all the way home and when he sat down at his fire his eyes very naturally and simply rose to his old rifle over the door and then he laughed to himself so loudly that old honorable heard him Air you goin crazy Billy she asked Whut you studyin bout Nothin I was jest a thinkin Devil Judd wouldn t leave a grease spot of him You AIR goin crazy who s him Uh nobody said Uncle Billy and old honorable turned with a shrug of her shoulders she was tired of all this talk about the feud All that summer young Dave Tolliver hung around Lonesome Cove He would sit for hours in Devil Judd s cabin rarely saying anything to June or to anybody though the girl felt that she hardly made a move that he did not see and while he disappeared when Hale came after a surly grunt of acknowledgment to Hale s cheerful greeting his perpetual espionage began to anger June Never however did he put himself into words until Hale s last visit when the summer had waned and it was nearly time for June to go away again to school As usual Dave had left the house when Hale came and an hour after Hale was gone she went to the little ravine with a book in her hand and there the boy was sitting on her log his elbows dug into his legs midway between thigh and knee his chin in his hands his slouched hat over his black eyes every line of him picturing angry sullen dejection She would have slipped away but he heard her and lifted his head and stared at her without speaking Then he slowly got off the log and sat down on a moss covered stone Scuse me he said with elaborate sarcasm This bein yo school house over hyeh an me not bein a scholar I reckon I m in your way How do you happen to know hit s my school house asked June quietly I ve seed you hyeh Jus as I s posed You an HIM Jus as I s posed she repeated and a spot of red came into each cheek But we didn t see YOU Young Dave laughed Well everybody don t always see me when I m seein them No she said unsteadily So you ve been sneakin around through the woods a spyin on me SNEAKIN AN SPYIN she repeated so searingly that Dave looked at the ground suddenly picked up a pebble confusedly and shot it in the water I had a mighty good reason he said doggedly Ef he d been up to some of his furrin tricks June stamped the ground Don t you think I kin take keer o myself No I don t I never seed a gal that could with one o them furriners Huh she said scornfully You seem to set a mighty big store by the decency of yo own kin Dave was silent He ain t up to no tricks An whut do you reckon Dad ud be doin while you was pertecting me Air ye goin away to school he asked suddenly June hesitated Well seein as hit s none o yo business I am Air ye goin to marry him He ain t axed me The boy s face turned red as a flame Ye air honest with me an now I m goin to be honest with you You hain t never goin to marry him Illustration You hain t never goin to marry him two hundred forty two Mebbe you think I m goin to marry YOU A mist of rage swept before the lad s eyes so that he could hardly see but he repeated steadily You hain t goin to marry HIM June looked at the boy long and steadily but his black eyes never wavered she knew what he meant An he kept the Falins from killin you she said quivering with indignation at the shame of him but Dave went on unheeding You pore little fool Do ye reckon as how he s EVER goin to axe ye to marry him Whut s he sendin you away fer Because you hain t good enough fer him Whar s yo pride You hain t good enough fer him he repeated scathingly June had grown calm now I know it she said quietly but I m goin to try to be Dave rose then in impotent fury and pointed one finger at her His black eyes gleamed like a demon s and his voice was hoarse with resolution and rage but it was Tolliver against Tolliver now and June answered him with contemptuous fearlessness YOU HAIN T NEVER GOIN TO MARRY HIM An he kept the Falins from killin ye Yes he retorted savagely at last an I kept the Falins from killin HIM and he stalked away leaving June blanched and wondering It was true Only an hour before as Hale turned up the mountain that very afternoon at the mouth of Lonesome Cove young Dave had called to him from the bushes and stepped into the road You air goin to court Monday he said Yes said Hale Well you better take another road this time he said quietly Three o the Falins will be waitin in the lorrel somewhar on the road to lay way ye Hale was dumfounded but he knew the boy spoke the truth Look here he said impulsively I ve got nothing against you and I hope you ve got nothing against me I m much obliged let s shake hands The boy turned sullenly away with a dogged shake of his head I was beholden to you he said with dignity an I warned you bout them Falins to git even with you We re quits now Hale started to speak to say that the lad was not beholden to him that he would as quickly have protected a Falin but it would have only made matters worse Moreover he knew precisely what Dave had against him and that too was no matter for discussion So he said simply and sincerely I m sorry we can t be friends No Dave gritted out not this side o Heaven or Hell XIX And still farther into that far silence about which she used to dream at the base of the big Pine went little June At dusk weary and travel stained she sat in the parlours of a hotel a great gray columned structure of stone She was confused and bewildered and her head ached The journey had been long and tiresome The swift motion of the train had made her dizzy and faint The dust and smoke had almost stifled her and even now the dismal parlours rich and wonderful as they were to her unaccustomed eyes oppressed her deeply If she could have one more breath of mountain air The day had been too full of wonders Impressions had crowded on her sensitive brain so thick and fast that the recollection of them was as through a haze She had never been on a train before and when as it crashed ahead she clutched Hale s arm in fear and asked how they stopped it Hale hearing the whistle blow for a station said I ll show you and he waved one hand out the window And he repeated this trick twice before she saw that it was a joke All day he had soothed her uneasiness in some such way and all day he watched her with an amused smile that was puzzling to her She remembered sadly watching the mountains dwindle and disappear and when several of her own people who were on the train were left at way stations it seemed as though all links that bound her to her home were broken The face of the country changed the people changed in looks manners and dress and she shrank closer to Hale with an increasing sense of painful loneliness These level fields and these farm houses so strangely built so varied in colour were the settlemints and these people so nicely dressed so clean and fresh looking were furriners At one station a crowd of school girls had got on board and she had watched them with keen interest mystified by their incessant chatter and gayety And at last had come the big city with more smoke more dust more noise more confusion and she was in HIS world That was the thought that comforted her it was his world and now she sat alone in the dismal parlours while Hale was gone to find his sister waiting and trembling at the ordeal close upon her of meeting Helen Hale Below Hale found his sister and her maid registered and a few minutes later he led Miss Hale into the parlour As they entered June rose without advancing and for a moment the two stood facing each other the still roughly clad primitive mountain girl and the exquisite modern woman in an embarrassment equally painful to both June this is my sister At a loss what to do Helen Hale simply stretched out her hand but drawn by June s timidity and the quick admiration and fear in her eyes she leaned suddenly forward and kissed her A grateful flush overspread the little girl s features and the pallor that instantly succeeded went straight way to the sister s heart You are not well she said quickly and kindly You must go to your room at once I am going to take care of you you are MY little sister now June lost the subtlety in Miss Hale s emphasis but she fell with instant submission under such gentle authority and though she could say nothing her eyes glistened and her lips quivered and without looking to Hale she followed his sister out of the room Hale stood still He had watched the meeting with apprehension and now surprised and grateful he went to Helen s parlour and waited with a hopeful heart When his sister entered he rose eagerly Well he said stopping suddenly for there were tears of vexation dismay and genuine distress on his sister s face Oh Jack she cried how could you How could you Hale bit his lips turned and paced the room He had hoped too much and yet what else could he have expected His sister and June knew as little about each other and each other s lives as though they had occupied different planets He had forgotten that Helen must be shocked by June s inaccuracies of speech and in a hundred other ways to which he had become accustomed With him moreover the process had been gradual and moreover he had seen beneath it all And yet he had foolishly expected Helen to understand everything at once He was unjust so very wisely he held himself in silence Where is her baggage Jack Helen had opened her trunk and was lifting out the lid She ought to change those dusty clothes at once You d better ring and have it sent right up No said Hale I will go down and see about it myself He returned presently his face aflame with June s carpet bag I believe this is all she has he said quietly In spite of herself Helen s grief changed to a fit of helpless laughter and afraid to trust himself further Hale rose to leave the room At the door he was met by the negro maid Miss Helen she said with an open smile Miss June say she don t want NUTTIN Hale gave her a fiery look and hurried out June was seated at a window when he went into her room with her face buried in her arms She lifted her head dropped it and he saw that her eyes were red with weeping Are you sick little girl he asked anxiously June shook her head helplessly You aren t homesick are you No The answer came very faintly Don t you like my sister The head bowed an emphatic Yes yes Then what is the matter Oh she said despairingly between her sobs she won t like me I never can be like HER Hale smiled but her grief was so sincere that he leaned over her and with a tender hand soothed her into quiet Then he went to Helen again and he found her overhauling dresses I brought along several things of different sizes and I am going to try at any rate Oh she added hastily only of course until she can get some clothes of her own Sure said Hale but His sister waved one hand and again Hale kept still June had bathed her eyes and was lying down when Helen entered and she made not the slightest objection to anything the latter proposed Straightway she fell under as complete subjection to her as she had done to Hale Without a moment s hesitation she drew off her rudely fashioned dress and stood before Helen with the utmost simplicity her beautiful arms and throat bare and her hair falling about them with the rich gold of a cloud at an autumn sunset Dressed she could hardly breathe but when she looked at herself in the mirror she trembled Magic transformation Apparently the chasm between the two had been bridged in a single instant Helen herself was astonished and again her heart warmed toward the girl when a little later she stood timidly under Hale s scrutiny eagerly watching his face and flushing rosy with happiness under his brightening look Her brother had not exaggerated the little girl was really beautiful When they went down to the dining room there was another surprise for Helen Hale for June s timidity was gone and to the wonder of the woman she was clothed with an impassive reserve that in herself would have been little less than haughtiness and was astounding in a child She saw too that the change in the girl s bearing was unconscious and that the presence of strangers had caused it It was plain that June s timidity sprang from her love of Hale her fear of not pleasing him and not pleasing her his sister and plain too that remarkable self poise was little June s to command At the table June kept her eyes fastened on Helen Hale Not a movement escaped her and she did nothing that was not done by one of the others first She said nothing but if she had to answer a question she spoke with such care and precision that she almost seemed to be using a foreign language Miss Hale smiled but with inward approval and that night she was in better spirits Jack she said when he came to bid her good night I think we d better stay here a few days I thought of course you were exaggerating but she is very very lovely And that manner of hers well it passes my understanding Just leave everything to me Hale was very willing to do that He had all trust in his sister s judgment he knew her dislike of interference her love of autocratic supervision so he asked no questions but in grateful relief kissed her good night The sister sat for a long time at her window after he was gone Her brother had been long away from civilization he had become infatuated the girl loved him he was honourable and in his heart he meant to marry her that was to her the whole story She had been mortified by the misstep but the misstep made only one thought had occurred to her to help him all she could She had been appalled when she first saw the dusty shrinking mountain girl but the helplessness and the loneliness of the tired little face touched her and she was straightway responsive to the mute appeal in the dark eyes that were lifted to her own with such modest fear and wonder Now her surprise at her brother s infatuation was abating rapidly The girl s adoration of him her wild beauty her strange winning personality as rare and as independent of birth and circumstances as genius had soon made that phenomenon plain And now what was to be done The girl was quick observant imitative docile and in the presence of strangers her gravity of manner gave the impression of uncanny self possession It really seemed as though anything might be possible At Helen s suggestion then the three stayed where they were for a week for June s wardrobe was sadly in need of attention So the week was spent in shopping driving and walking and rapidly as it passed for Helen and Hale it was to June the longest of her life so filled was it with a thousand sensations unfelt by them The city had been stirred by the spirit of the new South but the charm of the old was distinct everywhere Architectural eccentricities had startled the sleepy maple shaded rows of comfortable uniform dwellings here and there and in some streets the life was brisk but it was still possible to see pedestrians strolling with unconscious good humour around piles of goods on the sidewalk business men stopping for a social chat on the streets street cars moving independent of time men invariably giving up their seats to women and strangers or not depositing their fare for them the drivers at the courteous personal service of each patron of the road now holding a car and placidly whistling while some lady who had signalled from her doorway went back indoors for some forgotten article now twisting the reins around the brakes and leaving a parcel in some yard and no one grumbling But what was to Hale an atmosphere of amusing leisure was to June bewildering confusion To her his amusement was unintelligible but though in constant wonder at everything she saw no one would ever have suspected that she was making her first acquaintance with city scenes At first the calm unconcern of her companions had puzzled her She could not understand how they could walk along heedless of the wonderful visions that beckoned to her from the shop windows fearless of the strange noises about them and scarcely noticing the great crowds of people or the strange shining vehicles that thronged the streets But she had quickly concluded that it was one of the demands of that new life to see little and be astonished at nothing and Helen and Hale surprised in turn at her unconcern little suspected the effort her self suppression cost her And when over some wonder she did lose herself Hale would say Just wait till you see New York and June would turn her dark eyes to Helen for confirmation and to see if Hale could be joking with her It s all true June Helen would say You must go there some day It s true But that town was enough and too much for June Her head buzzed continuously and she could hardly sleep and she was glad when one afternoon they took her into the country again the Bluegrass country and to the little town near which Hale had been born and which was a dream city to June and to a school of which an old friend of his mother was principal and in which Helen herself was a temporary teacher And Rumour had gone ahead of June Hale had found her dashing about the mountains on the back of a wild bull said rumour She was as beautiful as Europa was of pure English descent and spoke the language of Shakespeare the honorable Sam Budd s hand was patent in this She had saved Hale s life from moonshiners and while he was really in love with her he was pretending to educate her out of gratitude and here doubtless was the faint tracery of Miss Anne Saunder s natural suspicions And there Hale left her under the eye of his sister left her to absorb another new life like a thirsty plant and come back to the mountains to make his head swim with new witcheries XX The boom started after its shadow through the hills now and Hale watched it sweep toward him with grim satisfaction at the fulfilment of his own prophecy and with disgust that by the irony of fate it should come from the very quarters where years before he had played the maddening part of lunatic at large The avalanche was sweeping southward Pennsylvania was creeping down the Alleghanies emissaries of New York capital were pouring into the hills the tide water of Virginia and the Bluegrass region of Kentucky were sending in their best blood and youth and friends of the helmeted Englishmen were hurrying over the seas Eastern companies were taking up principalities and at Cumberland Gap those helmeted Englishmen had acquired a kingdom They were building a town there too with huge steel plants broad avenues and business blocks that would have graced Broadway and they were pouring out a million for every thousand that it would have cost Hale to acquire the land on which the work was going on Moreover they were doing it there as Hale heard because they were too late to get control of his gap through the Cumberland At his gap too the same movement was starting In stage and wagon on mule and horse riding and tying sometimes and even afoot came the rush of madmen Horses and mules were drowned in the mud holes along the road such was the traffic and such were the floods The incomers slept eight in a room burned oil at one dollar a gallon and ate potatoes at ten cents apiece The Grand Central Hotel was a humming Real Estate Exchange and night and day the occupants of any room could hear through the thin partitions lots booming to right left behind and in front of them The labour and capital question was instantly solved for everybody became a capitalist carpenter brick layer blacksmith singing teacher and preacher There is no difference between the shrewdest business man and a fool in a boom for the boom levels all grades of intelligence and produces as distinct a form of insanity as you can find within the walls of an asylum Lots took wings sky ward Hale bought one for June for thirty dollars and sold it for a thousand Before the autumn was gone he found himself on the way to ridiculous opulence and when spring came he had the world in a sling and if he wished he could toss it playfully at the sun and have it drop back into his hand again And the boom spread down the valley and into the hills The police guard had little to do and over in the mountains the feud miraculously came to a sudden close So pervasive indeed was the spirit of the times that the honorable Sam Budd actually got old Buck Falin and old Dave Tolliver to sign a truce agreeing to a complete cessation of hostilities until he carried through a land deal in which both were interested And after that was concluded nobody had time even the Red Fox for deviltry and private vengeance so busy was everybody picking up the manna which was dropping straight from the clouds Hale bought all of old Judd s land formed a stock company and in the trade gave June a bonus of the stock Money was plentiful as grains of sand and the cashier of the bank in the back of the furniture store at the Gap chuckled to his beardless directors as he locked the wooden door on the day before the great land sale Capital stock paid in thirteen thousand dollars Deposits three hundred thousand Loans two hundred and sixty thousand interest from eight to twelve per cent And beardless though those directors were that statement made them reel A club was formed and the like of it was not below Mason and Dixon s line in the way of furniture periodicals liquors and cigars Poker ceased it was too tame in competition with this new game of town lots On the top of High Knob a kingdom was bought The young bloods of the town would build a lake up there run a road up and build a Swiss chalet on the very top for a country club The booming editor was discharged A new paper was started and the ex editor of a New York Daily was got to run it If anybody wanted anything he got it from no matter where nor at what cost Nor were the arts wholly neglected One man who was proud of his voice thought he would like to take singing lessons An emissary was sent to Boston to bring back the best teacher he could find The teacher came with a method of placing the voice by trying to say Come at the base of the nose and between the eyes This was with the lips closed He charged two dollars per half hour for this effort he had each pupil try it twice for half an hour each day and for six weeks the town was humming like a beehive At the end of that period the teacher fell ill and went his way with a fat pocket book and not a warbling soul had got the chance to open his mouth The experience dampened nobody Generosity was limitless It was equally easy to raise money for a roulette wheel a cathedral or an expedition to Africa And even yet the railroad was miles away and even yet in February the Improvement Company had a great land sale The day before it competing purchasers had deposited cheques aggregating three times the sum asked for by the company for the land So the buyers spent the night organizing a pool to keep down competition and drawing lots for the privilege of bidding For fairness the sale was an auction and one old farmer who had sold some of the land originally for a hundred dollars an acre bought back some of that land at a thousand dollars a lot That sale was the climax and that early Hale got a warning word from England but he paid no heed even though after the sale the boom slackened poised and stayed still for optimism was unquenchable and another tide would come with another sale in May and so the spring passed in the same joyous recklessness and the same perfect hope In April the first railroad reached the Gap at last and families came in rapidly Money was still plentiful and right royally was it spent for was not just as much more coming when the second road arrived in May Life was easier too supplies came from New York eight o clock dinners were in vogue and everybody was happy Every man had two or three good horses and nothing to do The place was full of visiting girls They rode in parties to High Knob and the ring of hoof and the laughter of youth and maid made every dusk resonant with joy On Poplar Hill houses sprang up like magic and weddings came The passing stranger was stunned to find out in the wilderness such a spot gayety prodigal hospitality a police force of gentlemen nearly all of whom were college graduates and a club where poker flourished in the smoke of Havana cigars and a barrel of whiskey stood in one corner with a faucet waiting for the turn of any hand And still the foundation of the new hotel was not started and the coming of the new railroad in May did not make a marked change For some reason the May sale was postponed by the Improvement Company but what did it matter Perhaps it was better to wait for the fall and so the summer went on unchanged Every man still had a bank account and in the autumn the boom would come again At such a time June came home for her vacation and Bob Berkley came back from college for his All through the school year Hale had got the best reports of June His sister s letters were steadily encouraging June had been very homesick for the mountains and for Hale at first but the homesickness had quickly worn off apparently for both She had studied hard had become a favourite among the girls and had held her own among them in a surprising way But it was on June s musical talent that Hale s sister always laid most stress and on her voice which she said was really unusual June wrote too at longer and longer intervals and in her letters Hale could see the progress she was making the change in her handwriting the increasing formality of expression and the increasing shrewdness of her comments on her fellow pupils her teachers and the life about her She did not write home for a reason Hale knew though June never mentioned it because there was no one at home who could read her letters but she always sent messages to her father and Bub and to the old miller and old honorable and Hale faithfully delivered them when he could From her people as Hale learned from his sister only one messenger had come during the year to June and he came but once One morning a tall black haired uncouth young man in a slouch hat and a Prince Albert coat had strode up to the school with a big paper box under his arm and asked for June As he handed the box to the maid at the door it broke and red apples burst from it and rolled down the steps There was a shriek of laughter from the girls and the young man flushing red as the apples turned without giving his name and strode back with no little majesty looking neither to right nor left Hale knew and June knew that the visitor was her cousin Dave but she never mentioned the incident to him though as the end of the session drew nigh her letters became more frequent and more full of messages to the people in Lonesome Cove and she seemed eager to get back home Over there about this time old Judd concluded suddenly to go West taking Bud with him and when Hale wrote the fact an answer came from June that showed the blot of tears However she seemed none the less in a hurry to get back and when Hale met her at the station he was startled for she came back in dresses that were below her shoe tops with her wonderful hair massed in a golden glory on the top of her head and the little fairy cross dangling at a woman s throat Her figure had rounded her voice had softened She held herself as straight as a young poplar and she walked the earth as though she had come straight from Olympus And still in spite of her new feathers and airs and graces there was in her eye and in her laugh and in her moods all the subtle wild charm of the child in Lonesome Cove It was fairy time for June that summer though her father and Bud had gone West for her step mother was living with a sister the cabin in Lonesome Cove was closed and June stayed at the Gap not at the Widow Crane s boarding house but with one of Hale s married friends on Poplar Hill And always was she young as she was one of the merry parties of that happy summer even at the dances for the dance too June had learned Moreover she had picked up the guitar and many times when Hale had been out in the hills he would hear her silver clear voice floating out into the moonlight as he made his way toward Poplar Hill and he would stop under the beeches and listen with ears of growing love to the wonder of it all For it was he who was the ardent one of the two now June was no longer the frank impulsive child who stood at the foot of the beech doggedly reckless if all the world knew her love for him She had taken flight to some inner recess where it was difficult for Hale to follow and right puzzled he was to discover that he must now win again what unasked she had once so freely given Bob Berkley too had developed amazingly He no longer said Sir to Hale that was bad form at Harvard he called him by his first name and looked him in the eye as man to man just as June Hale observed no longer seemed in any awe of Miss Anne Saunders and to have lost all jealousy of her or of anybody else so swiftly had her instinct taught her she now had nothing to fear And Bob and June seemed mightily pleased with each other and sometimes Hale watching them as they galloped past him on horseback laughing and bantering felt foolish to think of their perfect fitness the one for the other and the incongruity of himself in a relationship that would so naturally be theirs At one thing he wondered she had made an extraordinary record at school and it seemed to him that it was partly through the consciousness that her brain would take care of itself that she could pay such heed to what hitherto she had had no chance to learn dress manners deportment and speech Indeed it was curious that she seemed to lay most stress on the very things to which he because of his long rough life in the mountains was growing more and more indifferent It was quite plain that Bob with his extreme gallantry of manner his smart clothes his high ways and his unconquerable gayety had supplanted him on the pedestal where he had been the year before just as somebody somewhere his sister perhaps had supplanted Miss Anne Several times indeed June had corrected Hale s slips of tongue with mischievous triumph and once when he came back late from a long trip in the mountains and walked in to dinner without changing his clothes Hale saw her look from himself to the immaculate Bob with an unconscious comparison that half amused half worried him The truth was he was building a lovely Frankenstein and from wondering what he was going to do with it he was beginning to wonder now what it might some day do with him And though he sometimes joked with Miss Anne who had withdrawn now to the level plane of friendship with him about the transformation that was going on he worried in a way that did neither his heart nor his brain good Still he fought both to little purpose all that summer and it was not till the time was nigh when June must go away again that he spoke both For Hale s sister was going to marry and it was her advice that he should take June to New York if only for the sake of her music and her voice That very day June had for the first time seen her cousin Dave He was on horseback he had been drinking and he pulled in and without an answer to her greeting stared her over from head to foot Colouring angrily she started on and then he spoke thickly and with a sneer Bout fryin size now ain t ye I reckon maybe if you keep on you ll be good enough fer him in a year or two more I m much obliged for those apples Dave said June quietly and Dave flushed a darker red and sat still forgetting to renew the old threat that was on his tongue But his taunt rankled in the girl rankled more now than when Dave first made it for she better saw the truth of it and the hurt was the greater to her unconquerable pride that kept her from betraying the hurt to Dave long ago and now when he was making an old wound bleed afresh But the pain was with her at dinner that night and through the evening She avoided Hale s eyes though she knew that he was watching her all the time and her instinct told her that something was going to happen that night and what that something was Hale was the last to go and when he called to her from the porch she went out trembling and stood at the head of the steps in the moonlight I love you little girl he said simply and I want you to marry me some day will you June She was unsurprised but she flushed under his hungry eyes and the little cross throbbed at her throat SOME day not NOW she thought and then with equal simplicity Yes Jack And if you should love somebody else more you ll tell me right away won t you June She shrank a little and her eyes fell but straight way she raised them steadily Yes Jack Thank you little girl good night Good night Jack Hale saw the little shrinking movement she made and as he went down the hill he thought she seemed to be in a hurry to be alone and that she had caught her breath sharply as she turned away And brooding he walked the woods long that night Only a few days later they started for New York and with all her dreaming June had never dreamed that the world could be so large Mountains and vast stretches of rolling hills and level land melted away from her wondering eyes towns and cities sank behind them swift streams swollen by freshets were outstripped and left behind darkness came on and through it they still sped on Once during the night she woke from a troubled dream in her berth and for a moment she thought she was at home again They were running through mountains again and there they lay in the moonlight the great calm dark faces that she knew and loved and she seemed to catch the odour of the earth and feel the cool air on her face but there was no pang of homesickness now she was too eager for the world into which she was going Next morning the air was cooler the skies lower and grayer the big city was close at hand Then came the water shaking and sparkling in the early light like a great cauldron of quicksilver and the wonderful Brooklyn Bridge a ribbon of twinkling lights tossed out through the mist from the mighty city that rose from that mist as from a fantastic dream then the picking of a way through screeching little boats and noiseless big ones and white bird like floating things and then they disappeared like two tiny grains in a shifting human tide of sand But Hale was happy now for on that trip June had come back to herself and to him once more and now awed but unafraid eager bubbling uplooking full of quaint questions about everything she saw she was once more sitting with affectionate reverence at his feet When he left her in a great low house that fronted on the majestic Hudson June clung to him with tears and of her own accord kissed him for the first time since she had torn her little playhouse to pieces at the foot of the beech down in the mountains far away And Hale went back with peace in his heart but to trouble in the hills Not suddenly did the boom drop down there not like a falling star but on the wings of hope wings that ever fluttering upward yet sank inexorably and slowly closed The first crash came over the waters when certain big men over there went to pieces men on whose shoulders rested the colossal figure of progress that the English were carving from the hills at Cumberland Gap Still nobody saw why a hurt to the Lion should make the Eagle sore and so the American spirit at the other gaps and all up the Virginia valleys that skirt the Cumberland held faithful and dauntless for a while But in time as the huge steel plants grew noiseless and the flaming throats of the furnaces were throttled a sympathetic fire of dissolution spread slowly North and South and it was plain only to the wise outsider as merely a matter of time until all up and down the Cumberland the fox and the coon and the quail could come back to their old homes on corner lots marked each by a pathetic little whitewashed post a tombstone over the graves of a myriad of buried human hopes But it was the gap where Hale was that died last and hardest and of the brave spirits there his was the last and hardest to die In the autumn while June was in New York the signs were sure but every soul refused to see them Slowly however the vexed question of labour and capital was born again for slowly each local capitalist went slowly back to his own trade the blacksmith to his forge but the carpenter not to his plane nor the mason to his brick there was no more building going on The engineer took up his transit the preacher politician was oftener in his pulpit and the singing teacher started on his round of raucous do mi sol dos through the mountains again It was curious to see how each man slowly reluctantly and perforce sank back again to his old occupation and the town with the luxuries of electricity water works bath tubs and a street railway was having a hard fight for the plain necessities of life The following spring notes for the second payment on the lots that had been bought at the great land sale fell due and but very few were paid As no suits were brought by the company however hope did not quite die June did not come home for the summer and Hale did not encourage her to come she visited some of her school mates in the North and took a trip West to see her father who had gone out there again and bought a farm In the early autumn Devil Judd came back to the mountains and announced his intention to leave them for good But that autumn the effects of the dead boom became perceptible in the hills There were no more coal lands bought logging ceased the factions were idle once more moonshine stills flourished quarrelling started and at the county seat one Court day Devil Judd whipped three Falins with his bare fists In the early spring a Tolliver was shot from ambush and old Judd was so furious at the outrage that he openly announced that he would stay at home until he had settled the old scores for good So that as the summer came on matters between the Falins and the Tollivers were worse than they had been for years and everybody knew that with old Judd at the head of his clan again the fight would be fought to the finish At the Gap one institution only had suffered in spirit not at all and that was the Volunteer Police Guard Indeed as the excitement of the boom had died down the members of that force as a vent for their energies went with more enthusiasm than ever into their work Local lawlessness had been subdued by this time the Guard had been extending its work into the hills and it was only a question of time until it must take a part in the Falin Tolliver troubles Indeed that time Hale believed was not far away for Election Day was at hand and always on that day the feudists came to the Gap in a search for trouble Meanwhile not long afterward there was a pitched battle between the factions at the county seat and several of each would fight no more Next day a Falin whistled a bullet through Devil Judd s beard from ambush and it was at such a crisis of all the warring elements in her mountain life that June s school days were coming to a close Hale had had a frank talk with old Judd and the old man agreed that the two had best be married at once and live at the Gap until things were quieter in the mountains though the old man still clung to his resolution to go West for good when he was done with the Falins At such a time then June was coming home XXI Hale was beyond Black Mountain when her letter reached him His work over there had to be finished and so he kept in his saddle the greater part of two days and nights and on the third day rode his big black horse forty miles in little more than half a day that he might meet her at the train The last two years had wrought their change in him Deterioration is easy in the hills superficial deterioration in habits manners personal appearance and the practices of all the little niceties of life The morning bath is impossible because of the crowded domestic conditions of a mountain cabin and if possible might if practised excite wonder and comment if not vague suspicion Sleeping garments are practically barred for the same reason Shaving becomes a rare luxury A lost tooth brush may not be replaced for a month In time one may bring himself to eat with a knife for the reason that it is hard for a hungry man to feed himself with a fork that has but two tines The finger tips cease to be the culminating standard of the gentleman It is hard to keep a supply of fresh linen when one is constantly in the saddle and a constant weariness of body and a ravenous appetite make a man indifferent to things like a bad bed and worse food particularly as he must philosophically put up with them anyhow Of all these things the man himself may be quite unconscious and yet they affect him more deeply than he knows and show to a woman even in his voice his walk his mouth everywhere save in his eyes which change only in severity or in kindliness or when there has been some serious break down of soul or character within And the woman will not look to his eyes for the truth which makes its way slowly particularly when the woman has striven for the very things that the man has so recklessly let go She would never suffer herself to let down in such a way and she does not understand how a man can Hale s life since his college doors had closed behind him had always been a rough one He had dropped from civilization and had gone back into it many times And each time he had dropped he dropped the deeper and for that reason had come back into his own life each time with more difficulty and with more indifference The last had been his roughest year and he had sunk a little more deeply just at the time when June had been pluming herself for flight from such depths forever Moreover Hale had been dominant in every matter that his hand or his brain had touched His habit had been to say do this and it was done Though he was no longer acting captain of the Police Guard he always acted as captain whenever he was on hand and always he was the undisputed leader in all questions of business politics or the maintenance of order and law The success he had forged had hardened and strengthened his mouth steeled his eyes and made him more masterful in manner speech and point of view and naturally had added nothing to his gentleness his unselfishness his refinement or the nice consideration of little things on which women lay such stress It was an hour by sun when he clattered through the gap and pushed his tired black horse into a gallop across the valley toward the town He saw the smoke of the little dummy and as he thundered over the bridge of the North Fork he saw that it was just about to pull out and he waved his hat and shouted imperiously for it to wait With his hand on the bell rope the conductor autocrat that he too was did wait and Hale threw his reins to the man who was nearest hardly seeing who he was and climbed aboard He wore a slouched hat spotted by contact with the roof of the mines which he had hastily visited on his way through Lonesome Cove The growth of three days beard was on his face He wore a gray woollen shirt and a blue handkerchief none too clean was loosely tied about his sun scorched column of a throat he was spotted with mud from his waist to the soles of his rough riding boots and his hands were rough and grimy But his eye was bright and keen and his heart thumped eagerly Again it was the middle of June and the town was a naked island in a sea of leaves whose breakers literally had run mountain high and stopped for all time motionless Purple lights thick as mist veiled Powell s Mountain Below the valley was still flooded with yellow sunlight which lay along the mountain sides and was streaked here and there with the long shadow of a deep ravine The beech trunks on Imboden Hill gleamed in it like white bodies scantily draped with green and the yawning Gap held the yellow light as a bowl holds wine He had long ago come to look upon the hills merely as storehouses for iron and coal put there for his special purpose but now the long submerged sense of the beauty of it all stirred within him again for June was the incarnate spirit of it all and June was coming back to those mountains and to him And June June had seen the change in Hale The first year he had come often to New York to see her and they had gone to the theatre and the opera and June was pleased to play the part of heroine in what was such a real romance to the other girls in school and she was proud of Hale But each time he came he seemed less interested in the diversions that meant so much to her more absorbed in his affairs in the mountains and less particular about his looks His visits came at longer intervals with each visit he stayed less long and each time he seemed more eager to get away She had been shy about appearing before him for the first time in evening dress and when he entered the drawing room she stood under a chandelier in blushing and resplendent confusion but he seemed not to recognize that he had never seen her that way before and for another reason June remained confused disappointed and hurt for he was not only unobserving and seemingly unappreciative but he was more silent than ever that night and he looked gloomy But if he had grown accustomed to her beauty there were others who had not and smart dapper college youths gathered about her like bees around a flower a triumphant fact to which he also seemed indifferent Moreover he was not in evening clothes that night and she did not know whether he had forgotten or was indifferent to them and the contrast that he was made her that night almost ashamed for him She never guessed what the matter was for Hale kept his troubles to himself He was always gentle and kind he was as lavish with her as though he were a king and she was as lavish and prodigally generous as though she were a princess There seemed no limit to the wizard income from the investments that Hale had made for her when as he said he sold a part of her stock in the Lonesome Cove mine and what she wanted Hale always sent her without question Only as the end was coming on at the Gap he wrote once to know if a certain amount would carry her through until she was ready to come home but even that question aroused no suspicion in thoughtless June And then that last year he had come no more always always he was too busy Not even on her triumphal night at the end of the session was he there when she had stood before the guests and patrons of the school like a goddess and had thrilled them into startling applause her teachers into open glowing pride the other girls into bright eyed envy and herself into still another new world Now she was going home and she was glad to go She had awakened that morning with the keen air of the mountains in her nostrils the air she had breathed in when she was born and her eyes shone happily when she saw through her window the loved blue hills along which raced the train They were only a little way from the town where she must change the porter said she had overslept and she had no time even to wash her face and hands and that worried her a good deal The porter nearly lost his equilibrium when she gave him half a dollar for women are not profuse in the way of tipping and instead of putting her bag down on the station platform he held it in his hand waiting to do her further service At the head of the steps she searched about for Hale and her lovely face looked vexed and a little hurt when she did not see him Hotel Miss said the porter Yes please Harvey she called An astonished darky sprang from the line of calling hotel porters and took her bag Then every tooth in his head flashed Lordy Miss June I never knowed you at all June smiled it was the tribute she was looking for Have you seen mister Hale No m mister Hale ain t been here for mos six months I reckon he aint in this country now I aint heard nothin bout him for a long time June knew better than that but she said nothing She would rather have had even Harvey think that he was away So she hurried to the hotel she would have four hours to wait and asked for the one room that had a bath attached the room to which Hale had sent her when she had passed through on her way to New York She almost winced when she looked in the mirror and saw the smoke stains about her pretty throat and ears and she wondered if anybody could have noticed them on her way from the train Her hands too were dreadful to look at and she hurried to take off her things In an hour she emerged freshened immaculate from her crown of lovely hair to her smartly booted feet and at once she went downstairs She heard the man whom she passed stop at the head of them and turn to look down at her and she saw necks craned within the hotel office when she passed the door On the street not a man and hardly a woman failed to look at her with wonder and open admiration for she was an apparition in that little town and it all pleased her so much that she became flushed and conscious and felt like a queen who unknown moved among her subjects and blessed them just with her gracious presence For she was unknown even by several people whom she knew and that too pleased her to have bloomed so quite beyond their ken She was like a meteor coming back to dazzle the very world from which it had flown for a while into space When she went into the dining room for the midday dinner there was a movement in almost every part of the room as though there were many there who were on the lookout for her entrance The head waiter a portly darky lost his imperturbable majesty for a moment in surprise at the vision and then with a lordly yet obsequious wave of his hand led her to a table over in a corner where no one was sitting Four young men came in rather boisterously and made for her table She lifted her calm eyes at them so haughtily that the one in front halted with sudden embarrassment and they all swerved to another table from which they stared at her surreptitiously Perhaps she was mistaken for the comic opera star whose brilliant picture she had seen on a bill board in front of the opera house Well she had the voice and she might have been and she might yet be and if she were this would be the distinction that would be shown her And still as it was she was greatly pleased At four o clock she started for the hills In half an hour she was dropping down a winding ravine along a rock lashing stream with those hills so close to the car on either side that only now and then could she see the tops of them Through the window the keen air came from the very lungs of them freighted with the coolness of shadows the scent of damp earth and the faint fragrance of wild flowers and her soul leaped to meet them The mountain sides were showered with pink and white laurel she used to call it ivy and the rhododendrons she used to call them laurel were just beginning to blossom they were her old and fast friends mountain shadow the wet earth and its pure breath and tree plant and flower she had not forgotten them and it was good to come back to them Once she saw an overshot water wheel on the bank of the rushing little stream and she thought of Uncle Billy she smiled and the smile stopped short she was going back to other things as well The train had creaked by a log cabin set in the hillside and then past another and another and always there were two or three ragged children in the door and a haggard unkempt woman peering over their shoulders How lonely those cabins looked and how desolate the life they suggested to her now NOW The first station she came to after the train had wound down the long ravine to the valley level again was crowded with mountaineers There a wedding party got aboard with a great deal of laughter chaffing and noise and all three went on within and without the train while it was waiting A sudden thought stunned her like a lightning stroke They were HER people out there on the platform and inside the car ahead those rough men in slouch hats jeans and cowhide boots their mouths stained with tobacco juice their cheeks and eyes on fire with moonshine and those women in poke bonnets with their sad worn patient faces on which the sympathetic good cheer and joy of the moment sat so strangely She noticed their rough shoes and their homespun gowns that made their figures all alike and shapeless with a vivid awakening of early memories She might have been one of those narrow lived girls outside or that bride within had it not been for Jack Hale She finished the name in her own mind and she was conscious that she had Ah well that was a long time ago and she was nothing but a child and she had thrown herself at his head Perhaps it was different with him now and if it was she would give him the chance to withdraw from everything It would be right and fair and then life was so full for her now She was dependent on nobody on nothing A rainbow spanned the heaven above her and the other end of it was not in the hills But one end was and to that end she was on her way She was going to just such people as she had seen at the station Her father and her kinsmen were just such men her step mother and kinswomen were just such women Her home was little more than just such a cabin as the desolate ones that stirred her pity when she swept by them She thought of how she felt when she had first gone to Lonesome Cove after a few months at the Gap and she shuddered to think how she would feel now She was getting restless by this time and aimlessly she got up and walked to the front of the car and back again to her seat hardly noticing that the other occupants were staring at her with some wonder She sat down for a few minutes and then she went to the rear and stood outside on the platform clutching a brass rod of the railing and looking back on the dropping darkness in which the hills seemed to be rushing together far behind as the train crashed on with its wake of spark lit rolling smoke A cinder stung her face and when she lifted her hand to the spot she saw that her glove was black with grime With a little shiver of disgust she went back to her seat and with her face to the blackness rushing past her window she sat brooding brooding Why had Hale not met her He had said he would and she had written him when she was coming and had telegraphed him at the station in New York when she started Perhaps he HAD changed She recalled that even his letters had grown less frequent shorter more hurried the past year well he should have his chance Always however her mind kept going back to the people at the station and to her people in the mountains They were the same she kept repeating to herself the very same and she was one of them And always she kept thinking of her first trip to Lonesome Cove after her awakening and of what her next would be That first time Hale had made her go back as she had left in home spun sun bonnet and brogans There was the same reason why she should go back that way now as then would Hale insist that she should now She almost laughed aloud at the thought She knew that she would refuse and she knew that his reason would not appeal to her now she no longer cared what her neighbours and kinspeople might think and say The porter paused at her seat How much longer is it she asked Half an hour Miss June went to wash her face and hands and when she came back to her seat a great glare shone through the windows on the other side of the car It was the furnace a run was on and she could see the streams of white molten metal racing down the narrow channels of sand to their narrow beds on either side The whistle shrieked ahead for the Gap and she nerved herself with a prophetic sense of vague trouble at hand At the station Hale had paced the platform He looked at his watch to see whether he might have time to run up to the furnace half a mile away and board the train there He thought he had and he was about to start when the shriek of the coming engine rose beyond the low hills in Wild Cat Valley echoed along Powell s Mountain and broke against the wrinkled breast of the Cumberland On it came and in plain sight it stopped suddenly to take water and Hale cursed it silently and recalled viciously that when he was in a hurry to arrive anywhere the water tower was always on the wrong side of the station He got so restless that he started for it on a run and he had gone hardly fifty yards before the train came on again and he had to run back to beat it to the station where he sprang to the steps of the Pullman before it stopped pushing the porter aside to find himself checked by the crowded passengers at the door June was not among them and straightway he ran for the rear of the car June had risen The other occupants of the car had crowded forward and she was the last of them She had stood during an irritating wait at the water tower and now as she moved slowly forward again she heard the hurry of feet behind her and she turned to look into the eager wondering eyes of John Hale June he cried in amazement but his face lighted with joy and he impulsively stretched out his arms as though he meant to take her in them but as suddenly he dropped them before the startled look in her eyes which with one swift glance searched him from head to foot They shook hands almost gravely XXII June sat in the little dummy the focus of curious eyes while Hale was busy seeing that her baggage was got aboard The checks that she gave him jingled in his hands like a bunch of keys and he could hardly help grinning when he saw the huge trunks and the smart bags that were tumbled from the baggage car all marked with her initials There had been days when he had laid considerable emphasis on pieces like those and when he thought of them overwhelming with opulent suggestions that debt stricken little town and later piled incongruously on the porch of the cabin on Lonesome Cove he could have laughed aloud but for a nameless something that was gnawing savagely at his heart He felt almost shy when he went back into the car and though June greeted him with a smile her immaculate daintiness made him unconsciously sit quite far away from her The little fairy cross was still at her throat but a tiny diamond gleamed from each end of it and from the centre as from a tiny heart pulsated the light of a little blood red ruby To him it meant the loss of June s simplicity and was the symbol of her new estate but he smiled and forced himself into hearty cheerfulness of manner and asked her questions about her trip But June answered in halting monosyllables and talk was not easy between them All the while he was watching her closely and not a movement of her eye ear mouth or hand not an inflection of her voice escaped him He saw her sweep the car and its occupants with a glance and he saw the results of that glance in her face and the down dropping of her eyes to the dainty point of one boot He saw her beautiful mouth close suddenly tight and her thin nostrils quiver disdainfully when a swirl of black smoke heavy with cinders came in with an entering passenger through the front door of the car Two half drunken men were laughing boisterously near that door and even her ears seemed trying to shut out their half smothered rough talk The car started with a bump that swayed her toward him and when she caught the seat with one hand it checked as suddenly throwing her the other way and then with a leap it sprang ahead again giving a nagging snap to her head Her whole face grew red with vexation and shrinking distaste and all the while when the little train steadied into its creaking puffing jostling way one gloved hand on the chased silver handle of her smart little umbrella kept nervously swaying it to and fro on its steel shod point until she saw that the point was in a tiny pool of tobacco juice and then she laid it across her lap with shuddering swiftness At first Hale thought that she had shrunk from kissing him in the car because other people were around He knew better now At that moment he was as rough and dirty as the chain carrier opposite him who was just in from a surveying expedition in the mountains as the sooty brakeman who came through to gather up the fares as one of those good natured profane inebriates up in the corner No it was not publicity she had shrunk from him as she was shrinking now from black smoke rough men the shaking of the train the little pool of tobacco juice at her feet The truth began to glimmer through his brain He understood even when she leaned forward suddenly to look into the mouth of the gap that was now dark with shadows Through that gap lay her way and she thought him now more a part of what was beyond than she who had been born of it was and dazed by the thought he wondered if he might not really be At once he straightened in his seat and his mind made up as he always made it up swiftly He had not explained why he had not met her that morning nor had he apologized for his rough garb because he was so glad to see her and because there were so many other things he wanted to say and when he saw her conscious and resentful perhaps that he had not done these things at once he deliberately declined to do them now He became silent but he grew more courteous more thoughtful watchful She was very tired poor child there were deep shadows under her eyes which looked weary and almost mournful So when with a clanging of the engine bell they stopped at the brilliantly lit hotel he led her at once upstairs to the parlour and from there sent her up to her room which was ready for her You must get a good sleep he said kindly and with his usual firmness that was wont to preclude argument You are worn to death I ll have your supper sent to your room The girl felt the subtle change in his manner and her lip quivered for a vague reason that neither knew but without a word she obeyed him like a child He did not try again to kiss her He merely took her hand placed his left over it and with a gentle pressure said Good night little girl Good night she faltered Resolutely relentlessly first Hale cast up his accounts liabilities resources that night to see what under the least favourable outcome the balance left to him would be Nearly all was gone His securities were already sold His lots would not bring at public sale one half of the deferred payments yet to be made on them and if the company brought suit as it was threatening to do he would be left fathoms deep in debt The branch railroad had not come up the river toward Lonesome Cove and now he meant to build barges and float his cannel coal down to the main line for his sole hope was in the mine in Lonesome Cove The means that he could command were meagre but they would carry his purpose with June for a year at least and then who knew he might through that mine be on his feet again The little town was dark and asleep when he stepped into the cool night air and made his way past the old school house and up Imboden Hill He could see all shining silver in the moonlight the still crest of the big beech at the blessed roots of which his lips had met June s in the first kiss that had passed between them On he went through the shadowy aisle that the path made between other beech trunks harnessed by the moonlight with silver armour and motionless as sentinels on watch till dawn out past the amphitheatre of darkness from which the dead trees tossed out their crooked arms as though voicing silently now his own soul s torment and then on to the point of the spur of foot hills where with the mighty mountains encircling him and the world a dreamland lighted only by stars he stripped his soul before the Maker of it and of him and fought his fight out alone His was the responsibility for all his alone No one else was to blame June not at all He had taken her from her own life had swerved her from the way to which God pointed when she was born He had given her everything she wanted had allowed her to do what she pleased and had let her think that through his miraculous handling of her resources she was doing it all herself And the result was natural For the past two years he had been harassed with debt racked with worries writhing this way and that concerned only with the soul tormenting catastrophe that had overtaken him About all else he had grown careless He had not been to see her the last year he had written seldom and it appalled him to look back now on his own self absorption and to think how he must have appeared to June And he had gone on in that self absorption to the very end He had got his license to marry had asked Uncle Billy who was magistrate as well as miller to marry them and a rough mountaineer himself to the outward eye he had appeared to lead a child like a lamb to the sacrifice and had found a woman with a mind heart and purpose of her own It was all his work He had sent her away to fit her for his station in life to make her fit to marry him She had risen above and now HE WAS NOT FIT TO MARRY HER That was the brutal truth a truth that was enough to make a wise man laugh or a fool weep and Hale did neither He simply went on working to make out how he could best discharge the obligations that he had voluntarily willingly gladly selfishly even assumed In his mind he treated conditions only as he saw and felt them and believed them at that moment true and into the problem he went no deeper than to find his simple duty and that while the morning stars were sinking he found And it was a duty the harder to find because everything had reawakened within him and the starting point of that awakening was the proud glow in Uncle Billy s kind old face when he knew the part he was to play in the happiness of Hale and June All the way over the mountain that day his heart had gathered fuel from memories at the big Pine and down the mountain and through the gap to be set aflame by the yellow sunlight in the valley and the throbbing life in everything that was alive for the month was June and the spirit of that month was on her way to him So when he rose now with back thrown head he stretched his arms suddenly out toward those far seeing stars and as suddenly dropped them with an angry shake of his head and one quick gritting of his teeth that such a thought should have mastered him even for one swift second the thought of how lonesome would be the trail that would be his to follow after that day XXIII June tired though she was tossed restlessly that night The one look she had seen in Hale s face when she met him in the car told her the truth as far as he was concerned He was unchanged she could give him no chance to withdraw from their long understanding for it was plain to her quick instinct that he wanted none And so she had asked him no question about his failure to meet her for she knew now that his reason no matter what was good He had startled her in the car for her mind was heavy with memories of the poor little cabins she had passed on the train of the mountain men and women in the wedding party and Hale himself was to the eye so much like one of them had so startled her that though she knew that his instinct too was at work she could not gather herself together to combat her own feelings for every little happening in the dummy but drew her back to her previous train of painful thought And in that helplessness she had told Hale good night She remembered now how she had looked upon Lonesome Cove after she went to the Gap how she had looked upon the Gap after her year in the Bluegrass and how she had looked back even on the first big city she had seen there from the lofty vantage ground of New York What was the use of it all Why laboriously climb a hill merely to see and yearn for things that you cannot have if you must go back and live in the hollow again Well she thought rebelliously she would not go back to the hollow again that was all She knew what was coming and her cousin Dave s perpetual sneer sprang suddenly from the past to cut through her again and the old pride rose within her once more She was good enough now for Hale oh yes she thought bitterly good enough NOW and then remembering his life long kindness and thinking what she might have been but for him she burst into tears at the unworthiness of her own thought Ah 
3738_176680_000007_000009	train-clean-360	what should she do 
none	none	what should she do Repeating that question over and over again she fell toward morning into troubled sleep She did not wake until nearly noon for already she had formed the habit of sleeping late late at least for that part of the world and she was glad when the negro boy brought her word that mister Hale had been called up the valley and would not be back until the afternoon She dreaded to meet him for she knew that he had seen the trouble within her and she knew he was not the kind of man to let matters drag vaguely if they could be cleared up and settled by open frankness of discussion no matter how blunt he must be She had to wait until mid day dinner time for something to eat so she lay abed picked a breakfast from the menu which was spotted dirty and meagre in offerings and had it brought to her room Early in the afternoon she issued forth into the sunlight and started toward Imboden Hill It was very beautiful and soul comforting the warm air the luxuriantly wooded hills with their shades of green that told her where poplar and oak and beech and maple grew the delicate haze of blue that overlay them and deepened as her eyes followed the still mountain piles north eastward to meet the big range that shut her in from the outer world The changes had been many One part of the town had been wiped out by fire and a few buildings of stone had risen up On the street she saw strange faces but now and then she stopped to shake hands with somebody whom she knew and who recognized her always with surprise and spoke but few words and then as she thought with some embarrassment Half unconsciously she turned toward the old mill There it was dusty and gray and the dripping old wheel creaked with its weight of shining water and the muffled roar of the unseen dam started an answering stream of memories surging within her She could see the window of her room in the old brick boarding house and as she passed the gate she almost stopped to go in but the face of a strange man who stood in the door with a proprietary air deterred her There was Hale s little frame cottage and his name half washed out was over the wing that was still his office Past that she went with a passing temptation to look within and toward the old school house A massive new one was half built of gray stone to the left but the old one with its shingles on the outside that had once caused her such wonder still lay warm in the sun but closed and deserted There was the playground where she had been caught in Ring around the Rosy and Hale and that girl teacher had heard her confession She flushed again when she thought of that day but the flush was now for another reason Over the roof of the schoolhouse she could see the beech tree where she had built her playhouse and memory led her from the path toward it She had not climbed a hill for a long time and she was panting when she reached it There was the scattered playhouse it might have lain there untouched for a quarter of a century just as her angry feet had kicked it to pieces On a root of the beech she sat down and the broad rim of her hat scratched the trunk of it and annoyed her so she took it off and leaned her head against the tree looking up into the underworld of leaves through which a sunbeam filtered here and there one striking her hair which had darkened to a duller gold striking it eagerly unerringly as though it had started for just such a shining mark Below her was outspread the little town the straggling wretched little town crude lonely lifeless She could not be happy in Lonesome Cove after she had known the Gap and now her horizon had so broadened that she felt now toward the Gap and its people as she had then felt toward the mountaineers for the standards of living in the Cove so it seemed were no farther below the standards in the Gap than they in turn were lower than the new standards to which she had adapted herself while away Indeed even that Bluegrass world where she had spent a year was too narrow now for her vaulting ambition and with that thought she looked down again on the little town a lonely island in a sea of mountains and as far from the world for which she had been training herself as though it were in mid ocean Live down there She shuddered at the thought and straightway was very miserable The clear piping of a wood thrush rose far away a tear started between her half closed lashes and she might have gone to weeping silently had her ear not caught the sound of something moving below her Some one was coming that way so she brushed her eyes swiftly with her handkerchief and stood upright against the tree And there again Hale found her tense upright bareheaded again and her hands behind her only her face was not uplifted and dreaming it was turned toward him unstartled and expectant He stopped below her and leaned one shoulder against a tree I saw you pass the office he said and I thought I should find you here His eyes dropped to the scattered playhouse of long ago and a faint smile that was full of submerged sadness passed over his face It was his playhouse after all that she had kicked to pieces But he did not mention it nor her attitude nor did he try in any way to arouse her memories of that other time at this same place I want to talk with you June and I want to talk now Yes Jack she said tremulously For a moment he stood in silence his face half turned his teeth hard on his indrawn lip thinking There was nothing of the mountaineer about him now He was clean shaven and dressed with care June saw that but he looked quite old his face seemed harried with worries and ravaged by suffering and June had suddenly to swallow a quick surging of pity for him He spoke slowly and without looking at her June if it hadn t been for me you would be over in Lonesome Cove and happily married by this time or at least contented with your life for you wouldn t have known any other I don t know Jack I took you out and it rests with you whether I shall be sorry I did sorry wholly on your account I mean he added hastily She knew what he meant and she said nothing she only turned her head away slightly with her eyes upturned a little toward the leaves that were shaking like her own heart I think I see it all very clearly he went on in a low and perfectly even voice You can t be happy over there now you can t be happy over here now You ve got other wishes ambitions dreams now and I want you to realize them and I want to help you to realize them all I can that s all Jack she helplessly protestingly spoke his name in a whisper but that was all she could do and he went on It isn t so strange What is strange is that I that I didn t foresee it all But if I had he added firmly I d have done it just the same unless by doing it I ve really done you more harm than good No no Jack I came into your world you went into mine What I had grown indifferent about you grew to care about You grew sensitive while I was growing callous to certain he was about to say surface things but he checked himself certain things in life that mean more to a woman than to a man I would not have married you as you were I ve got to be honest now at least I thought it necessary that you should be otherwise and now you have gone beyond me and now you do not want to marry me as I am And it is all very natural and very just Very slowly her head had dropped until her chin rested hard above the little jewelled cross on her breast You must tell me if I am wrong You don t love me now well enough to be happy with me here he waved one hand toward the straggling little town below them and then toward the lonely mountains I did not know that we would have to live here but I know it now he checked himself and afterward she recalled the tone of those last words but then they had no especial significance Am I wrong he repeated and then he said hurriedly for her face was so piteous No you needn t give yourself the pain of saying it in words I want you to know that I understand that there is nothing in the world I blame you for nothing nothing If there is any blame at all it rests on me alone She broke toward him with a cry then No no Jack she said brokenly and she caught his hand in both her own and tried to raise it to her lips but he held her back and she put her face on his breast and sobbed heart brokenly He waited for the paroxysm to pass stroking her hair gently You mustn t feel that way little girl You can t help it I can t help it and these things happen all the time everywhere You don t have to stay here You can go away and study and when I can I ll come to see you and cheer you up and when you are a great singer I ll send you flowers and be so proud of you and I ll say to myself I helped do that Dry your eyes now You must go back to the hotel Your father will be there by this time and you ll have to be starting home pretty soon Like a child she obeyed him but she was so weak and trembling that he put his arm about her to help her down the hill At the edge of the woods she stopped and turned full toward him You are so good she said tremulously so GOOD Why you haven t even asked me if there was another Hale interrupted her shaking his head If there is I don t want to know But there isn t there isn t she cried I don t know what is the matter with me I hate the tears started again and again she was on the point of breaking down but Hale checked her Now now he said soothingly you mustn t now that s all right You mustn t Her anger at herself helped now Why I stood like a silly fool tongue tied and I wanted to say so much I You don t need to Hale said gently I understand it all I understand I believe you do she said with a sob better than I do Well it s all right little girl Come on They issued forth into the sunlight and Hale walked rapidly The strain was getting too much for him and he was anxious to be alone Without a word more they passed the old school house the massive new one and went on in silence down the street Hitched to a post near the hotel were two gaunt horses with drooping heads and on one of them was a side saddle Sitting on the steps of the hotel with a pipe in his mouth was the mighty figure of Devil Judd Tolliver He saw them coming at least he saw Hale coming and that far away Hale saw his bushy eyebrows lift in wonder at June A moment later he rose to his great height without a word Dad said June in a trembling voice don t you know me The old man stared at her silently and a doubtful smile played about his bearded lips Hardly but I reckon hit s June She knew that the world to which Hale belonged would expect her to kiss him and she made a movement as though she would but the habit of a lifetime is not broken so easily She held out her hand and with the other patted him on the arm as she looked up into his face Time to be goin June if we want to get home afore dark All right Dad The old man turned to his horse Hurry up little gal In a few minutes they were ready and the girl looked long into Hale s face when he took her hand You are coming over soon Just as soon as I can Her lips trembled Good by she faltered Good by June said Hale From the steps he watched them the giant father slouching in his saddle and the trim figure of the now sadly misplaced girl erect on the awkward pacing mountain beast as incongruous the two as a fairy on some prehistoric monster A horseman was coming up the street behind him and a voice called Who s that Hale turned it was the Honourable Samuel Budd coming home from Court June Tolliver June Taliaferro corrected the honorable Sam with emphasis The same The honorable Sam silently followed the pair for a moment through his big goggles What do you think of my theory of the latent possibilities of the mountaineer now I think I know how true it is better than you do said Hale calmly and with a grunt the honorable Sam rode on Hale watched them as they rode across the plateau watched them until the Gap swallowed them up and his heart ached for June Then he went to his room and there stretched out on his bed and with his hands clenched behind his head he lay staring upward Devil Judd Tolliver had lost none of his taciturnity Stolidly silently he went ahead as is the custom of lordly man in the mountains horseback or afoot asking no questions answering June s in the fewest words possible Uncle Billy the miller had been complaining a good deal that spring and old honorable had rheumatism Uncle Billy s old maid sister who lived on Devil s Fork had been cooking for him at home since the last taking to bed of June s step mother Bub had growed up like a hickory sapling Her cousin Loretta hadn t married and some folks allowed she d run away some day yet with young Buck Falin Her cousin Dave had gone off to school that year had come back a month before and been shot through the shoulder He was in Lonesome Cove now This fact was mentioned in the same matter of fact way as the other happenings Hale had been raising Cain in Lonesome Cove A cuttin things down an tearin em up an playin hell ginerally The feud had broken out again and maybe June couldn t stay at home long He didn t want her there with the fighting going on whereat June s heart gave a start of gladness that the way would be easy for her to leave when she wished to leave Things over at the Gap was agoin to perdition the old man had been told while he was waiting for June and Hale that day and Hale had not only lost a lot of money but if things didn t take a rise he would be left head over heels in debt if that mine over in Lonesome Cove didn t pull him out They were approaching the big Pine now and June was beginning to ache and get sore from the climb So Hale was in trouble that was what he meant when he said that though she could leave the mountains when she pleased he must stay there perhaps for good I m mighty glad you come home gal said the old man an that ye air goin to put an end to all this spendin o so much money Jack says you got some money left but I don t understand it He says he made a investment fer ye and tribbled the money I haint never axed him no questions Hit was betwixt you an him an twant none o my business long as you an him air goin to marry He said you was goin to marry this summer an I wish you d git tied up right away whilst I m livin fer I don t know when a Winchester might take me off an I d die a sight easier if I knowed you was tied up with a good man like him Yes Dad was all she said for she had not the heart to tell him the truth and she knew that Hale never would until the last moment he must when he learned that she had failed Half an hour later she could see the stone chimney of the little cabin in Lonesome Cove A little farther down several spirals of smoke were visible rising from unseen houses which were more miners shacks her father said that Hale had put up while she was gone The water of the creek was jet black now A row of rough wooden houses ran along its edge The geese cackled a doubtful welcome A new dog leaped barking from the porch and a tall boy sprang after him both running for the gate Why Bub cried June sliding from her horse and kissing him and then holding him off at arms length to look into his steady gray eyes and his blushing face Take the horses Bub said old Judd and June entered the gate while Bub stood with the reins in his hand still speechlessly staring her over from head to foot There was her garden thank God with all her flowers planted a new bed of pansies and one of violets and the border of laurel in bloom unchanged and weedless One o Jack Hale s men takes keer of it explained old Judd and again with shame June felt the hurt of her lover s thoughtfulness When she entered the cabin the same old rasping petulant voice called her from a bed in one corner and when June took the shrivelled old hand that was limply thrust from the bed clothes the old hag s keen eyes swept her from head to foot with disapproval My but you air wearin mighty fine clothes she croaked enviously I ain t had a new dress fer more n five year and that was the welcome she got No said June appeasingly Well I ll get one for you myself I m much obleeged she whined but I reckon I can git along A cough came from the bed in the other corner of the room That s Dave said the old woman and June walked over to where her cousin s black eyes shone hostile at her from the dark I m sorry Dave she said but Dave answered nothing but a sullen howdye and did not put out a hand he only stared at her in sulky bewilderment and June went back to listen to the torrent of the old woman s plaints until Bub came in Then as she turned she noticed for the first time that a new door had been cut in one side of the cabin and Bub was following the direction of her eyes Why haint nobody told ye he said delightedly Told me what Bub With a whoop Bud leaped for the side of the door and reaching up pulled a shining key from between the logs and thrust it into her hands Go ahead he said Hit s yourn Some more o Jack Hale s fool doin s said the old woman Go on gal and see whut he s done With eager hands she put the key in the lock and when she pushed open the door she gasped Another room had been added to the cabin and the fragrant smell of cedar made her nostrils dilate Bub pushed by her and threw open the shutters of a window to the low sunlight and June stood with both hands to her head It was a room for her with a dresser a long mirror a modern bed in one corner a work table with a student s lamp on it a wash stand and a chest of drawers and a piano On the walls were pictures and over the mantel stood the one she had first learned to love two lovers clasped in each other s arms and under them the words Enfin Seul Oh oh was all she could say and choking she motioned Bub from the room When the door closed she threw herself sobbing across the bed Over at the Gap that night Hale sat in his office with a piece of white paper and a lump of black coal on the table in front of him His foreman had brought the coal to him that day at dusk He lifted the lump to the light of his lamp and from the centre of it a mocking evil eye leered back at him The eye was a piece of shining black flint and told him that his mine in Lonesome Cove was but a pocket of cannel coal and worth no more than the smouldering lumps in his grate Then he lifted the piece of white paper it was his license to marry June XXIV Very slowly June walked up the little creek to the old log where she had lain so many happy hours There was no change in leaf shrub or tree and not a stone in the brook had been disturbed The sun dropped the same arrows down through the leaves blunting their shining points into tremulous circles on the ground the water sang the same happy tune under her dangling feet and a wood thrush piped the old lay overhead Wood thrush June smiled as she suddenly rechristened the bird for herself now That bird henceforth would be the Magic Flute to musical June and she leaned back with ears eyes and soul awake and her brain busy All the way over the mountain on that second home going she had thought of the first and even memories of the memories aroused by that first home going came back to her the place where Hale had put his horse into a dead run and had given her that never to be forgotten thrill and where she had slid from behind to the ground and stormed with tears When they dropped down into the green gloom of shadow and green leaves toward Lonesome Cove she had the same feeling that her heart was being clutched by a human hand and that black night had suddenly fallen about her but this time she knew what it meant She thought then of the crowded sleeping room the rough beds and coarse blankets at home the oil cloth spotted with drippings from a candle that covered the table the thick plates and cups the soggy bread and the thick bacon floating in grease the absence of napkins the eating with knives and fingers and the noise Bub and her father made drinking their coffee But then she knew all these things in advance and the memories of them on her way over had prepared her for Lonesome Cove The conditions were definite there she knew what it would be to face them again she was facing them all the way and to her surprise the realities had hurt her less even than they had before Then had come the same thrill over the garden and now with that garden and her new room and her piano and her books with Uncle Billy s sister to help do the work and with the little changes that June was daily making in the household she could live her own life even over there as long as she pleased and then she would go out into the world again But all the time when she was coming over from the Gap the way had bristled with accusing memories of Hale even from the chattering creeks the turns in the road the sun dappled bushes and trees and flowers and when she passed the big Pine that rose with such friendly solemnity above her the pang of it all hurt her heart and kept on hurting her When she walked in the garden the flowers seemed not to have the same spirit of gladness It had been a dry season and they drooped for that reason but the melancholy of them had a sympathetic human quality that depressed her If she saw a bass shoot arrow like into deep water if she heard a bird or saw a tree or a flower whose name she had to recall she thought of Hale Do what she would she could not escape the ghost that stalked at her side everywhere so like a human presence that she felt sometimes a strange desire to turn and speak to it And in her room that presence was all pervasive The piano the furniture the bits of bric a brac the pictures and books all were eloquent with his thought of her and every night before she turned out her light she could not help lifting her eyes to her once favourite picture even that Hale had remembered the lovers clasped in each other s arms At Last Alone only to see it now as a mocking symbol of his beaten hopes She had written to thank him for it all and not yet had he answered her letter He had said that he was coming over to Lonesome Cove and he had not come why should he on her account Between them all was over why should he The question was absurd in her mind and yet the fact that she had expected him that she so WANTED him was so illogical and incongruous and vividly true that it raised her to a sitting posture on the log and she ran her fingers over her forehead and down her dazed face until her chin was in the hollow of her hand and her startled eyes were fixed unwaveringly on the running water and yet not seeing it at all A call her step mother s cry rang up the ravine and she did not hear it She did not even hear Bub coming through the underbrush a few minutes later and when he half angrily shouted her name at the end of the vista down stream whence he could see her she lifted her head from a dream so deep that in it all her senses had for the moment been wholly lost Come on he shouted She had forgotten there was a bean stringing at the house that day and she slipped slowly off the log and went down the path gathering herself together as she went and making no answer to the indignant Bub who turned and stalked ahead of her back to the house At the barnyard gate her father stopped her he looked worried Jack Hale s jus been over hyeh June caught her breath sharply Has he gone The old man was watching her and she felt it Yes he was in a hurry an nobody knowed whar you was He jus come over he said to tell me to tell you that you could go back to New York and keep on with yo singin doin s whenever you please He knowed I didn t want you hyeh when this war starts fer a finish as hit s goin to mighty soon now He says he ain t quite ready to git married yit I m afeerd he s in trouble Trouble I tol you t other day he s lost all his money but he says you ve got enough to keep you goin fer some time I don t see why you don t git married right now and live over at the Gap June coloured and was silent Oh said the old man quickly you ain t ready nuther he studied her with narrowing eyes and through a puzzled frown but I reckon hit s all right if you air goin to git married some time What s all right Dad The old man checked himself Ever thing he said shortly but don t you make a fool of yo self with a good man like Jack Hale And wondering June was silent The truth was that the old man had wormed out of Hale an admission of the kindly duplicity the latter had practised on him and on June and he had given his word to Hale that he would not tell June He did not understand why Hale should have so insisted on that promise for it was all right that Hale should openly do what he pleased for the girl he was going to marry but he had given his word so he turned away but his frown stayed where it was June went on puzzled for she knew that her father was withholding something and she knew too that he would tell her only in his own good time But she could go away when she pleased that was the comfort and with the thought she stopped suddenly at the corner of the garden She could see Hale on his big black horse climbing the spur Once it had always been his custom to stop on top of it to rest his horse and turn to look back at her and she always waited to wave him good by She wondered if he would do it now and while she looked and waited the beating of her heart quickened nervously but he rode straight on without stopping or turning his head and June felt strangely bereft and resentful and the comfort of the moment before was suddenly gone She could hear the voices of the guests in the porch around the corner of the house there was an ordeal for her around there and she went on Loretta and Loretta s mother were there and old honorable and several wives and daughters of Tolliver adherents from up Deadwood Creek and below Uncle Billy s mill June knew that the bean stringing was simply an excuse for them to be there for she could not remember that so many had ever gathered there before at that function in the spring at corn cutting in the autumn or sorghum making time or at log raisings or quilting parties and she well knew the motive of these many and the curiosity of all save perhaps Loretta and the old miller s wife and June was prepared for them She had borrowed a gown from her step mother a purple creation of home spun she had shaken down her beautiful hair and drawn it low over her brows and arranged it behind after the fashion of mountain women and when she went up the steps of the porch she was outwardly to the eye one of them except for the leathern belt about her slenderly full waist her black silk stockings and the little furrin shoes on her dainty feet She smiled inwardly when she saw the same old wave of disappointment sweep across the faces of them all It was not necessary to shake hands but unthinkingly she did and the women sat in their chairs as she went from one to the other and each gave her a limp hand and a grave howdye though each paid an unconscious tribute to a vague something about her by wiping that hand on an apron first Very quietly and naturally she took a low chair piled beans in her lap and as one of them went to work Nobody looked at her at first until old honorable broke the silence You haint lost a spec o yo good looks Juny June laughed without a flush she would have reddened to the roots of her hair two years before I m feelin right peart thank ye she said dropping consciously into the vernacular but there was a something in her voice that was vaguely felt by all as a part of the universal strangeness that was in her erect bearing her proud head her deep eyes that looked so straight into their own a strangeness that was in that belt and those stockings and those shoes inconspicuous as they were to which she saw every eye in time covertly wandering as to tangible symbols of a mystery that was beyond their ken Old honorable and the step mother alone talked at first and the others even Loretta said never a word Jack Hale must have been in a mighty big hurry quavered the old step mother June ain t goin to be with us long I m afeerd and without looking up June knew the wireless significance of the speech was going around from eye to eye but calmly she pulled her thread through a green pod and said calmly with a little enigmatical shake of her head I don t know I don t know Young Dave s mother was encouraged and all her efforts at good humour could not quite draw the sting of a spiteful plaint from her voice I reckon she d never git away if my boy Dave had the sayin of it There was a subdued titter at this but Bub had come in from the stable and had dropped on the edge of the porch He broke in hotly You jest let June alone Aunt Tilly you ll have yo hands full if you keep yo eye on Loretty thar Already when somebody was saying something about the feud as June came around the corner her quick eye had seen Loretta bend her head swiftly over her work to hide the flush of her face Now Loretta turned scarlet as the step mother spoke severely You hush Bub and Bub rose and stalked into the house Aunt Tilly was leaning back in her chair gasping and consternation smote the group June rose suddenly with her string of dangling beans I haven t shown you my room Loretty Don t you want to see it Come on all of you she added to the girls and they and Loretta with one swift look of gratitude rose shyly and trooped shyly within where they looked in wide mouthed wonder at the marvellous things that room contained The older women followed to share sight of the miracle and all stood looking from one thing to another some with their hands behind them as though to thwart the temptation to touch and all saying merely My My None of them had ever seen a piano before and June must play the shiny contraption and sing a song It was only curiosity and astonishment that she evoked when her swift fingers began running over the keys from one end of the board to the other astonishment at the gymnastic quality of the performance and only astonishment when her lovely voice set the very walls of the little room to vibrating with a dramatic love song that was about as intelligible to them as a problem in calculus and June flushed and then smiled with quick understanding at the dry comment that rose from Aunt Tilly behind She shorely can holler some She couldn t play Sourwood Mountain on the piano nor Jinny git Aroun nor Soapsuds over the Fence but with a sudden inspiration she went back to an old hymn that they all knew and at the end she won the tribute of an awed silence that made them file back to the beans on the porch Loretta lingered a moment and when June closed the piano and the two girls went into the main room a tall figure entering stopped in the door and stared at June without speaking Why howdye Uncle Rufe said Loretta This is June You didn t know her did ye The man laughed Something in June s bearing made him take off his hat he came forward to shake hands and June looked up into a pair of bold black eyes that stirred within her again the vague fears of her childhood She had been afraid of him when she was a child and it was the old fear aroused that made her recall him by his eyes now His beard was gone and he was much changed She trembled when she shook hands with him and she did not call him by his name Old Judd came in and a moment later the two men and Bub sat on the porch while the women worked and when June rose again to go indoors she felt the newcomer s bold eyes take her slowly in from head to foot and she turned crimson This was the terror among the Tollivers Bad Rufe come back from the West to take part in the feud HE saw the belt and the stockings and the shoes the white column of her throat and the proud set of her gold crowned head HE knew what they meant he made her feel that he knew and later he managed to catch her eyes once with an amused half contemptuous glance at the simple untravelled folk about them that said plainly how well he knew they two were set apart from them and she shrank fearfully from the comradeship that the glance implied and would look at him no more He knew everything that was going on in the mountains He had come back ready for business he said When he made ready to go June went to her room and stayed there but she heard him say to her father that he was going over to the Gap and with a laugh that chilled her soul I m goin over to kill me a policeman And her father warned gruffly You better keep away from thar You don t understand them fellers And she heard Rufe s brutal laugh again and as he rode into the creek his horse stumbled and she saw him cut cruelly at the poor beast s ears with the rawhide quirt that he carried She was glad when all went home and the only ray of sunlight in the day for her radiated from Uncle Billy s face when at sunset he came to take old honorable home The old miller was the one unchanged soul to her in that he was the one soul that could see no change in June He called her baby in the old way and he talked to her now as he had talked to her as a child He took her aside to ask her if she knew that Hale had got his license to marry and when she shook her head his round red face lighted up with the benediction of a rising sun Well that s what he s done baby an he s axed me to marry ye he added with boyish pride he s axed ME And June choked her eyes filled and she was dumb but Uncle Billy could not see that it meant distress and not joy He just put his arm around her and whispered I ain t told a soul baby not a soul She went to bed and to sleep with Hale s face in the dream mist of her brain and Uncle Billy s and the bold black eyes of Bad Rufe Tolliver all fused blurred indistinguishable Then suddenly Rufe s words struck that brain word by word like the clanging terror of a frightened bell I m goin to kill me a policeman And with the last word it seemed she sprang upright in bed clutching the coverlid convulsively Daylight was showing gray through her window She heard a swift step up the steps across the porch the rattle of the door chain her father s quick call then the rumble of two men s voices and she knew as well what had happened as though she had heard every word they uttered Rufe had killed him a policeman perhaps John Hale and with terror clutching her heart she sprang to the floor and as she dropped the old purple gown over her shoulders she heard the scurry of feet across the back porch feet that ran swiftly but cautiously and left the sound of them at the edge of the woods She heard the back door close softly the creaking of the bed as her father lay down again and then a sudden splashing in the creek Kneeling at the window she saw strange horsemen pushing toward the gate where one threw himself from his saddle strode swiftly toward the steps and her lips unconsciously made soft little inarticulate cries of joy for the stern gray face under the hat of the man was the face of John Hale After him pushed other men fully armed whom he motioned to either side of the cabin to the rear By his side was Bob Berkley and behind him was a red headed Falin whom she well remembered Within twenty feet she was looking into that gray face when the set lips of it opened in a loud command Hello She heard her father s bed creak again again the rattle of the door chain and then old Judd stepped on the porch with a revolver in each hand Hello he answered sternly Judd said Hale sharply and June had never heard that tone from him before a man with a black moustache killed one of our men over in the Gap yesterday and we ve tracked him over here There s his horse and we saw him go into that door We want him Do you know who the feller is asked old Judd calmly No said Hale quickly And then with equal calm Hit was my brother and the old man s mouth closed like a vise Had the last word been a stone striking his ear Hale could hardly have been more stunned Again he called and almost gently Watch the rear there and then gently he turned to Devil Judd Judd your brother shot a man at the Gap without excuse or warning He was an officer and a friend of mine but if he were a stranger we want him just the same Is he here Judd looked at the red headed man behind Hale So you re turned on the Falin side now have ye he said contemptuously Is he here repeated Hale Yes an you can t have him Without a move toward his pistol Hale stepped forward and June saw her father s big right hand tighten on his huge pistol and with a low cry she sprang to her feet I m an officer of the law Hale said stand aside Judd Bub leaped to the door with a Winchester his eyes wild and his face white Watch out men Hale called and as the men raised their guns there was a shriek inside the cabin and June stood at Bub s side barefooted her hair tumbled about her shoulders and her hand clutching the little cross at her throat Stop she shrieked He isn t here He s he s gone For a moment a sudden sickness smote Hale s face then Devil Judd s ruse flashed to him and wheeling he sprang to the ground Quick he shouted with a sweep of his hand right and left Up those hollows Lead those horses up to the Pine and wait Quick Already the men were running as he directed and Hale followed by Bob and the Falin rushed around the corner of the house Old Judd s nostrils were quivering and with his pistols dangling in his hands he walked to the gate listening to the sounds of the pursuit They ll never ketch him he said coming back and then he dropped into a chair and sat in silence a long time June reappeared her face still white and her temples throbbing for the sun was rising on days of darkness for her Devil Judd did not even look at her I reckon you ain t goin to marry John Hale No Dad said June XXV Thus Fate did not wait until Election Day for the thing Hale most dreaded a clash that would involve the guard in the Tolliver Falin troubles over the hills There had been simply a preliminary political gathering at the Gap the day before but it had been a crucial day for the guard from a cloudy sunrise to a tragic sunset Early that morning Mockaby the town sergeant had stepped into the street freshly shaven with polished boots and in his best clothes for the eyes of his sweetheart who was to come up that day to the Gap from Lee Before sunset he died with those boots on while the sweetheart unknowing was bound on her happy way homeward and Rufe Tolliver who had shot Mockaby was clattering through the Gap in flight for Lonesome Cove As far as anybody knew there had been but one Tolliver and one Falin in town that day though many had noticed the tall Western looking stranger who early in the afternoon had ridden across the bridge over the North Fork but he was quiet and well behaved he merged into the crowd and through the rest of the afternoon was in no way conspicuous even when the one Tolliver and the one Falin got into a fight in front of the speaker s stand and the riot started which came near ending in a bloody battle The Falin was clearly blameless and was let go at once This angered the many friends of the Tolliver and when he was arrested there was an attempt at rescue and the Tolliver was dragged to the calaboose behind a slowly retiring line of policemen who were jabbing the rescuers back with the muzzles of cocked Winchesters It was just when it was all over and the Tolliver was safely jailed that Bad Rufe galloped up to the calaboose shaking with rage for he had just learned that the prisoner was a Tolliver He saw how useless interference was but he swung from his horse threw the reins over its head after the Western fashion and strode up to Hale You the captain of this guard Yes said Hale and you Rufe shook his head with angry impatience and Hale thinking he had some communication to make ignored his refusal to answer I hear that a fellow can t blow a whistle or holler or shoot off his pistol in this town without gittin arrested That s true why Rufe s black eyes gleamed vindictively Nothin he said and he turned to his horse Ten minutes later as Mockaby was passing down the dummy track a whistle was blown on the river bank a high yell was raised a pistol shot quickly followed and he started for the sound of them on a run A few minutes later three more pistol shots rang out and Hale rushed to the river bank to find Mockaby stretched out on the ground dying and a mountaineer lout pointing after a man on horseback who was making at a swift gallop for the mouth of the gap and the hills He done it said the lout in a frightened way but I don t know who he was Within half an hour ten horsemen were clattering after the murderer headed by Hale Logan and the Infant of the Guard Where the road forked a woman with a child in her arms said she had seen a tall black eyed man with a black moustache gallop up the right fork She no more knew who he was than any of the pursuers Three miles up that fork they came upon a red headed man leading his horse from a mountaineer s yard He went up the mountain the red haired man said pointing to the trail of the Lonesome Pine He s gone over the line Whut s he done killed somebody Yes said Hale shortly starting up his horse I wish I d a knowed you was atter him I m sheriff over thar Now they were without warrant or requisition and Hale pulling in said sharply We want that fellow He killed a man at the Gap If we catch him over the line we want you to hold him for us Come along The red headed sheriff sprang on his horse and grinned eagerly I m your man Who was that fellow asked Hale as they galloped The sheriff denied knowledge with a shake of his head What s your name The sheriff looked sharply at him for the effect of his answer Jim Falin And Hale looked sharply back at him He was one of the Falins who long long ago had gone to the Gap for young Dave Tolliver and now the Falin grinned at Hale I know you all right No wonder the Falin chuckled at this Heaven born chance to get a Tolliver into trouble At the Lonesome Pine the traces of the fugitive s horse swerved along the mountain top the shoe of the right forefoot being broken in half That swerve was a blind and the sheriff knew it but he knew where Rufe Tolliver would go and that there would be plenty of time to get him Moreover he had a purpose of his own and a secret fear that it might be thwarted so without a word he followed the trail till darkness hid it and they had to wait until the moon rose Then as they started again the sheriff said Wait a minute and plunged down the mountain side on foot A few minutes later he hallooed for Hale and down there showed him the tracks doubling backward along a foot path Regular rabbit ain t he chuckled the sheriff and back they went to the trail again on which two hundred yards below the Pine they saw the tracks pointing again to Lonesome Cove On down the trail they went and at the top of the spur that overlooked Lonesome Cove the Falin sheriff pulled in suddenly and got off his horse There the tracks swerved again into the bushes He s goin to wait till daylight fer fear somebody s follered him He ll come in back o Devil Judd s How do you know he s going to Devil Judd s asked Hale Whar else would he go asked the Falin with a sweep of his arm toward the moonlit wilderness Thar ain t but one house that way fer ten miles and nobody lives thar How do you know that he s going to any house asked Hale impatiently He may be getting out of the mountains D you ever know a feller to leave these mountains jus because he d killed a man How d you foller him at night How d you ever ketch him with his start What d he turn that way fer if he wasn t goin to Judd s why d n t he keep on down the river If he s gone he s gone If he ain t he ll be at Devil Judd s at daybreak if he ain t thar now What do you want to do Go on down with the hosses hide em in the bushes an wait Maybe he s already heard us coming down the mountain That s the only thing I m afeerd of said the Falin calmly But whut I m tellin you s our only chance How do you know he won t hear us going down Why not leave the horses We might need the hosses and hit s mud and sand all the way you ought to know that Hale did know that so on they went quietly and hid their horses aside from the road near the place where Hale had fished when he first went to Lonesome Cove There the Falin disappeared on foot Do you trust him asked Hale turning to Budd and Budd laughed I reckon you can trust a Falin against a friend of a Tolliver or t other way round any time Within half an hour the Falin came back with the news that there were no signs that the fugitive had yet come in No use surrounding the house now he said he might see one of us first when he comes in an git away We ll do that atter daylight And at daylight they saw the fugitive ride out of the woods at the back of the house and boldly around to the front of the house where he left his horse in the yard and disappeared Now send three men to ketch him if he runs out the back way quick said the Falin Hit ll take em twenty minutes to git thar through the woods Soon s they git thar let one of em shoot his pistol off an that ll be the signal fer us The three men started swiftly but the pistol shot came before they had gone a hundred yards for one of the three a new man and unaccustomed to the use of fire arms stumbled over a root while he was seeing that his pistol was in order and let it go off accidentally No time to waste now the Falin called sharply Git on yo hosses and git Then the rush was made and when they gave up the chase at noon that day the sheriff looked Hale squarely in the eye when Hale sharply asked him a question Why didn t you tell me who that man was Because I was afeerd you wouldn t go to Devil Judd s atter him I know better now and he shook his head for he did not understand And so Hale at the head of the disappointed Guard went back to the Gap and when next day they laid Mockaby away in the thinly populated little graveyard that rested in the hollow of the river s arm the spirit of law and order in the heart of every guard gave way to the spirit of revenge and the grass would grow under the feet of none until Rufe Tolliver was caught and the death debt of the law was paid with death That purpose was no less firm in the heart of Hale and he turned away from the grave sick with the trick that Fate had lost no time in playing him for he was a Falin now in the eyes of both factions and an enemy even to June The weeks dragged slowly along and June sank slowly toward the depths with every fresh realization of the trap of circumstance into which she had fallen She had dim memories of just such a state of affairs when she was a child for the feud was on now and the three things that governed the life of the cabin in Lonesome Cove were hate caution and fear Bub and her father worked in the fields with their Winchesters close at hand and June was never easy if they were outside the house If somebody shouted hello that universal hail of friend or enemy in the mountains from the gate after dark one or the other would go out the back door and answer from the shelter of the corner of the house Neither sat by the light of the fire where he could be seen through the window nor carried a candle from one room to the other And when either rode down the river June must ride behind him to prevent ambush from the bushes for no Kentucky mountaineer even to kill his worst enemy will risk harming a woman Sometimes Loretta would come and spend the day and she seemed little less distressed than June Dave was constantly in and out and several times June had seen the Red Fox hanging around Always the talk was of the feud The killing of this Tolliver and of that long ago was rehearsed over and over all the wrongs the family had suffered at the hands of the Falins were retold and in spite of herself June felt the old hatred of her childhood reawakening against them so fiercely that she was startled and she knew that if she were a man she would be as ready now to take up a Winchester against the Falins as though she had known no other life Loretta got no comfort from her in her tentative efforts to talk of Buck Falin and once indeed June gave her a scathing rebuke With every day her feeling for her father and Bub was knit a little more closely and toward Dave grew a little more kindly She had her moods even against Hale but they always ended in a storm of helpless tears Her father said little of Hale but that little was enough Young Dave was openly exultant when he heard of the favouritism shown a Falin by the Guard at the Gap the effort Hale had made to catch Rufe Tolliver and his well known purpose yet to capture him for the Guard maintained a fund for the arrest and prosecution of criminals and the reward it offered for Rufe dead or alive was known by everybody on both sides of the State line For nearly a week no word was heard of the fugitive and then one night after supper while June was sitting at the fire the back door was opened Rufe slid like a snake within and when June sprang to her feet with a sharp cry of terror he gave his brutal laugh Don t take much to skeer you does it Shuddering she felt his evil eyes sweep her from head to foot for the beast within was always unleashed and ever ready to spring and she dropped back into her seat speechless Young Dave entering from the kitchen saw Rufe s look and the hostile lightning of his own eyes flashed at his foster uncle who knew straightway that he must not for his own safety strain the boy s jealousy too far You oughtn t to a done it Rufe said old Judd a little later and he shook his head Again Rufe laughed No he said with a quick pacificatory look to young Dave not to HIM The swift gritting of Dave s teeth showed that he knew what was meant and without warning the instinct of a protecting tigress leaped within June She had seen and had been grateful for the look Dave gave the outlaw but without a word she rose new and went to her own room While she sat at her window her step mother came out the back door and left it open for a moment Through it June could hear the talk No said her father she ain t goin to marry him Dave grunted and Rufe s voice came again Ain t no danger I reckon of her tellin on me No said her father gruffly and the door banged No thought June she wouldn t even without her father s trust though she loathed the man and he was the only thing on earth of which she was afraid that was the miracle of it and June wondered She was a Tolliver and the clan loyalty of a century forbade that was all As she rose she saw a figure skulking past the edge of the woods She called Bub in and told him about it and Rufe stayed at the cabin all night but June did not see him next morning and she kept out of his way whenever he came again A few nights later the Red Fox slouched up to the cabin with some herbs for the step mother Old Judd eyed him askance Lookin fer that reward Red The old man had no time for the meek reply that was on his lips for the old woman spoke up sharply You let Red alone Judd I tol him to come And the Red Fox stayed to supper and when Rufe left the cabin that night a bent figure with a big rifle and in moccasins sneaked after him The next night there was a tap on Hale s window just at his bedside and when he looked out he saw the Red Fox s big rifle telescope moccasins and all in the moonlight The Red Fox had discovered the whereabouts of Rufe Tolliver and that very night he guided Hale and six of the guard to the edge of a little clearing where the Red Fox pointed to a one roomed cabin quiet in the moonlight Hale had his requisition now Ain t no trouble ketchin Rufe if you bait him with a woman he snarled There mought be several Tollivers in thar Wait till daybreak and git the drap on him when he comes out And then he disappeared Surrounding the cabin Hale waited and on top of the mountain above Lonesome Cove the Red Fox sat waiting and watching through his big telescope Through it he saw Bad Rufe step outside the door at daybreak and stretch his arms with a yawn and he saw three men spring with levelled Winchesters from behind a clump of bushes The woman shot from the door behind Rufe with a pistol in each hand but Rufe kept his hands in the air and turned his head to the woman who lowered the half raised weapons slowly When he saw the cavalcade start for the county seat with Rufe manacled in the midst of them he dropped swiftly down into Lonesome Cove to tell Judd that Rufe was a prisoner and to retake him on the way to jail And as the Red Fox well knew would happen old Judd and young Dave and two other Tollivers who were at the cabin galloped into the county seat to find Rufe in jail and that jail guarded by seven grim young men armed with Winchesters and shot guns Hale faced the old man quietly eye to eye It s no use Judd he said you d better let the law take its course The old man was scornful Thar s never been a Tolliver convicted of killin nobody much less hung an thar ain t goin to be I m glad you warned me said Hale still quietly though it wasn t necessary But if he s convicted he ll hang The giant s face worked in convulsive helplessness and he turned away You hold the cyards now but my deal is comin All right Judd you re getting a square one from me Back rode the Tollivers and Devil Judd never opened his lips again until he was at home in Lonesome Cove June was sitting on the porch when he walked heavy headed through the gate They ve ketched Rufe he said and after a moment he added gruffly Thar s goin to be sure enough trouble now The Falins ll think all them police fellers air on their side now This ain t no place fer you you must git away June shook her head and her eyes turned to the flowers at the edge of the garden I m not goin away Dad she said XXVI 
3845-176676-0000	train-other-500	Back to the passing of Boone and the landing of Columbus no man in that region had ever been hanged And as old Judd said no Tolliver had ever been sentenced and no jury
none	none	 of mountain men he well knew 
3845-176676-0001	train-other-500	could be found who would convict a Tolliver for there were no twelve men in the mountains who would dare
none	none	 And so the Tollivers decided to await the outcome of the trial 
3845-176676-0002	train-other-500	and rest easy But they did not count on the mettle and intelligence of the grim young furriners
none	none	 who were a flying wedge of civilization at the Gap 
3845-176676-0003	train-other-500	Straightway they gave up the practice of law and banking and trading and store keeping and cut port holes in the brick walls of the Court House and guarded town and jail night and day They brought their own fearless judge their own fearless jury and their own fearless guard
none	none	 Such an abstract regard for law and order 
3845-176676-0004	train-other-500	the mountaineer finds a hard thing to understand It looked as though the motive of the Guard was vindictive and personal and old Judd was almost stifled by the volcanic rage that daily grew within him as the toils daily tightened about Rufe Tolliver
3845-176676-0005	train-other-500	Every happening the old man learned through the Red Fox who with his huge pistols was one of the men who escorted Rufe to and from Court House and jail a volunteer Hale supposed because he hated Rufe
none	none	 and as the Tollivers supposed so that he could keep them advised of everything that went on which he did with secrecy and his own peculiar faith And steadily and to the growing uneasiness of the Tollivers the law went its way Rufe had proven that he was at the Gap all day and had taken no part in the trouble 
3845-176676-0006	train-other-500	He produced a witness the mountain lout whom Hale remembered who admitted that he had blown the whistle given the yell and fired the pistol shot When asked his reason the witness who was stupid had none ready looked helplessly at Rufe
3845-176676-0007	train-other-500	and finally mumbled fer fun But it was plain from the questions that Rufe had put to Hale only a few minutes before the shooting and from the hesitation of the witness
none	none	 that Rufe had used him for a tool So the testimony of the latter that Mockaby without even summoning Rufe 
3845-176676-0008	train-other-500	to surrender had fired first carried no conviction And yet Rufe had no trouble making it almost sure that he had never seen the dead man before so what was his motive
none	none	 It was then that word reached the ear of the prosecuting attorney of the only testimony that could establish a motive and make the crime a hanging offence and Court was adjourned for a day while he sent for the witness who could give it That afternoon one of the Falins who had grown bolder and in twos and threes were always at the trial shot at a Tolliver on the edge of town and there was an immediate turmoil between the factions that the Red Fox had been waiting for 
3845-176676-0009	train-other-500	and that suited his dark purposes well That very night with his big rifle he slipped through the woods to a turn of the road over which old Dave Tolliver was to pass next morning
3845-176676-0010	train-other-500	and built a blind behind some rocks and lay there smoking peacefully and dreaming his Swedenborgian dreams
none	none	 And when a wagon came round the turn 
3845-176676-0011	train-other-500	driven by a boy and with the gaunt frame of old Dave Tolliver lying on straw in the bed of it his big rifle thundered and the frightened horses dashed on with the Red Fox s last enemy lifeless Coolly he slipped back to the woods
none	none	 threw the shell from his gun tirelessly he went by short cuts through the hills and at noon benevolent and smiling 
3845-176676-0012	train-other-500	he was on guard again The little Court Room was crowded for the afternoon session Inside the railing sat Rufe Tolliver white and defiant manacled Leaning on the railing to one side was the Red Fox with his big pistols
none	none	 his good profile calm dreamy kind to the other similarly armed was Hale At each of the gaping port holes and on each side of the door stood a guard with a Winchester and around the railing outside were several more In spite of window and port hole 
3845-176676-0013	train-other-500	the air was close and heavy with the smell of tobacco and the sweat of men Here and there in the crowd was a red Falin
none	none	 but not a Tolliver was in sight 
3845-176676-0014	train-other-500	and Rufe Tolliver sat alone
none	none	 The clerk called the Court to order after the fashion since the days before Edward the Confessor 
3845-176676-0015	train-other-500	except that he asked God to save a commonwealth instead of a king and the prosecuting attorney rose Next witness may it please your Honour and as the clerk got to his feet with a slip of paper in his hand and bawled out a name
none	none	 Hale wheeled with a thumping heart The crowd vibrated turned heads gave way and through the human aisle walked June Tolliver with the sheriff following meekly behind At the railing gate she stopped head uplifted face pale and indignant and her eyes swept past Hale as if he were no more than a wooden image and were fixed with proud inquiry on the Judge s face She was bare headed her bronze hair was drawn low over her white brow 
3845-176676-0016	train-other-500	her gown was of purple home spun and her right hand was clenched tight about the chased silver handle of a riding whip
none	none	 and in eyes mouth and in every line of her tense figure was the mute question Why have you brought me here Illustration Why have you brought me here three hundred forty two Here please said the Judge gently as though he were about to answer that question and as she passed Hale she seemed to swerve her skirts aside that they might not touch him 
3845-176676-0017	train-other-500	Swear her June lifted her right hand put her lips to the soiled old black Bible and faced the jury and Hale and Bad Rufe Tolliver whose black eyes never left her face What is your name
none	none	 asked a deep voice that struck her ears as familiar 
3845-176676-0018	train-other-500	and before she answered she swiftly recalled that she had heard that voice speaking when she entered the door June Tolliver Your age Eighteen You live In Lonesome Cove
none	none	 You are the daughter of Judd Tolliver Do you know the prisoner He is my foster uncle Were you at home on the night of August the tenth I was Have you ever heard the prisoner express any enmity against this volunteer Police Guard He waved his hand toward the men at the portholes and about the railing 
3845-176676-0019	train-other-500	unconsciously leaving his hand directly pointed at Hale June hesitated and Rufe leaned one elbow on the table and the light in his eyes beat with fierce intensity into the girl s eyes
none	none	 into which came a curious 
3845-176676-0020	train-other-500	frightened look that Hale remembered the same look she had shown long ago when Rufe s name was mentioned in the old miller s cabin and when going up the river road she had put her childish trust in him to see that her bad uncle bothered her no more
none	none	 Hale had never forgot that and if it had not been absurd he would have stopped the prisoner from staring at her now 
3845-176676-0021	train-other-500	An anxious look had come into Rufe s eyes would she lie for him Never said June Ah she would she was a Tolliver and Rufe took a breath of deep content
3845-176676-0022	train-other-500	You never heard him express any enmity toward the Police Guard before that night I have answered that question said June with dignity and Rufe s lawyer was on his feet Your Honour I object he said indignantly
3845-176676-0023	train-other-500	I apologize
none	none	 said the deep voice sincerely and he bowed to June Then very quietly What was the last thing you heard the prisoner say that afternoon when he left your father s house It had come how well she remembered just what he had said and how that night even when she was asleep Rufe s words had clanged like a bell in her brain what her awakening terror was when she knew that the deed was done and the stifling fear that the victim might be Hale Swiftly her mind worked somebody had blabbed her step mother perhaps and what Rufe had said had reached a Falin ear 
3845-176676-0024	train-other-500	and come to the relentless man in front of her
none	none	 She remembered too now what the deep voice was saying as she came into the door 
3845-176676-0025	train-other-500	There must be deliberation a malicious purpose proven to make the prisoner s crime a capital offence I admit that of course your Honour Very well we propose to prove that now and then she had heard her name called
3845-176676-0026	train-other-500	The proof that was to send Rufe Tolliver to the scaffold
none	none	 was to come from her that was why she was there Her lips opened and Rufe s eyes like a snake s caught her own again and held them 
3845-176676-0027	train-other-500	He said he was going over to the Gap There was a commotion at the door again the crowd parted and in towered giant Judd Tolliver pushing people aside as though they were straws
none	none	 his bushy hair wild and his great frame shaking from head to 
3845-176676-0028	train-other-500	foot with rage You went to my house he rumbled hoarsely glaring at Hale an took my gal thar when I wasn t at home you Order in the Court said the Judge sternly
3845-176676-0029	train-other-500	but already at a signal from Hale several guards were pushing through the crowd and old Judd saw them coming and saw the Falins about him and the Winchesters at the port holes and he stopped with a hard gulp and stood looking at June
none	none	 Repeat his exact words said the deep voice again as calmly as though nothing had happened He said I m goin over to the Gap and still Rufe s black eyes held her with mesmeric power would she lie for him would she lie for him It was a terrible struggle for June Her father was there her uncle Dave was dead her foster uncle s life hung on her next words 
3845-176676-0030	train-other-500	and she was a Tolliver Yet she had given her oath she had kissed the sacred Book in which she believed from cover to cover with her whole heart
none	none	 and she could feel upon her the blue eyes of a man for whom a lie was impossible

none	none	 I m goin over to the Gap her face turned deadly white she shivered her dark eyes swerved suddenly full on Hale and she said slowly and distinctly yet hardly above a whisper TO KILL ME A POLICEMAN That will do said the deep voice gently and Hale started toward her she looked so deadly sick and she trembled so when she tried to rise but she saw him her mouth steadied she rose and without looking at him passed by his outstretched hand and walked slowly out of the Court Room XXVII The miracle had happened The Tollivers following the Red Fox s advice to make no attempt at rescue just then had waited expecting the old immunity from the law and getting instead the swift sentence that Rufe Tolliver should be hanged by the neck until he was dead Astounding and convincing though the news was no mountaineer believed he would ever hang and Rufe himself faced the sentence defiant He laughed when he was led back to his cell I ll never hang he said scornfully They were the first words that came from his lips and the first words that came from old Judd s when the news reached him in Lonesome Cove and that night old Judd gathered his clan for the rescue to learn next morning that during the night Rufe had been spirited away to the capital for safekeeping until the fatal day And so there was quiet for a while old Judd making ready for the day when Rufe should be brought back and trying to find out who it was that had slain his brother Dave The Falins denied the deed but old Judd never questioned that one of them was the murderer and he came out openly now and made no secret of the fact that he meant to have revenge And so the two factions went armed watchful and wary especially the Falins who were lying low and waiting to fulfil a deadly purpose of their own They well knew that old Judd would not open hostilities on them until Rufe Tolliver was dead or at liberty They knew that the old man meant to try to rescue Rufe when he was brought back to jail or taken from it to the scaffold and when either day came they themselves would take a hand thus giving the Tollivers at one and the same time two sets of foes And so through the golden September days the two clans waited and June Tolliver went with dull determination back to her old life for Uncle Billy s sister had left the house in fear and she could get no help milking cows at cold dawns helping in the kitchen spinning flax and wool and weaving them into rough garments for her father and step mother and Bub and in time she thought grimly for herself for not another cent for her maintenance could now come from John Hale even though he claimed it was hers even though it was in truth her own Never but once had Hale s name been mentioned in the cabin never but once had her father referred to the testimony that she had given against Rufe Tolliver for the old man put upon Hale the fact that the sheriff had sneaked into his house when he was away and had taken June to Court and that was the crowning touch of bitterness in his growing hatred for the captain of the guard of whom he had once been so fond Course you had to tell the truth baby when they got you there he said kindly but kidnappin you that a way He shook his great bushy head from side to side and dropped it into his hands I reckon that damn Hale was the man who found out that you heard Rufe say that I d like to know how I d like to git my hands on the feller as told him June opened her lips in simple justice to clear Hale of that charge but she saw such a terrified appeal in her step mother s face that she kept her peace let Hale suffer for that too and walked out into her garden Never once had her piano been opened her books had lain unread and from her lips during those days came no song When she was not at work she was brooding in her room or she would walk down to Uncle Billy s and sit at the mill with him while the old man would talk in tender helplessness or under the honeysuckle vines with old honorable whose brusque kindness was of as little avail And then still silent she would get wearily up and as quietly go away while the two old friends worried to the heart followed her sadly with their eyes At other times she was brooding in her room or sitting in her garden where she was now and where she found most comfort the garden that Hale had planted for her where purple asters leaned against lilac shrubs that would flower for the first time the coming spring where a late rose bloomed and marigolds drooped and great sunflowers nodded and giant castor plants stretched out their hands of Christ And while June thus waited the passing of the days many things became clear to her for the grim finger of reality had torn the veil from her eyes and let her see herself but little changed at the depths by contact with John Male s world as she now saw him but little changed at the depths by contact with hers Slowly she came to see too that it was his presence in the Court Room that made her tell the truth reckless of the consequences and she came to realize that she was not leaving the mountains because she would go to no place where she could not know of any danger that in the present crisis might threaten John Hale And Hale saw only that in the Court Room she had drawn her skirts aside that she had looked at him once and then had brushed past his helping hand It put him in torment to think of what her life must be now and of how she must be suffering He knew that she would not leave her father in the crisis that was at hand and after it was all over what then His hands would still be tied and he would be even more helpless than he had ever dreamed possible To be sure an old land deal had come to life just after the discovery of the worthlessness of the mine in Lonesome Cove and was holding out another hope But if that too should fail or if it should succeed what then Old Judd had sent back with a curt refusal the last allowance he forwarded to June and he knew the old man was himself in straits So June must stay in the mountains and what would become of her She had gone back to her mountain garb would she lapse into her old life and ever again be content Yes she would lapse but never enough to keep her from being unhappy all her life and at that thought he groaned Thus far he was responsible and the paramount duty with him had been that she should have the means to follow the career she had planned for herself outside of those hills And now if he had the means he was helpless There was nothing for him to do now but to see that the law had its way with Rufe Tolliver and meanwhile he let the reawakened land deal go hang and set himself the task of finding out who it was that had ambushed old Dave Tolliver So even when he was thinking of June his brain was busy on that mystery and one night as he sat brooding a suspicion flashed that made him grip his chair with both hands and rise to pace the porch Old Dave had been shot at dawn and the night before the Red Fox had been absent from the guard and had not turned up until nearly noon next day He had told Hale that he was going home Two days later Hale heard by accident that the old man had been seen near the place of the ambush about sunset of the day before the tragedy which was on his way home and he now learned straightway for himself that the Red Fox had not been home for a month which was only one of his ways of mistreating the patient little old woman in black A little later the Red Fox gave it out that he was trying to ferret out the murderer himself and several times he was seen near the place of ambush looking as he said for evidence But this did not halt Hale s suspicions for he recalled that the night he had spent with the Red Fox long ago the old man had burst out against old Dave and had quickly covered up his indiscretion with a pious characterization of himself as a man that kept peace with both factions And then why had he been so suspicious and fearful when Hale told him that night that he had seen him talking with a Falin in town the Court day before and had he disclosed the whereabouts of Rufe Tolliver and guided the guard to his hiding place simply for the reward He had not yet come to claim it and his indifference to money was notorious through the hills Apparently there was some general enmity in the old man toward the whole Tolliver clan and maybe he had used the reward to fool Hale as to his real motive And then Hale quietly learned that long ago the Tollivers bitterly opposed the Red Fox s marriage to a Tolliver that Rufe when a boy was always teasing the Red Fox and had once made him dance in his moccasins to the tune of bullets spitting about his feet and that the Red Fox had been heard to say that old Dave had cheated his wife out of her just inheritance of wild land but all that was long long ago and apparently had been mutually forgiven and forgotten But it was enough for Hale and one night he mounted his horse and at dawn he was at the place of ambush with his horse hidden in the bushes The rocks for the ambush were waist high and the twigs that had been thrust in the crevices between them were withered And there on the hypothesis that the Red Fox was the assassin Hale tried to put himself after the deed into the Red Fox s shoes The old man had turned up on guard before noon then he must have gone somewhere first or have killed considerable time in the woods He would not have crossed the road for there were two houses on the other side there would have been no object in going on over the mountain unless he meant to escape and if he had gone over there for another reason he would hardly have had time to get to the Court House before noon nor would he have gone back along the road on that side for on that side too was a cabin not far away So Hale turned and walked straight away from the road where the walking was easiest down a ravine and pushing this way and that through the bushes where the way looked easiest Half a mile down the ravine he came to a little brook and there in the black earth was the faint print of a man s left foot and in the hard crust across was the deeper print of his right where his weight in leaping had come down hard But the prints were made by a shoe and not by a moccasin and then Hale recalled exultantly that the Red Fox did not have his moccasins on the morning he turned up on guard All the while he kept a sharp lookout right and left on the ground the Red Fox must have thrown his cartridge shell somewhere and for that Hale was looking Across the brook he could see the tracks no farther for he was too little of a woodsman to follow so old a trail but as he stood behind a clump of rhododendron wondering what he could do he heard the crack of a dead stick down the stream and noiselessly he moved farther into the bushes His heart thumped in the silence the long silence that followed for it might be a hostile Tolliver that was coming so he pulled his pistol from his holster made ready and then noiseless as a shadow the Red Fox slipped past him along the path in his moccasins now and with his big Winchester in his left hand The Red Fox too was looking for that cartridge shell for only the night before had he heard for the first time of the whispered suspicions against him He was making for the blind and Hale trembled at his luck There was no path on the other side of the stream and Hale could barely hear him moving through the bushes So he pulled off his boots and carrying them in one hand slipped after him watching for dead twigs stooping under the branches or sliding sidewise through them when he had to brush between their extremities and pausing every now and then to listen for an occasional faint sound from the Red Fox ahead Up the ravine the old man went to a little ledge of rocks beyond which was the blind and when Hale saw his stooped figure slip over that and disappear he ran noiselessly toward it crept noiselessly to the top and peeped carefully over to see the Red Fox with his back to him and peering into a clump of bushes hardly ten yards away While Hale looked the old man thrust his hand into the bushes and drew out something that twinkled in the sun At the moment Hale s horse nickered from the bushes and the Red Fox slipped his hand into his pocket crouched listening a moment and then step by step backed toward the ledge Hale rose I want you Red The old man wheeled the wolf s snarl came but the big rifle was too slow Hale s pistol had flashed in his face Drop your gun Paralyzed but the picture of white fury the old man hesitated Drop your gun Slowly the big rifle was loosed and fell to the ground Back away turn around and hands up With his foot on the Winchester Hale felt in the old man s pockets and fished out an empty cartridge shell Then he picked up the rifle and threw the slide It fits all right March toward that horse Without a word the old man slouched ahead to where the big black horse was restlessly waiting in the bushes Climb up said Hale We won t ride and tie back to town but I ll take turns with you on the horse The Red Fox was making ready to leave the mountains for he had been falsely informed that Rufe was to be brought back to the county seat next day and he was searching again for the sole bit of evidence that was out against him And when Rufe was spirited back to jail and was on his way to his cell an old freckled hand was thrust between the bars of an iron door to greet him and a voice called him by name Rufe stopped in amazement then he burst out laughing he struck then at the pallid face through the bars with his manacles and cursed the old man bitterly then he laughed again horribly The two slept in adjoining cells of the same cage that night the one waiting for the scaffold and the other waiting for the trial that was to send him there And away over the blue mountains a little old woman in black sat on the porch of her cabin as she had sat patiently many and many a long day It was time she thought that the Red Fox was coming home XXVIII And so while Bad Rufe Tolliver was waiting for death the trial of the Red Fox went on and when he was not swinging in a hammock reading his Bible telling his visions to his guards and singing hymns he was in the Court House giving shrewd answers to questions or none at all with the benevolent half of his mask turned to the jury and the wolfish snarl of the other half showing only now and then to some hostile witness for whom his hate was stronger than his fear for his own life And in jail Bad Rufe worried his enemy with the malicious humour of Satan Now he would say Oh there ain t nothin betwixt old Red and me nothin at all cept this iron wall and he would drum a vicious tattoo on the thin wall with the heel of his boot Or when he heard the creak of the Red Fox s hammock as he droned his Bible aloud he would say to his guard outside Course I don t read the Bible an preach the word nor talk with sperits but thar s worse men than me in the world old Red in thar for instance and then he would cackle like a fiend and the Red Fox would writhe in torment and beg to be sent to another cell And always he would daily ask the Red Fox about his trial and ask him questions in the night and his devilish instinct told him the day that the Red Fox too was sentenced to death he saw it in the gray pallour of the old man s face and he cackled his glee like a demon For the evidence against the Red Fox was too strong Where June sat as chief witness against Rufe Tolliver John Hale sat as chief witness against the Red Fox He could not swear it was a cartridge shell that he saw the old man pick up but it was something that glistened in the sun and a moment later he had found the shell in the old man s pocket and if it had been fired innocently why was it there and why was the old man searching for it He was looking he said for evidence of the murderer himself That claim made the Red Fox s lawyer picked up the big rifle and the shell You say mister Hale the prisoner told you the night you spent at his home that this rifle was rim fire He did The lawyer held up the shell You see this was exploded in such a rifle That was plain and the lawyer shoved the shell into the rifle pulled the trigger took it out and held it up again The plunger had struck below the rim and near the centre but not quite on the centre and Hale asked for the rifle and examined it closely It s been tampered with he said quietly and he handed it to the prosecuting attorney The fact was plain it was a bungling job and better proved the Red Fox s guilt Moreover there were only two such big rifles in all the hills and it was proven that the man who owned the other was at the time of the murder far away The days of brain storms had not come then There were no eminent Alienists to prove insanity for the prisoner Apparently he had no friends none save the little old woman in black who sat by his side hour by hour and day by day And the Red Fox was doomed In the hush of the Court Room the Judge solemnly put to the gray face before him the usual question Have you anything to say whereby sentence of death should not be pronounced on you The Red Fox rose No he said in a shaking voice but I have a friend here who I would like to speak for me The Judge bent his head a moment over his bench and lifted it It is unusual he said but under the circumstances I will grant your request Who is your friend And the Red Fox made the souls of his listeners leap Jesus Christ he said The Judge reverently bowed his head and the hush of the Court Room grew deeper when the old man fished his Bible from his pocket and calmly read such passages as might be interpreted as sure damnation for his enemies and sure glory for himself read them until the Judge lifted his hand for a halt And so another sensation spread through the hills and a superstitious awe of this strange new power that had come into the hills went with it hand in hand Only while the doubting ones knew that nothing could save the Red Fox they would wait to see if that power could really avail against the Tolliver clan The day set for Rufe s execution was the following Monday and for the Red Fox the Friday following for it was well to have the whole wretched business over while the guard was there Old Judd Tolliver so Hale learned had come himself to offer the little old woman in black the refuge of his roof as long as she lived and had tried to get her to go back with him to Lonesome Cove but it pleased the Red Fox that he should stand on the scaffold in a suit of white cap and all as emblems of the purple and fine linen he was to put on above and the little old woman stayed where she was silently and without question cutting the garments as Hale pityingly learned from a white table cloth and measuring them piece by piece with the clothes the old man wore in jail It pleased him too that his body should be kept unburied three days saying that he would then arise and go about preaching and that duty too she would as silently and with as little question perform Moreover he would preach his own funeral sermon on the Sunday before Rufe s day and a curious crowd gathered to hear him The Red Fox was led from jail He stood on the porch of the jailer s house with a little table in front of him On it lay a Bible on the other side of the table sat a little pale faced old woman in black with a black sun bonnet drawn close to her face By the side of the Bible lay a few pieces of bread It was the Red Fox s last communion a communion which he administered to himself and in which there was no other soul on earth to join save that little old woman in black And when the old fellow lifted the bread and asked the crowd to come forward to partake with him in the last sacrament not a soul moved Only the old woman who had been ill treated by the Red Fox for so many years only she of all the crowd gave any answer and she for one instant turned her face toward him With a churlish gesture the old man pushed the bread over toward her and with hesitating trembling fingers she reached for it Bob Berkley was on the death watch that night and as he passed Rufe s cell a wiry hand shot through the grating of his door and as the boy sprang away the condemned man s fingers tipped the butt of the big pistol that dangled on the lad s hip Not this time said Bob with a cool little laugh and Rufe laughed too I was only foolin he said I ain t goin to hang You hear that Red I ain t goin to hang but you are Red sure Nobody d risk his little finger for your old carcass cept maybe that little old woman o yours who you ve treated like a hound but my folks ain t goin to see me hang Rufe spoke with some reason That night the Tollivers climbed the mountain and before daybreak were waiting in the woods a mile on the north side of the town And the Falins climbed too farther along the mountains and at the same hour were waiting in the woods a mile to the south Back in Lonesome Cove June Tolliver sat alone her soul shaken and terror stricken to the depths and the misery that matched hers was in the heart of Hale as he paced to and fro at the county seat on guard and forging out his plans for that day under the morning stars XXIX Day broke on the old Court House with its black port holes on the graystone jail and on a tall topless wooden box to one side from which projected a cross beam of green oak From the centre of this beam dangled a rope that swung gently to and fro when the wind moved And with the day a flock of little birds lighted on the bars of the condemned man s cell window chirping through them and when the jailer brought breakfast he found Bad Rufe cowering in the corner of his cell and wet with the sweat of fear Them damn birds ag in he growled sullenly Don t lose yo nerve Rufe said the jailer and the old laugh of defiance came but from lips that were dry Not much he answered grimly but the jailer noticed that while he ate his eyes kept turning again and again to the bars and the turnkey went away shaking his head Rufe had told the jailer his one friend through whom he had kept in constant communication with the Tollivers how on the night after the shooting of Mockaby when he lay down to sleep high on the mountain side and under some rhododendron bushes a flock of little birds flew in on him like a gust of rain and perched over and around him twittering at him until he had to get up and pace the woods and how throughout the next day when he sat in the sun planning his escape those birds would sweep chattering over his head and sweep chattering back again and in that mood of despair he had said once and only once Somehow I knowed this time my name was Dennis a phrase of evil prophecy he had picked up outside the hills And now those same birds of evil omen had come again he believed right on the heels of the last sworn oath old Judd had sent him that he would never hang With the day through mountain and valley came in converging lines mountain humanity men and women boys and girls children and babes in arms all in their Sunday best the men in jeans slouched hats and high boots the women in gay ribbons and brilliant home spun in wagons on foot and on horses and mules carrying man and man man and boy lover and sweetheart or husband and wife and child all moving through the crisp autumn air past woods of russet and crimson and along brown dirt roads to the straggling little mountain town A stranger would have thought that a county fair a camp meeting or a circus was their goal but they were on their way to look upon the Court House with its black port holes the graystone jail the tall wooden box the projecting beam and that dangling rope which when the wind moved swayed gently to and fro And Hale had forged his plan He knew that there would be no attempt at rescue until Rufe was led to the scaffold and he knew that neither Falins nor Tollivers would come in a band so the incoming tide found on the outskirts of the town and along every road boyish policemen who halted and disarmed every man who carried a weapon in sight for thus John Hale would have against the pistols of the factions his own Winchesters and repeating shot guns And the wondering people saw at the back windows of the Court House and at the threatening port holes more youngsters manning Winchesters more at the windows of the jailer s frame house which joined and fronted the jail and more still a line of them running all around the jail and the old men wagged their heads in amazement and wondered if after all a Tolliver was not really going to be hanged So they waited the neighbouring hills were black with people waiting the housetops were black with men and boys waiting the trees in the streets were bending under the weight of human bodies and the jail yard fence was three feet deep with people hanging to it and hanging about one another s necks all waiting All morning they waited silently and patiently and now the fatal noon was hardly an hour away and not a Falin nor a Tolliver had been seen Every Falin had been disarmed of his Winchester as he came in and as yet no Tolliver had entered the town for wily old Judd had learned of Hale s tactics and had stayed outside the town for his own keen purpose As the minutes passed Hale was beginning to wonder whether after all old Judd had come to believe that the odds against him were too great and had told the truth when he set afoot the rumour that the law should have its way and it was just when his load of anxiety was beginning to lighten that there was a little commotion at the edge of the Court House and a great red headed figure pushed through the crowd followed by another of like build and as the people rapidly gave way and fell back a line of Falins slipped along the wall and stood under the port holes quiet watchful and determined Almost at the same time the crowd fell back the other way up the street there was the hurried tramping of feet and on came the Tollivers headed by giant Judd all armed with Winchesters for old Judd had sent his guns in ahead and as the crowd swept like water into any channel of alley or doorway that was open to it Hale saw the yard emptied of everybody but the line of Falins against the wall and the Tollivers in a body but ten yards in front of them The people on the roofs and in the trees had not moved at all for they were out of range For a moment old Judd s eyes swept the windows and port holes of the Court House the windows of the jailer s house the line of guards about the jail and then they dropped to the line of Falins and glared with contemptuous hate into the leaping blue eyes of old Buck Falin and for that moment there was silence In that silence and as silently as the silence itself issued swiftly from the line of guards twelve youngsters with Winchesters repeating shot guns and in a minute six were facing the Falins and six facing the Tollivers each with his shot gun at his hip At the head of them stood Hale his face a pale image as hard as though cut from stone his head bare and his hand and his hip weaponless In all that crowd there was not a man or a woman who had not seen or heard of him for the power of the guard that was at his back had radiated through that wild region like ripples of water from a dropped stone and unarmed even he had a personal power that belonged to no other man in all those hills though armed to the teeth His voice rose clear steady commanding The law has come here and it has come to stay He faced the beetling eyebrows and angrily working beard of old Judd now Illustration We ll fight you both three hundred seventy The Falins are here to get revenge on you Tollivers if you attack us I know that But he wheeled on the Falins understand We don t want your help If the Tollivers try to take that man in there and one of you Falins draws a pistol those guns there waving his hand toward the jail windows will be turned loose on YOU WE LL FIGHT YOU BOTH The last words shot like bullets through his gritted teeth then the flash of his eyes was gone his face was calm and as though the whole matter had been settled beyond possible interruption he finished quietly The condemned man wishes to make a confession and to say good by In five minutes he will be at that window to say what he pleases Ten minutes later he will be hanged And he turned and walked calmly into the jailer s door Not a Tolliver nor a Falin made a movement or a sound Young Dave s eyes had glared savagely when he first saw Hale for he had marked Hale for his own and he knew that the fact was known to Hale Had the battle begun then and there Hale s death was sure and Dave knew that Hale must know that as well as he and yet with magnificent audacity there he was unarmed personally helpless and invested with an insulting certainty that not a shot would be fired Not a Falin or a Tolliver even reached for a weapon and the fact was the subtle tribute that ignorance pays intelligence when the latter is forced to deadly weapons as a last resort for ignorance faced now belching shot guns and was commanded by rifles on every side Old Judd was trapped and the Falins were stunned Old Buck Falin turned his eyes down the line of his men with one warning glance Old Judd whispered something to a Tolliver behind him and a moment later the man slipped from the band and disappeared Young Dave followed Hale s figure with a look of baffled malignant hatred and Bub s eyes were filled with angry tears Between the factions the grim young men stood with their guns like statues At once a big man with a red face appeared at one of the jailer s windows and then came the sheriff who began to take out the sash Already the frightened crowd had gathered closer again and now a hush came over it followed by a rustling and a murmur Something was going to happen Faces and gun muzzles thickened at the port holes and at the windows the line of guards turned their faces sidewise and upward the crowd on the fence scuffled for better positions the people in the trees craned their necks from the branches or climbed higher and there was a great scraping on all the roofs Even the black crowd out on the hills seemed to catch the excitement and to sway while spots of intense blue and vivid crimson came out here and there from the blackness when the women rose from their seats on the ground Then sharply there was silence The sheriff disappeared and shut in by the sashless window as by a picture frame and blinking in the strong light stood a man with black hair cropped close face pale and worn and hands that looked white and thin stood bad Rufe Tolliver He was going to confess that was the rumour His lawyers wanted him to confess the preacher who had been singing hymns with him all morning wanted him to confess the man himself said he wanted to confess and now he was going to confess What deadly mysteries he might clear up if he would No wonder the crowd was eager for there was no soul there but knew his record and what a record His best friends put his victims no lower than thirteen and there looking up at him were three women whom he had widowed or orphaned while at one corner of the jail yard stood a girl in black the sweetheart of Mockaby for whose death Rufe was standing where he stood now But his lips did not open Instead he took hold of the side of the window and looked behind him The sheriff brought him a chair and he sat down Apparently he was weak and he was going to wait a while Would he tell how he had killed one Falin in the presence of the latter s wife at a wild bee tree how he had killed a sheriff by dropping to the ground when the sheriff fired in this way dodging the bullet and then shooting the officer from where he lay supposedly dead how he had thrown another Falin out of the Court House window and broken his neck the Falin was drunk Rufe always said and fell out why when he was constable he had killed another because Rufe said he resisted arrest how and where he had killed Red necked Johnson who was found out in the woods Would he tell all that and more If he meant to tell there was no sign His lips kept closed and his bright black eyes were studying the situation the little squad of youngsters back to back with their repeating shot guns the line of Falins along the wall toward whom protruded six shining barrels the huddled crowd of Tollivers toward whom protruded six more old Judd towering in front with young Dave on one side tense as a leopard about to spring and on the other Bub with tears streaming down his face In a flash he understood and in that flash his face looked as though he had been suddenly struck a heavy blow by some one from behind and then his elbows dropped on the sill of the window his chin dropped into his hands and a murmur arose Maybe he was too weak to stand and talk perhaps he was going to talk from his chair Yes he was leaning forward and his lips were opening but no sound came Slowly his eyes wandered around at the waiting people in the trees on the roofs and the fence and then they dropped to old Judd s and blazed their appeal for a sign With one heave of his mighty chest old Judd took off his slouch hat pressed one big hand to the back of his head and despite that blazing appeal kept it there At that movement Rufe threw his head up as though his breath had suddenly failed him his face turned sickening white and slowly again his chin dropped into his trembling hands and still unbelieving he stared his appeal but old Judd dropped his big hand and turned his head away The condemned man s mouth twitched once settled into defiant calm and then he did one kindly thing He turned in his seat and motioned Bob Berkley who was just behind him away from the window and the boy to humour him stepped aside Then he rose to his feet and stretched his arms wide Simultaneously came the far away crack of a rifle and as a jet of smoke spurted above a clump of bushes on a little hill three hundred yards away Bad Rufe wheeled half way round and fell back out of sight into the sheriff s arms Every Falin made a nervous reach for his pistol the line of gun muzzles covering them wavered slightly but the Tollivers stood still and unsurprised and when Hale dashed from the door again there was a grim smile of triumph on old Judd s face He had kept his promise that Rufe should never hang Steady there said Hale quietly His pistol was on his hip now and a Winchester was in his left hand Stand where you are everybody There was the sound of hurrying feet within the jail There was the clang of an iron door the bang of a wooden one and in five minutes from within the tall wooden box came the sharp click of a hatchet and then dully T H O O MP The dangling rope had tightened with a snap and the wind swayed it no more At his cell door the Red Fox stood with his watch in his hand and his eyes glued to the second hand When it had gone three times around its circuit he snapped the lid with a sigh of relief and turned to his hammock and his Bible He s gone now said the Red Fox Outside Hale still waited and as his eyes turned from the Tollivers to the Falins seven of the faces among them came back to him with startling distinctness and his mind went back to the opening trouble in the county seat over the Kentucky line years before when eight men held one another at the points of their pistols One face was missing and that face belonged to Rufe Tolliver Hale pulled out his watch Keep those men there he said pointing to the Falins and he turned to the bewildered Tollivers Come on Judd he said kindly all of you Dazed and mystified they followed him in a body around the corner of the jail where in a coffin that old Jadd had sent as a blind to his real purpose lay the remains of Bad Rufe Tolliver with a harmless bullet hole through one shoulder Near by was a wagon and hitched to it were two mules that Hale himself had provided Hale pointed to it I ve done all I could Judd Take him away I ll keep the Falins under guard until you reach the Kentucky line so that they can t waylay you If old Judd heard he gave no sign He was looking down at the face of his foster brother his shoulder drooped his great frame shrunken and his iron face beaten and helpless Again Hale spoke I m sorry for all this I m even sorry that your man was not a better shot The old man straightened then and with a gesture he motioned young Dave to the foot of the coffin and stooped himself at the head Past the wagon they went the crowd giving way before them and with the dead Tolliver on their shoulders old Judd and young Dave passed with their followers out of sight XXX The longest of her life was that day to June The anxiety in times of war for the women who wait at home is vague because they are mercifully ignorant of the dangers their loved ones run but a specific issue that involves death to those loved ones has a special and poignant terror of its own June knew her father s plan the precise time the fight would take place and the especial danger that was Hale s for she knew that young Dave Tolliver had marked him with the first shot fired Dry eyed and white and dumb she watched them make ready for the start that morning while it was yet dark dully she heard the horses snorting from the cold the low curt orders of her father and the exciting mutterings of Bub and young Dave dully she watched the saddles thrown on the pistols buckled the Winchesters caught up and dully she watched them file out the gate and ride away single file into the cold damp mist like ghostly figures in a dream Once only did she open her lips and that was to plead with her father to leave Bub at home but her father gave her no answer and Bub snorted his indignation he was a man now and his now was the privilege of a man For a while she stood listening to the ring of metal against stone that came to her more and more faintly out of the mist and she wondered if it was really June Tolliver standing there while father and brother and cousin were on their way to fight the law how differently she saw these things now for a man who deserved death and to fight a man who was ready to die for his duty to that law the law that guarded them and her and might not perhaps guard him the man who had planted for her the dew drenched garden that was waiting for the sun and had built the little room behind her for her comfort and seclusion who had sent her to school had never been anything but kind and just to her and to everybody who had taught her life and thank God love Was she really the June Tolliver who had gone out into the world and had held her place there who had conquered birth and speech and customs and environment so that none could tell what they all once were who had become the lady the woman of the world in manner dress and education who had a gift of music and a voice that might enrich her life beyond any dream that had ever sprung from her own brain or any that she had ever caught from Hale s Was she June Tolliver who had been and done all that and now had come back and was slowly sinking back into the narrow grave from which Hale had lifted her It was all too strange and bitter but if she wanted proof there was her step mother s voice now the same old querulous nerve racking voice that had embittered all her childhood calling her down into the old mean round of drudgery that had bound forever the horizon of her narrow life just as now it was shutting down like a sky of brass around her own And when the voice came instead of bursting into tears as she was about to do she gave a hard little laugh and she lifted a defiant face to the rising sun There was a limit to the sacrifice for kindred brother father home and that limit was the eternal sacrifice the eternal undoing of herself when this wretched terrible business was over she would set her feet where that sun could rise on her busy with the work that she could do in that world for which she felt she was born Swiftly she did the morning chores and then she sat on the porch thinking and waiting Spinning wheel loom and darning needle were to lie idle that day The old step mother had gotten from bed and was dressing herself miraculously cured of a sudden miraculously active She began to talk of what she needed in town and June said nothing She went out to the stable and led out the old sorrel mare She was going to the hanging Don t you want to go to town June No said June fiercely Well you needn t git mad about it I got to go some day this week and I reckon I might as well go ter day June answered nothing but in silence watched her get ready and in silence watched her ride away She was glad to be left alone The sun had flooded Lonesome Cove now with a light as rich and yellow as though it were late afternoon and she could yet tell every tree by the different colour of the banner that each yet defiantly flung into the face of death The yard fence was festooned with dewy cobwebs and every weed in the field was hung with them as with flashing jewels of exquisitely delicate design Hale had once told her that they meant rain Far away the mountains were overhung with purple so deep that the very air looked like mist and a peace that seemed motherlike in tenderness brooded over the earth Peace Peace with a man on his way to a scaffold only a few miles away and two bodies of men one led by her father the other by the man she loved ready to fly at each other s throats the one to get the condemned man alive the other to see that he died She got up with a groan She walked into the garden The grass was tall tangled and withering and in it dead leaves lay everywhere stems up stems down in reckless confusion The scarlet sage pods were brown and seeds were dropping from their tiny gaping mouths The marigolds were frost nipped and one lonely black winged butterfly was vainly searching them one by one for the lost sweets of summer The gorgeous crowns of the sun flowers were nothing but grotesque black mummy heads set on lean dead bodies and the clump of big castor plants buffeted by the wind leaned this way and that like giants in a drunken orgy trying to keep one another from falling down The blight that was on the garden was the blight that was in her heart and two bits of cheer only she found one yellow nasturtium scarlet flecked whose fragrance was a memory of the spring that was long gone and one little cedar tree that had caught some dead leaves in its green arms and was firmly holding them as though to promise that another spring would surely come With the flower in her hand she started up the ravine to her dreaming place but it was so lonely up there and she turned back She went into her room and tried to read Mechanically she half opened the lid of the piano and shut it horrified by her own act As she passed out on the porch again she noticed that it was only nine o clock She turned and watched the long hand how long a minute was Three hours more She shivered and went inside and got her bonnet she could not be alone when the hour came and she started down the road toward Uncle Billy s mill Hale Hale Hale the name began to ring in her ears like a bell The little shacks he had built up the creek were deserted and gone to ruin and she began to wonder in the light of what her father had said how much of a tragedy that meant to him Here was the spot where he was fishing that day when she had slipped down behind him and he had turned and seen her for the first time She could recall his smile and the very tone of his kind voice

none	none	She remembered when she had written her name after she had first kissed him at the foot of the beech June HAIL and by a grotesque mental leap the beating of his name in her brain now made her think of the beating of hailstones on her father s roof one night when as a child she had lain and listened to them Then she noticed that the autumn shadows seemed to make the river darker than the shadows of spring or was it already the stain of dead leaves Hale could have told her Those leaves were floating through the shadows and when the wind moved others zig zagged softly down to join them The wind was helping them on the water too and along came one brown leaf that was shaped like a tiny trireme its stem acting like a rudder and keeping it straight before the breeze so that it swept past the rest as a yacht that she was once on had swept past a fleet of fishing sloops She was not unlike that swift little ship and thirty yards ahead were rocks and shallows where it and the whole fleet would turn topsy turvy would her own triumph be as short and the same fate be hers There was no question as to that unless she took the wheel of her fate in her own hands and with them steered the ship Thinking hard she walked on slowly with her hands behind her and her eyes bent on the road What should she do She had no money her father had none to spare and she could accept no more from Hale Once she stopped and stared with unseeing eyes at the blue sky and once under the heavy helplessness of it all she dropped on the side of the road and sat with her head buried in her arms sat so long that she rose with a start and with an apprehensive look at the mounting sun hurried on She would go to the Gap and teach and then she knew that if she went there it would be on Hale s account Very well she would not blind herself to that fact she would go and perhaps all would be made up between them and then she knew that if that but happened nothing else could matter When she reached the miller s cabin she went to the porch without noticing that the door was closed Nobody was at home and she turned listlessly When she reached the gate she heard the clock beginning to strike and with one hand on her breast she breathlessly listened counting eight nine ten eleven and her heart seemed to stop in the fraction of time that she waited for it to strike once more But it was only eleven and she went on down the road slowly still thinking hard The old miller was leaning back in a chair against the log side of the mill with his dusty slouched hat down over his eyes He did not hear her coming and she thought he must be asleep but he looked up with a start when she spoke and she knew of what he too had been thinking Keenly his old eyes searched her white face and without a word he got up and reached for another chair within the mill You set right down now baby he said and he made a pretence of having something to do inside the mill while June watched the creaking old wheel dropping the sun shot sparkling water into the swift sluice but hardly seeing it at all By and by Uncle Billy came outside and sat down and neither spoke a word Once June saw him covertly looking at his watch and she put both hands to her throat stifled What time is it Uncle Billy She tried to ask the question calmly but she had to try twice before she could speak at all and when she did get the question out her voice was only a broken whisper Five minutes to twelve baby said the old man and his voice had a gulp in it that broke June down She sprang to her feet wringing her hands I can t stand it Uncle Billy she cried madly and with a sob that almost broke the old man s heart I tell you I can t stand it And yet for three hours more she had to stand it while the cavalcade of Tollivers with Rufe s body made its slow way to the Kentucky line where Judd and Dave and Bub left them to go home for the night and be on hand for the funeral next day But Uncle Billy led her back to his cabin and on the porch the two with old honorable waited while the three hours dragged along It was June who was first to hear the galloping of horses hoofs up the road and she ran to the gate followed by Uncle Billy and old honorable to see young Dave Tolliver coming in a run At the gate he threw himself from his horse Git up thar June and go home he panted sharply June flashed out the gate Have you done it she asked with deadly quiet Hurry up an go home I tell ye Uncle Judd wants ye She came quite close to him now You said you d do it I know what you ve done you she looked as if she would fly at his throat and Dave amazed shrank back a step
3738_176680_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Go home I tell ye Uncle Judd s shot 
none	none	Git on the hoss No no NO I wouldn t TOUCH anything that was yours she put her hands to her head as though she were crazed and then she turned and broke into a swift run up the road Panting June reached the gate The front door was closed and there she gave a tremulous cry for Bub The door opened a few inches and through it Bub shouted for her to come on The back door too was closed and not a ray of daylight entered the room except at the port hole where Bub with a Winchester had been standing on guard By the light of the fire she saw her father s giant frame stretched out on the bed and she heard his laboured breathing Swiftly she went to the bed and dropped on her knees beside it Dad she said The old man s eyes opened and turned heavily toward her All right Juny They shot me from the laurel and they might nigh got Bub I reckon they ve got me this time No no He saw her eyes fixed on the matted blood on his chest Hit s stopped I m afeared hit s bleedin inside His voice had dropped to a whisper and his eyes closed again There was another cautious Hello outside and when Bub again opened the door Dave ran swiftly within He paid no attention to June I follered June back an left my hoss in the bushes There was three of em He showed Bub a bullet hole through one sleeve and then he turned half contemptuously to June I hain t done it adding grimly not yit He s as safe as you air I hope you re satisfied that hit hain t him stid o yo daddy thar Are you going to the Gap for a doctor I reckon I can t leave Bub here alone agin all the Falins not even to git a doctor or to carry a love message fer you Then I ll go myself A thick protest came from the bed and then an appeal that might have come from a child Don t leave me Juny Without a word June went into the kitchen and got the old bark horn Uncle Billy will go she said and she stepped out on the porch But Uncle Billy was already on his way and she heard him coming just as she was raising the horn to her lips She met him at the gate and without even taking the time to come into the house the old miller hurried upward toward the Lonesome Pine The rain came then the rain that the tiny cobwebs had heralded at dawn that morning The old step mother had not come home and June told Bub she had gone over the mountain to see her sister and when as darkness fell she did not appear they knew that she must have been caught by the rain and would spend the night with a neighbour June asked no question but from the low talk of Bub and Dave she made out what had happened in town that day and a wild elation settled in her heart that John Hale was alive and unhurt though Rufe was dead her father wounded and Bub and Dave both had but narrowly escaped the Falin assassins that afternoon Bub took the first turn at watching while Dave slept and when it was Dave s turn she saw him drop quickly asleep in his chair and she was left alone with the breathing of the wounded man and the beating of rain on the roof And through the long night June thought her brain weary over herself her life her people and Hale They were not to blame her people they but did as their fathers had done before them They had their own code and they lived up to it as best they could and they had had no chance to learn another She felt the vindictive hatred that had prolonged the feud Had she been a man she could not have rested until she had slain the man who had ambushed her father She expected Bub to do that now and if the spirit was so strong in her with the training she had had how helpless they must be against it Even Dave was not to blame not to blame for loving her he had always done that For that reason he could not help hating Hale and how great a reason he had now for he could not understand as she could the absence of any personal motive that had governed him in the prosecution of the law no matter if he hurt friend or foe But for Hale she would have loved Dave and now be married to him and happier than she was Dave saw that no wonder he hated Hale And as she slowly realized all these things she grew calm and gentle and determined to stick to her people and do the best she could with her life And now and then through the night old Judd would open his eyes and stare at the ceiling and at these times it was not the pain in his face that distressed her as much as the drawn beaten look that she had noticed growing in it for a long time It was terrible that helpless look in the face of a man so big in body so strong of mind so iron like in will and whenever he did speak she knew what he was going to say It s all over Juny They ve beat us on every turn They ve got us one by one Thar ain t but a few of us left now and when I git up if I ever do I m goin to gether em all together pull up stakes and take em all West You won t ever leave me Juny No Dad she would say gently He had asked the question at first quite sanely but as the night wore on and the fever grew and his mind wandered he would repeat the question over and over like a child and over and over while Bub and Dave slept and the rain poured June would repeat her answer I ll never leave you Dad XXXI Before dawn Hale and the doctor and the old miller had reached the Pine and there Hale stopped Any farther the old man told him he would go only at the risk of his life from Dave or Bub or even from any Falin who happened to be hanging around in the bushes for Hale was hated equally by both factions now I ll wait up here until noon Uncle Billy said Hale Ask her for God s sake to come up here and see me All right I ll axe her but the old miller shook his head Breakfastless except for the munching of a piece of chocolate Hale waited all the morning with his black horse in the bushes some thirty yards from the Lonesome Pine Every now and then he would go to the tree and look down the path and once he slipped far down the trail and aside to a spur whence he could see the cabin in the cove Once his hungry eyes caught sight of a woman s figure walking through the little garden and for an hour after it disappeared into the house he watched for it to come out again But nothing more was visible and he turned back to the trail to see Uncle Billy laboriously climbing up the slope Hale waited and ran down to meet him his face and eyes eager and his lips trembling but again Uncle Billy was shaking his head No use John he said sadly I got her out on the porch and axed her but she won t come She won t come at all John when one o them Tollivers gits white about the mouth an thar eyes gits to blazin and they KEEPS QUIET they re plumb out o reach o the Almighty hisself June skeered me But you mustn t blame her jes now You see you got up that guard You ketched Rufe and hung him and she can t help thinkin if you hadn t done that her old daddy wouldn t be in thar on his back nigh to death You mustn t blame her John she s most out o her head now All right Uncle Billy Good by Hale turned climbed sadly back to his horse and sadly dropped down the other side of the mountain and on through the rocky gap home A week later he learned from the doctor that the chances were even that old Judd would get well but the days went by with no word of June Through those days June wrestled with her love for Hale and her loyalty to her father who sick as he was seemed to have a vague sense of the trouble within her and shrewdly fought it by making her daily promise that she would never leave him For as old Judd got better June s fierceness against Hale melted and her love came out the stronger because of the passing injustice that she had done him Many times she was on the point of sending him word that she would meet him at the Pine but she was afraid of her own strength if she should see him face to face and she feared she would be risking his life if she allowed him to come There were times when she would have gone to him herself had her father been well and strong but he was old beaten and helpless and she had given her sacred word that she would never leave him So once more she grew calmer gentler still and more determined to follow her own way with her own kin though that way led through a breaking heart She never mentioned Hale s name she never spoke of going West and in time Dave began to wonder not only if she had not gotten over her feeling for Hale but if that feeling had not turned into permanent hate To him June was kinder than ever because she understood him better and because she was sorry for the hunted hounded life he led not knowing when on his trips to see her or to do some service for her father he might be picked off by some Falin from the bushes So Dave stopped his sneering remarks against Hale and began to dream his old dreams though he never opened his lips to June and she was unconscious of what was going on within him By and by as old Judd began to mend overtures of peace came singularly enough from the Falins and while the old man snorted with contemptuous disbelief at them as a pretence to throw him off his guard Dave began actually to believe that they were sincere and straightway forged a plan of his own even if the Tollivers did persist in going West So one morning as he mounted his horse at old Judd s gate he called to June in the garden I m a goin over to the Gap June paled but Dave was not looking at her What for she asked steadying her voice Business he answered and he laughed curiously and still without looking at her rode away Hale sat in the porch of his little office that morning and the honorable Sam Budd who had risen to leave stood with his hands deep in his pockets his hat tilted far over his big goggles looking down at the dead leaves that floated like lost hopes on the placid mill pond Hale had agreed to go to England once more on the sole chance left him before he went back to chain and compass the old land deal that had come to life and between them they had about enough money for the trip You ll keep an eye on things over there said Hale with a backward motion of his head toward Lonesome Cove and the honorable Sam nodded his head All I can Those big trunks of hers are still here The honorable Sam smiled She won t need em I ll keep an eye on em and she can come over and get what she wants every year or two he added grimly and Hale groaned Stop it Sam All right You ain t goin to try to see her before you leave And then at the look on Hale s face he said hurriedly All right all right and with a toss of his hands turned away while Hale sat thinking where he was Rufe Tolliver had been quite right as to the Red Fox Nobody would risk his life for him there was no one to attempt a rescue and but a few of the guards were on hand this time to carry out the law On the last day he had appeared in his white suit of tablecloth The little old woman in black had made even the cap that was to be drawn over his face and that too she had made of white Moreover she would have his body kept unburied for three days because the Red Fox said that on the third day he would arise and go about preaching So that even in death the Red Fox was consistently inconsistent and how he reconciled such a dual life at one and the same time over and under the stars was except to his twisted brain never known He walked firmly up the scaffold steps and stood there blinking in the sunlight With one hand he tested the rope For a moment he looked at the sky and the trees with a face that was white and absolutely expressionless Then he sang one hymn of two verses and quietly dropped into that world in which he believed so firmly and toward which he had trod so strange a way on earth As he wished the little old woman in black had the body kept unburied for the three days but the Red Fox never rose With his passing law and order had become supreme Neither Tolliver nor Falin came on the Virginia side for mischief and the desperadoes of two sister States whose skirts are stitched together with pine and pin oak along the crest of the Cumberland confined their deviltries with great care to places long distant from the Gap John Hale had done a great work but the limit of his activities was that State line and the Falins ever threatening that they would not leave a Tolliver alive could carry out those threats and Hale not be able to lift a hand It was his helplessness that was making him writhe now Old Judd had often said he meant to leave the mountains why didn t he go now and take June for whose safety his heart was always in his mouth As an officer he was now helpless where he was and if he went away he could give no personal aid he would not even know what was happening and he had promised Budd to go An open letter was clutched in his hand and again he read it His coal company had accepted his last proposition They would take his stock worthless as they thought it and surrender the cabin and two hundred acres of field and woodland in Lonesome Cove That much at least would be intact but if he failed in his last project now it would be subject to judgments against him that were sure to come So there was one thing more to do for June before he left for the final effort in England to give back her home to her and as he rose to do it now somebody shouted at his gate Hello Hale stopped short at the head of the steps his right hand shot like a shaft of light to the butt of his pistol stayed there and he stood astounded It was Dave Tolliver on horseback and Dave s right hand had kept hold of his bridle reins Hold on he said lifting the other with a wide gesture of peace I want to talk with you a bit Still Hale watched him closely as he swung from his horse Come in won t you The mountaineer hitched his horse and slouched within the gate Have a seat Dave dropped to the steps I ll set here he said and there was an embarrassed silence for a while between the two Hale studied young Dave s face from narrowed eyes He knew all the threats the Tolliver had made against him the bitter enmity that he felt and that it would last until one or the other was dead This was a queer move The mountaineer took off his slouched hat and ran one hand through his thick black hair I reckon you ve heard as how all our folks air sellin out over the mountains No said Hale quickly Well they air an all of em are going West Uncle Judd Loretty and June and all our kinfolks You didn t know that No repeated Hale Well they hain t closed all the trades yit he said an they mought not go mebbe afore spring The Falins say they air done now Uncle Judd don t believe em but I do an I m thinkin I won t go I ve got a leetle money an I want to know if I can t buy back Uncle Judd s house an a leetle ground around it Our folks is tired o fightin and I couldn t live on t other side of the mountain after they air gone an keep as healthy as on this side so I thought I d see if I couldn t buy back June s old home mebbe an live thar Hale watched him keenly wondering what his game was and he went on I know the house an land ain t wuth much to your company an as the coal vein has petered out I reckon they might not axe much fer it It was all out now and he stopped without looking at Hale I ain t axin any favours leastwise not o you an I thought my share o Mam s farm mought be enough to git me the house an some o the land You mean to live there yourself Yes Alone Dave frowned I reckon that s my business So it is excuse me Hale lighted his pipe and the mountaineer waited he was a little sullen now Well the company has parted with the land Dave started Sold it In a way yes Well would you mind tellin me who bought it maybe I can git it from him It s mine now said Hale quietly YOURN The mountaineer looked incredulous and then he let loose a scornful laugh YOU goin to live thar Maybe Alone That s my business The mountaineer s face darkened and his fingers began to twitch Well if you re talkin bout June hit s MY business Hit always has been and hit always will be Well if I was talking about June I wouldn t consult you No but I d consult you like hell I wish you had the chance said Hale coolly but I wasn t talking about June Again Dave laughed harshly and for a moment his angry eyes rested on the quiet mill pond He went backward suddenly You went over thar in Lonesome with your high notions an your slick tongue an you took June away from me But she wusn t good enough fer you THEN so you filled her up with yo fool notions an sent her away to git her po little head filled with furrin ways so she could be fitten to marry you You took her away from her daddy her family her kinfolks and her home an you took her away from me an now she s been over thar eatin her heart out just as she et it out over here when she fust left home An in the end she got so highfalutin that SHE wouldn t marry YOU He laughed again and Hale winced under the laugh and the lashing words An I know you air eatin yo heart out too because you can t git June an I m hopin you ll suffer the torment o hell as long as you live God she hates ye now To think o your knowin the world and women and books he spoke with vindictive and insulting slowness You bein such a fool That may all be true but I think you can talk better outside that gate The mountaineer deceived by Hale s calm voice sprang to his feet in a fury but he was too late Hale s hand was on the butt of his revolver his blue eyes were glittering and a dangerous smile was at his lips Silently he sat and silently he pointed his other hand at the gate Dave laughed D ye think I d fight you hyeh If you killed me you d be elected County Jedge if I killed you what chance would I have o gittin away I d swing fer it He was outside the gate now and unhitching his horse He started to turn the beasts but Hale stopped him Get on from this side please With one foot in the stirrup Dave turned savagely Why don t you go up in the Gap with me now an fight it out like a man I don t trust you I ll git ye over in the mountains some day I ve no doubt you will if you have the chance from the bush Hale was getting roused now Look here he said suddenly you ve been threatening me for a long time now I ve never had any feeling against you I ve never done anything to you that I hadn t to do But you ve gone a little too far now and I m tired If you can t get over your grudge against me suppose we go across the river outside the town limits put our guns down and fight it out fist and skull I m your man said Dave eagerly Looking across the street Hale saw two men on the porch Come on he said The two men were Budd and the new town sergeant Sam he said this gentleman and I are going across the river to have a little friendly bout and I wish you d come along and you too Bill to see that Dave here gets fair play The sergeant spoke to Dave You don t need nobody to see that you git fair play with them two but I ll go long just the same Hardly a word was said as the four walked across the bridge and toward a thicket to the right Neither Budd nor the sergeant asked the nature of the trouble for either could have guessed what it was Dave tied his horse and like Hale stripped off his coat The sergeant took charge of Dave s pistol and Budd of Hale s All you ve got to do is to keep him away from you said Budd If he gets his hands on you you re gone You know how they fight rough and tumble Hale nodded he knew all that himself and when he looked at Dave s sturdy neck and gigantic shoulders he knew further that if the mountaineer got him in his grasp he would have to gasp enough in a hurry or be saved by Budd from being throttled to death Are you ready Again Hale nodded Go ahead Dave growled the sergeant for the job was not to his liking Dave did not plunge toward Hale as the three others expected On the contrary he assumed the conventional attitude of the boxer and advanced warily using his head as a diagnostician for Hale s points and Hale remembered suddenly that Dave had been away at school for a year Dave knew something of the game and the honorable Sam straightway was anxious when the mountaineer ducked and swung his left Budd s heart thumped and he almost shrank himself from the terrific sweep of the big fist God he muttered for had the fist caught Hale s head it must it seemed have crushed it like an egg shell Hale coolly withdrew his head not more than an inch it seemed to Budd s practised eye and jabbed his right with a lightning uppercut into Dave s jaw that made the mountaineer reel backward with a grunt of rage and pain and when he followed it up with a swing of his left on Dave s right eye and another terrific jolt with his right on the left jaw and Budd saw the crazy rage in the mountaineer s face he felt easy In that rage Dave forgot his science as the honorable Sam expected and with a bellow he started at Hale like a cave dweller to bite tear and throttle but the lithe figure before him swayed this way and that like a shadow and with every side step a fist crushed on the mountaineer s nose chin or jaw until blinded with blood and fury Dave staggered aside toward the sergeant with the cry of a madman Gimme my gun I ll kill him Gimme my gun And when the sergeant sprang forward and caught the mountaineer he dropped weeping with rage and shame to the ground You two just go back to town said the sergeant I ll take keer of him Quick and he shook his head as Hale advanced He ain t goin to shake hands with you The two turned back across the bridge and Hale went on to Budd s office to do what he was setting out to do when young Dave came There he had the lawyer make out a deed in which the cabin in Lonesome Cove and the acres about it were conveyed in fee simple to June her heirs and assigns forever but the girl must not know until Hale said her father dies or I die or she marries When he came out the sergeant was passing the door Ain t no use fightin with one o them fellers thataway he said shaking his head If he whoops you he ll crow over you as long as he lives and if you whoop him he ll kill ye the fust chance he gets You ll have to watch that feller as long as you live specially when he s drinking He ll remember that lickin and want revenge fer it till the grave One of you has got to die some day shore And the sergeant was right Dave was going through the Gap at that moment cursing swaying like a drunken man firing his pistol and shouting his revenge to the echoing gray walls that took up his cries and sent them shrieking on the wind up every dark ravine All the way up the mountain he was cursing Under the gentle voice of the big Pine he was cursing still and when his lips stopped his heart was beating curses as he dropped down the other side of the mountain When he reached the river he got off his horse and bathed his mouth and his eyes again and he cursed afresh when the blood started afresh at his lips again For a while he sat there in his black mood undecided whether he should go to his uncle s cabin or go on home But he had seen a woman s figure in the garden as he came down the spur and the thought of June drew him to the cabin in spite of his shame and the questions that were sure to be asked When he passed around the clump of rhododendrons at the creek June was in the garden still She was pruning a rose bush with Bub s penknife and when she heard him coming she wheeled quivering She had been waiting for him all day and like an angry goddess she swept fiercely toward him Dave pretended not to see her but when he swung from his horse and lifted his sullen eyes he shrank as though she had lashed him across them with a whip Her eyes blazed with murderous fire from her white face the penknife in her hand was clenched as though for a deadly purpose and on her trembling lips was the same question that she had asked him at the mill Have you done it this time she whispered and then she saw his swollen mouth and his battered eye Her fingers relaxed about the handle of the knife the fire in her eyes went swiftly down and with a smile that was half pity half contempt she turned away She could not have told the whole truth better in words even to Dave and as he looked after her his every pulse beat was a new curse and if at that minute he could have had Hale s heart he would have eaten it like a savage raw For a minute he hesitated with reins in hand as to whether he should turn now and go back to the Gap to settle with Hale and then he threw the reins over a post He could bide his time yet a little longer for a crafty purpose suddenly entered his brain Bub met him at the door of the cabin and his eyes opened What s the matter Dave Oh nothin he said carelessly My hoss stumbled comin down the mountain an I went clean over his head He raised one hand to his mouth and still Bub was suspicious Looks like you been in a fight The boy began to laugh but Dave ignored him and went on into the cabin Within he sat where he could see through the open door Whar you been Dave asked old Judd from the corner Just then he saw June coming and pretending to draw on his pipe he waited until she had sat down within ear shot on the edge of the porch Who do you reckon owns this house and two hundred acres o land roundabouts The girl s heart waited apprehensively and she heard her father s deep voice The company owns it Dave laughed harshly Not much John Hale The heart out on the porch leaped with gladness now He bought it from the company It s just as well you re goin away Uncle Judd He d put you out I reckon not I got writin from the company which lows me to stay here two year or more if I want to I don t know He s a slick one I heerd him say put in Bub stoutly that he d see that we stayed here jus as long as we pleased Well said old Judd shortly ef we stay here by his favour we won t stay long There was silence for a while Then Dave spoke again for the listening ears outside maliciously I went over to the Gap to see if I couldn t git the place myself from the company I believe the Falins ain t goin to bother us an I ain t hankerin to go West But I told him that you all was goin to leave the mountains and goin out thar fer good There was another silence He never said a word Nobody had asked the question but he was answering the unspoken one in the heart of June and that heart sank like a stone He s goin away hisself goin ter morrow goin to that same place he went before England some feller called it Dave had done his work well June rose unsteadily and with one hand on her heart and the other clutching the railing of the porch she crept noiselessly along it staggered like a wounded thing around the chimney through the garden and on still clutching her heart to the woods there to sob it out on the breast of the only mother she had ever known Dave was gone when she came back from the woods calm dry eyed pale Her step mother had kept her dinner for her and when she said she wanted nothing to eat the old woman answered something querulous to which June made no answer but went quietly to cleaning away the dishes For a while she sat on the porch and presently she went into her room and for a few moments she rocked quietly at her window Hale was going away next day and when he came back she would be gone and she would never see him again A dry sob shook her body of a sudden she put both hands to her head and with wild eyes she sprang to her feet and catching up her bonnet slipped noiselessly out the back door With hands clenched tight she forced herself to walk slowly across the foot bridge but when the bushes hid her she broke into a run as though she were crazed and escaping a madhouse At the foot of the spur she turned swiftly up the mountain and climbed madly with one hand tight against the little cross at her throat He was going away and she must tell him she must tell him what Behind her a voice was calling the voice that pleaded all one night for her not to leave him that had made that plea a daily prayer and it had come from an old man wounded broken in health and heart and her father Hale s face was before her but that voice was behind and as she climbed the face that she was nearing grew fainter the voice she was leaving sounded the louder in her ears and when she reached the big Pine she dropped helplessly at the base of it sobbing With her tears the madness slowly left her the old determination came back again and at last the old sad peace The sunlight was slanting at a low angle when she rose to her feet and stood on the cliff overlooking the valley her lips parted as when she stood there first and the tiny drops drying along the roots of her dull gold hair And being there for the last time she thought of that time when she was first there ages ago The great glare of light that she looked for then had come and gone There was the smoking monster rushing into the valley and sending echoing shrieks through the hills but there was no booted stranger and no horse issuing from the covert of maple where the path disappeared A long time she stood there with a wandering look of farewell to every familiar thing before her but not a tear came now Only as she turned away at last her breast heaved and fell with one long breath that was all Passing the Pine slowly she stopped and turned back to it unclasping the necklace from her throat With trembling fingers she detached from it the little luck piece that Hale had given her the tear of a fairy that had turned into a tiny cross of stone when a strange messenger brought to the Virginia valley the story of the crucifixion The penknife was still in her pocket and opening it she went behind the Pine and dug a niche as high and as deep as she could toward its soft old heart In there she thrust the tiny symbol whispering I want all the luck you could ever give me little cross for HIM Then she pulled the fibres down to cover it from sight and crossing her hands over the opening she put her forehead against them and touched her lips to the tree Illustration Keep it Safe Old Pine Frontispiece Keep it safe old Pine Then she lifted her face looking upward along its trunk to the blue sky And bless him dear God and guard him evermore She clutched her heart as she turned and she was clutching it when she passed into the shadows below leaving the old Pine to whisper when he passed her love Next day the word went round to the clan that the Tollivers would start in a body one week later for the West At daybreak that morning Uncle Billy and his wife mounted the old gray horse and rode up the river to say good by They found the cabin in Lonesome Cove deserted Many things were left piled in the porch the Tollivers had left apparently in a great hurry and the two old people were much mystified Not until noon did they learn what the matter was Only the night before a Tolliver had shot a Falin and the Falins had gathered to get revenge on Judd that night The warning word had been brought to Lonesome Cove by Loretta Tolliver and it had come straight from young Buck Falin himself So June and old Judd and Bub had fled in the night At that hour they were on their way to the railroad old Judd at the head of his clan his right arm still bound to his side his bushy beard low on his breast June and Bub on horseback behind him the rest strung out behind them and in a wagon at the end with all her household effects the little old woman in black who would wait no longer for the Red Fox to arise from the dead Loretta alone was missing She was on her way with young Buck Falin to the railroad on the other side of the mountains Between them not a living soul disturbed the dead stillness of Lonesome Cove XXXII All winter the cabin in Lonesome Cove slept through rain and sleet and snow and no foot passed its threshold Winter broke floods came and warm sunshine A pale green light stole through the trees shy ethereal and so like a mist that it seemed at any moment on the point of floating upward Colour came with the wild flowers and song with the wood thrush Squirrels played on the tree trunks like mischievous children the brooks sang like happy human voices through the tremulous underworld and woodpeckers hammered out the joy of spring but the awakening only made the desolate cabin lonelier still After three warm days in March Uncle Billy the miller rode up the creek with a hoe over his shoulder he had promised this to Hale for his labour of love in June s garden Weeping April passed May came with rosy face uplifted and with the birth of June the laurel emptied its pink flecked cups and the rhododendron blazed the way for the summer s coming with white stars Back to the hills came Hale then and with all their rich beauty they were as desolate as when he left them bare with winter for his mission had miserably failed His train creaked and twisted around the benches of the mountains and up and down ravines into the hills The smoke rolled in as usual through the windows and doors There was the same crowd of children slatternly women and tobacco spitting men in the dirty day coaches and Hale sat among them for a Pullman was no longer attached to the train that ran to the Gap As he neared the bulk of Powell s mountain and ran along its mighty flank he passed the ore mines At each one the commissary was closed the cheap dingy little houses stood empty on the hillsides and every now and then he would see a tipple and an empty car left as it was after dumping its last load of red ore On the right as he approached the station the big furnace stood like a dead giant still and smokeless and the piles of pig iron were red with rust The same little dummy wheezed him into the dead little town Even the face of the Gap was a little changed by the gray scar that man had slashed across its mouth getting limestone for the groaning monster of a furnace that was now at peace The streets were deserted A new face fronted him at the desk of the hotel and the eyes of the clerk showed no knowledge of him when he wrote his name His supper was coarse greasy and miserable his room was cold steam heat it seemed had been given up the sheets were ill smelling the mouth of the pitcher was broken and the one towel had seen much previous use But the water was the same as was the cool pungent night air both blessed of God and they were the sole comforts that were his that night The next day it was as though he were arranging his own funeral with but little hope of a resurrection The tax collector met him when he came downstairs having seen his name on the register You know he said I ll have to add five per cent next month Hale smiled That won t be much more he said and the collector a new one laughed good naturedly and with understanding turned away Mechanically he walked to the Club but there was no club then on to the office of The Progress the paper that was the boast of the town The Progress was defunct and the brilliant editor had left the hills A boy with an ink smeared face was setting type and a pallid gentleman with glasses was languidly working a hand press A pile of fresh smelling papers lay on a table and after a question or two he picked up one Two of its four pages were covered with announcements of suits and sales to satisfy judgments the printing of which was the raison d etre of the noble sheet Down the column his eye caught John Hale et al John Hale et al and he wondered why the others should be so persistently anonymous There was a cloud of them thicker than the smoke of coke ovens He had breathed that thickness for a long time but he got a fresh sense of suffocation now Toward the post office he moved Around the corner he came upon one of two brothers whom he remembered as carpenters He recalled his inability once to get that gentleman to hang a door for him He was a carpenter again now and he carried a saw and a plane There was grim humour in the situation The carpenter s brother had gone and he himself could hardly get enough work he said to support his family Goin to start that house of yours I think not said Hale Well I d like to get a contract for a chicken coop just to keep my hand in

none	none	So long Git up Wheel spokes whirred in the air and he saw a buggy with the top down rattling down another street in a cloud of dust It was the same buggy in which he had first seen the black bearded Senator seven years before It was the same horse too and the Arab like face and the bushy black whiskers save for streaks of gray were the same This was the man who used to buy watches and pianos by the dozen who one Xmas gave a present to every living man woman and child in the town and under whose colossal schemes the pillars of the church throughout the State stood as supports That far away the eagle nosed face looked haggard haunted and all but spent and even now he struck Hale as being driven downward like a madman by the same relentless energy that once had driven him upward It was the same story everywhere Nearly everybody who could get away was gone Some of these were young enough to profit by the lesson and take surer root elsewhere others were too old for transplanting and of them would be heard no more Others stayed for the reason that getting away was impossible These were living visible tragedies still hopeful pathetically unaware of the leading parts they were playing and still weakly waiting for a better day or sinking as by gravity back to the old trades they had practised before the boom A few sturdy souls the fittest survived undismayed Logan was there lawyer for the railroad and the coal company MacFarlan was a judge and two or three others too had come through unscathed in spirit and undaunted in resolution but gone were the young Bluegrass Kentuckians the young Tide water Virginians the New England school teachers the bankers real estate agents engineers gone the gamblers the wily Jews and the vagrant women that fringe the incoming tide of a new prosperity gone all gone Beyond the post office he turned toward the red brick house that sat above the mill pond Eagerly he looked for the old mill and he stopped in physical pain The dam had been torn away the old wheel was gone and a caved in roof and supporting walls drunkenly aslant were the only remnants left A red haired child stood at the gate before the red brick house and Hale asked her a question The little girl had never heard of the Widow Crane Then he walked toward his old office and bedroom There was a voice inside his old office when he approached a tall figure filled the doorway a pair of great goggles beamed on him like beacon lights in a storm and the honorable Sam Budd s hand and his were clasped over the gate It s all over Sam Don t you worry come on in The two sat on the porch Below it the dimpled river shone through the rhododendrons and with his eyes fixed on it the honorable Sam slowly approached the thought of each The old cabin in Lonesome Cove is just as the Tollivers left it None of them ever come back Budd shook his head

none	none	An hour later Hale was at the livery stable for a horse to ride to Lonesome Cove for he had sold his big black to help out expenses for the trip to England Old Dan Harris the stableman stood in the door and silently he pointed to a gray horse in the barn yard You know that hoss Yes You know whut s he here fer I ve heard Well I m lookin fer Dave every day now Well maybe I d better ride Dave s horse now said Hale jestingly I wish you would said old Dan No said Hale if he s coming I ll leave the horse so that he can get to me as quickly as possible You might send me word Uncle Dan ahead so that he can t waylay me I ll do that very thing said the old man seriously I was joking Uncle Dan
3738_176682_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 But I ain t 
none	none	The matter was out of Hale s head before he got through the great Gap How the memories thronged of June June June YOU DIDN T GIVE HER A CHANCE 
3738_176682_000067_000000	train-clean-360	That was what Budd said 
3738_176682_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Well had he given her a chance 
none	none	Why shouldn t he go to her and give her the chance now He shook his shoulders at the thought and laughed with some bitterness He hadn t the car fare for half way across the continent and even if he had he was a promising candidate for matrimony and again he shook his shoulders and settled his soul for his purpose He would get his things together and leave those hills forever How lonely had been his trip how lonely was the God forsaken little town behind him How lonely the road and hills and the little white clouds in the zenith straight above him and how unspeakably lonely the green dome of the great Pine that shot into view from the north as he turned a clump of rhododendron with uplifted eyes Not a breath of air moved The green expanse about him swept upward like a wave but unflecked motionless except for the big Pine which that far away looked like a bit of green spray spouting on its very crest Old man he muttered you know you know And as to a brother he climbed toward it No wonder they call you Lonesome he said as he went upward into the bright stillness and when he dropped into the dark stillness of shadow and forest gloom on the other side he said again My God no wonder they call you Lonesome And still the memories of June thronged at the brook at the river and when he saw the smokeless chimney of the old cabin he all but groaned aloud But he turned away from it unable to look again and went down the river toward Uncle Billy s mill Old honorable threw her arms around him and kissed him John said Uncle Billy I ve got three hundred dollars in a old yarn sock under one of them hearthstones and its yourn Ole honorable says so too Hale choked I want ye to go to June Dave ll worry her down and git her if you don t go and if he don t worry her down he ll come back an try to kill ye I ve always thought one of ye would have to die fer that gal an I want it to be Dave You two have got to fight it out some day and you mought as well meet him out thar as here You didn t give that little gal a fair chance John an I want you to go to June No I can t take your money Uncle Billy God bless you and old honorable I m going I don t know where and I m going now XXXIII Clouds were gathering as Hale rode up the river after telling old honorable and Uncle Billy good by He had meant not to go to the cabin in Lonesome Cove but when he reached the forks of the road he stopped his horse and sat in indecision with his hands folded on the pommel of his saddle and his eyes on the smokeless chimney The memories tugging at his heart drew him irresistibly on for it was the last time At a slow walk he went noiselessly through the deep sand around the clump of rhododendron The creek was clear as crystal once more but no geese cackled and no dog barked The door of the spring house gaped wide the barn door sagged on its hinges the yard fence swayed drunkenly and the cabin was still as a gravestone But the garden was alive and he swung from his horse at the gate and with his hands clasped behind his back walked slowly through it June s garden The garden he had planned and planted for June that they had tended together and apart and that thanks to the old miller s care was the one thing save the sky above left in spirit unchanged The periwinkles pink and white were almost gone The flags were at half mast and sinking fast The annunciation lilies were bending their white foreheads to the near kiss of death but the pinks were fragrant the poppies were poised on slender stalks like brilliant butterflies at rest the hollyhocks shook soundless pink bells to the wind roses as scarlet as June s lips bloomed everywhere and the richness of mid summer was at hand Quietly Hale walked the paths taking a last farewell of plant and flower and only the sudden patter of raindrops made him lift his eyes to the angry sky The storm was coming now in earnest and he had hardly time to lead his horse to the barn and dash to the porch when the very heavens with a crash of thunder broke loose Sheet after sheet swept down the mountains like wind driven clouds of mist thickening into water as they came The shingles rattled as though with the heavy slapping of hands the pines creaked and the sudden dusk outside made the cabin when he pushed the door open as dark as night Kindling a fire he lit his pipe and waited The room was damp and musty but the presence of June almost smothered him Once he turned his face June s door was ajar and the key was in the lock He rose to go to it and look within and then dropped heavily back into his chair He was anxious to get away now to get to work Several times he rose restlessly and looked out the window Once he went outside and crept along the wall of the cabin to the east and the west but there was no break of light in the murky sky and he went back to pipe and fire By and by the wind died and the rain steadied into a dogged downpour He knew what that meant there would be no letting up now in the storm and for another night he was a prisoner So he went to his saddle pockets and pulled out a cake of chocolate a can of potted ham and some crackers munched his supper went to bed and lay there with sleepless eyes while the lights and shadows from the wind swayed fire flicked about him After a while his body dozed but his racked brain went seething on in an endless march of fantastic dreams in which June was the central figure always until of a sudden young Dave leaped into the centre of the stage in the dream tragedy forming in his brain They were meeting face to face at last and the place was the big Pine Dave s pistol flashed and his own stuck in the holster as he tried to draw There was a crashing report and he sprang upright in bed but it was a crash of thunder that wakened him and that in that swift instant perhaps had caused his dream The wind had come again and was driving the rain like soft bullets against the wall of the cabin next which he lay He got up threw another stick of wood on the fire and sat before the leaping blaze curiously disturbed but not by the dream Somehow he was again in doubt was he going to stick it out in the mountains after all and if he should was not the reason deep down in his soul the foolish hope that June would come back again No he thought searching himself fiercely that was not the reason He honestly did not know what his duty to her was what even was his inmost wish and almost with a groan he paced the floor to and fro Meantime the storm raged A tree crashed on the mountainside and the lightning that smote it winked into the cabin so like a mocking malignant eye that he stopped in his tracks threw open the door and stepped outside as though to face an enemy The storm was majestic and his soul went into the mighty conflict of earth and air whose beginning and end were in eternity The very mountain tops were rimmed with zigzag fire which shot upward splitting a sky that was as black as a nether world and under it the great trees swayed like willows under rolling clouds of gray rain One fiery streak lit up for an instant the big Pine and seemed to dart straight down upon its proud tossing crest For a moment the beat of the watcher s heart and the flight of his soul stopped still A thunderous crash came slowly to his waiting ears another flash came and Hale stumbled with a sob back into the cabin God s finger was pointing the way now the big Pine was no more XXXIV The big Pine was gone He had seen it first one morning at daybreak when the valley on the other side was a sea of mist that threw soft clinging spray to the very mountain tops for even above the mists that morning its mighty head arose sole visible proof that the earth still slept beneath He had seen it at noon but little less majestic among the oaks that stood about it had seen it catching the last light at sunset clean cut against the after glow and like a dark silent mysterious sentinel guarding the mountain pass under the moon He had seen it giving place with sombre dignity to the passing burst of spring had seen it green among dying autumn leaves green in the gray of winter trees and still green in a shroud of snow a changeless promise that the earth must wake to life again It had been the beacon that led him into Lonesome Cove the beacon that led June into the outer world From it her flying feet had carried her into his life past it the same feet had carried her out again It had been their trysting place had kept their secrets like a faithful friend and had stood to him as the changeless symbol of their love It had stood a mute but sympathetic witness of his hopes his despairs and the struggles that lay between them In dark hours it had been a silent comforter and in the last year it had almost come to symbolize his better self as to that self he came slowly back And in the darkest hour it was the last friend to whom he had meant to say good by Now it was gone Always he had lifted his eyes to it every morning when he rose but now next morning he hung back consciously as one might shrink from looking at the face of a dead friend and when at last he raised his head to look upward to it an impenetrable shroud of mist lay between them and he was glad And still he could not leave The little creek was a lashing yellow torrent and his horse heavily laden as he must be could hardly swim with his weight too across so swift a stream But mountain streams were like June s temper up quickly and quickly down so it was noon before he plunged into the tide with his saddle pockets over one shoulder and his heavy transit under one arm Even then his snorting horse had to swim a few yards and he reached the other bank soaked to his waist line But the warm sun came out just as he entered the woods and as he climbed the mists broke about him and scudded upward like white sails before a driving wind Once he looked back from a fire scald in the woods at the lonely cabin in the cove but it gave him so keen a pain that he would not look again The trail was slippery and several times he had to stop to let his horse rest and to slow the beating of his own heart But the sunlight leaped gladly from wet leaf to wet leaf until the trees looked decked out for unseen fairies and the birds sang as though there was nothing on earth but joy for all its creatures and the blue sky smiled above as though it had never bred a lightning flash or a storm Hale dreaded the last spur before the little Gap was visible but he hurried up the steep and when he lifted his apprehensive eyes the gladness of the earth was as nothing to the sudden joy in his own heart The big Pine stood majestic still unscathed as full of divinity and hope to him as a rainbow in an eastern sky Hale dropped his reins lifted one hand to his dizzy head let his transit to the ground and started for it on a run Across the path lay a great oak with a white wound running the length of its mighty body from crest to shattered trunk and over it he leaped and like a child caught his old friend in both arms After all he was not alone One friend would be with him till death on that border line between the world in which he was born and the world he had tried to make his own and he could face now the old one again with a stouter heart There it lay before him with its smoke and fire and noise and slumbering activities just awakening to life again He lifted his clenched fist toward it You got ME once he muttered but this time I ll get YOU He turned quickly and decisively there would be no more delay And he went back and climbed over the big oak that instead of his friend had fallen victim to the lightning s kindly whim and led his horse out into the underbrush As he approached within ten yards of the path a metallic note rang faintly on the still air the other side of the Pine and down the mountain Something was coming up the path so he swiftly knotted his bridle reins around a sapling stepped noiselessly into the path and noiselessly slipped past the big tree where he dropped to his knees crawled forward and lay flat peering over the cliff and down the winding trail He had not long to wait A riderless horse filled the opening in the covert of leaves that swallowed up the path It was gray and he knew it as he knew the saddle as his old enemy s Dave Dave had kept his promise he had come back The dream was coming true and they were to meet at last face to face One of them was to strike a trail more lonesome than the Trail of the Lonesome Pine and that man would not be John Hale One detail of the dream was going to be left out he thought grimly and very quietly he drew his pistol cocked it sighted it on the opening it was an easy shot and waited He would give that enemy no more chance than he would a mad dog or would he The horse stopped to browse He waited so long that he began to suspect a trap He withdrew his head and looked about him on either side and behind listening intently for the cracking of a twig or a footfall He was about to push backward to avoid possible attack from the rear when a shadow shot from the opening His face paled and looked sick of a sudden his clenched fingers relaxed about the handle of his pistol and he drew it back still cocked turned on his knees walked past the Pine and by the fallen oak stood upright waiting He heard a low whistle calling to the horse below and a shudder ran through him He heard the horse coming up the path he clenched his pistol convulsively and his eyes lit by an unearthly fire and fixed on the edge of the bowlder around which they must come burned an instant later on June At the cry she gave he flashed a hunted look right and left stepped swiftly to one side and stared past her still at the bowlder She had dropped the reins and started toward him but at the Pine she stopped short Where is he Her lips opened to answer but no sound came Hale pointed at the horse behind her That s his He sent me word He left that horse in the valley to ride over here when he came back to kill me Are you with him For a moment she thought from his wild face that he had gone crazy and she stared silently Then she seemed to understand and with a moan she covered her face with her hands and sank weeping in a heap at the foot of the Pine The forgotten pistol dropped full cocked to the soft earth and Hale with bewildered eyes went slowly to her Don t cry he said gently starting to call her name Don t cry he repeated and he waited helplessly He s dead Dave was shot out West she sobbed I told him I was coming back He gave me his horse Oh how could you Why did you come back he asked and she shrank as though he had struck her but her sobs stopped and she rose to her feet Wait she said and she turned from him to wipe her eyes with her handerchief Then she faced him When dad died I learned everything You made him swear never to tell me and he kept his word until he was on his death bed YOU did everything for me It was YOUR money YOU gave me back the old cabin in the Cove It was always you you YOU and there was never anybody else but you She stopped for Hale s face was as though graven from stone And you came back to tell me that Yes You could have written that Yes she faltered but I had to tell you face to face Is that all Again the tears were in her eyes No she said tremulously Then I ll say the rest for you You wanted to come to tell me of the shame you felt when you knew she nodded violently but you could have written that too and I could have written that you mustn t feel that way that he spoke slowly you mustn t rob me of the dearest happiness I ever knew in my whole life I knew you would say that she said like a submissive child The sternness left his face and he was smiling now And you wanted to say that the only return you could make was to come back and be my wife Yes she faltered again I did feel that I did You could have written that too but you thought you had to PROVE it by coming back yourself This time she nodded no assent and her eyes were streaming He turned away stretching out his arms to the woods God Not that no no Listen Jack As suddenly his arms dropped She had controlled her tears but her lips were quivering No Jack not that thank God I came because I wanted to come she said steadily I loved you when I went away I ve loved you every minute since her arms were stealing about his neck her face was upturned to his and her eyes moist with gladness were looking into his wondering eyes and I love you now Jack June The leaves about them caught his cry and quivered with the joy of it and above their heads the old Pine breathed its blessing with the name June June June XXXV With a mystified smile but with no question Hale silently handed his penknife to June and when smiling but without a word she walked behind the old Pine he followed her There he saw her reach up and dig the point of the knife into the trunk and when as he wonderingly watched her she gave a sudden cry Hale sprang toward her In the hole she was digging he saw the gleam of gold and then her trembling fingers brought out before his astonished eyes the little fairy stone that he had given her long ago She had left it there for him she said through tears and through his own tears Hale pointed to the stricken oak It saved the Pine he said And you said June And you repeated Hale solemnly and while he looked long at her her arms dropped slowly to her sides and he said simply Come Leading the horses they walked noiselessly through the deep sand around the clump of rhododendron and there sat the little cabin of Lonesome Cove The holy hush of a cathedral seemed to shut it in from the world so still it was below the great trees that stood like sentinels on eternal guard Both stopped and June laid her head on Hale s shoulder and they simply looked in silence Dear old home she said with a little sob and Hale still silent drew her to him You were never coming back again I was never coming back again She clutched his arm fiercely as though even now something might spirit him away and she clung to him while he hitched the horses and while they walked up the path Why the garden is just as I left it The very same flowers in the very same places Hale smiled Why not I had Uncle Billy do that Oh you dear you dear Her little room was shuttered tight as it always had been when she was away and as usual the front door was simply chained on the outside The girl turned with a happy sigh and looked about at the nodding flowers and the woods and the gleaming pool of the river below and up the shimmering mountain to the big Pine topping it with sombre majesty Dear old Pine she murmured and almost unconsciously she unchained the door as she had so often done before stepped into the dark room pulling Hale with one hand after her and almost unconsciously reaching upward with the other to the right of the door Then she cried aloud My key my key is there That was in case you should come back some day Oh I might I might and think if I had come too late think if I hadn t come now Again her voice broke and still holding Hale s arm she moved to her own door She had to use both hands there but before she let go she said almost hysterically It s so dark You won t leave me dear if I let you go For answer Hale locked his arms around her and when the door opened he went in ahead of her and pushed open the shutters The low sun flooded the room and when Hale turned June was looking with wild eyes from one thing to another in the room her rocking chair at a window her sewing close by a book on the table her bed made up in the corner her washstand of curly maple the pitcher full of water and clean towels hanging from the rack Hale had gotten out the things she had packed away and the room was just as she had always kept it She rushed to him weeping It would have killed me she sobbed It would have killed me She strained him tightly to her her wet face against his cheek Think think if I hadn t come now Then loosening herself she went all about the room with a caressing touch to everything as though it were alive The book was the volume of Keats he had given her which had been loaned to Loretta before June went away Oh I wrote for it and wrote for it she said I found it in the post office said Hale and I understood She went over to the bed Oh she said with a happy laugh You ve got one slip inside out and she whipped the pillow from its place changed it and turned down the edge of the covers in a triangle That s the way I used to leave it she said shyly Hale smiled I never noticed that She turned to the bureau and pulled open a drawer In there were white things with frills and blue ribbons and she flushed Oh she said these haven t even been touched Again Hale smiled but he said nothing One glance had told him there were things in that drawer too sacred for his big hands I m so happy so happy Suddenly she looked him over from head to foot his rough riding boots old riding breeches and blue flannel shirt I am pretty rough he said She flushed shook her head and looked down at her smart cloth suit of black Oh you are all right but you must go out now just for a little while What are you up to little girl How I love to hear that again Aren t you afraid I ll run away he said at the door I m not afraid of anything else in this world any more Well I won t He heard her moving around as he sat planning on the porch To morrow he thought and then an idea struck him that made him dizzy From within June cried Here I am and out she ran in the last crimson gown of her young girlhood her sleeves rolled up and her hair braided down her back as she used to wear it You ve made up my bed and I m going to make yours and I m going to cook your supper why what s the matter Hale s face was radiant with the heaven born idea that lighted it and he seemed hardly to notice the change she had made He came over and took her in his arms Ah sweetheart my sweetheart A spasm of anxiety tightened her throat but Hale laughed from sheer delight Never you mind It s a secret and he stood back to look at hen She blushed as his eyes went downward to her perfect ankles It is too short she said No no no Not for me You re mine now little girl mine do you understand that Yes she whispered her mouth trembling Again he laughed joyously Come on he cried and he went into the kitchen and brought out an axe I ll cut wood for you She followed him out to the wood pile and then she turned and went into the house Presently the sound of his axe rang through the woods and as he stooped to gather up the wood he heard a creaking sound June was drawing water at the well and he rushed toward her Here you mustn t do that She flashed a happy smile at him You just go back and get that wood I reckon she used the word purposely I ve done this afore Her strong bare arms were pulling the leaking moss covered old bucket swiftly up hand under hand so he got the wood while she emptied the bucket into a pail and together they went laughing into the kitchen and while he built the fire June got out the coffee grinder and the meal to mix and settled herself with the grinder in her lap Oh isn t it fun She stopped grinding suddenly What would the neighbours say We haven t any But if we had Terrible said Hale with mock solemnity I wonder if Uncle Billy is at home Hale trembled at his luck That s a good idea I ll ride down for him while you re getting supper No you won t said June I can t spare you Is that old horn here yet Hale brought it out from behind the cupboard I can get him if he is at home Hale followed her out to the porch where she put her red mouth to the old trumpet One long mellow hoot rang down the river and up the hills Then there were three short ones and a single long blast again That s the old signal she said And he ll know I want him bad Then she laughed He may think he s dreaming so I ll blow for him again And she did There now she said He ll come It was well she did blow again for the old miller was not at home and old honorable down at the cabin dropped her iron when she heard the horn and walked to the door dazed and listening Even when it came again she could hardly believe her ears and but for her rheumatism she would herself have started at once for Lonesome Cove As it was she ironed no more but sat in the doorway almost beside herself with anxiety and bewilderment looking down the road for the old miller to come home Back the two went into the kitchen and Hale sat at the door watching June as she fixed the table and made the coffee and corn bread Once only he disappeared and that was when suddenly a hen cackled and with a shout of laughter he ran out to come back with a fresh egg Now my lord said June her hair falling over her eyes and her face flushed from the heat No said Hale I m going to wait on you For the last time she pleaded and to please her he did sit down and every time she came to his side with something he bent to kiss the hand that served him You re nothing but a big nice boy she said Hale held out a lock of his hair near the temples and with one finger silently followed the track of wrinkles in his face It s premature she said and I love every one of them And she stooped to kiss him on the hair And those are nothing but troubles I m going to smooth every one of them away If they re troubles they ll go now said Hale All the time they talked of what they would do with Lonesome Cove Even if we do go away we ll come back once a year said Hale Yes nodded June once a year I ll tear down those mining shacks float them down the river and sell them as lumber Yes And I ll stock the river with bass again Yes And I ll plant young poplars to cover the sight of every bit of uptorn earth along the mountain there I ll bury every bottle and tin can in the Cove I ll take away every sign of civilization every sign of the outside world And leave old Mother Nature to cover up the scars said June So that Lonesome Cove will be just as it was Just as it was in the beginning echoed June And shall be to the end said Hale And there will never be anybody here but you And you said June While she cleared the table and washed the dishes Hale fed the horses and cut more wood and it was dusk when he came to the porch Through the door he saw that she had made his bed in one corner And through her door he saw one of the white things that had lain untouched in her drawer now stretched out on her bed The stars were peeping through the blue spaces of a white clouded sky and the moon would be coming by and by In the garden the flowers were dim quiet and restful A kingfisher screamed from the river An owl hooted in the woods and crickets chirped about them but every passing sound seemed only to accentuate the stillness in which they were engulfed Close together they sat on the old porch and she made him tell of everything that had happened since she left the mountains and she told him of her flight from the mountains and her life in the West of her father s death and the homesickness of the ones who still were there Illustration She made him tell of everything four hundred forty four Bub is a cowboy and wouldn t come back for the world but I could never have been happy there she said even if it hadn t been for you here I m just a plain civil engineer now said Hale an engineer without even a job and his face darkened It s a shame sweetheart for you She put one hand over his lips and with the other turned his face so that she could look into his eyes In the mood of bitterness they did show worn hollow and sad and around them the wrinkles were deep Silly she said tracing them gently with her finger tips I love every one of them too and she leaned over and kissed them We re going to be happy each and every day and all day long We ll live at the Gap in winter and I ll teach No you won t Then I ll teach you to be patient and how little I care for anything else in the world while I ve got you and I ll teach you to care for nothing else while you ve got me And you ll have me dear forever and ever Amen said Hale Something rang out in the darkness far down the river and both sprang to their feet It s Uncle Billy cried June and she lifted the old horn to her lips With the first blare of it a cheery halloo answered and a moment later they could see a gray horse coming up the road coming at a gallop and they went down to the gate and waited Hello Uncle Billy cried June The old man answered with a fox hunting yell and Hale stepped behind a bush Jumping Jehosophat is that you June Air ye all right Yes Uncle Billy The old man climbed off his horse with a groan Lordy Lordy Lordy but I was skeered He had his hands on June s shoulders and was looking at her with a bewildered face What air ye doin here alone baby June s eyes shone Nothing Uncle Billy Hale stepped into sight Oh ho I see You back an he ain t gone Well bless my soul if this ain t the beatenest he looked from the one to the other and his kind old face beamed with a joy that was but little less than their own You come back to stay My where s that horn I want it right now Ole honorable down thar is a thinkin she s gone crazy and I thought she shorely was when she said she heard you blow that horn An she tol me the minute I got here if hit was you to blow three times And straightway three blasts rang down the river Now she s all right if she don t die o curiosity afore I git back and tell her why you come Why did you come back baby Gimme a drink o water son I reckon me an that ole hoss hain t travelled sech a gait in five year June was whispering something to the old man when Hale came back and what it was the old man s face told plainly Yes Uncle Billy right away said Hale Just as soon as you can git yo license Hale nodded An June says I m goin to do It Yes said Hale right away Again June had to tell the story to Uncle Billy that she had told to Hale and to answer his questions and it was an hour before the old miller rose to go Hale called him then into June s room and showed him a piece of paper Is it good now he asked The old man put on his spectacles looked at it and chuckled Just as good as the day you got hit Well can t you Right now Does June know Not yet I m going to tell her now June he called Yes dear Uncle Billy moved hurriedly to the door You just wait till I git out o here He met June in the outer room Where are you going Uncle Billy Go on baby he said hurrying by her I ll be back in a minute She stopped in the doorway her eyes wide again with sudden anxiety but Hale was smiling You remember what you said at the Pine dear The girl nodded and she was smiling now when with sweet seriousness she said again Your least wish is now law to me my lord Well I m going to test it now I ve laid a trap for you She shook her head And you ve walked right into it I m glad She noticed now the crumpled piece of paper in his hand and she thought it was some matter of business Oh she said reproachfully You aren t going to bother with anything of that kind now Yes he said I want you to look over this Very well she said resignedly He was holding the paper out to her and she took it and held it to the light of the candle Her face flamed and she turned remorseful eyes upon him And you ve kept that too you had it when I When you were wiser maybe than you are now God save me from ever being such a fool again Tears started in her eyes You haven t forgiven me she cried Uncle Billy says it s as good now as it was then He was looking at her queerly now and his smile was gone Slowly his meaning came to her like the flush that spread over her face and throat She drew in one long quivering breath and with parted lips and her great shining eyes wide she looked at him Now she whispered Now he said Her eyes dropped to the coarse gown she lifted both hands for a moment to her hair and unconsciously she began to roll one crimson sleeve down her round white arm No said Hale just as you are She went to him then put her arms about his neck and with head thrown back she looked at him long with steady eyes Yes she breathed out just as you are and now Uncle Billy was waiting for them on the porch and when they came out he rose to his feet and they faced him hand in hand The moon had risen The big Pine stood guard on high against the outer world Nature was their church and stars were their candles And as if to give them even a better light the moon had sent a luminous sheen down the dark mountainside to the very garden in which the flowers whispered like waiting happy friends Uncle Billy lifted his hand and a hush of expectancy seemed to come even from the farthest star
