on a cold and rainy night towards the end of October eighteen thirty eight that a tall and powerful man with an old broad brimmed straw hat upon his head and clad in a blue cotton carter s frock which hung loosely over trousers of the same material crossed the Pont au Change and darted with a hasty step into the Cite that labyrinth of obscure narrow and winding streets which extends from the Palais de Justice to Notre Dame one Tapis franc literally a free carpet a low haunt equivalent to what in English slang is termed a boozing ken Although limited in space and carefully watched this quarter serves as the lurking place or rendezvous of a vast number of the very dregs of society in Paris who flock to the tapis franc This word in the slang of theft and murder signifies a drinking shop of the lowest class A returned convict who in this foul phraseology is called an ogre or a woman in the same degraded state who is termed an ogress generally keep such cribs frequented by the refuse of the Parisian population freed felons thieves and assassins are there familiar guests If a crime is committed it is here in this filthy sewer that the police throws its cast net and rarely fails to catch the criminals it seeks to take On the night in question the wind howled fiercely in the dark and dirty gullies of the Cite the blinking and uncertain light of the lamps which swung to and fro in the sudden gusts were dimly reflected in pools of black slush which flowed abundantly in the midst of the filthy pavement The murky coloured houses which were lighted within by a few panes of glass in the worm eaten casements overhung each other so closely that the eaves of each almost touched its opposite neighbour so narrow were the streets Dark and noisome alleys led to staircases still more black and foul and so perpendicular that they could hardly be ascended by the help of a cord fixed to the dank and humid walls by holdfasts of iron Stalls of charcoal sellers fruit sellers or venders of refuse meat occupied the ground floor of some of these wretched abodes Notwithstanding the small value of their commodities the fronts of nearly all these shops were protected by strong bars of iron a proof that the shopkeepers knew and dreaded the gentry who infested the vicinity The man of whom we have spoken having entered the Rue aux Feves which is in the centre of the Cite slackened his pace he felt he was on his own soil The night was dark and strong gusts of wind mingled with rain dashed against the walls Ten o clock struck by the distant dial of the Palais de Justice Women were huddled together under the vaulted arches deep and dark like caverns some hummed popular airs in a low key others conversed together in whispers whilst some dumb and motionless looked on mechanically at the wet which fell and flowed in torrents The man in the carter s frock stopping suddenly before one of these creatures silent and sad as she gazed seized her by the arm and said Ha good evening La Goualeuse two two Sweet throated in reference to the tone of her voice The girl receded saying in a faint and fearful tone Good evening Chourineur three Don t hurt me three One who strikes with the knife the stabber or slasher This man a liberated convict had been so named at the hulks Now I have you said the fellow you must pay me the glass of tape eau d aff or I ll make you dance without music he added with a hoarse and brutal laugh Oh Heaven I have no money replied Goualeuse trembling from head to foot for this man was the dread of the district If you re stumped the ogress of the tapis franc will give you tick for your pretty face She won t I already owe her for the clothes I m wearing What you want to shirk it shouted the Chourineur darting after La Goualeuse who had hid herself in a gully as murk as midnight Now then my lady I ve got you said the vagabond after groping about for a few moments and grasping in one of his coarse and powerful hands a slim and delicate wrist and now for the dance I promised you No it is you who shall dance was uttered by a masculine and deep voice A man Is t you Bras Rouge Speak why don t you and don t squeeze so hard I am here in the entrance to your ken and you it must be Tis not Bras Rouge said the voice Oh isn t it Well then if it is not a friend why here goes at you exclaimed the Chourineur But whose bit of a hand is it I have got hold of It must be a woman s It is the fellow to this responded the voice And under the delicate skin of this hand which grasped his throat with sudden ferocity the Chourineur felt himself held by nerves of iron The Goualeuse who had sought refuge in this alley and lightly ascended a few steps paused for an instant and said to her unknown defender Thanks sir for having taken my part The Chourineur said he would strike me because I could not pay for his glass of brandy but I think he only jested Now I am safe pray let him go Take care of yourself for he is the Chourineur If he be the Chourineur I am a bully boy who never knuckles down exclaimed the unknown All was then silent for a moment and then were heard for several seconds in the midst of the pitchy darkness sounds of a fierce struggle Who the devil is this then said the ruffian making a desperate effort to free himself from his adversary whose extraordinary power astonished him Now then now you shall pay both for La Goualeuse and yourself he shouted grinding his teeth Pay yes I will pay you but it shall be with my fists and it shall be cash in full replied the unknown If said the Chourineur in a stifled voice you do but let go my neckcloth I will bite your nose off My nose is too small my lad and you haven t light enough to see it Come under the hanging glim four there four Under the lamp called reverbere That I will replied the unknown for then we may look into the whites of each other s eyes He then made a desperate rush at the Chourineur whom he still held by the throat and forced him to the end of the alley and then thrust him violently into the street which was but dimly lighted by the suspended street lamp The bandit stumbled but rapidly recovering his feet he threw himself furiously upon the unknown whose slim and graceful form appeared to belie the possession of the irresistible strength he had displayed After a struggle of a few minutes the Chourineur although of athletic build and a first rate champion in a species of pugilism vulgarly termed the savate found that he had got what they call his master The unknown threw him twice with immense dexterity by what is called in wrestling the leg pass or crook Unwilling however to acknowledge the superiority of his adversary the Chourineur boiling with rage returned again to the charge Then the defender of La Goualeuse suddenly altering his mode of attack rained on the head and face of the bandit a shower of blows with his closed fist as hard and heavy as if stricken by a steel gauntlet These blows worthy of the admiration of Jem Belcher Dutch Sam Tom Cribb or any other celebrated English pugilist were so entirely different from the system of the savate that the Chourineur dropped like an ox on the pavement exclaiming as he fell I m floored Mon linge est lave Mon Dieu Mon Dieu Have pity on him exclaimed La Goualeuse who during the contest had ventured on the threshold of the alley adding with an air of astonishment But who are you then Except the Schoolmaster and Skeleton there is no one from the Rue Saint Eloi to Notre Dame who can stand against the Chourineur I thank you very very much sir for indeed I fear that without your aid he would have beaten me The unknown instead of replying listened with much attention to the voice of this girl Perhaps a tone more gentle sweet and silvery never fell on human ear He endeavoured to examine the features of La Goualeuse but the night was too dark and the beams of the street lamp too flickering and feeble After remaining for some minutes quite motionless the Chourineur shook his legs and arms and then partly rose from the ground Pray be on your guard exclaimed the Goualeuse retreating again into the dark passage and taking her champion by the arm take care or he will have his revenge on you Don t be frightened my child if he has not had enough I have more ready for him The brigand heard these words Thanks he murmured I m half throttled and one eye is closed that is quite enough for one day Some other time perhaps when we may meet again What not content yet grumbling still said the unknown with a menacing tone No no not at all I do not grumble in the least You have regularly served me out you are a lad of mettle said the Chourineur in a coarse tone but still with that sort of deference which physical superiority always finds in persons of his grade You are the better man that s clear Well except the Skeleton who seems to have bones of iron he is so thin and powerful and the Schoolmaster who could eat three Herculeses for his breakfast no man living could boast of having put his foot on my neck Well and what then Why now I have found my master that s all you will find yours some day sooner or later everybody does One thing however is certain now that you are a better man than the Chourineur you may go your length in the Cite All the women will be your slaves ogres and ogresses will give you credit if it is only for fear you may be a king in your way But who and what are you You patter flash like a family man If you are a prig I ll have nothing to do with you I have used the knife it is true because when the blood comes into my eyes I see red and I must strike in spite of myself but I have paid for my slashing by going to the hulks for fifteen years My time is up and I am free from surveillance I can now live in the capital without fear of the beaks and I have never prigged have I La Goualeuse No he was never a thief said the girl Come along then and let us have a glass of something together and I ll tell you who I am said the unknown Come don t let us bear malice Bear malice Devil a bit You are master I confess it You do know how to handle your fists I never knew anything like it Thunder and lightning how your thumps fell on my sconce I never felt anything like it Yours is a new game and you must teach it to me I will recommence whenever you like Not on me though thank ye not on me exclaimed the Chourineur laughing your blows fell as if from a sledge hammer I am still giddy from them But do you know Bras Rouge in whose passage you were Bras Rouge said the unknown who appeared disagreeably surprised at the question adding however with an indifferent air I do not know Bras Rouge Is he the only person who inhabits this abode It rained in torrents and I took shelter in the alley You meant to beat this poor girl and I have thrashed you that s all You re right I have nothing to do with your affairs Bras Rouge has a room here but does not occupy it often He is usually at his estaminet in the Champs Elysees But what s the good of talking about him Then turning to the Goualeuse On my word you are a good wench and I would not have beaten you you know I would not harm a child it was only my joke Never mind it was very good of you not to set on this friend of yours against me when I was down and at his mercy Come and drink with us he pays for all By the way my trump said he to the unknown what say you instead of going to tipple shall we go and have a crust for supper with the ogress at the White Rabbit It is a tapis franc With all my heart I will pay for the supper You ll come with us Goualeuse inquired the unknown Thanks sir she replied but after having seen your struggle it has made my heart beat so that I have no appetite Pooh pooh one shoulder of mutton pokes the other down said the Chourineur the cookery at the White Rabbit is first rate The three personages then in perfect amity bent their steps together towards the tavern During the contest between the Chourineur and the unknown a charcoal seller of huge size ensconced in another passage had contemplated with much anxiety the progress of the combat but without attempting to offer the slightest assistance to either antagonist When the unknown the Chourineur and the Goualeuse proceeded to the public house the charcoal man followed them The beaten man and the Goualeuse first entered the tapis franc the unknown was following when the charcoal man accosted him and said in a low voice in the German language and in a most respectful tone of remonstrance Pray your highness be on your guard The unknown shrugged his shoulders and rejoined his new companion The charcoal dealer did not leave the door of the cabaret but listened attentively and gazed from time to time through a small hole which had been accidentally made in the thick coat of whitening with which the windows of such haunts as these are usually covered on the inside CHAPTER II THE OGRESS The White Rabbit is situated in the centre of the Rue aux Feves This tavern occupies the ground floor of a lofty house the front of which is formed by two windows which are styled a guillotine Hanging from the front of the door leading to a dark and arched passage was an oblong lamp on the cracked panes of which were written in red letters Nightly Lodgings Here The Chourineur the unknown and the Goualeuse entered into a large but low apartment with the ceiling smoked and crossed by black rafters just visible by the flickering light of a miserable suspended lamp The cracked walls formerly covered with plaster were now ornamented in places with coarse drawings or sentences of flash and obscenity The floor composed of earth beaten together with saltpetre was thick with dirt an armful of straw an apology for a carpet was placed at the foot of the ogress s counter which was at the right hand of the door just beneath the dim lantern On each side of this room there were six tables one end of each of which was nailed to the wall as well as the benches on either side of them At the farther end was a door leading to a kitchen on the right near the counter was a passage which led into a den where persons slept for the night at three halfpence a head A few words will describe the ogress and her guests The lady was called Mother Ponisse her triple trade consisted in letting furnished apartments keeping a public house and lending clothes to the miserable creatures who infest these foul streets The ogress was about forty years of age bulky fat and heavy She had a full colour and strong symptoms of a beard Her deep voice her enormous arms and coarse hands betokened uncommon strength She wore on her cap a large red and yellow handkerchief a shawl of rabbit skin was crossed over her bosom and tied behind her woollen gown fell upon black wooden shoes scorched almost black by the small stove at which she warmed her feet and to crown her beauty she had a copper complexion which the use of strong liquors had materially tended to heighten The counter covered with lead was decked with jugs with iron hoops and various pewter measures In an open cupboard fastened to the wall there were several flasks of glass so fashioned as to represent the pedestrian figure of the Emperor These bottles contained sundry cordials red and green in colour and known by the names of Drops for the Brave Ratafia of the Column et cetera et cetera A large black cat with green eyes was sitting near the ogress and seemed the familiar demon of the place Then in strange contrast a holy branch of boxwood bought at church by the ogress was suspended at the back of an old cuckoo clock Two marvellously ill favoured fellows with unshaven beards and their garb all in tatters hardly tasted of the pitcher of wine before them and conversed together in low voices and with uneasy aspect One of the two very pale and livid pulled from time to time his shabby skull cap over his brows and concealed as much as possible his left hand and even when compelled to use it he did so with caution Further on there was a young man hardly sixteen years of age with beardless chin and a countenance wan wrinkled and heavy his eye dull and his long black hair straggling down his neck This youthful rake the emblem of precocious vice was smoking a short black pipe His back was resting against the wall and his two hands were in the pockets of his blouse and his legs stretched along the bench He did not cease smoking for a moment unless it was to drink from a cannikin of brandy placed before him The other inmates of the tapis franc men and women presented no remarkable characteristics There was the ferocious or embruted face the vulgar and licentious mirth but from time to time there was a deep and dull silence Such were the guests of the tapis franc when the unknown the Chourineur and the Goualeuse entered These three persons play such important parts in our recital that we must put them in relief The Chourineur was a man of lofty stature and athletic make with hair of a pale brown nearly white thick eyebrows and enormous whiskers of deep red The sun s rays misery and the severe toil of the galleys had bronzed his skin to that deep and olive hue which is peculiar to convicts In spite of his horrible nickname his features did not express ferocity but a sort of coarse familiarity and irrepressible audacity We have said already that the Chourineur was clothed in trousers and frock of blue cotton and on his head he had one of those large straw hats usually worn by workmen in timber yards and barge emptiers The Goualeuse was perhaps about sixteen and a half years old A forehead of the purest and whitest surmounted a face of perfect oval and angel like expression a fringe of eyelids so long that they curled slightly half veiled her large blue eyes which had a melancholy expression The down of early youth graced cheeks lightly coloured with a scarlet tinge Her small and rosy mouth which hardly ever smiled her nose straight and delicately chiselled her rounded chin had in their combined expression a nobility and a sweetness such as we can only find in the most beautiful of Raphael s portraits On each side of her fair temples was a band of hair of the most splendid auburn hue which descended in luxuriant ringlets half way down her cheeks and was then turned back behind the ear a portion of which ivory shaded with carnation was thus visible and was then lost under the close folds of a large cotton handkerchief with blue checks tied as it is called en marmotte Her graceful neck of dazzling whiteness was encircled by a small necklace of grains of coral Her gown of brown stuff though much too large could not conceal a charming form supple and round as a cane a worn out small orange coloured shawl with green fringe was crossed over her bosom The lovely voice of the Goualeuse had made a strong impression on her unknown defender and in sooth that voice so gentle so deliciously modulated and harmonious had an attraction so irresistible that the horde of villains and abandoned women in the midst of whom this unfortunate girl lived often begged her to sing and listened to her with rapture The Goualeuse had another name given doubtless to the maiden sweetness of her countenance she was also called Fleur de Marie The defender of La Goualeuse we shall call the unknown Rodolph appeared about thirty six years of age his figure tall graceful and admirably proportioned yet did not betoken the astonishing vigour which he had displayed in his rencounter with the Chourineur It would have been difficult to assign a decided character to the physiognomy of Rodolph Certain wrinkles in his forehead betokened a man of meditation and yet the firm expression of his mouth the dignified and bold carriage of the head assured us of the man of action whose physical strength and presence of mind would always command an ascendancy over the multitude Illustration The Chourineur Rodolph and La Goualeuse Etching by Adrian Marcel after the drawing by Frank T Merrill In his struggle with the Chourineur Rodolph had neither betrayed anger nor hatred Confident in his own strength his address and agility he had only shown a contempt for the brute beast which he subdued We will finish this bodily picture of Rodolph by saying that his features regularly handsome seemed too beautiful for a man His eyes were large and of a deep hazel his nose aquiline his chin rather projecting his hair bright chestnut of the same shade as his eyebrows which were strongly arched and his small moustache which was fine and silky Thanks to the manners and the language which he assumed with so much ease Rodolph was exactly like the other guests of the ogress Round his graceful neck as elegantly modelled as that of the Indian Bacchus he wore a black cravat carelessly tied the ends of which fell on the collar of his blue blouse A double row of nails decorated his heavy shoes and except that his hands were of most aristocratic shape nothing distinguished him from the other guests of the tapis franc though in a moral sense his resolute air and what we may term his bold serenity placed an immense distance between them On entering the tapis franc the Chourineur laying one of his heavy hands on the shoulders of Rodolph cried Hail the conqueror of the Chourineur Yes my boys this springald has floored me and if any young gentleman wishes to have his ribs smashed or his nob in Chancery even including the Schoolmaster and the Skeleton here is their man I will answer for him and back him At these words all present from the ogress to the lowest ruffian of the tapis franc contemplated the victor of the Chourineur with respect and fear Some moving their glasses and jugs to the end of the table at which they were seated offered Rodolph a seat if he were inclined to sit near them others approached the Chourineur and asked him in a low voice for the particulars of this unknown who had made his entrance into their world in so striking a manner Then the ogress accosting Rodolph with one of her most gracious smiles a thing unheard of and almost deemed fabulous in the annals of the White Rabbit rose from the bar to take the orders of her guest and know what he desired to have for the refreshment of his party an attention which she did not evince either to the Schoolmaster or the Skeleton two fearful ruffians who made even the Chourineur tremble One of the men with the villainous aspect whom we have before described as being very pale hiding his left hand and continually pulling his cap over his brows leaned towards the ogress who was carefully wiping the table where Rodolph had taken his seat and said to her in a hoarse tone Hasn t the Gros Boiteux been here to day No said Mother Ponisse Nor yesterday Yes he came yesterday Was Calebasse with him the daughter of Martial who was guillotined You know whom I mean the Martials of the Ile de Ravageur What do you take me for a spy with your questions Do you think I watch my customers said the ogress in a brutal tone I have an appointment to night with the Gros Boiteux and the Schoolmaster replied the fellow we have some business together That s your affair a set of ruffians as you are altogether Ruffians said the man much incensed it is such ruffians you get your living by Will you hold your jaw said the Amazon with a threatening gesture and lifting as she spoke the pitcher she held in her hand The man resumed his place grumbling as he did so The Gros Boiteux has perhaps stayed to give that young fellow Germain who lives in the Rue du Temple his gruel said he to his companion What do they mean to do for him No not quite but to make him more careful in future It appears he has blown the gaff in the job at Nantes so Bras Rouge declares Why that is Gros Boiteux s affair he has only just left prison and has his hands full already Fleur de Marie had followed the Chourineur into the tavern of the ogress and he responding to a nod given to him by the young scamp with the jaded aspect said Ah Barbillon what pulling away at the old stuff Yes I would rather fast and go barefoot any day than be without my drops for my throttle and the weed for my pipe said the rapscallion in a thick low hoarse voice without moving from his seat and puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke Good evening Fleur de Marie said the ogress looking with a prying eye on the clothes of the poor girl clothes which she had lent her After her scrutiny she said in a tone of coarse satisfaction It s really a pleasure so it is to lend one s good clothes to you you are as clean as a kitten or else I would never have trusted you with that shawl Such a beauty as that orange one is I would never have trusted it to such gals as Tourneuse and Boulotte but I have taken every care on you ever since you came here six weeks ago and if the truth must be said there is not a tidier nor more nicer girl than you in all the Cite that there ain t though you be al ays so sad like and too particular The Goualeuse sighed turned her head and said nothing Why mother said Rodolph to the old hag you have got some holy boxwood I see over your cuckoo and he pointed with his finger to the consecrated bough behind the old clock Why you heathen would you have us live like dogs replied the ogress Then addressing Fleur de Marie she added Come now Goualeuse tip us one of your pretty little ditties goualantes Supper supper first Mother Ponisse said the Chourineur Well my lad of wax what can I do for you said the ogress to Rodolph whose good will she was desirous to conciliate and whose support she might perchance require Ask the Chourineur he orders I pay Well then said the ogress turning to the bandit what will you have for supper you bad lot Two quarts of the best wine at twelve sous three crusts of wheaten bread and a harlequin five said the Chourineur after considering for a few moments what he should order five A harlequin is a collection of odds and ends of fish flesh and fowl after they come from table which the Parisian providing for the class to which the Chourineur belongs finds a profitable and popular composition Ah you are a dainty dog I know and as fond as ever of them harlequins Well now Goualeuse said the Chourineur are you hungry No Chourineur Would you like anything better than a harlequin my lass said Rodolph No I thank you I have no appetite Come now said the Chourineur with a brutal grin look my master in the face like a jolly wench You have no objection I suppose The poor girl blushed and did not look at Rodolph A few moments afterwards and the ogress herself placed on the table a pitcher of wine bread and a harlequin of which we will not attempt to give an idea to the reader but which appeared most relishing to the Chourineur for he exclaimed Dieu de Dieu what a dish What a glorious dish It is a regular omnibus there is something in it to everybody s taste Those who like fat can have it so can they who like lean as well as those who prefer sugar and those who choose pepper There s tender bits of chicken biscuit sausage tarts mutton bones pastry crust fried fish vegetables woodcock s heads cheese and salad Come eat Goualeuse eat it is so capital You have been to a wedding breakfast somewhere this morning No more than on other mornings I ate this morning as usual my ha porth of milk and my ha porth of bread The entrance of another personage into the cabaret interrupted all conversation for a moment and everybody turned his head in the direction of the newcomer who was a middle aged man active and powerful wearing a loose coat and cap He was evidently quite at home in the tapis franc and in language familiar to all the guests requested to be supplied with supper He was so placed that he could observe the two ill looking scoundrels who had asked after Gros Boiteux and the Schoolmaster He did not take his eyes off them but in consequence of their position they could not see that they were the objects of such marked and constant attention The conversation momentarily interrupted was resumed In spite of his natural audacity the Chourineur showed a deference for Rodolph and abstained from familiarity By Jove said he to Rodolph although I have smarted for it yet I am very glad to have met with you What because you relish the harlequin Why may be so but more because I am all on the fret to see you serve out the Schoolmaster To see him who has always crowed over me crowed over in his turn would do me good Do you suppose then that for your amusement I mean to spring at the Schoolmaster and pin him like a bull dog No but he ll have at you in a moment when he learns that you are a better man than he replied the Chourineur rubbing his hands Well I have coin enough left to pay him in full said Rodolph in a careless tone but it is horrible weather what say you to a cup of brandy with sugar in it That s the ticket said the Chourineur And that we may be better acquainted we will tell each other who we are added Rodolph The Albinos called the Chourineur a freed convict worker at the wood that floats at saint Paul s Quay frozen in the winter scorched in the summer from twelve to fifteen hours a day in the water half man half frog that s my description said Rodolph s companion making him a military salute with his left hand Well now and you my master this is your first appearance in the Cite I don t mean anything to offend but you entered head foremost against my skull and beating the drum on my carcass By all that s ugly what a rattling you made especially with these blows with which you doubled me up I never can forget them thick as buttons what a torrent But you have some trade besides polishing off the Chourineur I am a fan painter and my name is Rodolph A fan painter Ah that s the reason then that your hands are so white added the Chourineur If all your fellow workmen are like you there must be a tidy lot of you But as you are a workman what brings you to a tapis franc in the Cite where there are only prigs cracksmen or freed convicts like myself and who only come here because we cannot go elsewhere This is no place for you Honest mechanics have their coffee shops and don t talk slang I come here because I like good company Gammon said the Chourineur shaking his head with an air of doubt I found you in the passage of Bras Rouge Well man never mind You say you don t know him What do you mean with all your nonsense about your Bras Rouge Let him go to the Stay master of mine You perhaps distrust me but you are wrong and if you like I will tell you my history but that is on condition that you teach me how to give those precious thumps which settled my business so quickly What say you I agree Chourineur tell me your story and Goualeuse will also tell hers Very well replied the Chourineur it is not weather to turn a mangy cur out of doors and it will be an amusement Do you agree Goualeuse Oh certainly but my story is a very short one said Fleur de Marie And you will have to tell us your history comrade Rodolph added the Chourineur Well then I ll begin Fan painter said Goualeuse what a very pretty trade And how much can you earn if you stick close to work inquired the Chourineur I work by the piece responded Rodolph my good days are worth three francs sometimes four in summer when the days are long And you are idle sometimes you rascal Yes as long as I have money though I do not waste it First I pay ten sous for my night s lodging Your pardon monseigneur you sleep then at ten sous do you said the Chourineur raising his hand to his cap The word monseigneur spoken ironically by the Chourineur caused an almost imperceptible smile on the lips of Rodolph who replied Oh I like to be clean and comfortable Here s a peer of the realm for you a man with mines of wealth exclaimed the Chourineur he pays ten sous for his bed Well then continued Rodolph four sous for tobacco that makes fourteen sous four sous for breakfast eighteen fifteen sous for dinner one or two sous for brandy that all comes to about thirty four or thirty five sous a day I have no occasion to work all the week and so the rest of the time I amuse myself And your family said the Goualeuse Dead replied Rodolph Who were your friends asked the Goualeuse Dealers in old clothes and marine stores under the pillars of the market place How did you spend what they left you inquired the Chourineur I was very young and my guardian sold the stock and when I came of age he brought me in his debtor for thirty francs that was my inheritance And who is now your employer the Chourineur demanded His name is Gauthier in the Rue des Bourdonnais a beast brute thief miser He would almost as soon lose the sight of an eye as pay his workmen Now this is as true a description as I can give you of him so let s have done with him I learned my trade under him from the time when I was fifteen years of age I have a good number in the Conscription and my name is Rodolph Durand My history is told Now it s your turn Goualeuse said the Chourineur I keep my history till last as a bonne bouche CHAPTER III HISTORY OF LA GOUALEUSE Let us begin at the beginning said the Chourineur Yes your parents added Rodolph I never knew them said Fleur de Marie The deuce said the Chourineur Well that is odd Goualeuse you and I are of the same family What you too Chourineur An orphan of the streets of Paris like you my girl Then who brought you up Goualeuse asked Rodolph I don t know sir As far back as I can remember I was I think about six or seven years old I was with an old one eyed woman whom they call the Chouette six because she had a hooked nose a green eye quite round and was like an owl with one eye out six The Screech owl Ha ha ha I think I see her the old night bird shouted the Chourineur laughing The one eyed woman resumed Fleur de Marie made me sell barley sugar in the evenings on the Pont Neuf but that was only an excuse for asking charity and when I did not bring her in at least ten sous the Chouette beat me instead of giving me any supper Are you sure the woman was not your mother inquired Rodolph Quite sure for she often scolded me for being fatherless and motherless and said she picked me up one day in the street So said the Chourineur you had a dance instead of a meal if you did not pick up ten sous Yes And after that I went to lie down on some straw spread on the ground when I was cold very cold I do not doubt it for the feather of beans straw is a very cold sort of stuff said the Chourineur A dung heap is twice as good but then people don t like your smell and say Oh the blackguard where has he been This remark made Rodolph smile whilst Fleur de Marie thus continued Next day the one eyed woman gave me a similar allowance for breakfast as for supper and sent me to Montfaucon to get some worms to bait for fish for in the daytime the Chouette kept her stall for selling fishing lines near the bridge of Notre Dame For a child of seven years of age who is half dead with hunger and cold it is a long way from the Rue de la Mortellerie to Montfaucon But exercise has made you grow as straight as an arrow my girl you have no reason to complain of that said the Chourineur striking a light for his pipe Well said the Goualeuse I returned very very tired then at noon the Chouette gave me a little bit of bread Ah eating so little has kept your figure as fine as a needle girl you must not find fault with that said Chourineur puffing out a cloud of tobacco smoke But what ails you comrade I mean Master Rodolph You seem quite down like are you sorry for the girl and her miseries Ah we all have and have had our miseries Yes but not such miseries as mine Chourineur said Fleur de Marie What not I Goualeuse Why my lass you were a queen to me At least when you were little you slept on straw and ate bread I passed my most comfortable nights in the lime kilns at Clichy like a regular vagabond I fed on cabbage stumps and other refuse vegetables which I picked up when and where I could but very often as it was so far to the lime kilns at Clichy and I was tired after my work I slept under the large stones at the Louvre and then in winter I had white sheets that is whenever the snow fell A man is stronger but a poor little girl said Fleur de Marie And yet with all that I was as plump as a skylark What you remember that eh To be sure I do When the Chouette beat me I fell always at the first blow then she stamped upon me screaming out Ah the nasty little brute she hasn t a farden s worth of strength she can t stand even two thumps And then she called me Pegriotte little thief I never had any other name that was my baptismal name Like me I had the baptism of a dog in a ditch and they called me Fellow or You sir or Albino It is really surprising my wench how much we resemble each other said the Chourineur That s true in our misery said Fleur de Marie who addressed herself to the Chourineur almost always feeling in spite of herself a sort of shame at the presence of Rodolph hardly venturing to raise her eyes to him although in appearance he belonged to that class with whom she ordinarily lived And when you had fetched the worms for the Chouette what did you do inquired the Chourineur Why she made me beg until night then in the evening she went to sell fried fish on the Pont Neuf Oh dear at that time it was a long while to wait for my morsel of bread and if I dared to ask the Chouette for something to eat she beat me and said Get ten sous and then you shall have your supper Then I being very hungry and as she hurt me very much cried with a very full heart and sore body The Chouette tied my little basket of barley sugar round my neck and stationed me on the Pont Neuf where in winter I was frozen to death Yet sometimes in spite of myself I slept as I stood but not long for the Chouette kicked me until I awoke I remained on the bridge till eleven o clock my stock of barley sugar hanging round my neck and often crying heartily The passengers touched by my tears sometimes gave me a sou and then I gained ten and sometimes fifteen sous which I gave to the Chouette who searched me all over and even looked in my mouth to see if I had kept back anything Well fifteen sous was a good haul for a little bird like you It was And then the one eyed woman seeing that With her one eye said the Chourineur laughing Of course because she had but one Well then she finding that when I cried I got most money always beat me severely before she put me on the bridge Brutal but cunning Well at last I got hardened to blows and as the Chouette got in a passion when I did not cry why I to be revenged upon her the more she thumped me the more I laughed although the tears came into my eyes with the pain But poor Goualeuse did not the sticks of barley sugar make you long for them Ah yes Chourineur but I never tasted them It was my ambition and my ambition ruined me One day returning from Montfaucon some little boys beat me and stole my basket I came back well knowing what was in store for me and I had a shower of thumps and no bread In the evening before going to the bridge the Chouette savage because I had not brought in anything the evening before instead of beating me as usual to make me cry made me bleed by pulling my hair from the sides of the temples where it is most tender Tonnerre that was coming it too strong said the bandit striking his fist heavily on the table and frowning sternly To beat a child is no such great thing but to ill use one so Heaven and earth Rodolph had listened attentively to the recital of Fleur de Marie and now looked at the Chourineur with astonishment the display of such feeling quite surprised him What ails you Chourineur he inquired What ails me Ails me Why have you no feeling That devil s dam of a Chouette who so brutally used this girl Are you as hard as your own fists Go on my girl said Rodolph to Fleur de Marie without appearing to notice the Chourineur s appeal I have told you how the Chouette ill used me to make me cry I was then sent on to the bridge with my barley sugar The one eyed was at her usual spot and from time to time shook her doubled fist at me However as I had not broken my fast since the night before and as I was very hungry at the risk of putting the Chouette in a passion I took a piece of barley sugar and began to eat it Well done girl I ate another piece Bravo go it my hearties I found it so good not from daintiness but real hunger But then a woman who sold oranges cried out to the one eyed woman Look ye there Chouette Pegriotte is eating the barley sugar Oh thunder and lightning said the Chourineur that would enrage her make her in a passion Poor little mouse what a fright you were in when the Chouette saw you eh How did you get out of that affair poor Goualeuse asked Rodolph with as much interest as the Chourineur Why it was a serious matter to me but that was afterwards for the Chouette although boiling over with rage at seeing me devour the barley sugar could not leave her stove for the fish was frying Ha ha ha True true that was a difficult position for her said the Chourineur laughing heartily At a distance the Chouette threatened me with her long iron fork but when her fish was cooked she came towards me I had only collected three sous and I had eaten six sous worth She did not say a word but took me by the hand and dragged me away with her At this moment I do not know how it was that I did not die on the spot with fright I remember it as well as if it was this very moment it was very near to New Year s day and there were a great many shops on the Pont Neuf all filled with toys and I had been looking at them all the evening with the greatest delight beautiful dolls little furnished houses you know how very amusing such things are for a child You had never had any playthings had you Goualeuse asked the Chourineur I Mon Dieu who was there to give me any playthings said the girl in a sad tone Well the evening passed Although it was in the depth of winter I only had on a little cotton gown no stockings no shift and with wooden shoes on my feet that was not enough to stifle me with heat was it Well when the old woman took my hand I burst out into a perspiration from head to foot What frightened me most was that instead of swearing and storming as usual she only kept on grumbling between her teeth She never let go my hand but made me walk so fast so very fast that I was obliged to run to keep up with her and in running I had lost one of my wooden shoes and as I did not dare to say so I followed her with one foot naked on the bare stones When we reached home it was covered with blood A one eyed old devil s kin said the Chourineur again thumping the table in his anger It makes my heart quite cold to think of the poor little thing trotting along beside that cursed old brute with her poor little foot all bloody We lived in a garret in the Rue de la Montellerie beside the entrance to our alley there was a dram shop and there the Chouette went in still dragging me by the hand She then had a half pint of brandy at the bar The deuce Why I could not drink that without being quite fuddled It was her usual quantity perhaps that was the reason why she beat me of an evening Well at last we got up into our cock loft the Chouette double locked the door I threw myself on my knees and asked her pardon for having eaten the barley sugar She did not answer me but I heard her mumbling to herself as she walked about the room What shall I do this evening to this little thief who has eaten all that barley sugar Ah I see And she looked at me maliciously with her one green eye I was still on my knees when she suddenly went to a shelf and took down a pair of pincers Pincers exclaimed the Chourineur Yes pincers What for To strike you inquired Rodolph To pinch you said the Chourineur No no answered the poor girl trembling at the very recollection To pull out your hair No to take out one of my teeth The Chourineur uttered a blasphemous oath accompanied with such furious imprecations that all the guests in the tapis franc looked at him with astonishment Why what is the matter with you asked Rodolph The matter the matter I ll skin her alive that infernal old hag if I can catch her Where is she Tell me where is she Let me find her and I ll throttle the old And did she really take out your tooth my poor child that wretched monster in woman s shape demanded Rodolph whilst the Chourineur was venting his rage in a volley of the most violent reproaches Yes sir but not at the first pull How I suffered She held me with my head between her knees where she held it as if in a vice Then half with her pincers half with her fingers she pulled out my tooth and then said Now I will pull out one every day Pegriotte and when you have not a tooth left I will throw you into the river and the fish shall eat you The old devil To break and pull out a poor child s teeth in that way exclaimed the Chourineur with redoubled fury And how did you escape her then inquired Rodolph of the Goualeuse Next day instead of going to Montfaucon I went on the side of the Champs Elysees so frightened was I of being drowned by the Chouette I would have run to the end of the world rather than be again in the Chouette s hands After walking and walking I fairly lost myself I had not begged a farthing and the more I thought the more frightened did I become At night I hid myself in a timber yard under some piles of wood As I was very little I was able to creep under an old door and hide myself amongst a heap of logs I was so hungry that I tried to gnaw a piece of the bark but I could not bite it it was too hard At length I fell asleep In the morning hearing a noise I hid myself still further back in the wood pile It was tolerably warm and if I had had something to eat I could not have been better off for the winter Like me in the lime kiln I did not dare to quit the timber yard for I fancied that the Chouette would seek for me everywhere to pull out my teeth and drown me and that she would be sure to catch me if I stirred from where I was Stay do not mention that old beast s name again it makes the blood come into my eyes The fact is that you have known misery bitter bitter misery Poor little mite how sorry I am that I threatened to beat you just now and frightened you As I am a man I did not mean to do it Why would you not have beaten me I have no one to defend me That s the very reason because you are not like the others because you have no one to take your part that I would not have beaten you When I say no one I do not mean our comrade Rodolph but his coming was a chance and he certainly did give me my full allowance when we met Go on my child said Rodolph How did you get away from the timber yard Next day about noon I heard a great dog barking under the wood pile I listened and the bark came nearer and nearer then a deep voice exclaimed My dog barks somebody is hid in the yard They are thieves said another voice and the men then began to encourage the dog and cry Find em find em lad The dog ran to me and for fear of being bitten I began to cry out with all my might and main Hark said one of them I hear the cry of a child They called back the dog I came out from the pile of wood and saw a gentleman and a man in a blouse Ah you little thief what are you doing in my timber yard said the gentleman in a cross tone I put my hands together and said Don t hurt me pray I have had nothing to eat for two days and I ve run away from the Chouette who pulled out my tooth and said she would throw me over to the fishes Not knowing where to sleep I was passing before your door and I slept for the night amongst these logs under this heap not thinking I hurt anybody I m not to be gammoned by you you little hussy You came to steal my logs Go and call the watch said the timber merchant to his man Ah the old vagabond The old reprobate Call the watch Why didn t he send for the artillery said the Chourineur Steal his logs and you only eight years old What an old ass Not true sir his man replied Steal your logs master How can she do that She is not so big as the smallest piece You are right replied the timber merchant but if she does not come for herself she does for others Thieves have a parcel of children whom they send to pry about and hide themselves to open the doors of houses She must be taken to the commissary and mind she does not escape Upon my life this timber merchant was more of a log than any log in his own yard said the Chourineur I was taken to the commissary resumed Goualeuse I accused myself of being a wanderer and they sent me to prison I was sent before the Tribunal and sentenced as a rogue and vagabond to remain until I was sixteen years of age in a house of correction I thank the judges much for their kindness for in prison I had food I was not beaten and it was a paradise after the cock loft of the Chouette Then in prison I learned to sew but sad to say I was idle I preferred singing to work and particularly when I saw the sun shine Ah when the sun shone on the walls of the prison I could not help singing and then when I could sing I seemed no longer to be a prisoner It was after I began to sing so much that they called me Goualeuse instead of Pegriotte Well when I was sixteen I left the gaol At the door I found the ogress here and two or three old women who had come to see my fellow prisoners and who had always told me that when I left the prison they would find work for me Yes yes I see said the Chourineur My pretty little maid said the ogress and her old companions come and lodge with us we will give you good clothes and then you may amuse yourself I didn t like them and refused saying to myself I know how to sew very well and I have two hundred francs in hand I have been eight years in prison I should like to enjoy myself a bit that won t hurt anybody work will come when the money is spent And so I began to spend my two hundred francs Ah that was my mistake added Fleur de Marie with a sigh I ought first to have got my work but I hadn t a soul on earth to advise me At sixteen to be thrown on the city of Paris as I was one is so lonely and what is done is done I have done wrong and I have suffered for it I began then to spend my money first I bought flowers to put in my room I do love flowers then I bought a gown a nice shawl and I took a walk in the Bois de Boulogne and I went to saint Germains Vincennes and other country places Oh how I love the country With a lover by your side my girl asked the Chourineur Oh mon Dieu no I like to be my own mistress I had my little excursions with a friend who was in prison with me a good little girl as can be they call her Rigolette because she is always laughing Rigolette Rigolette I don t know her said the Chourineur who appeared to be appealing to his memory I didn t think you knew her I am sure Rigolette was very well behaved in prison and always so gay and so industrious she took out with her when she left the prison at least four hundred francs that she had earned And then she is so particular you should see her When I say I had no one to advise me I am wrong I ought to have listened to her for after having had a week s amusement together she said to me Now we have had such a holiday we ought to try for work and not spend our money in waste I who was so happy in the fields and the woods it was just at the end of spring this year I answered Oh I must be idle a little longer and then I will work hard Since that time I have not seen Rigolette but I heard a few days since that she was living near the Temple that she was a famous needlewoman and earned at least twenty five sous a day and has a small workroom of her own but now I could not for the world see her again I should die with shame if I met her So then my poor girl said Rodolph you spent your money in the country you like the country do you Like it I love it Oh what would I not give to live there Rigolette on the contrary prefers Paris and likes to walk on the Boulevards but she is so nice and so kind she went into the country only to please me And you did not even leave yourself a few sous to live upon whilst you found work said the Chourineur Yes I had reserved about fifty francs but it happened that I had for my washerwoman a woman called Lorraine a poor thing with none but the good God to protect her She was then very near her confinement and yet was obliged all day long to be with her hands and feet in her washing tubs She fell sick and not being able to work applied for admittance to a lying in hospital but there was no room She could not work and her time was very near at hand and she had not a son to pay for the bed in a garret from which they drove her Fortunately she met one day at the end of the Pont Notre Dame with Goubin s wife who had been hiding for four days in a cellar of a house which was being pulled down behind the Hotel Dieu But why was Goubin s wife hiding To escape from her husband who threatened to kill her and she only went out at night to buy some bread and it was then she met with the poor Lorraine ill and hardly able to drag herself along for she was expecting to be brought to bed every hour Well it seems this Goubin s wife took her to the cellar where she was hiding it was just a shelter and no more There she shared her bread and straw with the poor Lorraine who was confined in this cellar of a poor little infant her only covering and bed was straw Well it seems that Goubin s wife could not bear it and so going out at all risks even of being killed by her husband who was looking for her everywhere she left the cellar in open day and came to me She knew I had still a little money left and that I could assist her if I would so when Helmina had told me all about poor Lorraine who was obliged to lie with her new born babe on straw I told her to bring them both to my room at once and I would take a chamber for her next to mine This I did and oh how happy she was poor Lorraine when she found herself in a bed with her babe beside her in a little couch which I had bought for her Helmina and I nursed her until she was able to get about again and then with the rest of my money I enabled her to return to her washing tubs And when all your money was spent on Lorraine and her infant what did you do my child inquired Rodolph I looked out for work but it was too late I can sew very well I have good courage and thought that I had only to ask for work and get it Ah how I deceived myself I went into a shop where they sell ready made linen and asked for employment and as I would not tell a story I said I had just left prison They showed me the door without making me any answer I begged they would give me a trial and they pushed me into the street as if I had been a thief Then I remembered too late what Rigolette had told me Little by little I sold my small stock of clothes and linen and when all was gone they turned me out of my lodging I had not tasted food for two days I did not know where to sleep At this moment I met the ogress and one of her old women who knew where I lodged and was always coming about me since I left prison They told me they would find me work and I believed them I went with them so exhausted for want of food that my senses were gone They gave me brandy to drink and and here I am said the unhappy creature hiding her face in her hands Have you lived a long time with the ogress my poor girl asked Rodolph in accents of the deepest compassion Six weeks sir replied Goualeuse shuddering as she spoke I see I see said the Chourineur I know you now as well as if I were your father and mother and you had never left my lap Well well this is a confession indeed It makes you sad my girl to tell the story of your life said Rodolph Alas sir replied Fleur de Marie sorrowfully since I was born this is the first time it ever happened to me to recall all these things at once and my tale is not a merry one Well said the Chourineur ironically you are sorry perhaps that you are not a kitchen wench in a cook shop or a servant to some old brutes who think of no one but themselves Ah said Fleur de Marie with a deep sigh to be quite happy we must be quite virtuous Oh what is your little head about now exclaimed the Chourineur with a loud burst of laughter Why not count your rosary in honour of your father and mother whom you never knew My father and mother abandoned me in the street like a puppy that is one too many in the house perhaps they had not enough to feed themselves said Goualeuse with bitterness I want nothing of them I complain of nothing but there are lots happier than mine Yours Why what would you have You are as handsome as a Venus and yet only sixteen and a half you sing like a nightingale behave yourself very prettily are called Fleur de Marie and yet you complain What will you say I should like to know when you will have a stove under your paddlers and a chinchilla boa like the ogress Oh I shall never be so old as she is Perhaps you have a charm for never growing any older No but I could not lead such a life I have already a bad cough Ah I see you already in the cold meat box Go along you silly child you Do you often have such thoughts as these Goualeuse said Rodolph Sometimes You perhaps M Rodolph understand me In the morning when I go to buy my milk from the milkwoman at the corner of Rue de la Vieille Draperie with the sous which the ogress gives me and see her go away in her little cart drawn by her donkey I do envy her so and I say to myself She is going into the country to the pure air to her home and her family and then I return alone into the garret of the ogress where you cannot see plainly even at noonday Well child be good laugh at your troubles be good said the Chourineur Good mon Dieu and how do you mean be good The clothes I wear belong to the ogress and I am in debt to her for my board and lodging I can t stir from her she would have me taken up as a thief I belong to her and I must pay her When she had uttered these last words the unhappy girl could not help shuddering and a tear trembled in her long eyelashes Well but remain as you are and do not compare yourself to a country milkwoman said the Chourineur Are you taking leave of your senses Only think you may yet cut a figure in the capital whilst the milkwoman must boil the pot for her brats milk her cows gather grass for her rabbits and perhaps after all get a black eye from her husband when he comes home from the pot house Why it is really ridiculous to hear you talk of envying her The Goualeuse did not reply her eye was fixed her heart was full and the expression of her face was painfully distressed Rodolph had listened to the recital made with so painful a frankness with deep interest Misery destitution ignorance of the world had weighed down this wretched girl cast at sixteen years of age on the wide world of Paris Rodolph involuntarily thought of a beloved child whom he had lost a girl dead at six years of age and who had she survived would have been like Fleur de Marie sixteen years and a half old This recollection excited the more highly his solicitude for the unhappy creature whose narration he had just heard CHAPTER IV THE CHOURINEUR S HISTORY The reader has not forgotten the two guests at the tapis franc who were watched so closely by the third individual who had come into the cabaret We have said that one of these fellows who had on a Greek cap and concealed his left hand with much care asked the ogress if the Schoolmaster and Gros Boiteux had not arrived During the story of the Goualeuse which they could not overhear they had been constantly talking in a very low tone throwing occasional hurried glances at the door He who wore the Greek cap said to his comrade The Gros Boiteux does not show nor the Schoolmaster Perhaps the Skeleton has done for him and made off with the swag A precious go that would be for us who laid the plant and look out for our snacks replied the other The newcomer who observed the two men was seated too far off to hear a word they said but after having cautiously consulted a small paper concealed at the bottom of his cap he appeared satisfied with his remarks rose from the table and said to the ogress who was sleeping at the bar with her feet on the stove and her great cat on her knee I say Mother Ponisse I shall soon be back again take care of my pitcher and my plate I don t want any one to make free with them Make yourself easy my fine fellow said Mother Ponisse if your plate and pitcher are empty no one will touch them The newcomer laughed loudly at the joke of the ogress and then slipped out so that his departure was unnoticed At that moment when this man retired and before the door could be shut Rodolph saw the charcoal dealer whose black face and tall form we have already alluded to and he had just time to manifest to him by an impatient gesture how much he disliked his watchful attendance but the charcoal man did not appear to heed this in the least and still kept hanging about the tapis franc The countenance of the Goualeuse became still more saddened with her back to the wall her head drooping on her bosom her full blue eyes gazing mechanically about her the unfortunate being seemed bowed down with the weight of her oppressive thoughts Two or three times having met Rodolph s fixed look she turned away unable to account to herself for the singular impression which the unknown had caused her Weighed down and abashed at his presence she almost regretted having made so candid a narrative to him of her unhappy life The Chourineur on the contrary was quite in high spirits he had devoured the whole harlequin without the least assistance the wine and brandy had made him very communicative the fact of his having found his master as he called him had been forgotten in the generous conduct of Rodolph and he also detected so decided a physical superiority that his humiliation had given way to a sentiment of admiration mingled with fear and respect This absence of rancour and the savage pride with which he boasted of never having robbed proved that the Chourineur was not as yet thoroughly hardened This had not escaped the sagacity of Rodolph and he awaited the man s recital with curiosity Now my boy said he we are listening The Chourineur emptied his glass and thus began You my poor girl were at last taken to by the Chouette whom the devil confound You never had a shelter until the moment when you were imprisoned as a vagabond I can never recollect having slept in what is called a bed before I was nineteen years of age a happy age and then I became a trooper What you have served then Chourineur said Rodolph Three years but you will hear all about it the stones of the Louvre the lime kilns of Clichy and the quarries of Montrouge these were the hotels of my youth Then I had my house in Paris and in the country Who but I And what was your trade Faith master I have a foggy recollection of having strolled about in my childhood with an old rag picker who almost thumped me to death and it must be true for I have never since met one of these old Cupids with a wicker work quiver without a longing to pitch into him a proof that one of them must have thumped me when I was a child My first employment was to help the knackers to cut the horses throats at Montfaucon I was about ten or twelve When I began to slash chouriner these poor old beasts it had quite an impression on me At the month s end I thought no more about it on the contrary I began to like my trade No one had his knife so sharpened and keen edged as mine and that made me rejoice in using it When I had cut the animals throats they gave me for my trouble a piece of the thigh of some animal that had died of disease for those that they slaughter are sold to the cag mag shops near the School of Medicine who convert it into beef mutton veal or game according to the taste of purchasers However when I got to my morsel of horse s flesh I was as happy as a king I went with it into the lime kiln like a wolf to his lair and then with the leave of the lime burners I made a glorious fry on the ashes When the burners were not at work I picked up some dry wood at Romainville set light to it and broiled my steak under the walls of the bone house The meat certainly was bloody and almost raw but that made a change And your name What did they call you asked Rodolph I had hair much more flaxen than now and the blood was always in my eyes and so they called me the Albino The Albinos are the white rabbits amongst men they have red eyes added the Chourineur in a grave tone and as it were with a physiological parenthesis And your relations your family My relations Oh they lodge at the same number as the Goualeuse s Place of my birth Why the first corner of no matter what street either on the right or left hand side of the way and either going up or coming down the kennel Then you have cursed your father and mother for having abandoned you Why that would not have set my leg if I had broken it No matter though it s true they played me a scurvy trick in bringing me into the world But I should not have complained if they had made me as beggars ought to be made that is to say without the sense of cold hunger or thirst Beggars who don t like thieving would find it greatly to their advantage You were cold thirsty hungry Chourineur and yet you did not steal No and yet I was horribly wretched It s a fact that I have often gone with an empty bread basket fasted for two days at a time that was more than my share but I never stole For fear of a gaol Pooh said the Chourineur shrugging his shoulders and laughing loudly I should then not have stolen bread for fear of getting my allowance eh An honest man I was famishing a thief I should have been supported in prison and right well too But I did not steal because because why because the idea of stealing never came across me so that s all about it This reply noble as it was in itself but of the rectitude of which the Chourineur himself had no idea perfectly astonished Rodolph He felt that the poor fellow who had remained honest in the midst of the most cruel privations was to be respected twofold since the punishment of the crime became a certain resource for him Rodolph held out his hand to this ill used savage of civilisation whom misery had been unable wholly to corrupt The Chourineur looked at his host in astonishment almost with respect he hardly dared to touch the hand tendered to him He felt impressed with some vague idea that there was a wide abyss between Rodolph and himself Tis well said Rodolph to him you have heart and honour Heart honour what I Come now don t chaff me he replied with surprise To suffer misery and hunger rather than steal is to have heart and honour said Rodolph gravely Well it may be said the Chourineur as if thinking it may be so Does it astonish you It really does for people don t usually say such things to me they generally treat me as they would a mangy dog It s odd though the effect what you say has on me Heart honour he repeated with an air which was actually pensive Well what ails you I faith I don t know replied the Chourineur in a tone of emotion but these words do you see they quite make my heart beat and I feel more flattered than if any one told me I was a better man than either the Skeleton or the Schoolmaster I never felt anything like it before Be sure though that these words and the blows of the fist at the end of my tussle you did lay em on like a good un not alluding to what you pay for the supper and the words you have said in a word he exclaimed bluntly as if he could not find language to express his thoughts make sure that in life or death you may depend on the Chourineur Rodolph unwilling to betray his emotion replied in a tone as calm as he could assume How long did you go on as an amateur knacker Why at first I was quite sick of cutting up old worn out horses who could not even kick but when I was about sixteen and my voice began to get rough it became a passion a taste a relish a rage with me to cut and slash I did not care for anything but that not even eating and drinking You should have seen me in the middle of my work Except an old pair of woollen trousers I was quite naked When with my large and well whetted knife in my hand I had about me fifteen or twenty horses waiting their turn by Jupiter when I began to slaughter them I don t know what possessed me I was like a fury My ears had singing in them and I saw everything red all was red and I slashed and slashed and slashed until my knife fell from my hands Thunder what happiness Had I had millions I could have paid them to have enjoyed my trade It is that which has given you the habit of stabbing said Rodolph Very likely but when I was turned of sixteen the passion became so strong that when I once began slashing I became mad I spoiled my work yes I spoiled the skins because I slashed and cut them across and across for I was so furious that I could not see clearly At last they turned me out of the yard I wanted employment with the butchers for I have always liked that sort of business Well they quite looked down upon me they despised me as a shoemaker does a cobbler Then I had to seek my bread elsewhere and I didn t find it very readily and this was the time when my bread basket was so often empty At length I got employment in the quarries at Montrouge but at the end of two years I was tired of going always around like a squirrel in his cage and drawing stone for twenty sous a day I was tall and strong and so I enlisted in a regiment They asked my name my age and my papers My name the Albino My age look at my beard My papers here s the certificate of the master quarryman As I was just the fellow for a grenadier they took me With your strength courage and taste for chopping and slashing you ought in war time to have been made an officer Thunder and lightning what do you say What to cut up English or Prussians Why that would have been better than to cut up old horses but worse luck there was no war but a great deal of discipline An apprentice tries to hit his master a thump well if he be the weaker why he gets the worst of it if he be the stronger he has the best of it he is turned out of doors perhaps put into the cage and that is all In the army it is quite a different thing One day our sergeant had bullied me a good deal to make me more attentive he was right for I was very slow I did not like a poke he gave me and I kicked at him he pushed me again I returned his poke he collared me and I gave him a punch of the head They fell on me and then my blood was up in my eyes and I was enraged in a moment I had my knife in my hand I belonged to the cookery and I went it my hardest I cut slashed slashed chopped as if I was in the slaughter house I made cold meat of the sergeant wounded two soldiers it was a real shambles I gave the three eleven wounds yes eleven Blood flowed flowed everywhere blood as though we were in the bone house I swam in it The brigand lowered his head with a sombre sullen air and was silent What are you thinking of Chourineur asked Rodolph with interest Nothing he replied abruptly and then with an air of brutish carelessness he added At length they handcuffed me and brought me before the big wigs and I was cast for death You escaped however True but I had fifteen years at the galleys instead of being scragged I forgot to tell you that whilst in the regiment I had saved two of my comrades from drowning in the Marne when we were quartered at Milan At another time you will laugh and say I am amphibious either in fire or water when saving men or women at another time being in garrison at Rouen all the wooden houses in one quarter were on fire and burning like so many matches I am the lad for a fire and so I went to the place in an instant They told me that there was an old woman who was bedridden and could not escape from her room which was already in flames I went towards it and by Jove how it did burn it reminded me of the lime kilns in my happy days However I saved the old woman although I had the very soles of my feet scorched Thanks to my having done these things and the cunning of my advocate my sentence was changed and instead of being scragged I was only sent to the hulks for fifteen years When I found that my life would be spared and I was to go to the galleys I would have jumped upon the babbling fool and twisted his neck at the moment when he came to wish me joy and to tell me he had saved my life and be hanged to him only they prevented me Were you sorry then to have your sentence commuted Yes for those who sport with the knife the headsman s steel is the proper fate for those who steal the darbies to their heels each his proper punishment But to force you to live amongst galley slaves when you have a right to be guillotined out of hand is infamous and besides my life when I first went to the Bagne was rather queer one don t kill a man and soon forget it you must know You feel some remorse then Chourineur Remorse No for I have served my time said the savage but at first a night did not pass but I saw like a nightmare the sergeant and soldiers whom I had slashed and slaughtered that is they were not alone added the brigand in a voice of terror these were in tens and dozens and hundreds and thousands each waiting his turn in a kind of slaughter house like the horses whose throats I used to cut at Montfaucon awaiting each his turn Then then I saw red and began to cut and slash away on these men as I used formerly to do on the horses The more however I chopped down the soldiers the faster the ranks filled up with others and as they died they looked at one with an air so gentle so gentle that I cursed myself for killing em but I couldn t help it That was not all I never had a brother and yet it seemed as if every one of those whom I killed was my brother and I loved all of them At last when I could bear it no longer I used to wake covered all over with sweat as cold as melting snow That was a horrid dream Chourineur It was yes That dream do you see was enough to drive one mad or foolish so twice I tried to kill myself once by swallowing verdigris and another time by trying to choke myself with my chain but confound it I am as strong as a bull The verdigris only made me thirsty and as for the twist of the chain round my neck why that only gave me a natural cravat of a blue colour Afterwards the desire of life came back to me nay nightmare ceased to torment me and I did as others did At the Bagne you were in a good school for learning how to thieve Yes but it was not to my taste The other prigs bullied me but I soon silenced them with a few thumps of my chain It was in this way I first knew the Schoolmaster and I must pay him the compliment due to his blows he paid me off as you did some little time ago He is then a criminal who has served his time He was sentenced for life but escaped Escaped and not denounced I m not the man to denounce him Besides it would seem as if I were afraid of him But how is it that the police do not detect him Have they not got his description His description Oh yes yes but it is long since he has scraped out from his phiz what nature had placed there now none but the baker who puts the condemned in his oven the devil could recognise him the Schoolmaster What has he done to himself He began by destroying his nose which was an ell long he ate it off with vitriol You jest If he comes in this evening you ll see He had a nose like a parrot and now it is as flat as in a death s head to say nothing of his lips which are as thick as your fist and his face which is as wrinkled as the waistcoat of a rag picker And so he is not recognised It is six months since he escaped from Rochefort and the traps have met him a hundred times without knowing him Why was he at the Bagne For having been a forger thief and assassin He is called the Schoolmaster because he wrote a splendid hand and has had a good education And is he much feared He will not be any longer when you have given him such a licking as you gave me Oh by Jove I am anxious to see it What does he do for a living He is associated with an old woman as bad as himself and as deep as the old one but she is never seen though he has told the ogress that some day or other he would bring his mot woman with him And this women helps him in his robberies Yes and in his murders too They say he brags of having already with her assistance done for two or three persons and amongst others three weeks ago a cattle dealer on the road to Poissy whom they also robbed He will be taken sooner or later They must be very cunning as well as powerful to do that for he always has under his blouse a brace of loaded pistols and a dagger He says that Charlot the executioner waits for him and he can only lose his head once and so he will kill all he can kill to try and escape Oh he makes no mystery of it and as he is twice as strong as you and I they will have a tough job who take him What did you do Chourineur when you left the Bagne I offered myself to the master lighterman of the Quai saint Paul and I get my livelihood there But as you have never been a prig why do you live in the Cite Why where else can I live Who likes to be seen with a discharged criminal I should be tired of always being alone for I like company and here I am with my equals I have a bit of a row sometimes and they fear me like fire in the Cite but the police have nothing to say to me except now and then for a shindy for which they give me perhaps twenty four hours at the watch house and there s an end of that What do you earn a day Thirty five sous for taking in the river foot baths up to the stomach from twelve to fifteen hours a day summer and winter but let me be just and tell the truth so if through having my toes in the water I get the grenouille seven I am allowed to break my arms in breaking up old vessels and unloading timber on my back I begin as a beast of burden and end like a fish s tail When I lose my strength entirely I shall take a rake and a wicker basket like the old rag picker whom I see in the recollections of my childhood seven A disease of the skin to which all who work in the water are liable And yet you are not unhappy There are worse than I am and without my dreams of the sergeant and soldiers with their throats cut for I have the dream still sometimes I could quietly wait for the moment when I should drop down dead at the corner of some dunghill like that at which I was born but the dream the dream by heaven and earth I don t like even to think of that said the Chourineur and he emptied his pipe at the corner of the table The Goualeuse had hardly listened to the Chourineur she seemed wholly absorbed in a deep and melancholy reverie Rodolph himself was pensive A tragic incident occurred which brought these three personages to a recollection of the spot in which they were CHAPTER V THE ARREST The man who had gone out for a moment after having requested the ogress to look after his jug and plate soon returned accompanied by a tall brawny man to whom he said It was a chance to meet in this way old fellow Come in and let us have a glass together The Chourineur said in a low voice to Rodolph and the Goualeuse pointing to the newcomer We shall have a row He s a trap Look out for squalls The two ruffians one of whom with the Greek skull cap pulled over his brows had inquired several times for the Schoolmaster and the Gros Boiteux exchanged rapid glances of the eye and rising suddenly from the table went towards the door but the two police officers uttering a peculiar note seized them A fierce struggle ensued The door of the tavern opened and all of the policemen dashed into the room whilst outside were seen the muskets of the gens d armes Taking advantage of the tumult the charcoal seller of whom we have spoken advanced to the threshold of the tapis franc and meeting the eye of Rodolph he put to his lips the forefinger of his right hand Rodolph with a gesture as rapid as it was imperious desired him to go and then turned his attention to the scene before him The man with the Greek skull cap shrieked with rage and half extended on a table struggled so desperately that three men could scarcely hold him His companion enfeebled dejected with livid aspect and pale lips his lower jaw fallen and shaking convulsively made no resistance but held out his hands to be enclasped by the handcuffs The ogress seated at her bar and used to such scenes remained motionless with her hands in the pockets of her apron What have these fellows done my dear M Narcisse Borel inquired she of one of the policemen whom she knew Killed an old woman yesterday in the Rue saint Christophe and robbed her chamber Before she died the poor old thing said that she had bitten one of her murderers in the hand We had our eyes on these two scoundrels and my comrade having come to make sure of his men why we have made free to take them How lucky they paid me beforehand for their pint said the ogress Won t you take a dram o nothin short M Narcisse Just a go of Ratifi of the Column Thanks Mother Ponisse but I must make sure of my game one fellow shows fight still The assassin in the Greek cap was furious with rage and when they tried to get him into a hackney coach which was waiting in the street he resisted so stoutly that they were obliged to carry him His accomplice seized with a nervous tremor could hardly support himself and his blue lips trembled as though he were speaking They threw him helpless and unresisting into the vehicle Before he left the tapis franc the head officer looked attentively at the other guests assembled and said to the Chourineur in a tone almost kind What you here you bad lot Why it is a long time since we heard anything of you What no more rows Are you growing steady Steady as a stone figure Why you know that now I never break a head even if I am begged to do so Oh I don t think that would cost you much trouble strong as you are Yet here is my master said the Chourineur laying his hand on Rodolph s shoulder Stay I do not know him said the agent de police looking steadfastly at Rodolph And I do not think we shall form an acquaintance now replied he I hope not for your sake my fine fellow said the agent then turning to the ogress Good night Mother Ponisse your tapis franc is a regular mouse trap this is the third assassin I have taken here I hope it won t be the last M Narcisse it is quite at your service said the ogress making a very insinuating nod with her head After the departure of the police the young vagabond with the haggard visage who was smoking and drinking brandy refilled his pipe and said in a hoarse voice to the Chourineur Didn t you twig the cove in the Greek cap He s Boulotte s man When I saw the traps walk in I says to myself says I there s something up and then too I saw him keep his hand always under the table It s lucky for the Schoolmaster and Gros Boiteux that they were not here said the ogress Greek cap asked twice for him and said they had business together but I never turn nose informer on any customer If they take them very well every one to his trade but I never sell my friends Oh talk of the old gentleman and you see his horns added the hag as at the moment a man and woman entered the cabaret here they are the Schoolmaster and his companion Well he was right not to show her for I never see such an ugly creetur in my born days She ought to be very much obliged to him for having taken up with such a face At the name of the Schoolmaster a sort of shudder seemed to circulate amongst the guests of the tapis franc Rodolph himself in spite of his natural intrepidity could not wholly subdue a slight emotion at the sight of this redoubtable ruffian whom he contemplated for some seconds with a mixed feeling of curiosity and horror The Chourineur had spoken truth when he said that the Schoolmaster was frightfully mutilated Nothing can be imagined more horrible than the countenance of this man His face was furrowed in all directions with deep livid cicatrices the corrosive action of the vitriol had puffed out his lips the cartilages of his nose were divided and two misshapen holes supplied the loss of nostrils His gray eyes were bright small circular and sparkled savagely his forehead as flat as a tiger s was half hidden beneath a fur cap with long yellow hair looking like the crest of a monster The Schoolmaster was not more than five feet four or five his head which was disproportionately large was buried between two shoulders broad powerful and fleshy displaying themselves even under the loose folds of his coarse cotton blouse he had long muscular arms hands short thick and hairy to the very fingers end with legs somewhat bowed whose enormous calves betokened his vast strength This man presented in fact the exaggeration of what there is of short thickset and condensed in the type of the Hercules Farnese As to the expression of ferocity which suffused this hideous mask and the restless wild and glaring look more like a wild beast than a human being it is impossible to describe them The woman who accompanied the Schoolmaster was old and rather neatly dressed in a brown gown with a plaid shawl of red and black check and a white bonnet Rodolph saw her profile and her green eye hooked nose skinny lips peaked chin and countenance at once wicked and cunning reminded him involuntarily of La Chouette that horrible old wretch who had made poor Fleur de Marie her victim He was just on the point of saying this to the girl when he saw her suddenly turn pale with fright whilst looking at the hideous companion of the Schoolmaster and seizing the arm of Rodolph with a trembling hand the Goualeuse said in a low voice Oh the Chouette the Chouette the one eyed woman At this moment the Schoolmaster after having exchanged a few words in an undertone with Barbillon came slowly towards the table where Rodolph the Goualeuse and the Chourineur were sitting and addressing himself to Fleur de Marie in a hoarse voice said Ah my pretty fair miss you must quit these two muffs and come with me The Goualeuse made no reply but clung to Rodolph her teeth chattering with fright And I shall not be jealous of my man my little fourline a pet word for assassin added the Chouette laughing loudly She had not yet recognised in Goualeuse Pegriotte her old victim Well my little white face dost hear me said the monster advancing If thou dost not come I ll poke your eye out and make you a match for the Chouette And thou with the moustache he said to Rodolph if thou dost not stand from between me and the wench I ll crack thy crown Defend me oh defend me cried Fleur de Marie to Rodolph clasping her hands Then reflecting that she was about to expose him to great danger she added in a low voice No no do not move Mister Rodolph if he comes nearer I will cry out for help and for fear of the disturbance which may call in the police the ogress will take my part Don t be alarmed my child said Rodolph looking calmly at the Schoolmaster you are beside me don t stir and as this ill looking scoundrel makes you as well as myself feel uncomfortable I will kick him out Thou said the Schoolmaster I said Rodolph And in spite of the efforts of the Goualeuse he rose from the table Despite his hardihood the Schoolmaster retreated a step so threatening were the looks so commanding the deportment of Rodolph There are peculiar glances of the eye which are irresistible and certain celebrated duellists are said to owe their bloody triumphs to this fascinating glance which unmans paralyses and destroys their adversaries The Schoolmaster trembled retreated a step and for once distrustful of his giant strength felt under his blouse for his long cut and thrust knife A murder would have stained the tapis franc no doubt if the Chouette taking the Schoolmaster by the arm had not screamed out A minute a minute fourline let me say a word You shall walk into these two muffs all the same presently The Schoolmaster looked at her with astonishment For some minutes she had been looking at Fleur de Marie with fixed and increasing attention as if trying to refresh her memory At length no doubt remained and she recognised the Goualeuse Is it possible she cried clasping her hands in astonishment It is Pegriotte who stole my barley sugar But where do you come from Is it the devil who sends you back and she shook her clenched hand at the young girl You won t come into my clutch again eh But be easy if I do not pull out your teeth I will have out of your eyes every tear in your body Come no airs and graces You don t know what I mean Why I have found out the people who had the care of you before you were handed over to me The Schoolmaster saw at the Pre the galleys the man who brought you to my crib when you were a brat and he has proofs that the people who had you first were gentry coves rich people My parents Do you know them cried Fleur de Marie Never mind whether I know them or not you shall know nothing about it The secret is mine and my fourline s and I will tear out his tongue rather than he shall blab it What it makes you snivel does it Pegriotte Oh no said Goualeuse with a bitterness of accent now I do not care ever to know my parents Whilst La Chouette was speaking the Schoolmaster had resumed his assurance for looking at Rodolph he could not believe that a young man of slight and graceful make could for a moment cope with him and confident in his brutal force he approached the defender of Goualeuse and said to the Chouette in an imperious voice Hold your jaw I ll tackle with this swell and then the fair lady may think me more to her fancy than he is With one bound Rodolph leaped on the table Take care of my plates shouted the ogress The Schoolmaster stood on his guard his two hands in front his chest advanced firmly planted on his legs and arched as it were on his brawny legs which were like balusters of stone At the moment when Rodolph was springing at him the door of the tapis franc opened with violence and the charcoal man of whom we have before spoken and who was upwards of six feet high dashed into the apartment pushed the Schoolmaster on one side rudely and coming up to Rodolph said in German in his ear Monseigneur the countess and her brother they are at the end of the street At these words Rodolph made an impatient and angry gesture threw a louis d or on the bar of the ogress and made for the door in haste The Schoolmaster attempted to arrest Rodolph s progress but he turning to him gave him two or three rapid blows with his fists over the nose and eyes and with such potent effect that the beast staggered with very giddiness and fell heavily against a table which alone prevented his prostration on the floor Vive la Charte those are my blows I know them cried the Chourineur two or three more lessons like that and I shall know all about it Restored to himself after a few moments the Schoolmaster darted off in pursuit of Rodolph but he had disappeared with the charcoal man in the dark labyrinth of the streets of the Cite and the brigand found it useless to follow At the moment when the Schoolmaster had returned foaming with rage two persons approaching from the opposite side to that by which Rodolph had disappeared entered into the tapis franc hastily and out of breath as if they had been running far and fast Their first impulse was to look around the room How unfortunate said one of them he has gone another opportunity lost The two newcomers spoke in English The Goualeuse horror struck at meeting with the Chouette and dreading the threats of the Schoolmaster took advantage of the tumult and confusion caused by the arrival of the two fresh guests in the tapis franc and quietly gliding out by the half opened door left the cabaret CHAPTER VI THOMAS SEYTON AND THE COUNTESS SARAH The two persons who had just entered the tapis franc were quite of another class from those who ordinarily frequented it One tall and erect had hair almost white black eyebrows and whiskers a long and tanned face with a stiff formal air His long frock coat was buttoned up to the throat a la militaire We shall call this individual Thomas Seyton His companion was young pale and handsome and appeared about thirty one or two years of age His hair eyebrows and eyes were of a deep black which showed off the more fully the pure whiteness of his face By his step the smallness of his stature and the delicacy of his features it was easy to detect a woman in male habiliments This female was the Countess Sarah Macgregor We will hereafter inform our readers of the motives and events which had brought the countess and her brother into this cabaret of the Cite Call for something to drink Thomas and ask the people here about him perhaps they may give us some information said Sarah still speaking English The man with white hair and black eyebrows sat down at a table whilst Sarah was wiping her forehead and said to the ogress in excellent French Madame let us have something to drink if you please The entrance of these two persons into the tapis franc had excited universal attention Their dress their manners all announced that they never frequented low drinking shops whilst by their restless looks and disturbed countenances it might be judged that some very powerful motives had led them hither The Chourineur the Schoolmaster and the Chouette viewed them with increasing curiosity Startled by the appearance of such strange customers the ogress shared in the general surprise Thomas Seyton a second time and with an impatient tone said We have called for something to drink ma am pray let us have it Mother Ponisse flattered by their courtesy of manner left her bar and coming towards her new guests leaned her arms on their table and said Will you have a pint of wine in measure or a bottle A bottle of wine glasses and some water The ogress brought the supplies demanded and Thomas Seyton threw her a five franc piece and refused the change which she offered to him Keep it my good woman for yourself and perhaps you will take a glass with us You re uncommon purlite sir looking at the countess s brother with as much surprise as gratitude But tell me now said he we had appointed to meet a friend in a cabaret in this street and have perhaps mistaken the house in coming here This is the White Rabbit at your service sir That s right enough then said Thomas making a sign to Sarah yes it was at the White Rabbit that he was to give us the meeting There are not two White Rabbits in this street said the ogress with a toss of her head But what sort of a person was your friend Tall slim and with hair and moustaches of light chestnut said Seyton Exactly exactly that s the man who has just gone out A charcoal man very tall and stout came in and said a few words to him and they left together The very man we want to meet said Tom Were they alone here inquired Sarah Why the charcoal man only came in for one moment but your comrade supped here with the Chourineur and Goualeuse and with a nod of her head the ogress pointed out the individual of the party who was left still in the cabaret Thomas and Sarah turned towards the Chourineur After contemplating him for a few minutes Sarah said in English to her companion Do you know this man No Karl lost all trace of Rodolph at the entrance of these obscure streets Seeing Murphy disguised as a charcoal seller keeping watch about this cabaret and constantly peeping through the windows he was afraid that something wrong was going on and so came to warn us Murphy no doubt recognised him During this conversation held in a very low tone and in a foreign tongue the Schoolmaster said to the Chouette looking at Tom and Sarah The swell has shelled out a bull to the ogress It is just twelve rains and blows like the devil When they leave the crib we will be on their lay and draw the flat of his blunt As his mot is with him he ll hold his jaw If Tom and Sarah had heard this foul language they would not have understood it and would not have detected the plot against them Be quiet fourline answered the Chouette if the cull sings out for the traps I have my vitriol in my pocket and will break the phial in his patter box Nothing like a drink to keep children from crying she added Tell me darling sha n t we lay hands on Pegriotte the first time we meet with her And only let me once get her to our place and I ll rub her chops with my vitriol and then my lady will no longer be proud of her fine skin Well said Chouette I shall make you my wife some day or other said the Schoolmaster you have no equal for skill and courage On that night with the cattle dealer I had an opportunity of judging of you and I said Here s the wife for me she works better than a man And you said right fourline if the Skeleton had had a woman like me at his elbow he would not have been nabbed with his gully in the dead man s weasand He s done up and now he will not leave the stone jug except to kiss the headsman s daughter and be a head shorter What strange language these people talk said Sarah who had involuntarily heard the last few words of the conversation between the Schoolmaster and the Chouette Then she added pointing to the Chourineur If we ask this man some questions about Rodolph perhaps he may be able to answer them We can but try replied Thomas who said to the Chourineur Comrade we expected to find in this cabaret a friend of ours he supped with you I find Perhaps as you know him you will tell us which way he has gone I know him because he gave me a precious good hiding two hours ago to prevent me from beating Goualeuse And have you never seen him before Never we met by chance in the alley which leads to Bras Rouge s house Hostess another bottle of the best said Thomas Seyton Sarah and he had hardly moistened their lips and their glasses were still full but Mother Ponisse doubtless anxious to pay proper respect to her own cellar had frequently filled and emptied hers And put it on the table where that gentleman sits if he will permit added Thomas who with Sarah seated themselves beside the Chourineur who was as much astonished as flattered by such politeness The Schoolmaster and the Chouette were talking over their own dark plans in low tones and flash language The bottle being brought and Sarah and her brother seated with the Chourineur and the ogress who had considered a second invitation as superfluous the conversation was resumed You told us my good fellow that you met our comrade Rodolph in the house where Bras Rouge lives inquired Thomas Seyton as he hob and nobbed with the Chourineur Yes my good fellow replied he as he emptied his glass at a gulp What a singular name is Bras Rouge What is this Bras Rouge Il pastique la maltouze smuggles said the Chourineur in a careless tone and then added This is jolly good wine Mother Ponisse If you think so do not spare it my fine fellow said Seyton and he filled the Chourineur s glass as he spoke Your health mate said he and the health of your little friend who but mum If my aunt was a man she d be my uncle as the proverb says Ah you sly rogue I m up to you Sarah coloured slightly as her brother continued I did not quite understand what you meant about Bras Rouge Rodolph came from his house no doubt I told you that Bras Rouge pastique la maltouze Thomas regarded the Chourineur with an air of surprise What do you mean by pastique la mal What do you call it Pastiquer la maltouze He smuggles I suppose you would call it but it seems you can t patter flash My fine fellow I don t understand one word you say I see you can t talk slang like M Rodolph Slang said Thomas Seyton looking at Sarah with an astonished air Ah you are yokels but comrade Rodolph is an out and out pal he is Though only a fan painter yet he is as downy in flash as I am myself Well since you can t speak this very fine language I tell you in plain French that Bras Rouge is a smuggler and besides that has a small tavern in the Champs Elysees I say without breaking faith that he is a smuggler for he makes no secret of it but owns it under the very nose of the custom house officers Find him out though if you can Bras Rouge is a deep one What could Rodolph want at the house of this man asked Sarah Really sir or madam which you please I know nothing about anything as true as I drink this glass of wine I was chaffing to night with the Goualeuse who thought I was going to beat her and she ran up Bras Rouge s alley and I after her it was as dark as the devil Instead of hitting Goualeuse however I stumbled on Master Rodolph who soon gave me better than I sent Such thumps and especially those infernal thwacks with his fist at last My eyes how hot and heavy they did fall But he s promised to teach me and to And Bras Rouge what sort of a person is he asked Tom What goods does he sell Bras Rouge Oh by the Holy he sells everything he is forbidden to sell and does everything which it is forbidden to do That s his line ain t it Mother Ponisse Oh he s a boy with more than one string to his bow answered the ogress He is besides principal occupier of a certain house in the Rue du Temple a rum sort of a house to be sure but mum added she fearing to have revealed too much And what is the address of Bras Rouge in that street asked Seyton of the Chourineur No thirteen sir Perhaps we may learn something there said Seyton in a low voice to his sister I will send Karl thither to morrow As you know M Rodolph said the Chourineur you may boast the acquaintance of a stout friend and a good fellow If it had not been for the charcoal man he would have doubled up the Schoolmaster who is there in the corner with the Chouette By the Lord I can hardly contain myself when I see that old hag and know how she behaved to the Goualeuse but patience a blow delayed is not a blow lost as the saying is The Hotel de Ville clock struck midnight the lamp of the tavern only shed a dim and flickering light Except the Chourineur and his two companions the Schoolmaster and the Screech owl all the guests of the tapis franc had retired one after the other The Schoolmaster said in an undertone to the Chouette If we go and hide in the alley opposite we shall see the swells come out and know which road they take If they turn to the left we can double upon them at the turning of the Rue Saint Eloi if to the right we will wait for them by the ruins close to the tripe market There s a large hole close by and I have a capital idea The Schoolmaster and the Chouette then went towards the door You won t then take a drain of nothin to night said the ogress No Mother Ponisse we only came in to take shelter from the rain said the Schoolmaster as he and the Chouette went out CHAPTER VII YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE The noise which was made by the shutting of the door aroused Tom and Sarah from their reverie and they rose and having thanked the Chourineur for the information he had given them the fellow went out the wind blowing very strongly and the rain falling in torrents The Schoolmaster and the Chouette hidden in an alley opposite the tapis franc saw the Chourineur go down the street in the direction of the street in which the house in ruins was situated His steps which were somewhat irregular in consequence of the frequent libations of the evening were soon unheard amidst the whistling of the storm and the sheets of rain which dashed against the walls Sarah and Tom left the tavern in spite of the tempest and took a contrary direction to the Chourineur They re done for said the Schoolmaster in a low key to the Chouette out with your vitriol and mind your eye Let us take off our shoes and then they won t hear us as we follow suggested the Chouette You are right always right let us tread like cats my old darling The two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses By means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of Sarah and Tom they did not hear them Fortunately our hackney coach is at the end of the street the rain falls in torrents Are you not cold Sarah Perhaps we shall glean something from this smuggler this Bras Rouge said Sarah in a thoughtful tone and not replying to her brother s inquiry He suddenly stopped and said I have taken a wrong turning I ought to have gone to the right when I left the tavern we must pass by a house in ruins to reach the fiacre We must turn back The Schoolmaster and the Chouette who followed on the heels of their intended victims retreated into the dark porch of a house close at hand so that they might not be perceived by Tom and Sarah who in passing almost touched them with their elbows I am glad they have gone that way said the Schoolmaster for if the cove resists I have my own idea Sarah and her brother having again passed by the tapis franc arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its opened cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction In an instant the Schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized Seyton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed Your money or I will fling you into this hole Then the brigand pushing Seyton backwards shoved him off his balance and with one hand held him suspended over the mouth of the deep excavation whilst with his other hand he grasped the arm of Sarah as if in a vice Before Tom could make the slightest struggle the Chouette had emptied his pockets with singular dexterity Sarah did not utter a cry nor try to resist she only said in a calm tone Give up your purse brother and then accosting the robber We will make no noise do not do us any injury The Chouette having carefully searched the pockets of the two victims of this ambush said to Sarah Let s see your hands if you ve got any rings No said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring What a shame Tom Seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred Will you strike a bargain My pocketbook contains papers quite useless to you return it to me and to morrow I will give you twenty five louis d ors said Tom to the Schoolmaster whose hand relaxed something of its fierce gripe Oh ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief Be off without looking behind you and be thankful that you have escaped so well One moment said the Chouette if he behaves well he shall have his pocketbook There is a way Then addressing Thomas Seyton You know the plain of saint Denis I do Do you know where saint Ouen is Yes Opposite saint Ouen at the end of the road of La Revolte the plain is wide and open Across the fields one may see a long way Come there to morrow quite alone with your money in your hand you will find me and the pocketbook ready Hand me the cash and I will hand you the pocketbook But he ll trap you Chouette Oh no he won t I m up to him or any of his dodges We can see a long way off I have only one eye but that is a piercer and if the cove comes with a companion he won t find anybody I shall have mizzled A sudden idea seemed to strike Sarah and she said to the brigand Will you like to gain some money Yes Did you see in the cabaret we have just left for I know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek A dandy with moustaches Yes I would have stuck it into the fellow but he did not give me time He stunned me with two blows of his fists and upset me on the table for the first time that any man ever did so Curses on him but I will be revenged He is the man I mean said Sarah He cried the Schoolmaster a thousand francs and I ll kill him Wretch I do not seek his life replied Sarah to the Schoolmaster What then would you have Come to morrow to the plain of saint Denis you will there find my companion she replied you will see that he is alone and he will tell you what to do I will not give you one thousand but two thousand francs if you succeed Fourline said the Chouette in a low tone to the Schoolmaster there s blunt to be had these are a swell lot who want to be revenged on an enemy and that enemy is the beggar that you wished to floor Let s go and meet him I would go if I were you Fire and smoke Old boy it will pay for looking after Well my wife shall be there said the Schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and I shall see Be it so to morrow at one At one o clock In the plain of saint Denis In the plain of saint Denis Between saint Ouen and the road of La Revolte at the end of the road Agreed I will bring your pocketbook And you shall have the five hundred francs I promised you and we will agree in the other matter if you are reasonable Now you go to the right and we to the left hand Do not follow us or else The Schoolmaster and the Chouette hurried off whilst Tom and the countess went in the other direction towards Notre Dame A concealed witness had been present at this transaction it was the Chourineur who had entered the cellars of the house to get shelter from the rain The proposal which Sarah made to the brigand respecting Rodolph deeply interested the Chourineur who alarmed for the perils which appeared about to beset his new friend regretted that he could not warn him of them Perhaps his detestation of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette might have something to do with this feeling The Chourineur resolved to inform Rodolph of the danger which threatened him but how He had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter Perhaps Rodolph would never again come to the tapis franc and then how could he warn him Whilst he was conning all this over in his mind the Chourineur had mechanically followed Tom and Sarah and saw them get into a coach which awaited them near Notre Dame The fiacre started The Chourineur got up behind and at one o clock it stopped on the Boulevard de l Observatoire and Thomas and Sarah went down a narrow entrance which was close at hand The night was pitch dark and the Chourineur that he might know the next day the place where he then was drew from his pocket his clasp knife and cut a deep notch in one of the trees at the corner of the entrance and then returned to his resting place which was at a considerable distance For the first time for a very long while the Chourineur enjoyed in his den a comfortable sleep which was not once interrupted by the horrible vision of the Sergeant s slaughter house as in his coarse language he styled it CHAPTER VIII THE WALK On the day after the evening on which the various events we have described had passed a bright autumnal sun shone from a pure sky the darkness of the night had wholly disappeared Although always shaded by the height of the houses the disreputable neighbourhood into which the reader has followed us seemed less horrible when viewed in the light of open day Whether Rodolph no longer feared meeting with the two persons whom he had evaded the over night or did not care whether he faced them or not about eleven o clock in the morning he entered the Rue aux Feves and directed his steps towards the tavern of the ogress Rodolph was still in a workman s dress but there was a decided neatness in his costume His new blouse open on his chest showed a red woollen shirt closed by several silver buttons whilst the collar of another shirt of white cotton fell over a black silk cravat loosely tied around his neck From under his sky blue velvet cap with a bright leather peak several locks of chestnut hair were seen and his boots cleaned very brightly and replacing the heavy iron shoes of the previous evening showed off to advantage a well formed foot which seemed all the smaller from appearing out of a loose pantaloon of olive velveteen The costume was well calculated to display the elegant shape and carriage of Rodolph which combined so much grace suppleness and power The ogress was airing herself at her door when Rodolph presented himself Your servant young man you have come no doubt for your change of the twenty francs she said with some show of respect not venturing to forget that the conqueror of the Chourineur had handed her a louis d or the previous evening There is seventeen francs ten sous coming to you but that s not all There was somebody here asking after you last night a tall gent well dressed and with him a young woman in men s clothes They drank my best wine along with the Chourineur Oh with the Chourineur did they And what could they have to say to him When I say they drank I make a mistake they only just sipped a drain or so and But what did they say to the Chourineur Oh they talked of all manner of things of Bras Rouge and the rain and fine weather Do they know Bras Rouge Not by no means the Chourineur told em all about him and as how as you Well well that is not what I want to know You want your change Yes and I want to take Goualeuse to pass the day in the country Oh that s impossible Why Why Because she may never come back again Her things belong to me not including as she owes me a matter of ninety francs as a balance for her board and lodging for the six weeks as she has lodged with me and if I didn t know her to be as honest a gal as is I should never let her go out of sight Goualeuse owes you ninety francs Ninety francs ten sous but what s that to you my lad Are you a going to come my lord and pay it for her Yes said Rodolph throwing five louis on the ogress s bar and what s your price for the clothes she wears The old hag amazed looked at the louis one after the other with an air of much doubt and mistrust What do you think I have given you bad money Send and get change for one of them but make haste about it I say again how much for the garments the poor girl is wearing The ogress divided between her desire to make a good harvest her surprise to see a workman with so much money the fear of being cheated and the hopes of still greater gain was silent for an instant and then replied Oh them things is well worth a hundred francs What those rags Come now you shall keep the change from yesterday and I ll give you another louis and no more If I give you all I have I shall cheat the poor who ought to get some alms out of me Well then my fine fellow I ll keep my things and Goualeuse sha n t go out I have a right to sell my things for what I choose May Lucifer one day fry you as you deserve Here s your money go and look for Goualeuse The ogress pocketed the gold thinking that the workman had committed a robbery or received a legacy and then said with a nasty leer Well indeed Why not go up stairs and find Goualeuse yourself she ll be very glad to see you for on my life she was much smitten with you yesterday Do you go and fetch her and tell her I will take her into the country that s all you need say not a word about my having paid you her debt Why not What s that to you Oh nothing it s no matter to me I would rather that she still believed herself in my clutch Will you hold your tongue and do as I bid you Oh what a cross creetur you are I pity anybody who is under you Well I m going I m going and the ogress went up stairs After a few minutes she came down again Goualeuse would not believe me and really turned quite crimson when she knew you were here and when I told her that I would give her leave to pass the day in the country I thought she would have gone crazy for the first time in her life she was inclined to throw her arms about my neck That was her delight at leaving you Fleur de Marie entered at this moment dressed as she was the over night with her gown of brown stuff her little orange shawl tied behind her and her handkerchief of red checks over her head leaving only two thick bands of light hair visible She blushed when she saw Rodolph and looked down with a confused air Would you like to pass the day in the country with me my lass asked Rodolph Very much indeed M Rodolph said Goualeuse since madame gives me leave Yes yes you may go my little duck because you re such a good gal Come and kiss me afore you go And the old beldam offered her bloated lips to Fleur de Marie The poor girl overcoming her disgust bent her forehead to the ogress but Rodolph giving a sudden push with his elbow shoved the hag back on her seat took Fleur de Marie s arm and left the tapis franc amidst the loud maledictions of Mother Ponisse Mind M Rodolph said Goualeuse the ogress will perhaps throw something at you she is very spiteful Oh don t heed her my girl But what s the matter with you You seem embarrassed sad Are you sorry for having come out with me Oh dear no but but you give me your arm Well and what of that You are a workman and some one may tell your master that they met you with me and harm may come of it masters do not like their workmen to be unsteady And Goualeuse gently removed her arm from that of Rodolph adding Go on by yourself I will follow you to the barrier when we are once in the fields I can walk with you Do not be uneasy said Rodolph touched by the poor girl s consideration and taking her arm again my master does not live in this quarter and we shall find a coach on the Quai aux Fleurs As you please M Rodolph I only said so that you might not get into trouble I am sure of that and thank you very much But tell me is it all the same to you what part of the country we go into Yes quite so M Rodolph so that it be the country It is so fine and it is so nice to breathe the open air Do you know that I have not been farther than the flower market for these six weeks And now if the ogress allows me to leave the Cite she must have great confidence in me And when you came here was it to buy flowers Oh no I had no money I only came to look at them and breathe their beautiful smell During the half hour which the ogress allowed me to pass on the quay on market days I was so happy that I forgot everything else And on returning to the ogress and those filthy streets Oh why then I returned more sad than when I set out but I wiped my eyes that I might not be beaten for crying Yet at the market what made me envious oh so envious was to see neat clean little workwomen who were going away so gaily with a beautiful pot of flowers in their hands I am sure that if you had had but a few flowers in your own window they would have kept you company What you say is quite true M Rodolph Only imagine one day on her birthday the ogress knowing my taste gave me a little rose tree If you only knew how happy it made me I was never tired of looking at it my own rose tree I counted its leaves its flowers but the air of the Cite is bad and it began to wither in two days Then but you ll laugh at me M Rodolph No no go on Well then I asked the ogress to let me go out and take my rose tree for a walk as I would have taken a child out Well then I carried it to the quay thinking that to be with other flowers in the fresh and balmy air would do it good I bathed its poor fading leaves in the clear waters of the fountain and then to dry it I placed it for a full quarter of an hour in the sun Dear little rose tree it never saw the sun in the Cite any more than I did for in our street it never descends lower than the roof At last I went back again and I assure you M Rodolph that thanks to these walks my rose tree lived at least ten days longer than it would have done had I not taken such pains with it No doubt of it But when it died what a loss it must have been to you I cried heartily for it grieved me very very much and you see M Rodolph for you know one loves flowers although one hasn t any of one s own you see I felt grateful to it that dear rose tree for blooming so kindly for me although I was so Goualeuse bent her head and blushed deeply Unhappy child With this feeling of your own position you must often Have desired to end it you mean sir said Goualeuse interrupting her companion Yes yes more than once A month ago I looked over the parapet at the Seine but then when I looked at the flowers and the sun then I said The river will be always there I am but sixteen and a half who knows When you said who knows you had hope Yes And what did you hope To find some charitable soul who would get me work so that I might be enabled to leave the ogress and this hope comforted me Then I said to myself I am very wretched but I have never injured anybody and if I had any one to advise me I should not be as I am This lightened my sorrow a little though it had greatly increased at the loss of my rose tree added Goualeuse with a sigh Always so very sad Yes but look here it is And Goualeuse took from her pocket a little bundle of wood trimmed very carefully and tied with a rose coloured bow What have you kept it I have indeed it is all I possess in the world What have you nothing else Nothing This coral necklace Belongs to the ogress And you have not a piece of riband a cap or handkerchief No nothing nothing but the dead branches of my poor rose tree and that is why I love it so When Rodolph and Goualeuse had reached the Quai aux Fleurs a coach was waiting there into which Rodolph handed Goualeuse He got in himself saying to the driver To saint Denis I will tell you presently which road to take The coach went on The sun was bright and the sky cloudless whilst the air fresh and crisp circulated freely through the open windows Here is a woman s cloak said Goualeuse remarking that she had seated herself on the garment without having at first noticed it Yes it is for you my child I brought it with me for fear you should be cold Little accustomed to such attention the poor girl looked at Rodolph with surprise Mon Dieu M Rodolph how kind you are I am really ashamed Because I am kind No but you do not speak as you did yesterday you appear quite another person Tell me then Fleur de Marie which do you like best the Rodolph of yesterday or the Rodolph of to day I like you better now yet yesterday I seemed to be more your equal Then as if correcting herself and fearing to have annoyed Rodolph she said to him When I say your equal M Rodolph I do not mean that I can ever be that One thing in you astonishes me very much Fleur de Marie And what is that M Rodolph You appear to have forgotten that the Chouette said to you yesterday that she knew the persons who had brought you up Oh I have not forgotten it I thought of it all night and I cried bitterly but I am sure it is not true she invented this tale to make me unhappy Yet the Chouette may know more than you think If it were so should you not be delighted to be restored to your parents Alas sir if my parents never loved me what should I gain by discovering them They would only see me and But if they did ever love me what shame I should bring on them Perhaps I should kill them If your parents ever loved you Fleur de Marie they will pity pardon and still love you If they have abandoned you then when they see the frightful destiny to which they have brought you their shame and remorse will avenge you What is the good of vengeance You are right let us talk no more on the subject At this moment the carriage reached saint Ouen where the road divides to saint Denis and the Revolte In spite of the monotony of the landscape Fleur de Marie was so delighted at seeing the fields as she called them that forgetting the sad thoughts which the recollection of the Chouette had awakened in her her lovely countenance grew radiant with delight She leaned out of the window clasping her hands and crying M Rodolph how happy I am Grass Fields May I get out It is so fine I should so like to run in the meadows Let us run then my child Coachman stop What You too Will you run M Rodolph I m having a holiday Oh What pleasure And Rodolph and Goualeuse taking each other s hand ran as fast as they could over a long piece of latter grass just mowed It would be impossible to describe the leaps and exclamations of joy the intense delight of Fleur de Marie Poor lamb so long a prisoner she inspired the free air with indescribable pleasure She ran returned stopped and then raced off again with renewed happiness At the sight of the daisies and buttercups Goualeuse could not restrain her transport she did not leave one flower which she could gather After having run about in this way for some time she became rather tired for she had lost the habit of exercise and stopped to take breath sitting down on the trunk of a fallen tree which was lying at the edge of a deep ditch Illustration She Proffered to Rodolph the Bouquet Etching by Mercier after the drawing by Frank T Merrill The clear and white complexion of Fleur de Marie generally rather pale was now heightened by the brightest colour Her large blue eyes sparkled brightly her vermilion lips partly opened to recover her breath displayed two rows of liquid pearls her bosom throbbed under her worn out little orange shawl and she placed one of her hands upon her heart as if to restrain its quickened pulsation whilst with the other hand she proffered to Rodolph the bouquet of field flowers which she had just gathered Nothing could be more charming than the combination of innocence and pure joy which beamed on her expressive countenance When Fleur de Marie could speak she said to Rodolph with an accent of supreme happiness and of gratitude almost amounting to piety How good is the great God to give us so fine a day A tear came into Rodolph s eye when he heard this poor forsaken despised lost creature utter a cry of happiness and deep gratitude to the Creator because she enjoyed a ray of sunshine and the sight of a green field He was roused from his reverie by an unexpected occurrence CHAPTER IX THE SURPRISE We have said that Goualeuse was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree at the edge of a deep ditch Suddenly a man springing up from the bottom of this hollow shook the rubbish from him under which he had concealed himself and burst into a loud fit of laughter Goualeuse turned around screaming with alarm It was the Chourineur Don t be frightened my girl said the Chourineur when he saw her extreme fear and that she had sought protection from her companion Ah Master Rodolph here s a curious meeting which I am sure neither you nor I expected Then he added in a serious tone Listen master People may say what they like but there is something in the air there up there above our heads very wonderful which seems to say to a man Go where I send you See how you two have been sent here It is devilish wonderful What are you doing there said Rodolph greatly surprised I was on the lookout in a matter of yours master but thunder and lightning what a high joke that you should come at this particular moment into this very neighbourhood of my country house There s something in all this decidedly there is something But again I ask you what are you doing there All in good time I ll tell you only let me first look about me for a moment The Chourineur then ran towards the coach which was some distance off looked this way and that way over the plain with a keen and rapid glance and then rejoined Rodolph running quickly Will you explain to me the meaning of all this Patience patience good master one word more What s o clock Half past twelve said Rodolph looking at his watch All right we have time then The Chouette will not be here for the next half hour The Chouette cried Rodolph and the girl both at once Yes the Chouette in two words master I ll tell you all Yesterday after you had left the tapis franc there came A tall man with a woman in man s attire who asked for me I know all about that but then Then they paid for my liquor and wanted to draw me about you I had nothing to tell them because you had communicated nothing to me except those fisticuffs which settled me All I know is that I learned something then which I shall not easily forget But we are friends for life and death Master Rodolph though the devil burn me if I know why I feel for you the regard which the bulldog feels for his master It was after you told me that I had heart and honour but that s nothing so there s an end of it It is no use trying to account for it so it is and so let it be if it s any good to you Many thanks my man but go on The tall man and the little lady in men s clothes finding that they could get nothing out of me left the ogress s and so did I they going towards the Palais de Justice and I to Notre Dame On reaching the end of the street I found it was raining pitchforks points downward a complete deluge There was an old house in ruins close at hand and I said to myself If this shower is to last all night I shall sleep as well here as in my own crib So I rolled myself into a sort of cave where I was high and dry my bed was an old beam and my pillow a heap of lath and plaster and there I slept like a king Well well go on We had drank together Master Rodolph I had drank too with the tall man and the little woman dressed in man s clothes so you may believe my head was rather heavy and besides nothing sends me off to sleep like a good fall of rain I began then to snooze but I had not been long asleep I think when aroused by a noise I sat up and listened I heard the Schoolmaster who was talking in a friendly tone with somebody I soon made out that he was parleying with the tall man who came into the tapis franc with the little woman dressed in man s clothes They in conference with the Schoolmaster and the Chouette said Rodolph with amazement With the Schoolmaster and the Chouette and they agreed to meet again on the morrow That s to day said Rodolph At one o clock This very moment Where the road branches off to saint Denis and La Revolte This very spot Just as you say Master Rodolph on this very spot The Schoolmaster Oh pray be on your guard M Rodolph exclaimed Fleur de Marie Don t be alarmed my child he won t come it s only the Chouette How could the man who with the female in disguise sought me at the tapis franc come into contact with these two wretches said Rodolph I faith I don t know and I think I only awoke at the end of the affair for the tall man was talking of getting back his pocketbook which the Chouette was to bring here in exchange for five hundred francs I should say that the Schoolmaster had begun by robbing him and that it was after that that they began to parley and to come to friendly terms It is very strange Mon Dieu it makes me quite frightened on your account M Rodolph said Fleur de Marie Master Rodolph is no chicken girl but as you say there may be something working against him and so I am here Go on my good fellow The tall man and the little woman have promised two thousand francs to the Schoolmaster to do to you I don t know what The Chouette is to be here directly to return the pocketbook and to know what is required from them which she is to tell the Schoolmaster who will undertake it Fleur de Marie started Rodolph smiled disdainfully Two thousand francs to do something to you Master Rodolph that makes me think that when I see a notice of a dog that has been lost I don t mean to make a comparison and the offer of a hundred francs reward for his discovery I say to myself Animal if you were lost no one would give a hundred farthings to find you Two thousand francs to do something to you Who are you then I ll tell you by and by That s enough master When I heard this proposal I said to myself I must find out where these two dons live who want to set the Schoolmaster on the haunches of M Rodolph it may be serviceable So when they had gone away I got out of my hiding place and followed them quietly I saw the tall man and little woman get into a coach near Notre Dame and I got up behind and we went on until we reached the Boulevard de l Observatoire It was as dark as the mouth of an oven and I could not distinguish anything so I cut a notch in a tree that I might find out the place in the morning Well thought of my good fellow This morning I went there and about ten yards from the tree I saw a narrow entrance closed by a gate In the mud there were little and large footsteps and at the end of the entrance a small garden gate where the traces ended so the roosting place of the tall man and the little woman must be there Thanks my worthy friend you have done me a most essential piece of service without knowing it I beg your pardon Master Rodolph but I believed I was serving you and that was the reason I did as I did I know it my fine fellow and I wish I could recompense your service more properly than by thanks but unfortunately I am only a poor devil of a workman although you say they offer two thousand francs for something to be done against me I will explain that to you Yes if you like but not unless Somebody threatens you with something and I will come across them if I can the rest is your affair I know what they want Listen to me I have a secret for cutting fans in ivory by a mechanical process but this secret does not belong to me alone I am awaiting my comrade to go to work and no doubt it is the model of the machine which I have at home that they are desirous of getting from me at any price for there is a great deal of money to be made by this discovery The tall man and the little woman then are Work people with whom I have been associated and to whom I have refused my secret This explanation appeared satisfactory to the Chourineur whose apprehension was not the clearest in the world and he replied Now I understand it all The beggars you see they have not the courage to do their dirty tricks themselves But to come to the end of my story I said to myself this morning I know the rendezvous of the Chouette and the tall man I will go there and wait for them I have good legs and my employer will wait for me I came here and found this hole and taking an armful of stuff from the dunghill yonder I hid myself here up to my nose and waited for the Chouette But lo and behold you came into the field and poor Goualeuse came and sat down on the very edge of my park and then I determined to have a bit of fun and jumping out of my lair I called out like a man on fire And now what do you propose to do To wait for the Chouette who is sure to come first to try and overhear what she and the tall man talk about for that may be useful for you to know There is nothing in the field but this trunk of a tree and from here you may see all over the plain it is as if it were made on purpose to sit down upon The rendezvous of the Chouette is only four steps off at the cross road and I will lay a bet they come and sit here when they arrive If I cannot hear anything then as soon as they separate I will follow the Chouette who is sure to stay last and I ll pay her the old grudge I owe her for the Goualeuse s tooth and I ll twist her neck until she tells me the name of the parents of the poor girl for she says she knows them What do you think of my idea Master Rodolph I like it very well my lad but there is one part which you must alter Oh Chourineur do not get yourself into any quarrel on my account If you beat the Chouette then the Schoolmaster Say no more my lass The Chouette shall not go scot free for me Confound it why for the very reason that the Schoolmaster will defend her I will double her dose Listen my man to me I have a better plan for avenging the Chouette s brutalities to Goualeuse which I will tell you hereafter Now said Rodolph moving a few paces from Goualeuse and speaking low Now will you render me a real service Name it Master Rodolph The Chouette does not know you I saw her yesterday for the first time at the tapis franc This is what you must do Hide yourself first but when you see her come close to you get out of this hole And twist her neck No defer that for a time To day only prevent her from speaking to the tall man He seeing some one with her will not approach and if he does do not leave her alone for a moment He cannot make his proposal before you If the man thinks me curious I know what to do he is neither the Schoolmaster nor Master Rodolph I will follow the Chouette like her shadow and the man shall not say a word that I do not overhear He will then be off and after that I will have one little turn with the Chouette I must have it it will be such a sweet drop for me Not yet the one eyed hag does not know whether you are a thief or not No not unless the Schoolmaster has talked of me to her and told her that I did not do business in that line If he have you must appear to have altered your ideas on that subject I Yes Ten thousand thunders M Rodolph what do you mean Indeed truly I don t like it it does not suit me to play such a farce as that You shall only do what you please but you will not find that I shall suggest any infamous plan to you The tall man once driven away you must try and talk over the Chouette As she will be very savage at having missed the good haul she expected you must try and smooth her down by telling her that you know of a capital bit of business which may be done and that you are then waiting for your comrade and that if the Schoolmaster will join you there is a lump of money to be made Well well After waiting with her for an hour you may say My mate does not come and so the job must be put off and then you may make an appointment with the Chouette and the Schoolmaster for to morrow at an early hour Do you understand me Quite And this evening at ten o clock meet me at the corner of the Champs Elysees and the Allee des Veuves and I will tell you more If it is a trap look out The Schoolmaster is a scoundrel You have beaten him and no doubt he will kill you if he can Have no fear By Jove it is a rum start but do as you like with me I do not hesitate for something tells me that there is a rod in pickle for the Schoolmaster and the Chouette One word though if you please M Rodolph Say it I do not think you are the man to lay a trap and set the police on the Schoolmaster He is an arrant blackguard who deserves a hundred deaths but to have them arrested that I will not have a hand in Nor I my boy but I have a score to wipe off with him and the Chouette because they are in a plot with others against me but we two will baffle them completely if you will lend me your assistance Of course I will and if that is to be the game I am your man But quick quick cried the Chourineur down there I see the head of the Chouette I know it is her bonnet Go go and I will drop into my hole To night then at ten o clock At the corner of the Champs Elysees and the Allee des Veuves all right Fleur de Marie had not heard a word of the latter part of the conversation between the Chourineur and Rodolph and now entered again into the coach with her travelling companion CHAPTER X CASTLES IN THE AIR For some time after this conversation with the Chourineur Rodolph remained preoccupied and pensive while Fleur de Marie too timid to break the silence continued to gaze on him with saddened earnestness At length Rodolph looked up and meeting her mournful look smiled kindly on her and said What are you thinking of my child I fear our rencontre with the Chourineur has made you uncomfortable and we were so merry too Oh no M Rodolph indeed I do not mind it at all nay I even believe the meeting with the Chourineur may be useful to you Did not this man pass amongst the inhabitants of the tapis franc as possessing some good points among his many bad ones Indeed I know not M Rodolph for although previously to the scene of yesterday I had frequently seen him I had scarcely ever spoken to him I always looked upon him as bad as all the rest Well well do not let us talk any more about him my pretty Fleur de Marie I should be sorry indeed to make you sad I who brought you out purposely that you might spend a happy day Oh I am happy It is so very long since I have been out of Paris Not since your grand doings with Rigolette Yes indeed M Rodolph but that was in the spring Yet though it is now autumn I enjoy it quite as much How beautifully the sun shines Only look at the gold coloured clouds out there there I mean and then that hill with its pretty white houses half hid among the trees and the leaves still so green though we are in the middle of the month of October Do not you think it is wonderful M Rodolph they should so well preserve their verdure In Paris all the leaves wither so soon Look look at those pigeons how many there are and how high they fly Now they are settling on that old mill One is never tired in the open fields of looking at all these amusing sights It is indeed a pleasure to behold the delight you seem to take in all these trifling matters Fleur de Marie though they in reality constitute the charm of a landscape And Rodolph was right for the countenance of his companion while gazing upon the fair calm scene before her was lit up with an expression of the purest joy See she exclaimed after intently watching the different objects that unfolded themselves to her eager look see how beautifully the clear white smoke rises from those cottages and ascends to the very clouds themselves and there are some men ploughing the land What a capital plough they have got drawn by those two fine gray horses Oh if I were a man how I should like to be a husbandman to go out in the fields and drive one s own plough and then when you look to see the blue skies and the green shiny leaves of the neighbouring forests such a day as to day for instance when you feel half inclined to weep without knowing why and begin singing old and melancholy songs like Genevieve de Brabant Do you know Genevieve de Brabant M Rodolph No my child but I hope you will have the kindness to sing it to me before the day is over You know our time is all our own At these words which reminded the poor Goualeuse that her newly tasted happiness was fast fleeting away and that at the close of this the brightest day that had ever shone on her existence she must return to all the horrors of a corrupt city her feelings broke through all restraint she hid her face in her hands and burst into tears Much surprised at her emotion Rodolph kindly inquired its cause What ails you Fleur de Marie What fresh grief have you found Nothing nothing indeed M Rodolph replied the girl drying her eyes and trying to smile Pray forgive me for being so sad and please not to notice it I assure you I have nothing at all to grieve about it is only a fancy and now I am going to be quite gay you will see And you were as gay as could be a few minutes ago Yes I know I was and it was my thinking how soon answered Fleur de Marie naively and raising her large tearful blue eyes with touching candour to his face The look the words fully enlightened Rodolph as to the cause of her distress and wishing to dissipate it he said smilingly I would lay a wager you are regretting your poor rose tree and are crying because you could not bring it out walking with you as you used to do La Goualeuse fell into the good natured scheme for regaining her cheerfulness and by degrees the clouds of sadness cleared away from her fair young face and once again she appeared absorbed in the pleasure of the moment without allowing herself to recollect the future that would succeed it The vehicle had by this time almost arrived at saint Denis and the tall spires of the cathedral were visible Oh what a fine steeple exclaimed La Goualeuse It is that of the splendid church of saint Denis would you like to see it We can easily stop our carriage Poor Fleur de Marie cast down her eyes From the hour I went to live with the ogress said she in a low tone while deep blushes dyed her cheek I never once entered a church I durst not When in prison on the contrary I used to delight in helping to sing the mass and against the Fete Dieu oh I made such lovely bouquets for the altar But God is merciful and good why then fear to pray to him or to enter his holy church Oh no no M Rodolph I have offended God deeply enough let me not add impiety and sacrilege to my sins After a moment s silence Rodolph again renewed the conversation and kindly taking the hand of La Goualeuse said Fleur de Marie tell me honestly have you ever known what it is to love Never M Rodolph And how do you account for this You saw the kind of persons who frequented the tapis franc And then to love the object should be good and virtuous Why do you think so Oh because one s lover or husband would be all in all to us and we should seek no greater happiness than devoting our life to him But M Rodolph if you please we will talk of something else for the tears will come into my eyes Willingly Fleur de Marie let us change the conversation And now tell me why do you look so beseechingly at me with those large tearful eyes Have I done anything to displease you On the contrary tis the excess of your goodness that makes me weep indeed I could almost fancy that you had brought me out solely for my individual pleasure and enjoyment without thinking of yourself Not content with your generous defence of me yesterday you have to day procured for me happiness such as I never hoped to enjoy You are then truly and entirely happy Never never shall I forget to day Happiness does not often attend us on earth said Rodolph sighing Alas no Seldom perhaps never For my own part to make up for a want of reality in its possession I often amuse myself with pictures of what I would have if I could saying to myself this is how and where I should like to live this is the sort of income I should like to enjoy Have you never my little Fleur de Marie amused yourself with building similar castles in the air Yes formerly when I was in prison before I went to live with the ogress then I used to do nothing all day but dance sing and build these fairy dreams but I very seldom do so now Tell me M Rodolph if you could have any wish you liked what should you most desire Oh I should like to be rich with plenty of servants and carriages to possess a splendid hotel and to mix in the first circles of fashion to be able to obtain any amusement I pleased and to go to the theatres and opera whenever I chose Well then you would be more unreasonable than I should Now I will tell you exactly what would satisfy me in every respect first of all sufficient money to clear myself with the ogress and to keep me till I could obtain work for my future support then a pretty little nice clean room all to myself from the window of which I could see the trees while I sat at my work Plenty of flowers in your casement of course Oh certainly And if it could be managed to live in the country always And that I think is all I should want Let me see a little room and work enough to maintain you those are positive necessaries but when one is merely wishing there is no harm in adding a few superfluities Should you not like such nice things as carriages diamonds and rich clothes Not at all All I wish for is my free and undisturbed liberty a country life and the certainty of not dying in a hospital Oh that idea is dreadful Above all things I would desire the certainty of its never being my fate Oh M Rodolph that dread often comes across me and fills me with terror Alas poor folks such as we are should not shrink from such things Tis not the dying in a charitable institution I dread or the poverty that would send me into it but the thoughts of what they do to your lifeless remains What do they do that shocks you so much Is it possible M Rodolph you have never been told what will become of you if you die in one of those places No indeed I have not do you tell me Well then I knew a young girl who had been a sort of companion to me when I was in prison she afterwards died in a hospital and what do you think Her body was given to the surgeons for dissection murmured the shuddering Fleur de Marie That is indeed a frightful idea And do these miserable anticipations often trouble you my poor girl Ah M Rodolph it surprises you that after my unhappy life I can feel any concern as to what becomes of my miserable remains God knows the feeling which makes me shrink from such an outrage to modesty is all my wretched fate has left me The mournful tone in which these words were uttered and the bitter feelings they contained went to the heart of Rodolph but his companion quickly perceiving his air of dejection and blaming herself for having caused it said timidly M Rodolph I feel that I am behaving very ill and ungratefully towards you who so kindly brought me out to amuse me and give me pleasure in return for which I only keep talking to you about all the dull and gloomy things I can think of I wonder how I can do so to be able even to recollect my misery when all around me smiles and looks so gay I cannot tell how it is words seem to rise from my lips in spite of myself and though I feel happier to day than I ever did before in my life my eyes are continually filling with tears You are not angry with me are you M Rodolph See too my sadness is going away as suddenly as it came There now it is all gone and shall not return to vex you any more I am determined Look M Rodolph just look at my eyes they do not show that I have been crying do they And here Fleur de Marie having repeatedly closed her eyes to get rid of the rebellious tears that would gather there opened them full upon Rodolph with a look of most enchanting candour and sweetness Put no restraint on yourself I beseech you Fleur de Marie be gay if you really feel so or sad if sadness most suits your present state of mind I have my own hours of gloom and melancholy and my sufferings would be much increased were I compelled to feign a lightness of heart I did not really possess Can it be possible M Rodolph that you are ever sad Quite possible my child and true Alas the prospect before me is but little brighter than your own I like you am without friends or parents what would become of me if I were to fall ill and be unable to earn my daily bread for I need scarcely tell you I live but from day to day and spend my money quite as fast as I obtain it Oh but that is wrong M Rodolph very very wrong said La Goualeuse in a tone of such deep and grave remonstrance as made him smile You should always lay by something Look at me why all my troubles and misfortunes have happened because I did not save my money more carefully If once a person can get a hundred francs beforehand he need never fear falling into any one s power generally a difficulty about money puts very evil thoughts into our head All that is very wise and very sensible my frugal little friend but a hundred francs that is a large sum how could a man like myself ever amass so much Why M Rodolph it is really very easy if you will but consider a little First of all I think you said you could earn five francs a day Yes so I can when I choose to work Ah but you should work constantly and regularly and yours is such a pretty trade To paint fans how nice such work must be mere amusement quite a recreation I cannot think why you should ever be tired or dull Indeed M Rodolph I must tell you plainly I do not pity you at all and besides really you talk like a mere child when you say you cannot save money out of such large earnings added La Goualeuse in a sweet but for her severe tone Why a workman may live well upon three francs a day there remain forty sous at the end of a month if you manage prudently you will have saved sixty francs Think of that There s a sum sixty francs in one month Oh but one likes to show off sometimes and to indulge in a little idleness There now M Rodolph I declare you make me quite angry to hear you talk so childishly Pray let me advise you to be wiser Come then my sage little monitress I will be a good boy and listen to all your careful advice And your idea of saving too is a remarkably good one I never thought of it before Really exclaimed the poor girl clapping her hands with joy Oh if you knew how delighted I am to hear you say so Then you will begin from to day to lay by the forty sous we were talking about will you Will you indeed I give you my honour that from this very hour I will resolve to follow up your most excellent plan and save forty sous out of each day s pay Are you quite quite sure you will Nay have I not promised you that I will You will see how proud and happy you will be with your first savings and that is not all ah if you would promise not to be angry Do I look as though I could be so unkind Fleur de Marie as to find fault with anything you said Oh no indeed that you do not only I hardly know whether I ought You ought to tell me everything you think or feel Fleur de Marie Well then I was wondering how you who it is easily seen are above your condition can frequent such low cabarets as that kept by the ogress Had I not done so I should not have had the pleasure of wandering in the fields with you to day my dear Fleur de Marie That is indeed true M Rodolph but still it does not alter my first opinion No much as I enjoy to day s treat I would cheerfully give up all thoughts of ever passing such another if I thought it could in any way injure you Injure me Far from it Think of the excellent advice you have been giving me Which you have promised me to follow I have and I pledge my word of honour to save henceforward at least forty sous a day Thus speaking Rodolph called out to the driver of their vehicle who was passing the village of Sarcelles Take the first road to the right cross Villiers to Bel turn to the left then keep along quite straight Now said Rodolph turning to his companion that I am a good boy and promised to do all you tell me let us go back to our diversion of building castles in the air that does not run away with much money You will not object to such a method of amusing myself will you Oh no build as many as you like they are very cheaply raised and very easily knocked down when you are tired of them Now then you begin Well then No Fleur de Marie you shall build up yours first I wonder if you could guess what I should choose if wishing were all M Rodolph Let us try Suppose that this road I say this road because we happen to be on it Yes yes of course this road is as good as any other Well then I say I suppose that this road leads to a delightful little village at a considerable distance from the highroad Oh yes that makes it so much more still and quiet It is built facing the south and half surrounded by trees And close by flows a gentle river Exactly a clear gently flowing river At the end of this village stands a pretty farm with a nice orchard on one side of it and a garden filled with flowers on the other That farm shall be called my farm to which we will pretend we are now going Just so And where we know we shall get some delicious milk to drink after our journey Milk indeed Excellent cream and newly laid eggs if you please And where we would be glad to stay all our lives All our lives Quite right go on And then we should go and see all the cows To be sure we should And afterwards visit the dairy Visit the dairy Yes Then the pigeon house Yes so we should Oh how very very nice only to think of such things But let me finish the description of the farm Yes pray do I quite forgot that Well then the ground floor contains two rooms one a large kitchen for the farm servants and the other for the owner of the place Make that room have green blinds M Rodolph do pray they are so cool and look so pretty Yes yes green blinds to the windows I quite agree with you they do look uncommonly pretty and set off a place so well Of course the person tenanting this farm is your aunt Of course she is my aunt and a very good sensible kind woman M Rodolph is she not Particularly so and loves you like her own child Dear good aunt Oh how delightful to have some one to love us And you return the tender affection she bears you Oh with all my heart exclaimed Fleur de Marie clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven with an expression impossible to describe And I should help her to work to attend to the family linen to keep everything neat and clean to store up the summer fruits against winter oh she would never have to complain that I was idle I promise First of all in the morning Wait a bit Fleur de Marie you are in too great a hurry I want to finish describing the house to you never mind your aunt just yet Ah ha mister Painter All this is taken from some pretty landscape you have been painting on a fan Now I know what makes you so expert at describing it said La Goualeuse laughing merrily at her own little jest You little chatterer be quiet will you Yes I am a chatterer indeed to interrupt you so often M Rodolph but pray go on and I will not speak again till you have finished painting this dear farm Your room is on the first floor My room how charming Oh go on go on please M Rodolph and describe all about it to me And the delighted girl opened her large laughing eyes and pressed more closely against Rodolph as if she expected to see the picture in his hand Your chamber has two windows looking out upon the flower garden and a small meadow watered by the river we mentioned On the opposite bank of the stream rises a small hill planted with fine old chestnut trees and from amongst them peeps out the village church Oh how beautiful how very beautiful M Rodolph It makes one quite long to be there Three or four fine cows are grazing in the meadow which is only separated from the garden by a hedge of honeysuckle And from my windows I can see the cows Perfectly And one among them ought to be my favourite you know M Rodolph and I ought to put a little bell round its neck and use it to feed out of my hands Of course she would come when you called her Let me see what name shall we give her Suppose we say Musette Do you like that She shall be very young and gentle and entirely white Oh what a pretty name Musette Ah Musette Musette I shall be always feeding you and patting you to make you know me Now we will finish the inside of your apartment Fleur de Marie The curtains and furniture are green like the blinds and outside the window grow an enormous rose tree and honeysuckle which entirely cover this side of the farm and so surround your casements that you have only to stretch out your hand to gather a large bunch of roses and honeysuckle wet with the early morning dew Ah M Rodolph what a good painter you are Now this is the way you will pass your day Yes yes let us see how I shall employ myself all day Early in the morning your good aunt wakes you with a tender kiss she brings with her a bowl of new milk just warm which she prays you to drink as she fancies you are delicate about the lungs poor dear child Well you do as she wishes you then rise and take a walk around the farm pay a visit to Musette the poultry your pets the pigeons the flowers in the garden till nine o clock when your writing master arrives My writing master Why you know unless you learned such necessary things as reading writing and accounts you would not be able to assist your aunt to keep her books relative to the produce of the farm Oh to be sure How very stupid of me not to recollect that I must learn to write well if I wished to help my aunt cried the young girl so thoroughly absorbed in the picture of this peaceful life as to believe for the moment in its reality After your lesson is concluded you will occupy yourself in household matters or embroider some pretty little article of dress for yourself then you will practise your writing for an hour or two and when that is done join your aunt in her round of visits to the different operations of the farm in the summer to see how the reapers get on in the hay field in harvest time to observe the reapers and afterwards to enjoy the delight with which the gleaners pick up the scattered ears of grain by this time you will have almost tired yourself and gathering a large handful of wild herbs carefully selected by you as the known favourites of your dear Musette you turn your steps homewards But we go back through the meadow dear M Rodolph do we not inquired La Goualeuse as earnestly as though every syllable her ears drank in was to be effectually brought to pass Oh yes by all means and there happens fortunately to be a nice little bridge by which the river separating the farm land from the meadow may be crossed By the time you reach home upon my word it is seven o clock and as the evenings begin to be a little chill a bright cheerful fire is blazing in the large farm kitchen you go in there for a few minutes just to warm yourself and to speak a few kind words to the honest labourers who are enjoying a hearty meal after the day s toil is over Then you sit down to dinner with your aunt sometimes the cure or a neighbouring farmer is invited to share the meal After dinner you read or work while your aunt and her guest have a friendly game at piquet At ten o clock she dismisses you with a kiss and a blessing to your chamber you retire to your room offer prayers and thanksgivings to the Great Author of all your happiness then sleep soundly till morning when the same routine begins again Oh M Rodolph one might lead such a life as that for a hundred years without ever knowing one moment s weariness But that is not all There are Sundays and fete days to be thought of Yes and how should we pass those Why you would put on your holiday dress with one of those pretty little caps a la paysanne which all admit you look so very nicely in and accompany your aunt in her large old fashioned chaise driven by James the farm servant to hear mass in the village church after which during summer your kind relative would take you to the different fetes given in the adjoining parishes You so gentle so modest and good looking so tenderly beloved by your aunt and so well spoken of by the cure for all the virtues and qualifications which make a good wife will have no scarcity of offers for your hand in the dance indeed all the principal young farmers will be anxious to secure you as a partner by way of opening an acquaintance which shall last for life By degrees you begin to remark one more than the others you perceive his deep desire to attract your undivided attention and so And here Rodolph struck by the continued silence of La Goualeuse looked up at her Alas the poor girl was endeavouring though fruitlessly to choke the deep sobs which almost suffocated her For a brief period carried away by the words of Rodolph the bright future presented to her mental vision had effaced the horrible present but too quickly did the hideous picture return and sweep away for ever the dear delight of believing so sweet so calm an existence could ever be hers Fleur de Marie asked Rodolph in a kind and affectionate tone why is this Why these tears Ah M Rodolph you have unintentionally caused me much pain Foolish girl that I was I had listened to you till I quite fancied this paradise were a true picture And so it is my dear child This paradise as you call it is no fiction Stop coachman Now look see observe where we are As the carriage stopped La Goualeuse at Rodolph s bidding mechanically raised her head they were on the summit of a little hill What was her surprise her astonishment at the scene which revealed itself to her gaze The pretty village built facing the south the farm the meadow the beautiful cows the little winding river the chestnut grove the church in the distance the whole picture so vividly painted was before her eyes Nothing was wanting even the milk white heifer Musette her future pet was peacefully grazing as she had been described The rich colouring of an October sun gilded the charming landscape while the variegated tint of the chestnut leaves slightly tinged by the autumnal breezes stood out in bold relief against the clear blue of the surrounding sky Well my little Fleur de Marie what do you say to this Am I a good painter or not La Goualeuse looked at him with a surprise in which a degree of uneasiness was mingled all she saw and heard appeared to her to partake largely of the supernatural M Rodolph she at length exclaimed with a bewildered look how can this be Indeed indeed I feel afraid to look at it it is so exactly alike I cannot believe it is anything but a dream you have conjured up and which will quickly pass away Speak to me pray do and tell me what to believe Calm yourself my dear child Nothing is more simple or true than what you behold here The good woman who owns this farm was my nurse and brought me up here intending to give myself a treat I sent to her early this morning to say I was coming to see her You see I painted after nature You are quite right M Rodolph sighed La Goualeuse There is indeed nothing but what is quite natural in all this The farm to which Rodolph had conducted Fleur de Marie was situated at the outer extremity of the village of Bouqueval a small isolated and unknown hamlet entirely surrounded by its own lands and about two leagues distance from Ecouen the vehicle following the directions of Rodolph rapidly descended the hill and entered a long avenue bordered with apple and cherry trees while the wheels rolled noiselessly over the short fine grass with which the unfrequented road was overgrown Fleur de Marie whose utmost efforts were unavailing to shake off the painful sensations she experienced remained so silent and mournful that Rodolph reproached himself with having by his well intentioned surprise been the cause of it In a few moments more the carriage passing by the large entrance to the farm entered a thick avenue of elm trees and stopped before a little rustic porch half hidden by the luxuriant branches of the vine which clustered round it Now Fleur de Marie here we are Are you pleased with what you see Indeed I am M Rodolph But how shall I venture before the good person you mentioned as living here Pray do not let her see me I cannot venture to approach her And why my child True M Rodolph I forget she does not know me and will not guess how unworthy I am And poor Fleur de Marie tried to suppress the deep sigh that would accompany her words The arrival of Rodolph had no doubt been watched for the driver had scarcely opened the carriage door when a prepossessing female of middle age dressed in the style of wealthy landholders about Paris and whose countenance though melancholy was also gentle and benevolent in its expression appeared in the porch and with respectful eagerness advanced to meet Rodolph Poor Goualeuse felt her cheeks flush and her heart beat as she timidly descended from the vehicle Good day good day Madame Georges said Rodolph advancing towards the individual so addressed you see I am punctual Then turning to the driver and putting money into his hand he said Here my friend there is no further occasion to detain you you may return to Paris as soon as you please The coachman a little short square built man with his hat over his eyes and his countenance almost entirely concealed by the high collar of his driving coat pocketed the money without a word remounted his seat gave his horses the whip and disappeared down the allee verte by which he had entered Fleur de Marie sprang to the side of Rodolph and with an air of unfeigned alarm almost amounting to distress said in a tone so low as not to be overheard by Madame Georges M Rodolph M Rodolph pray do not be angry but why have you sent away the carriage Will it not return to fetch us away Of course not I have quite done with the man and therefore dismissed him But the ogress What of her Why do you mention her name Alas alas because I must return to her this evening indeed indeed I must or or she will consider me a thief The very clothes I have on are hers and besides I owe her Make yourself quite easy my dear child it is my part to ask your forgiveness not you mine My forgiveness Oh for what can you require me to pardon you For not having sooner told you that you no longer owe the ogress anything that it rests only with yourself to decide whether you will henceforward make this quiet spot your home and cast off the garments you now wear for others my kind friend Madame Georges will furnish you with She is much about your height and can supply you with everything you require She is all impatience to commence her part of aunt I can assure you Poor Fleur de Marie seemed utterly unable to comprehend the meaning of all she saw and heard and gazed with wondering and perplexed looks from one companion to the other as though fearing to trust either her eyes or ears Do I understand you rightly she cried at length half breathless with emotion Not go back to Paris Remain here And this lady will permit me to stay with her Oh it cannot be possible I dare not hope it that would indeed be to realise our castles in the air Dear Fleur de Marie your wishes are realised your dream a true one No no you must be jesting that would be too much happiness to expect or even dare to hope for Nay Fleur de Marie we should never find fault with an oversupply of happiness Ah M Rodolph for pity s sake deceive me not you cannot believe the misery I should experience were you to tell me all this happiness was but a jest My child listen to me said Rodolph with a tone and manner which although still affectionate was mingled with a dignified accent and manner Fleur de Marie had never previously remarked in him I repeat that if you please you may from this very hour lead here with Madame Georges that peaceful life whose description but a short time since so much delighted you Though the kind lady with whom you will reside be not your aunt she will feel for you the most lively and affectionate interest and with the personages about the farm you will pass as being really and truly her niece and this innocent deception will render your residence here more agreeable and advantageous Once more I repeat to you Fleur de Marie you may now at your own pleasure realise the dream of our journey As soon as you have assumed your village dress said Rodolph smilingly we will take you to see that milk white heifer Musette who is to be your favourite henceforward and who is only waiting for the pretty collar you designed to ornament her with then we will go and introduce ourselves to your pets the pigeons afterwards visit the dairy and so go on till we have been all over the farm I mean to keep my promise in every respect I assure you Fleur de Marie pressed her hands together with earnest gratitude Surprise joy and the deepest thankfulness mingled with respect lit up her beautiful countenance while with eyes streaming with tears she exclaimed M Rodolph you are you must be one of those beneficent angels sent by the Almighty to do good upon earth and to rescue poor fallen creatures like myself from shame and misery My poor girl replied Rodolph with a smile of deep sadness and ineffable kindness though still young I have already deeply suffered I lost a dear child who if living would now be about your age Let that explain my deep sympathy with all who suffer and for yourself particularly Fleur de Marie or rather Marie only Now go with Madame Georges who will shew you the pretty chamber with its clustering roses and honeysuckle to form your morning bouquets Yes Marie henceforward let that name simple and sweet as yourself be your only appellation Before my departure we will have some talk together and then I shall quit you most happy in the knowledge of your full contentment Fleur de Marie without one word of reply gracefully bent her knee and before Rodolph could prevent her gently and respectfully raised his hand to her lips then rising with an air of modest submission followed Madame Georges who eyed her with a profound interest out of the room CHAPTER XI MURPHY AND RODOLPH Upon quitting the house Rodolph bent his steps towards the farmyard where he found the individual who the preceding evening disguised as a charcoal man had warned him of the arrival of Tom and Sarah Murphy which was the name of this personage was about fifty years of age his head nearly bald was still ornamented with a fringe of light brown hair at each side which the hand of time had here and there slightly tinged with gray his face was broad open and ruddy and free from all appearance of hair except very short whiskers of a reddish colour only reaching as low as the tip of the ear from which it diverged and stretched itself in a gentle curve across his rubicund cheeks Spite of his years and embonpoint Murphy was active and athletic his countenance though somewhat phlegmatic was expressive of great resolution and kindliness of nature he wore a white neck handkerchief a deep waistcoat and a long black coat with very wide skirts his breeches of an olive green colour corresponded in material with the gaiters which protected his sturdy legs without reaching entirely to the knee but allowing the strings belonging to his upper garment to display themselves in long unstudied bows in fact the dress and whole tournure of Murphy exactly accorded with the idea of what in England is styled a gentleman farmer Now the personage we are describing though an English squire was no farmer At the moment of Rodolph s appearance in the yard Murphy was in the act of depositing in the pocket of a small travelling caleche a pair of small pistols he had just been carefully cleaning What the devil are you going to do with those pistols inquired Rodolph That is my business my lord replied Murphy descending the carriage steps attend to your affairs and I will mind mine At what o clock have you ordered the horses According to your directions at nightfall You got here this morning I suppose I did at eight o clock Madame Georges has had ample time to make all the preparations you desired What has gone wrong Murphy You seem completely out of humour Have I done anything to offend you Can you not my lord accomplish your self imposed task without incurring so much personal risk Surely in order to lull all suspicion in the minds of the persons I seek to understand and fully appreciate I cannot do better than for a time to adopt their garb their language and their customs But all this did not prevent you my lord last night in that abominable place where we went to unkennel Bras Rouge in hopes of getting out of him some particulars relative to that unhappy son of Madame Georges from being angry and ready to quarrel with me because I wished to aid in your tussle with the rascal you encountered in that horrid cut throat alley I suppose then Murphy you do not think I am capable of defending myself and you either doubt my courage or the strength of my arm Unfortunately you have given me too many reasons to form a contrary opinion of both Thank God Flatman the Bertrand of Germany perfected you in the knowledge of fencing Tom Cribb taught you to box Lacour of Paris accomplished you in single stick wrestling and slang so as to render you fully provided for your venturesome excursions You are bold as a lion with muscles like iron and though so slight in form I should have no more chance with you than a dray horse would against a racer were they to compete with each other No mistake about that Then what are you afraid of Why I maintain my lord that it is not the right thing for you to throw yourself in the way of all these blackguards I do not say that because of the nuisance it is to a highly respectable individual of my acquaintance to blacken his face with charcoal and make himself look like a devil No God knows spite of my age my figure and my gravity I would disguise myself as a rope dancer if by so doing I could serve you But I still stick to what I say and Oh I know all you would say my excellent old fellow and that when once you have taken an idea into your thick skull the very devil himself could no more drive it out of you than he could by all his arts remove the fidelity and devotion implanted in your brave and valiant heart Come come my lord now you begin to flatter me I suspect you are up to some fresh mischief Think no such thing Murphy give yourself no uneasiness but leave all to me My lord I cannot be easy there is some new folly in hand and I am sure of it My good friend you mean well but you are choosing a very ill hour for your lectures forbear I beg And why my lord can you not listen to me now as well as any other time Because you are interfering with one of my short lived moments of pride and happiness I am here in this dear spot Where you have done so much good I know it Your model farm as you term it built by you to instruct to encourage and to reward deserving labourers has been of incalculable service to this part of the country Ordinary men think but of improving their cattle you more wisely and benevolently have directed your exertions for the bettering your fellow creatures Nothing can be better and when you placed Madame Georges at the head of the establishment you acted with the utmost wisdom and provident good sense What a woman she is No she is an angel so good so firm so noble and upright I am not easily moved my lord as you know but often have I felt my eyes grow moist as her many trials and misfortunes rise to my recollection But about your new protegee however my lord if you please we will not say much on that subject The least said is soonest mended as the old proverb has it Why not Murphy My lord you will do what you think proper I do what is just said Rodolph with an air of impatience What is just according to your own interpretation What is just before God and my own conscience replied Rodolph in a severe tone Well my lord this is a point on which we cannot agree and therefore let us speak no more about it I desire you will continue to talk about it cried Rodolph imperiously I have never been so circumstanced that your royal highness should have to bid me hold my tongue and I hope I shall not now be ordered to speak when I should be silent said Murphy proudly mister Murphy said Rodolph with a tone of increased irritation My lord You know sir how greatly I detest anything like concealment Your royal highness will excuse me but it suits me to have certain concealments said Murphy bluntly If I descend to familiarity with you sir it is on condition that you at least act with entire frankness towards me It is impossible to describe the extreme hauteur which marked the countenance of Rodolph as he uttered these words I am fifty years of age I am a gentleman and your royal highness should not address me in such a tone Be silent My lord Be silent I say Your royal highness does wrong in compelling a man of honour and feeling to recall the services he has rendered to you said the squire in a calm tone Have I not repaid those services in a thousand ways It should be stated that Rodolph had not attached to these bitter words the humiliating sense which could place Murphy in the light of a mercenary but such unfortunately was the esquire s interpretation of them He became purple with shame lifted his two clenched hands to his forehead with an expression of deep grief and indignation and then in a moment as by a sudden revulsion of feeling throwing his eyes on Rodolph whose noble countenance was convulsed by the violence of extreme disdain he said in a faltering voice and stifling a sigh of the tenderest pity My lord be yourself you surpass the bounds of reason These words impelled Rodolph to the very height of irritation his glance had even a savage glare in it his lips were blanched and advancing towards Murphy with a threatening aspect he exclaimed Dare you Murphy retreated and said in a quick tone and as if in spite of himself My lord my lord remember the thirteenth of January These words produced a magical effect on Rodolph His countenance contracted by anger now expanded He looked at Murphy steadfastly bowed his head and then after a moment s silence murmured in faltering accents Ah sir you are now cruel indeed I had thought that my repentance my deep remorse and yet it is you you Rodolph could not finish his voice was stifled he sunk subdued on a stone bench and concealed his countenance with both his hands My lord said Murphy in deep distress my good lord forgive me Forgive your old and faithful Murphy It was only when driven to an extremity and fearing alas not for myself but for you the consequences of your passion that I uttered those words I said them in spite of myself and with sorrow My lord I was wrong to be so sensitive Mon Dieu who can know your character your feelings if I do not I who have never left you from your childhood Pray oh pray say that you forgive me for having called to your recollection that sad sad day Alas what expiations have you not made Rodolph raised his head he was very pale and said to his companion in a gentle and saddened voice Enough enough my old friend I thank you for having by one word checked my headlong passion I make no apologies to you for the severe things I have said you know well that it is a long way from the heart to the lips as the good people at home say I was wrong let us say no more on the subject Alas now we shall be out of spirits for a long time as if I were not sufficiently unhappy I only wished to see you roused from your low spirits and yet I add to them by my foolish tenaciousness Good Heaven what s the use of being an honest man and having gray hairs if it does not enable us to endure reproaches which we do not deserve Be it so be it so we were both in the wrong my good friend said Rodolph mildly let us forget it and return to our former conversation You approved entirely of my establishment of this farm and the deep interest I have always felt in Madame Georges You will allow won t you that she had merited it by her excellent qualities her misfortunes even if she did not belong to the family of Harville a family to which my father had vowed eternal gratitude I have always approved of the sentiments which your lordship has entertained for Madame Georges But you are astonished at the interest I take in this poor girl are you not Pray pray my lord I was wrong I was wrong No I can imagine that appearances have deceived you but as you know my life all my life and as you aid me always with as much fidelity as courage in my self inflicted expiation it is my duty or if you like the phrase better my gratitude to convince you that I am not acting from a frivolous impulse Of that I am sure my lord You know my ideas on the subject of the good which a man ought to do who has the knowledge the will and the power To succour unhappy but deserving fellow creatures is well to seek after those who are struggling against misfortune with energy and honour and to aid them sometimes without their knowledge to prevent in right time misery and temptation is better to reinstate such perfectly in their own estimation to lead back to honesty those who have preserved in purity some generous and ennobling sentiments in the midst of the contempt that withers them the misery that eats into them the corruption that encircles them and for that end to brave in person this misery this corruption this contagion is better still to pursue with unalterable hatred with implacable vengeance vice infamy and crime whether they be trampling in the mud or be clothed in purple and fine linen that is justice but to give aid inconsiderately to well merited degradation to prostitute and lavish charity and commiseration by bestowing help on unworthy and undeserving objects is most infamous it is impiety very sacrilege it is to doubt the existence of the Almighty and so he who acts thus ought to be made to understand My lord I pray you do not think that I would for a moment assert that you have bestowed your benefits unworthily One word more my old friend You know well that the child whose death I daily deplore that that daughter whom I should have loved the more as her unworthy mother Sarah had shown herself so utterly indifferent about her would have been sixteen years of age like this unhappy girl You know too that I cannot prevent the deep and almost painful sympathy I feel for young girls of that age True my lord and I ought so to have interpreted the interest you evince for your protegee Besides to succour the unfortunate is to honour God It is my friend when the objects deserve it and thus nothing is more worthy of compassion and respect than a woman like Madame Georges who brought up by a pious and good mother in the strict observance of all her duties has never failed never and has moreover courageously borne herself in the midst of the most severe trials But is it not to honour God in the most acceptable way to raise from the dust one of those beings of the finest mould whom he has been pleased to endow richly Does not she deserve compassion and respect yes respect who unhappy girl abandoned to her own instinct who tortured imprisoned degraded sullied has yet preserved in holiness and pureness of heart those noble germs of good first implanted by the Almighty If you had but seen poor child how at the first word of interest expressed for her the first mark of kindness and right feeling the most charming natural impulses the purest tastes the most refined thoughts the most poetic ideas developed themselves abundantly in her ingenuous mind even as in the early spring a thousand wild flowers lift up their heads at the first rays of the sun In a conversation of about an hour with Fleur de Marie I have discovered treasures of goodness worth prudence yes prudence old Murphy A smile came to my lips and a tear in my eye when in her gentle and sensible prattle she urged on me the necessity of saving forty sous a day that I might be beyond want or evil temptations Poor little creature she said all this with so serious and persuasive a tone She seemed so delighted to give me good advice and experienced so extreme a pleasure in hearing me promise to follow it I was moved even to tears and you it affects you my old friend It does my lord the idea of making you lay by forty sous a day thinking you a workman instead of urging you to spend money on her that does touch me Hush here are Madame Georges and Marie Get all ready for our departure we must be in Paris in good time Thanks to the care of Madame Georges Fleur de Marie was no longer like her former self A pretty peasant s cap and two thick braids of light brown hair encircled her charming face A large handkerchief of white muslin crossed her bosom and disappeared under the high fold of a small shot taffetas apron whose blue and red shades appeared to advantage over a dark nun s dress which seemed expressly made for her The young girl s countenance was calm and composed Certain feelings of delight produce in the mind an unspeakable sadness a holy melancholy Rodolph was not surprised at the gravity of Fleur de Marie he had expected it Had she been merry and talkative she would not have retained so high a place in his good opinion In the serious and resigned countenance of Madame Georges might easily be traced the indelible marks of long suffering but she looked at Fleur de Marie with a tenderness and compassion quite maternal so much gentleness and sweetness did this poor girl evince Here is my child who has come to thank you for your goodness M Rodolph said Madame Georges presenting Goualeuse to Rodolph At the words my child Goualeuse turned her large eyes slowly towards her protectress and contemplated her for some moments with a look of unutterable gratitude Thanks for Marie my dear Madame Georges she deserves this kind interest and always will deserve it M Rodolph said Goualeuse with a trembling voice you understand I know I feel that you do that I cannot find anything to say to you Your emotion tells me all my child Oh she feels deeply the good fortune that has come to her so providentially said Madame Georges deeply affected her first impulse on entering my room was to prostrate herself before my crucifix Because now thanks to you M Rodolph I dare to pray said Goualeuse Murphy turned away hastily his pretensions to firmness would not allow of any one seeing to what extent the simple words of Goualeuse had touched him Rodolph said to her My child I wish to have some conversation with Madame Georges My friend Murphy will lead you over the farm and introduce you to your future proteges We will join you presently Well Murphy Murphy don t you hear me The worthy gentleman turned his back and pretended to blow his nose with a very loud noise then put his handkerchief in his pocket pulled his hat over his eyes and turning half around offered his arm to Marie managing so skilfully that neither Rodolph nor Madame Georges could see his face Taking the arm of Marie he walked away with her towards the farm buildings and so quickly that to keep up with him Goualeuse was obliged to run as in her infant days she ran beside the Chouette Well Madame Georges what do you think of Marie inquired Rodolph M Rodolph I have told you she had scarcely entered my room when seeing the crucifix she fell on her knees before it It is impossible for me to tell you to describe the spontaneous and naturally religious feeling that evidently dictated this I saw in an instant that hers was no degraded soul And then M Rodolph the expression of her gratitude to you had nothing exaggerated in it but it is not the less sincere And I have another proof of how natural and potent is this religious instinct in her I said to her You must have been much astonished and very happy when M Rodolph told you that you were to remain here for the future What an effect it must have had on you Yes oh yes was her reply when M Rodolph told me so I cannot describe what passed within me but I felt that kind of holy happiness which I experience in going into a church When I could go there she added for you know madame I know my child for I shall always call you my child I could not let her go on when I saw her cover her face for shame I know that you have suffered deeply but God blesses those who love and fear him those who have been unhappy and those who repent Then my good Madame Georges I am doubly happy at what I have done This poor girl will greatly interest you her disposition is so excellent her instincts so right What has besides affected me M Rodolph is that she has not allowed one single question to escape her about you although her curiosity must be so much excited Struck with a reserve so full of delicacy I wished to know what she felt I said to her You must be very curious to know who your mysterious benefactor is Know him she replied with delightful simplicity he is my benefactor Then you will love her Excellent woman she will find some interest in your heart Yes I shall occupy my heart with her as I should with him said Madame Georges in a broken voice Rodolph took her hand Do not be discouraged come come if our search has been unsuccessful so far yet one day perhaps Madame Georges shook her head sorrowfully and said in bitter accents My poor son would be now twenty years old Say he is that age God hear you and grant it M Rodolph He will hear I fully believe Yesterday I went but in vain to find a certain fellow called Bras Rouge who might perhaps have given me some information about your son Coming away from this Bras Rouge s abode after a struggle in which I was engaged I met with this unfortunate girl Alas but your kind endeavour in my behalf has thrown in your way another unfortunate being M Rodolph You have no intelligence from Rochefort None said Madame Georges shuddering and in a low voice So much the better We can no longer doubt but that the monster met his death in the attempt to escape from the Rodolph hesitated to pronounce the horrible word From the Bagne Oh say it the Bagne exclaimed the wretched woman with horror and almost frantic as she spoke The father of my child Ah if the unhappy boy still lives if like me he has not changed his name oh shame shame And yet it may be nothing his father has perhaps carried out his horrid threat What has he done with my boy Why did he tear him from me That mystery I cannot fathom said Rodolph with a pensive air What could induce the wretch to carry off your son fifteen years ago and when he was trying to escape into a foreign land A child of that age could only embarrass his flight Alas M Rodolph when my husband the poor woman shuddered as she pronounced the word was arrested on the frontier and thrown into prison where I was allowed to visit him he said to me these horrible words I took away the brat because you were fond of him and it will be a means of compelling you to send me money which may or may not be of service to him that s my affair Whether he lives or dies it is no matter to you but if he lives he will be in good hands you shall drink as deep of the shame of the son as you have of the disgrace of the father Alas a month afterwards my husband was condemned to the galleys for life and since then all my entreaties my prayers and letters have been in vain I have never been able to learn the fate of my boy Ah M Rodolph where is my child at this moment These frightful words are always ringing in my ears You shall drink as deep of the shame of the son as you have of the disgrace of the father This atrocity is most inexplicable why should he demoralise the unhappy child Why carry him off I have told you M Rodolph to compel me to send him money although he had nearly ruined me yet I had still some small resources but they at length were exhausted also In spite of his wickedness I could not believe but that he would employ at least a portion of this money in the bringing up of this unhappy child And your son had no sign no mark by which he could be recognised No other than that of which I have spoken to you M Rodolph a small Saint Esprit sculptured in lapis lazuli tied round his neck by a chain of silver a sacred relic blessed by the holy father Courage courage God is all powerful Providence placed me in your path M Rodolph Too late Madame Georges too late I might have saved you many years of sorrow Ah M Rodolph how kind you have been to me In what way I bought this farm in time of your prosperity you were not idle and now you have become my manager here where thanks to your excellent superintendence intelligence and activity this establishment produces me Produces you my lord said Madame Georges interrupting Rodolph why all the returns are employed not only in ameliorating the condition of the labourers who consider the occupation on this model farm as a great favour but moreover to succour all the needy in the district through the mediation of our good Abbe Laporte Ah the dear abbe said Rodolph desirous of escaping the praise of Madame Georges have you had the kindness to inform him of my arrival I wish to recommend my protegee to him He has had my letter mister Murphy gave it to him when he came this morning In that letter I told our good cure in a few words the history of this poor girl I was not sure that I should be able to come to day myself and if not then Murphy would have conducted Marie A labourer of the farm interrupted this conversation which had been carried on in the garden Madame M le Cure is waiting for you Are the post horses arrived my lad inquired Rodolph Yes M Rodolph and they are putting to And the man left the garden Madame Georges the cure and the inhabitants of the farm only knew Fleur de Marie s protector as M Rodolph Murphy s discretion was faultless and although when in private he was very precise in my lording Rodolph yet before strangers he was very careful not to address him otherwise than as M Rodolph I forgot to mention my dear Madame Georges said Rodolph when he returned to the house that Marie has I fear very weak lungs privations and misery have tried her health This morning early I was struck with the pallor of her countenance although her cheeks were of a deep rose colour her eyes too seem to me to have a brilliancy which betokens a feverish system Great care must be taken of her Rely on me M Rodolph but thank God there is nothing serious to apprehend At her age in the country with pure air rest and quiet she will soon be quite restored I hope so but I will not trust to your country doctors I will desire Murphy to bring here my medical man a negro a very skilful person who will tell you the best regimen to pursue You must send me news of Marie very often Some time hence when she shall be better and more at ease we will talk about her future life perhaps it would be best that she always remained with you if you were pleased with her I should like it greatly M Rodolph she would supply the place of the child I have lost and must for ever bewail Let us still hope for you and for her At the moment when Rodolph and Madame Georges approached the farm Murphy and Marie also entered The worthy gentleman let go the arm of Goualeuse and said to Rodolph in a low voice and with an air of some confusion This girl has bewitched me I really do not know which interests me most she or Madame Georges I was a brute a beast I knew old Murphy that you would do justice to my protegee said Rodolph smiling and shaking hands with the squire Madame Georges leaning on Marie s arm entered with her into a small room on the ground floor where the Abbe Laporte was waiting Murphy went away to see all ready for their departure Madame Georges Marie Rodolph and the cure remained together Plain but very comfortable this small apartment was fitted up with green hangings like the rest of the house as had been exactly described to Goualeuse by Rodolph A thick carpet covered the floor a good fire burnt in the grate and two large nosegays of daisies of all colours placed in two crystal vases shed their agreeable odour throughout the room Through the windows with their green blinds which were half opened was to be seen the meadow the little stream and beyond it the bank planted with chestnut trees The Abbe Laporte who was seated near the fireplace was upwards of eighty years of age and had ever since the last days of the Revolution done duty in this small parish Nothing can be imagined more venerable than his aged withered and somewhat melancholy countenance shaded by long white locks which fell on the collar of his black cassock which was pieced in more places than one the abbe liked better as they said to clothe one or two poor children in good warm broadcloth than faire le muguet that is to wear his cassocks less than two or three years The good abbe was so old so very old that his hands trembled continually and when he occasionally lifted them up when speaking it might have been supposed that he was giving a benediction M l Abbe said Rodolph respectfully Madame Georges has undertaken the guardianship of this young girl for whom I also beg your kindness She is entitled to it sir like all who come to us The mercy of God is inexhaustible my dear child and he has evinced it in not abandoning you in most severe trials I know all And he took the hand of Marie in his own withered and trembling palms The generous man who has saved you has realised the words of Holy Writ The Lord is near to all those who call upon him he will fulfil the desire of those who fear him he will hear their cries and he will save them Now deserve his bounty by your conduct and you will always find one ready to encourage and sustain you in the good path on which you have entered You will have in Madame Georges a constant example in me a careful adviser The Lord will finish his work And I will pray to him for those who have had compassion on me and have led me to him father said La Goualeuse throwing herself on her knees before the priest Her emotion overcame her her sobs almost choked her Madame Georges Rodolph and the abbe were all deeply affected Rise my dear child said the cure you will soon deserve absolution from those serious faults of which you have rather been the victim than the criminal for in the words of the prophet The Lord raises up all those who are ready to fall and elevates those who are oppressed Murphy at this moment opened the door M Rodolph he said the horses are ready Adieu father adieu Madame Georges I commend your child to your care our child I should say Farewell Marie I will soon come and see you again The venerable pastor leaning on the arms of Madame Georges and La Goualeuse who supported his tottering steps left the room to see Rodolph depart The last rays of the sun shed their light on this interesting yet sad group An old priest the symbol of charity pardon and everlasting hope a female overwhelmed by every grief that can distress a wife and mother a young girl hardly out of her infancy and but recently thrown into an abyss of vice through misery and the close contact with crime Rodolph got into the carriage Murphy took his place by his side and the horses set off at speed CHAPTER XII THE RENDEZVOUS The day after he had confided the Goualeuse to the care of Madame Georges Rodolph still dressed as a mechanic was at noon precisely at the door of a cabaret with the sign of the Panier Fleuri not far from the barrier of Bercy The evening before at ten o clock the Chourineur was punctual to the appointment which Rodolph had fixed with him The result of this narrative will inform our readers of the particulars of the meeting It was twelve o clock and the rain fell in torrents the Seine swollen by perpetual falls of rain had risen very high and overflowed a part of the quay Rodolph looked from time to time with a gesture of impatience towards the barrier and at last observed a man and woman who were coming towards him under the shelter of an umbrella and whom he recognised as the Chouette and the Schoolmaster These two individuals were completely metamorphosed The ruffian had laid aside his ragged garments and his air of brutal ferocity He wore a long frock coat of green cloth and a round hat whilst his shirt and cravat were remarkable for their whiteness But for the hideousness of his features and the fierce glance of his eyes always restless and suspicious this fellow might have been taken by his quiet and steady step for an honest citizen The Chouette was also in her Sunday costume wearing a large shawl of fine wool with a large pattern and held in her hand a capacious basket The rain having ceased for the moment Rodolph overcoming a sensation of disgust went to meet the frightful pair For the slang of the tapis franc the Schoolmaster now substituted a style almost polished and which betokened a cultivated mind in strange contrast with his real character and crimes When Rodolph approached the brigand made him a polite bow and the Chouette curtseyed respectfully Sir your humble servant said the Schoolmaster I am delighted to pay my respects to you delighted or rather to renew our acquaintance for the night before last you paid me two blows of the fist which were enough to have felled a rhinoceros But not a word of that now it was a joke on your part I am sure merely done in jest Let us not say another word about it for serious business brings us now together I saw the Chourineur yesterday about eleven o clock at the tapis franc and appointed to meet him here to day in case he chose to join us to be our fellow labourer but it seems that he most decidedly refuses You then accept the proposal Your name sir if you be so good Rodolph M Rodolph we will go into the Panier Fleuri neither myself nor madame has breakfasted and we will talk over our little matters whilst we are taking a crust Most willingly We can talk as we go on You and the Chourineur certainly do owe some satisfaction to my wife and myself you have caused us to lose more than two thousand francs Chouette had a meeting near saint Ouen with the tall gentleman in mourning who came to ask for you at the tapis franc He offered us two thousand francs to do something to you The Chourineur has told me all about this But Finette said the fellow go and select a room at the Panier Fleuri and order breakfast some cutlets a piece of veal a salad and a couple of bottles of vin de beaune the best quality and we will join you there The Chouette who had not taken her eye off Rodolph for a moment went off after exchanging looks with the Schoolmaster who then said I say M Rodolph that the Chourineur has edified me on the subject of the two thousand francs What do you mean by edified you You are right the language is a little too refined for you I would say that the Chourineur nearly told me all that the tall gentleman in mourning with his two thousand francs required Good Not so good young man for the Chourineur having yesterday morning met the Chouette near saint Ouen did not leave her for one moment when the tall gentleman in mourning came up so that he could not approach and converse with her You then ought to put us in the way of regaining our two thousand francs Nothing easier but let us hark back I had proposed a glorious job to the Chourineur which he at first accepted but afterwards refused to go on with He always had very peculiar ideas But whilst he refused he observed to me He made you observe Oh diable You are very grand with your grammar It is my profession as a schoolmaster He made me then observe that if he would not go on this lay he did not desire to discourage any other person and that you would willingly lend a hand in the affair May I without impertinence ask why you appointed a meeting with the Chourineur at saint Ouen yesterday which gave him the advantage of meeting the Chouette He was too much puzzled at my question to give me a clear answer Rodolph bit his lips imperceptibly and replied shrugging his shoulders Very likely for I only told him half my plan you must know not knowing if he had made up his mind That was very proper The more so as I had two strings to my bow You are a careful man You met the Chourineur then at saint Ouen for Rodolph after a moment s hesitation had the good luck to think of a story which would account for the want of address which the Chourineur had displayed and said Why this it is The attempt I propose is a famous one because the person in question is in the country all my fear was that he should return to Paris To make sure I went to Pierrefitte where his country house is situated and there I learned that he would not be back again until the day after to morrow Well but to return to my question why did you appoint to meet the Chourineur at saint Ouen Why you are not so bright as I took you for How far is it from Pierrefitte to saint Ouen About a league And from saint Ouen to Paris As much Well if I had not found any one at Pierrefitte that is if there had been an empty house there why there also would have been a good job not so good as in Paris but still well worth having I went back to the Chourineur who was waiting for me at saint Ouen We should have returned then to Pierrefitte by a cross path which I know and I understand If on the contrary the job was to be done in Paris We should have gained the Barrier de l Etoile by the road of the Rivolte and thence to the Allee des Veuves Is but a step that is plain enough At saint Ouen you were well placed for either operation that was clear and now I can understand why the Chourineur was at saint Ouen So the house in the Allee des Veuves will be uninhabited until the day after to morrow Uninhabited except the porter I see And is it a profitable job Sixty thousand francs in gold in the proprietor s cabinet And you know all the ways Perfectly Silence here we are not a word before the vulgar I do not know if you feel as I do but the morning air has given me an appetite The Chouette was awaiting them at the door This way this way she said I have ordered our breakfast Rodolph wished the brigand to pass in first for certain reasons but the Schoolmaster insisted on showing so much politeness that Rodolph entered before him Before he sat down the Schoolmaster tapped lightly against each of the divisions of the wainscot that he might ascertain their thickness and power of transmitting sounds We need not be afraid to speak out said he the division is not thin We shall have our breakfast soon and shall not be disturbed in our conversation A waiter brought in the breakfast and before he shut the door Rodolph saw the charcoal man Murphy seated with great composure at a table in a room close at hand The room in which the scene took place that we are describing was long and narrow lighted by one window which looked into the street and was opposite to the door The Chouette turned her back to this window whilst the Schoolmaster was at one side of the table and Rodolph on the other When the servant left the room the brigand got up took his plate and seated himself beside Rodolph and between him and the door We can talk better he said and need not talk so loud And then you can prevent me from going out replied Rodolph calmly The Schoolmaster gave a nod in the affirmative and then half drawing out of the pocket of his frock coat a stiletto round and as thick as a goose s quill with a handle of wood which disappeared in the grasp of his hairy fingers said You see that I do Advice to amateurs And bringing his shaggy brows together by a frown which made his wide and flat forehead closely resemble a tiger s he made a significant gesture And you may believe me added the Chouette I have made the tool sharp Rodolph with perfect coolness put his hand under his blouse and took out a double barrelled pistol which he showed to the Schoolmaster and then put into his pocket All right and now we understand each other but do not misunderstand me I am only alluding to an impossibility If they try to arrest me and you have laid any trap for me I will make cold meat of you And he gave a fierce look at Rodolph And I will spring upon him and help you fourline cried the Chouette Rodolph made no reply but shrugged his shoulders and pouring out a glass of wine tossed it off His coolness deceived the Schoolmaster I only put you on your guard Well then put up your larding pin into your pocket you have no chicken to lard now I am an old cock and know my game as well as most said Rodolph But to our business Yes let us talk of business but do not speak against my larding pin it makes no noise and does not disturb anybody And does its work as should be doesn t it fourline added the old beldam By the way said Rodolph to the Chouette do you really know the Goualeuse s parents My man has in his pocket two letters about it but she shall never see them the little slut I would rather tear her eyes out with my own hands Oh when I meet her again at the tapis franc won t I pay her off There that ll do Finette we have other things to talk of and so leave off your gossip May we patter before the mot asked Rodolph Most decidedly She s true as steel and is worth her weight in gold to watch for us to get information or impressions of keys to conceal stolen goods or sell them nothing comes amiss to her She is a first rate manager Good Finette added the robber extending his hand to the horrid hag You can have no idea of the services she has done me Take off your shawl Finette or you ll be cold when you go out put it on the chair with your basket The Chouette took off her shawl In spite of his presence of mind and the command which he had over himself Rodolph could not quite conceal his surprise when he saw suspended by a ring of silver from a thick chain of metal which hung round the old creature s neck a small Saint Esprit in lapis lazuli precisely resembling that which the son of Madame Georges had round his neck when he was carried off At this discovery a sudden idea flashed across the mind of Rodolph According to the Chourineur s statement the Schoolmaster had escaped from the Bagne six months ago and had since defied all search after him by disfiguring himself as he had now and six months ago the husband of Madame Georges had disappeared from the Bagne Rodolph surmised that very possibly the Schoolmaster was the husband of that unhappy lady If this were so he knew the fate of the son she lamented he possessed too some papers relative to the birth of the Goualeuse Rodolph had then fresh motives for persevering in his projects and fortunately his absence of mind was not observed by the Schoolmaster who was busy helping the Chouette Morbleu What a pretty chain you have said Rodolph to the one eyed woman Pretty and not dear answered the old creature laughing It is only a sham till my man can afford to give me a real one That will depend on this gentleman Finette If our job comes off well why then It is astonishing how well it is imitated continued Rodolph And what is that little blue thing at the end It is a present from my man which I shall wear until he gives me a ticker Isn t it fourline Rodolph s suspicions were thus half confirmed and he waited with anxiety for the reply of the Schoolmaster who said You must take care of that notwithstanding the ticker Finette it is a talisman and brings good luck A talisman said Rodolph in a careless tone do you believe in talismans And where the devil did you pick it up Give me the address of the shop They do not make them now the shop is shut up As you see it that bit of jewelry has a very great antiquity three generations I value it highly for it is a family loom added he with a hideous grin and that s why I gave it to Finette that she might have good fortune in the enterprises in which she so skilfully seconds me Only see her at work only see her If we go into business together why But let us now to our affair in hand You say that in the Allee des Veuves At No seventeen there is a house inhabited by a rich man whose name is I will not be guilty of the indiscretion of asking his name You say there are sixty thousand francs in gold in a cabinet Sixty thousand francs in gold exclaimed the Chouette Rodolph nodded his head in the affirmative And you know this house and the people in it said the Schoolmaster Quite well Is the entry difficult A wall seven feet high on the side of the Allee des Veuves a garden windows down to the ground and the house has only the ground floor throughout And there is only the porter to guard this treasure Yes And what young man is your proposed plan of proceeding Simple enough to climb over the wall pick the lock of the door or force open a shutter or lock What do you think of it I cannot answer you before I have examined it all myself that is by the aid of my wife but if all you tell me is as you say I think it would be the thing to do it at once this evening And the ruffian looked earnestly at Rodolph This evening impossible replied he Why since the occupier does not return until the day after to morrow Yes but I I cannot this evening Really Well and I I cannot to morrow Why not For the reason that prevents you this evening said the robber in a tone of mockery After a moment s reflection Rodolph replied Well then this evening be it Where shall we meet We will not separate said the Schoolmaster Why not Why should we What is the use of separating The weather has cleared up and we will go and walk about and give a look at the Allee des Veuves you will see how my woman will work When that is done we will return and play a hand at piquet and have a bit of something in a place in the Champs Elysees that I know near the river and as the Allee des Veuves is deserted at an early hour we will walk that way about ten o clock I will join you at nine o clock Do you or do you not wish that we should do this job together I do wish it Well then we do not separate before evening or else Or else I shall think that you are making a plant for me and that s the reason you wish to part company now If I wished to set the traps after you what is to prevent my doing so this evening Why everything You did not expect that I should propose the affair to you so soon and if you do not leave us you cannot put anybody up to it You mistrust me then Most extremely But as what you propose may be quite true and honest and the half of sixty thousand francs is worth a risk I am willing to try for it but this evening or never if never I shall have my suspicions of you confirmed and one day or other I will take care and let you dine off a dish of my cooking And I will return your compliment rely on it Oh this is all stuff and nonsense said the Chouette I think with fourline to night or never Rodolph was in a state of extreme anxiety if he allowed this opportunity to escape of laying hands on the Schoolmaster he might never again light on him The ruffian would ever afterwards be on his guard or if recognised apprehended and taken back to the Bagne would carry with him that secret which Rodolph had so much interest in discovering Confiding in his address and courage and trusting to chance he said to the Schoolmaster Agreed then and we will not part company before evening Then I m your man It is now two o clock it is some distance from here to the Allee des Veuves it is raining again in torrents let us pay the reckoning and take a coach If we have a coach I should like first to smoke a cigar Why not said the Schoolmaster Finette does not mind the smell of tobacco Well then I ll go and fetch some cigars said Rodolph rising Pray don t give yourself that trouble said the Schoolmaster stopping him Finette will go Rodolph resumed his seat The Schoolmaster had penetrated his design The Chouette went out What a clever manager I have haven t I said the ruffian and so tractable she would throw herself into the fire for me Apropos of fire it is not overwarm here replied Rodolph placing both his hands under his blouse and then continuing his conversation with the Schoolmaster he took out a lead pencil and a morsel of paper which he had in his waistcoat pocket without being detected and wrote some words hastily taking care to make his letters wide apart so that they might be more legible for he wrote under his blouse and without seeing what he wrote This note escaped the penetration of the Schoolmaster the next thing was to enable it to reach its address Rodolph rose and went listlessly towards the window and began to hum a tune between his teeth accompanying himself on the window glasses The Schoolmaster came up to the window and said to Rodolph What tune are you playing I am playing Tu n auras pas ma rose And a very pretty tune it is I should like to know if it would have the effect of making any of the passers by turn round I had no such intention You are wrong young man for you are playing the tambourine on that pane of glass with all your might But I was thinking the porter of this house in the Allee des Veuves is perhaps a stout fellow if he resists you have only your pistol which is a noisy weapon whilst a tool like this and he showed Rodolph the handle of his poniard makes no noise and does not disturb anybody Do you mean then to assassinate him exclaimed Rodolph If you have any such intention let us give up the job altogether I will have no hand in it so don t rely on me But if he wakes We will take to our heels Well just as you like only it is better to come to a clear understanding beforehand So then ours is simply a mere robbery with forcible entry Nothing more That s very silly and contemptible but so be it And as I will not leave you for a second thought Rodolph I will prevent you from shedding blood CHAPTER XIII PREPARATIONS The Chouette returned to the room bringing the cigars with her I don t think it rains now said Rodolph lighting his cigar Suppose we go and fetch the coach ourselves it will stretch our legs What not rain replied the Schoolmaster are you blind Do you think I will expose Finette to the chance of catching cold and exposing her precious life and spoiling her new shawl You are right old fellow it rains cats and dogs Let the servant come and we can pay him and desire him to fetch us a coach replied Rodolph That s the most sensible thing you have said yet young fellow we may go and look about as we seek the Allee des Veuves The servant entered and Rodolph gave her five francs Ah sir it is really an imposition I cannot allow it exclaimed the Schoolmaster Oh all right your turn next time Be it so but on condition that I shall offer you something by and by in a little cabaret in the Champs Elysees a capital little snuggery that I know of Just as you like The servant paid and they left the room Rodolph wished to go last out of politeness to the Chouette but the Schoolmaster would not allow it and followed close on his heels watching his every movement The master of the house kept a wine shop also and amongst other drinkers a charcoal man with his face blackened and his large hat flapping over his eyes was paying his shot at the bar when these three personages appeared In spite of the close lookout of the Schoolmaster and the one eyed hag Rodolph who walked before the hideous pair exchanged a rapid and unperceived glance with Murphy as he got into the hackney coach Which way am I to go master asked the driver Rodolph replied in a loud voice Allee des Des Acacias in the Bois de Boulogne cried the Schoolmaster interrupting him Then he added And we will pay you well coachman The door was shut What the devil made you bawl out which way we were going before these people said the Schoolmaster If the thing were found out to morrow we might be traced and discovered Young man young man you are very imprudent The coach was already in motion Rodolph answered True I did not think of that But with my cigar I shall smoke you like herrings let us have a window open And joining the action to the words Rodolph with much dexterity let fall outside the window the morsel of paper folded very small on which he had hastily written a few words in pencil under his blouse The Schoolmaster s glance was so quick that in spite of the calmness of Rodolph s features the ruffian detected some expression of triumph for putting his head out of the window he called out to the driver Whip behind whip behind there is some one getting up at the back of the coach The coach stopped and the driver standing on his seat looked back and said No master there is no one there Parbleu I will look myself replied the Schoolmaster jumping out into the street Not seeing any person or anything for since Rodolph had dropped the paper the coach had gone on several yards the Schoolmaster thought he was mistaken You will laugh at me he said as he resumed his seat but I don t know why I thought some one was following us The coach at this moment turned round a corner and Murphy who had not lost sight of it with his eyes and had seen Rodolph s manoeuvre ran and picked up the little note which had fallen into a crevice between two of the paving stones At the end of a quarter of an hour the Schoolmaster said to the driver of the hackney coach My man we have changed our minds drive to the Place de la Madelaine Rodolph looked at him with astonishment All right young man from hence we may go to a thousand different places If they seek to track us hereafter the deposition of the coachman will not be of the slightest service to them At the moment when the coach was approaching the barrier a tall man clothed in a long white riding coat with his hat drawn over his eyes and whose complexion appeared of a deep brown passed rapidly along the road stooping over the neck of a high splendid hunter which trotted with extraordinary speed A good horse and a good rider said Rodolph leaning forward to the door of the coach and following Murphy for it was he with his eyes What a pace that stout man goes Did you see him Ma foi he passed so very quickly said the Schoolmaster that I did not remark him Rodolph calmly concealed his satisfaction Murphy had doubtless deciphered the almost hieroglyphic characters of the note which he had dropped and which had escaped the vigilance of the Schoolmaster Certain that the coach was not followed he had become more assured and desirous of imitating the Chouette who slept or rather pretended to sleep he said to Rodolph Excuse me young man but the motion of the coach always produces a singular effect on me it sends me off to sleep like a child The ruffian under the guise of assumed sleep thought to examine whether the physiognomy of his companion betrayed any emotion but Rodolph was on his guard and replied I rose so early that I feel sleepy and will have a nap too He shut his eyes and very soon the hard breathing of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette who snored in chorus so completely deceived Rodolph that thinking his companions sound asleep he half opened his eyes The Schoolmaster and the Chouette in spite of their loud snoring had their eyes open and were exchanging some mysterious signs by means of their fingers curiously placed or bent in the palms of their hands In an instant this mute language ceased The brigand no doubt perceived by some almost imperceptible sign that Rodolph was not asleep and said in a laughing tone Ah ah comrade what you were trying your friends were you That can t astonish you who sleep with your eyes open I who That s different young man I am a somnambulist The hackney coach stopped in the Place de la Madelaine The rain had ceased for a moment but the clouds driven by the violence of the wind were so dark and so low that it was almost night in appearance Rodolph the Chouette and the Schoolmaster went towards the Cours la Reine Young man I have an idea which is not a bad one said the robber What is it To ascertain if all that you have told us respecting the interior of the house in the Allee des Veuves is true You surely will not go there now under any circumstances It would awaken suspicion I am not such a flat as that young fellow but why have I a wife whose name is Finette The Chouette drew up her head Do you see her young man Why she looks like a war horse when he hears the blast of the trumpet You mean to send her as a lookout Precisely so No seventeen Allee des Veuves isn t it my man cried the Chouette impatiently Make yourself easy I have but one eye but that is a good one Do you see young man do you see she is all impatience to be at work If she manages cleverly to get into the house I do not think your idea a bad one Take the umbrella fourline in half an hour I will be here again and you shall see what I will do said the Chouette One moment Finette we are going down to the Bleeding Heart only two steps from here If the little Tortillard cripple is there you had better take him with you he will remain outside on the watch whilst you go inside the house You are right little Tortillard is as cunning as a fox he is not ten years of age and yet it was he who the other day A signal from the Schoolmaster interrupted the Chouette What does the Bleeding Heart mean It is an odd sign for a cabaret asked Rodolph You must complain to the landlord What is his name The landlord of the Bleeding Heart Yes What is that to you He never asks the names of his customers But still Call him what you like Peter Thomas Christopher or Barnabas he will answer to any and all But here we are and it s time we were for the rain is coming down again in floods and how the river roars It has almost become a torrent Why look at it Two more days of such rain and the water will overflow the arches of the bridge You say that we are there but where the devil is the cabaret I do not see any house here Certainly not if you look round about you Where should I look then At your feet At my feet Yes And whereabouts Here look do you see the roof Mind and don t step upon it Rodolph had not remarked one of those subterraneans which used to be seen some years since in certain spots in the Champs Elysees and particularly near the Cours la Reine A flight of steps cut out of the damp and greasy ground led to the bottom of this sort of deep ditch against one end of which cut perpendicularly leaned a low mean dilapidated hovel its roof covered with moss covered tiles was scarcely so high as the ground on which Rodolph was standing two or three out buildings constructed of worm eaten planks serving as cellar wood house and rabbit hutches surrounded this wretched den A narrow path which extended along this ditch led from the stairs to the door of the hut the rest of the ground was concealed under a mass of trellis work which sheltered two rows of clumsy tables fastened to the ground A worn out iron sign swung heavily backwards and forwards on its creaking hinges and through the rust that covered it might still be seen a red heart pierced with an arrow The sign was supported by a post erected above this cave this real human burrow A thick and moist fog was added to the rain as night approached What think you of this hotel young fellow inquired the Schoolmaster Why thanks to the torrents that have fallen for the last fortnight it must be deliciously fresh But come on One moment I wish to know if the landlord is in Hark The ruffian then thrusting his tongue forcibly against his palate produced a singular noise a sort of guttural sound loud and lengthened something like P r r r r r r r A similar note came from the depths of the hovel He s there said the Schoolmaster Pardon me young man respect to the ladies allow the Chouette to pass first I follow you Mind how you come it s slippery CHAPTER XIV THE BLEEDING HEART The landlord of the Bleeding Heart after having responded to the signal of the Schoolmaster advanced politely to the threshold of his door This personage whom Rodolph had been to see in the Cite and whom he did not yet know under his true name or rather his habitual surname was Bras Rouge Lank mean looking and feeble this man might be fifty years of age His countenance resembled both the weasel and the rat his peaked nose his receding chin his high cheek bones his small eyes black restless and keen gave his features an indescribable expression of malice cunning and sagacity An old brown wig or rather as yellow as his bilious complexion perched on the top of his head showed the nape of the old fellow s withered neck He had on a round jacket and one of those long black aprons worn by the waiters at the wine shops Our three acquaintances had hardly descended the last step of the staircase when a child of about ten years of age rickety lame and somewhat misshapen came to rejoin Bras Rouge whom he resembled in so striking a manner that there was no mistaking them for father and son There was the same quick and cunning look joined to that impudent hardened and knavish air which is peculiar to the scamp voyou of Paris that fearful type of precocious depravity that real hemp seed graine de bagne as they style it in the horrible slang of the gaol The forehead of the brat was half lost beneath a thatch of yellowish locks as harsh and stiff as horse hair Reddish coloured trousers and a gray blouse confined by a leather girdle completed Tortillard s costume whose nickname was derived from his infirmity He stood close to his father standing on his sound leg like a heron by the side of a marsh Ah here is the darling one mome said the Schoolmaster Finette night is coming on and time is pressing we must profit by the daylight which is left to us You are right my man I will ask the father to spare his darling Good day old friend said Bras Rouge addressing the Schoolmaster in a voice which was cracked sharp and shrill What can I do for you Why if you could spare your small boy to my mistress for a quarter of an hour she has lost something which he could help her to look for Bras Rouge winked his eye and made a sign to the Schoolmaster and then said to the child Tortillard go with madame The hideous brat hopped forward and took hold of the one eyed s hand Love of a bright boy come along There is a child said Finette And how like his father He is not like Pegriotte who always pretended to have a pain in her side when she came near me a little baggage Come come away be off Finette Keep your weather eye open and bright lookout I await you here I won t be long Go first Tortillard The one eyed hag and the little cripple went up the slippery steps Finette take the umbrella the brigand called out Illustration Ah Here is the Darling One Original Etching by Adrian Marcel It would be in the way my man said the old woman who quickly disappeared with Tortillard in the midst of the fog which thickened with the twilight and the hollow murmur of the wind as it moaned through the thick and leafless branches of the tall elms in the Champs Elysees Let us go in said Rodolph It was requisite to stoop in passing in at the door of the cabaret which was divided into two apartments In one was a bar and a broken down billiard table in the other tables and garden chairs which had once been painted green Two narrow windows with their cracked panes festooned with spiders webs cast a dim but not religious light on the damp walls Rodolph was alone for one moment only during which Bras Rouge and the Schoolmaster had time to exchange some words rapidly uttered and some mysterious signs You ll take a glass of beer or brandy perhaps whilst we wait for Finette said the Schoolmaster No I am not thirsty Do as you like I am for a drain of brandy said the ruffian and he seated himself on one of the little green tables in the second apartment Darkness came on to this den so completely that it was impossible to see in one of the angles of this inner apartment the open mouth of one of those cellars which are entered by a door in two divisions one of which was constantly kept open for the convenience of access The table at which the Schoolmaster sat was close upon this dark and deep hole and he turned his back upon it so that it was entirely concealed from Rodolph s view He was looking through the window in order to command his countenance and conceal the workings of his thoughts The sight of Murphy speeding through the Allee des Veuves did not quite assure him he was afraid that the worthy squire had not quite understood the full meaning of his note necessarily so laconic and containing only these words This evening ten o clock Be on your guard Resolved not to go to the Allee des Veuves before that moment nor to lose sight of the Schoolmaster for an instant he yet trembled at the idea of losing the only opportunity that might ever be afforded him of obtaining that secret which he was so excessively anxious to possess Although he was powerful and well armed yet he had to deal with an unscrupulous assassin capable of any and every thing Not desiring however that his thoughts should be detected he seated himself at the table with the Schoolmaster and by way of seeming at his ease called for a glass of something Bras Rouge having exchanged a few words in a low tone with the brigand looked at Rodolph with an air in which curiosity distrust and contempt were mingled It is my advice young man said the Schoolmaster that if my wife informs us that the persons we wish to see are within we had better make our call about eight o clock That will be two hours too soon said Rodolph and that will spoil all Do you think so I am sure of it Bah amongst friends there should be no ceremony I know them well and I tell you that we must not think of going before ten o clock Are you out of your senses young man I give you my opinion and devil fetch me if I stir from here before ten o clock Don t disturb yourself I never close my establishment before midnight said Bras Rouge in his falsetto voice it is the time when my best customers drop in and my neighbours never complain of the noise which is made in my house I must agree to all you wish young man continued the Schoolmaster Be it so then we will not set out on our visit until ten o clock Here is the Chouette said Bras Rouge hearing and replying to a warning cry similar to that which the Schoolmaster had uttered before he descended to the subterraneous abode A minute afterwards the Chouette entered the billiard room alone It is all right my man I ve done the trick cried the one eyed hag as she entered Bras Rouge discreetly withdrew without asking a word about Tortillard whom perhaps he did not expect to see return The beldam sat with her face towards Rodolph and the brigand Well said the Schoolmaster The young fellow has told us all true so far Ah you see I was right exclaimed Rodolph Let the Chouette tell her tale young man Come tell us all about it Finette I went straight to No seventeen leaving Tortillard on the lookout and concealed in a corner It was still daylight and I rung at a side door which opens outwards and here s about two inches of space between it and the sill nothing else to notice I rang the porter opened Before I pulled the bell I had put my bonnet in my pocket that I might look like a neighbour As soon as I saw the porter I pretended to cry violently saying that I had lost a pet parrot Cocotte a little darling that I adored I told him I lived in the Rue Marboeuf and that I had pursued Cocotte from garden to garden and entreated him to allow me to enter and try and find the bird Ah said the Schoolmaster with an air of proud satisfaction pointing to Finette what a woman Very clever said Rodolph And what then The porter allowed me to look for the creature and I went trotting all around the garden calling Cocotte Cocotte and looked about me in every direction to scrutinise every thing Inside the walls continued the horrid old hag going on with her description of the premises inside the walls trellis work all around a perfect staircase at the left hand corner of the wall a fir tree just like a ladder a lying in woman might descend by it The house has six windows on the ground floor and has no upper story six small windows without any fastening The windows of the ground floor close with shutters having hooks below and staples in the upper part press in the bottom use your steel file A push said the Schoolmaster and it is open The Chouette continued The entrance has a glass door two Venetian blinds outside Memorandum said the ruffian Quite correct it is as precise as if we saw it said Rodolph On the left resumed the Chouette near the courtyard is a well the rope may be useful for at that particular spot there is no trellis against the wall in case retreat should be cut off in the direction of the door On entering into the house You got inside the house then Young man she got inside the house said the Schoolmaster with pride To be sure I got in Not finding Cocotte I had made so much lamentation that I pretended I was quite out of breath I begged the porter to allow me to sit down on the step of the door and he very kindly asked me to step in offering me a glass of wine and water A glass of plain water I said plain water only my good sir Then he made me go into the antechamber carpeted all over good precaution footsteps or broken glass cannot be heard if we must mill the glaze break a pane of glass right and left doors with sliding bolts which open by a gentle push from the top At the bottom was a strong door locked it looked very like a money chest I had my wax in my basket She had her wax young man She never goes without her wax said the brigand The Chouette proceeded It was necessary to approach the door which smelled so strongly of the cash so I pretended that I was seized with a fit of coughing so violent that I was compelled to lean against the wall for support Hearing me cough the porter said I ll fetch you a morsel of sugar to put in your water He probably looked for a spoon for I heard plate chink plate in the room on the left hand don t forget that fourline Well coughing and wheezing I reached the door at the bottom I had my wax in the palm of my hand I leaned against the lock as though accidentally and here is the impression we may not want it to day but another time it may be useful And the Chouette gave the brigand a bit of yellow wax on which the print of the lock was perfectly impressed You can tell us whether this is the door of the money chest said the Chouette It is and there is the cash replied Rodolph and then said to himself Has Murphy then been the dupe of this cursed old hag Perhaps so and he only expects to be assailed at ten o clock by that time every precaution will have been taken But all the money is not there continued the Chouette and her one green eye sparkled As I approached the windows still searching for my darling Cocotte I saw in one of the chambers door on the left some bags of crown pieces in a bureau I saw them as plainly as I see you my man there were at least a dozen of them Where is Tortillard said the Schoolmaster In his hiding place not more than two paces from the garden He can see in the dark like a cat There is only that one entrance to No seventeen so when we go he will tell us if any one has come or not That s good The Schoolmaster had scarcely uttered these words than he made a sudden rush at Rodolph grappled him by the throat and flung him violently down the cellar which was yawning behind the table The attack was so rapid unexpected and powerful that Rodolph could neither foresee nor avoid it The Chouette alarmed uttered a piercing shriek for at the first moment she had not seen the result of the struggle When the noise of Rodolph s body rolling down the steps had ceased the Schoolmaster who knew all the ways and windings of the underground vaults in the place went down the stairs slowly listening as he went Fourline be on your guard cried the beldam leaning over the opening of the trap draw your pinking iron The brigand disappeared without any reply For a time nothing was heard but at the end of a few moments the distant noise of a door shutting which creaked on its rusty hinges sounded harshly in the depths of the cavern then all was again still as death The darkness was complete The Chouette fumbled in her basket and then producing a lucifer match lighted a wax taper whose feeble ray made visible the darkness of this dreary den At this moment the monster visage of the Schoolmaster appeared at the opening of the trap The Chouette could not repress an exclamation of horror at the sight of his ghastly seamed mutilated and fearful face with eyes that gleamed like phosphorus and seemed to glare on the ground even in the midst of the darkness which the lighted taper could not entirely dissipate Having subdued her feeling of fright the old hag exclaimed in a tone of horrible flattery You must be an awful man fourline for even I was frightened yes I Quick quick for the Allee des Veuves said the ruffian securely closing the double flap of the trap with a bar of iron In another hour perhaps it will be too late If it is a trap it is not yet baited if it is not why we can do the job alone CHAPTER XV THE VAULT Stunned by his horrible fall Rodolph lay senseless and motionless at the bottom of the stairs down which he had been hurled The Schoolmaster dragging him to the entrance of a second and still deeper cavern thrust him into its hideous recesses and closing and securely bolting a massy iron shod door returned to his worthy confederate the Chouette who was waiting to join him in the proposed robbery it might be murder in the Allee des Veuves About the end of an hour Rodolph began though slowly to resume his consciousness He found himself extended on the ground in the midst of thick darkness he extended his hand and touched the stone stairs descending to the vault a sensation of extreme cold about his feet induced him to endeavour by feeling the ground to ascertain the cause his fingers dabbled in a pool of water With a violent effort he contrived to seat himself on the lower step of the staircase the giddiness arising from his fall subsided by degrees and as he became able to extend his limbs he found to his great joy that though severely shaken and contused no bones were broken He listened the only sound that reached his ear was a low dull pattering but continued noise of which he was then far from divining the cause As his senses became more clear so did the circumstances to which he had been the unfortunate victim return to his imagination and just as he had recalled each particular and was deeply considering the possible result of the whole he became aware that his feet were wholly submerged in water it had indeed risen above his ankle In the midst of the heavy gloom and deep silence which surrounded him he heard still the same dull trickling sound he had observed before and now the matter was clear to him Now indeed he comprehended all the horrors of his situation the cave was filling with water arising from the fearful and formidable overflowing of the Seine the dungeon in which he had been thrown was doubtless beneath the level of the river and was chosen by his gaolers for that purpose as offering a slow though certain means of destruction The conviction of his danger recalled Rodolph entirely to himself Quick as lightning he made his way up the damp slippery stairs arrived at the top he came in contact with a thick door he tried in vain to open it its massy hinges resisted his most vigorous efforts to force them At this moment of despair and danger his first thought was for Murphy If he be not on his guard those monsters will murder him cried he It will be I who shall have caused his death my good my faithful Murphy This cruel thought nerved the arm of Rodolph with fresh vigour and again he bent his most powerful energy to endeavour to force the ponderous door Alas the thickly plated iron with which it was covered mocked his utmost efforts and sore weary and exhausted he was compelled to relinquish the fruitless task Again he descended into the cave in hopes of obtaining something which might serve as a lever to force the hinges or wrench the fastenings Groping against the slimy walls he felt himself continually treading on some sort of round elastic bodies which appeared to slip from under his feet and to scramble for safety past him They were rats driven by the fast rising water from their retreats Groping about the place on all fours with the water half way up his leg Rodolph felt in all directions for the weapon he so much desired to find nothing but the damp walls met his touch however and in utter despair he resumed his position at the top of the steps of the thirteen stairs which composed the flight three were already under water Thirteen had ever been Rodolph s unlucky number There are moments when the strongest minds are under the influence of superstitious ideas and at this juncture Rodolph viewed the fatal amount of stairs as an ill augury Again the possible fate of Murphy recurred to him and as if inspired by a fresh hope he eagerly felt around the door to discover some slight chink or opening by which his cries for help might be heard In vain the dampness of the soil had swollen the wood and joined it hermetically to the wet slimy earth Rodolph next tried the powers of his voice and shouted with the fullest expansion of his lungs trusting that his cries for assistance might reach the adjoining cabaret and then tired and exhausted sat down to listen Nothing was to be heard no sound disturbed the deep silence which reigned but the drop drop drop the dull trickling monotonous bubbling of the fast increasing waters His last hope extinguished Rodolph seated himself in gloomy despair and leaning his back against the door bewailed the perilous situation of his faithful friend perhaps at that very moment struggling beneath the assassin s knife Bitterly did he then regret his rash and venturesome projects however good and generous the motives by which he had been instigated and severely did he reproach himself for having taken advantage of the devotion of Murphy who rich honoured and esteemed by all who knew him had quitted a beloved wife and child to assist Rodolph in the bold undertaking he had imposed on himself During these sorrowful reflections the water was still rising rapidly and five steps only now remained dry Rodolph now found himself compelled to assume a standing position though in so doing his forehead was brought in close contact with the very top of the vault He calculated the probable duration of his mortal agony of the period which must elapse ere this slow inch like death would put a period to his misery he bethought him of the pistol he carried with him and at the risk of injuring himself in the attempt he determined to fire it off against the door so as to disturb some of the fastenings by the concussion but here again a disappointment awaited him the pistol was nowhere to be found and he could but conclude it had fallen from his pocket during his struggle with the Schoolmaster But for his deep concern on Murphy s account Rodolph would have met his death unmoved his conscience acquitted him of all intentional offence nay it solaced him with the recollection of good actually performed and much more meditated To the decrees of an all wise and inscrutable Providence he resigned himself and humbly accepted his present punishment as the just reward for a criminal action as yet unexpiated A fresh trial of his fortitude awaited him The rats still pursued by the fast gathering waters finding no other means of escape sought refuge from one step to another ascending as fast as the rising flood rendered their position untenable unable to scale the perpendicular walls or doors they availed themselves of the vestments of Rodolph whose horror and disgust rose to an indescribable degree as he felt their cold clammy paws and wet hairy bodies crawling or clinging to him in his attempts to repulse them their sharp cold bite inflicted on him a most acute agony while his face and hands streamed with blood from the multitude of wounds received Again he called for help shouted aloud and almost screamed in his pain and wretchedness Alas the dull echo of the vault and the gurgling waters alone replied A few short moments and he would be bereft even of the power of calling upon God or man to help him the rapidly rising flood had now reached his very throat and ere long would have ascended to his lips The choked air began too to fail in the narrow space now left it and the first symptoms of asphyxia began to oppress Rodolph the arteries of his temples beat violently his head became giddy and the faint sickness of death seemed to make his chest heave convulsively Already were the waters gurgling in his ears a dizziness of sight and a confusion of ideas had well nigh deprived him of all powers of sight or sound the last glimmer of reason was well nigh shaken from her throne when hasty steps and the sound of voices on the other side of the door were heard Hope recalled his expiring strength and making one powerful effort Rodolph was able to distinguish the following words after which all consciousness forsook him Did I not tell you so There you see there is no one here Deuce take it no more there is replied the voice of the Chourineur in a tone of vexation and disappointment And the sounds died away Rodolph utterly exhausted had no longer power to sustain himself his limbs sunk from under him and he slid unresistingly down the stone steps All at once the door of the vault was abruptly opened from the other side and the swelling masses contained in the inner vault glad to find a further outlet rushed onwards as though bursting through the gates of a sluice and the Chourineur whose opportune return shall be accounted for by and by seized the two arms of Rodolph who half dead had mechanically clung to the threshold of the door and bore him from the black and rushing waters which had nigh proved his grave CHAPTER XVI THE SICK NURSE Snatched by the Chourineur from a certain death and removed to the house in the Allee des Veuves which had been reconnoitred by the Chouette previously to the attempt on it by the Schoolmaster Rodolph was placed in bed in a comfortably furnished apartment a cheerful fire was burning on the hearth A lamp placed on a neighbouring table diffused a strong clear light while the bed of Rodolph shaded by thick curtains of green damask remained protected from the glare and in the shadow of its deep recess A negro of middle stature with white hair and eyebrows wearing an orange and green riband at the buttonhole of his blue coat sat by the bedside holding in his right hand a seconds watch which he appeared to consult while counting with his left the beating of Rodolph s pulse The expression of the negro s countenance was at once sad and pensive and he continued from time to time to gaze on the sleeping man with the most tender solicitude The Chourineur clad in rags and soiled with mud stood motionless with folded arms at the foot of the bed his red beard was long and matted in disorder his thick bushy hair was tangled with mud and wet which still dripped from it while his hard bronzed features were marked by the most profound pity for the patient hardly venturing to breathe lest the heaving of his huge chest should disturb the invalid he awaited with the most intense anxiety the result of the doctor s observations on the sick man s state then as though to while away the fearful apprehension of an unfavourable opinion he continued to deliver his thoughts aloud after the following manner Who would think now to see him lying there so helpless he could ever have been the man to give me such a precious drubbing as I got from him I dare say though he will soon be up again well and strong as ever Don t you think so M le Docteur Faith I only wish he could drum himself well upon my back I d lend it him as long as he liked But perhaps that would shake him too much and overfatigue him would it sir addressing the negro whose only reply was an impatient wave of the hand The Chourineur was instantly silent The draught said the doctor The Chourineur who had respectfully left his nailed shoes at the door at these words arose and walked towards the table indicated by the negro s finger going on the very top of his toes drawing up his legs extending his arms and swelling out his back and shoulders in a manner so ludicrous as under other circumstances would have been highly diverting The poor fellow seemed endeavouring to collect his whole weight so that no portion of it should touch the floor which in spite of his energetic efforts to prevent it groaned beneath his ponderous limbs as they moved towards the desired spot Unfortunately between his overanxiety to acquit himself well in his important mission and his fear of dropping the delicate phial he was bringing so overcarefully he grasped the slight neck so tightly in his huge hand that it shivered to atoms and the precious liquid was expended on the carpet At the sight of this unfortunate mischance the Chourineur remained in mute astonishment one of his huge legs in the air his toes nervously contracted and looking with a stupefied air alternately from the doctor to the fragments of the bottle and from that to the morsel his thumb and finger were yet tightly holding Awkward devil exclaimed the negro impatiently Yes that I am responded the Chourineur as though grateful for the sound of a voice to break the frightful bewilderment of his ideas Ah cried the AEsculapius observing the table attentively happily you took the wrong phial I wanted the other one What that little one with the red stuff inquired the unlucky sick nurse in a low and humble tone Of course I mean that why there is no other left The Chourineur turning quickly around upon his heels after his old military fashion crushed the fragments of glass which lay on the carpet beneath his feet More delicate ones might have suffered severely from the circumstance but the ex debardeur had a pair of natural sandals hard as the hoofs of a horse Have a care cried the physician You will hurt yourself To this caution the Chourineur paid no attention but seemed wholly absorbed in so discharging his new mission as should effectually destroy all recollection of his late clumsiness It was really beautiful to behold the scrupulous delicacy and lightness of touch with which spreading out his two first fingers he seized the fragile crystal avoiding all use of the unlucky thumb whose undue pressure he rightly conceived had brought about his previous accident he kept so widely stretched from his forefinger that a butterfly might have passed between with outspread wings without losing one atom of its golden plumage The black doctor trembled lest all this caution should lead to a second misadventure but happily the phial reached its destination in safety As the Chourineur approached the bed he again smashed beneath his tread some of the fallen relics of the former potion The deuce take you man Do you want to maim yourself for life Lame myself asked the eager nurse Why yes you keep walking upon glass as though you were trying for it Oh bless you never mind that the soles of my feet are hard as iron must be something sharper than glass could hurt them A teaspoon said the doctor The Chourineur recommenced his evolutions sylphidiques and returned with the article required After having swallowed a few spoonfuls of the mixture Rodolph began to stir in his bed and faintly moved his hands Good good he is recovering from his stupor said the doctor speaking to himself That bleeding has relieved him he is now out of danger Saved Bravo Vive la Charte exclaimed the Chourineur in the full burst of his joy Hold your tongue and pray be quiet said the negro in a tone of command To be sure I will M le Medecin His pulse is becoming regular very well indeed excellent And that poor friend of M Rodolph s body and bones of me when he comes to know that But then luckily Silence I say Certainly M le Docteur And sit down But M le Sit down I tell you You disturb me twisting and fidgeting about in that manner you distract my attention Come sit down at once and keep still But doctor don t you perceive I am as dirty as a pile of floating wood just going to be unloaded all slime and wet you see I should spoil the furniture Then sit down on the ground I should soil the carpet Do what you like but for heaven s sake be quiet said the doctor in a tone of impatience then throwing himself into an armchair he leaned his head upon his clasped hands and appeared lost in deep reflection After a moment of profound meditation the Chourineur less from any need he felt for repose than in obedience to the doctor s commands took a chair with the utmost precaution turned it upside down with an air of intense self satisfaction at having at length devised a plan to act in strict conformity with the orders received and yet avoid all risk of soiling the silken cushion having laid the back on the ground he proceeded after all manner of delicate arrangements to take his seat on the outer rails but unhappily the Chourineur was entirely ignorant of the laws of the lever and the equilibrium of bodies the chair overbalanced and the luckless individual seated thereon in endeavouring to save himself from falling by an involuntary movement caught hold of a small stand on which was a tray containing some tea things At the formidable noise caused by so many falling articles clattering upon the head of the unfortunate cause of all this discord and havoc the doctor sprung from his seat while Rodolph awaking with a start raised himself on his elbow looked about him with an anxious and perturbed glance then passing his hand over his brows as though trying to arrange his ideas he inquired Where is Murphy Your royal highness need be under no apprehensions on his account answered the negro respectfully there is every hope of his recovery Recovery He is then wounded Unhappily my lord he is Where is he Let me see him And Rodolph endeavoured to rise but fell back again overcome by weakness and the intense pain he felt from his many and severe contusions Since I cannot walk cried he at length let me be instantly carried to Murphy this moment My lord he sleeps at present it would be highly dangerous at this particular juncture to expose him to the slightest agitation You are deceiving me and he is dead He has been murdered And I I am the wretched cause of it cried Rodolph in a tone of agony raising his clasped hands towards heaven My lord knows that his servant is incapable of a falsehood I assert by my honour that although severely wounded Murphy lives and that his chance of recovery is all but certain You say that but to prepare me for more disastrous tidings he lies doubtless wounded past all hope and he my faithful friend will die My lord Yes you are seeking to deceive me till all is over But I will see him I will judge for myself the sight of a friend cannot be hurtful Let me be instantly removed to his chamber Once more my lord I pledge my solemn assurance that barring chances not likely to occur Murphy will soon be convalescent My dear David may I indeed believe you You may indeed my lord Hear me You know the high opinion I entertain of your ability and knowledge and that from the hour in which you were attached to my household you have possessed my most unbounded confidence never for one instant have I doubted your great skill and perfect acquaintance with your profession but I conjure you if a consultation be necessary My lord that would have been my first thought had I seen the slightest reason for such a step but up to the present moment it would be both useless and unnecessary And besides I should be somewhat tenacious of introducing strangers into the house until I knew whether your orders of yesterday But how has all this happened said Rodolph interrupting the black Who saved me from drowning in that horrid cellar I have a confused recollection of having heard the Chourineur s voice there was I mistaken Not at all mistaken my lord But let the brave fellow to whom all praise is due relate the affair in which he was the principal actor himself Where is he Where is he The doctor looked about for the recently elected sick nurse and at length found him thoroughly silenced and shamed by his late tumble ensconced behind the curtains of the bed Here he is said the doctor he looks somewhat shamefaced Come forward my brave fellow said Rodolph extending his hand to his preserver The confusion of the poor Chourineur was still further increased from having when behind his curtain heard the black doctor address Rodolph continually as my lord or your royal highness Approach my friend my deliverer said Rodolph and give me your hand I beg pardon sir I mean my lord no highness no Call me M Rodolph as you used to do I like it better And so do I it comes so much easier to one But be so good as to excuse my hand I have done so much work lately that Your hand I tell you your hand Overcome by this kind and persevering command the Chourineur timidly extended his black and horny palm which Rodolph warmly shook Now then sit down and tell me all about it how you discovered the cellar But I think I can guess The Schoolmaster We have him in safety said the black doctor Yes he and the Chouette tied together like two rolls of tobacco A pair of pretty creatures they look as ever you would wish to see and I doubt not sick enough of each other s company by this time And my poor Murphy What a selfish wretch must I be to think only of myself Where is he wounded David In the right side my lord but fortunately towards the lower false rib Oh I must have a deep and terrible revenge for this David I depend upon your assistance My lord knows full well that I am wholly devoted to him both body and soul replied the negro coldly But how my noble fellow were you able to arrive here in time said Rodolph to the Chourineur Why if you please my lor no sir highness Rodolph I had better begin by the beginning Quite right I am listening go on But mind you are only to call me M Rodolph Very well You know that last night you told me after you returned from the country where you had gone with poor Goualeuse Try and find the Schoolmaster in the Cite tell him you know of a capital put up that you have refused to join it but that if he will take your place he has only to be to morrow that s to day at the barrier of Bercy at the Panier Fleuri and there he will see the man who has made the plant qui a nourri le poupard Well On leaving you I pushed on briskly for the Cite I goes to the ogress s no Schoolmaster then to the Rue Saint Eloi on to the Rue aux Feves then to the Rue de la Vieille Draperie couldn t find my man At last I stumbled upon him and that old devil s kin Chouette in the front of Notre Dame at the shop of a tailor who is a fence eight and thief they were sporting the blunt which they had prigged from the tall gentleman in black who wanted to do something to you they bought themselves some toggery The Chouette bargained for a red shawl an old monster I told my tale to the Schoolmaster and he snapped at it and said he would be at the rendezvous accordingly So far so good This morning according to your orders I ran here to bring you the answer You said to me My lad return to morrow before daybreak you must pass the day in the house and in the evening you will see something which will be worth seeing You did not let out more than that but I was fly and said to myself This is a dodge to catch the Schoolmaster to morrow by laying a right bait for him He is a scoundrel he murdered the cattle dealer and as they say another person besides in the Rue du Roule I see all about it eight Receiver of stolen goods My mistake was not to have told you all my good fellow then this horrible result would not have occurred That was your affair M Rodolph all that concerned me was to serve you for truth to say I don t know how or why but as I have told you before I feel as if I were your bulldog But that s enough I said then M Rodolph pays me for my time so my time is his and I will employ it for him Then an idea strikes me the Schoolmaster is cunning he may suspect a trap M Rodolph will propose to him the job for to morrow it is true but the downy cove is likely enough to come to day and lurk about and reconnoitre the ground and if he is suspicious of M Rodolph he will bring some other cracksman robber with him and do the trick on his own account To prevent this I said to myself I must go and plant myself somewhere where I may get a view of the walls the garden gate there is no other entrance If I find a snug corner as it rains I will remain there all day perhaps all night and to morrow morning I shall be all right and ready to go to M Rodolph s So I goes to the Allee des Veuves to place myself and what should I see but a small tavern not ten paces from your door I entered and took my seat near the window in a room on the ground floor I called for a quart of drink and a quart of nuts saying I expected some friends a humpbacked man and a tall woman I chose them because it would appear more natural I was very comfortably seated and kept my eye on the door It rained cats and dogs no one passed night came on But interrupted Rodolph why did you not go at once to my house You told me to come the next day morning M Rodolph and I didn t dare return there sooner I should have looked like an intruder a sneak brosseur as the troopers call it You understand Well there I was at the window of the wine shop cracking my nuts and drinking my liquor when through the fog I saw the Chouette approach accompanied by Bras Rouge s brat little Tortillard Ah ah said I to myself now the farce begins Well the little hound of a child hid himself in one of the ditches of the Allee and was evidently on the lookout As for that the Chouette she takes off her bonnet puts it into her pocket and rings the gate bell Our poor friend M Murphy opens the door and the one eyed mother of mischief tosses up her arms and makes her way into the garden I could have kicked myself for not being able to make out what the Chouette was up to At last out she comes puts on her bonnet says two words to Tortillard who returns to his hole and then cuts her stick I say to myself Caution no blunder now Tortillard has come with the Chouette then the Schoolmaster and M Rodolph are at Bras Rouge s The Chouette has come out to reconnoitre about the house then sure as a gun they ll try it on this very night If they do M Rodolph who believes they will not go to work till to morrow is quite over reached and if he is over reached I ought to go to Bras Rouge s and see for him True but then suppose that the Schoolmaster arrives in the meantime that s to be thought of Suppose I go to the house and see M Murphy mind your eye that urchin Tortillard is near the door he will hear me ring the bell see me and give the word to the Chouette and if she returns that will spoil all and the more particularly as perhaps M Rodolph has after all made his arrangements for this evening Confound it these yes and no bothered my brain tremendously I was quite bewildered and saw nothing clear before me I didn t know what to do for the best so I said I ll walk out and perhaps the clear air will brighten my thoughts a bit I went out and the open air cleared my brain so I took off my blouse and my neck handkerchief I went to the ditch where Tortillard lay and taking the young devil s kin by the cuff of his neck how he did wriggle and twist and scuffle and scratch I put him into my blouse tying up one end with the sleeves and the bottom tightly with my cravat He could breathe very well Well then I took the bundle under my arm and passing a low damp garden surrounded by a little wall I threw the brat Tortillard into the midst of a cabbage bed He squeaked like a sucking pig but nobody could hear him two steps off I cut off it was time I climbed up one of the high trees in the Allee just in front of your door and over the ditch in which Tortillard had been stationed Ten minutes afterwards I heard footsteps it was raining still and the night was very dark I listened it was the Chouette Tortillard Tortillard says she in a low voice It rains and the little brat is tired of waiting said the Schoolmaster swearing if I catch him I ll skin him alive Fourline take care replied the Chouette Perhaps he has gone to warn us of something that has happened maybe some trap for us The young fellow would not make the attempt till ten o clock That s the very reason replies the Schoolmaster it is now only seven o clock You saw the money nothing venture nothing have Give me the ripping chisel and the jemmy What instruments are they asked Rodolph They came from Bras Rouge s Oh he has a well furnished house In a crack the door is opened Stay where you are said the Schoolmaster to the Chouette keep a bright lookout and give me the signal if you hear anything Put your pinking iron in the buttonhole of your waistcoat that you may have it handy said the old hag The Schoolmaster entered the garden and I instantly coming down from the tree fell on the Chouette I silenced her with two blows of my fist my new style and she fell without a word I ran into the garden but thunder and lightning M Rodolph it was too late Poor Murphy He was struggling on the ground with the Schoolmaster at the entrance and although wounded he held his voice and made no cry for help Excellent man he is like a good dog bites but doesn t bark Well I went bang heads or tails at it hitting the Schoolmaster on the shoulder which was the only place I could at the moment touch Vive la Charte it s I The Chourineur shouts M Murphy Ah villain where do you come from cries out the Schoolmaster quite off his guard at that What s that to you says I fixing one of his legs between my knees and grasping his fin with my other hand it was that in which he held his dagger And M Rodolph asked M Murphy of me whilst doing all in his power to aid me Worthy kind hearted creature murmured Rodolph in a tone of deep distress I know nothing of him says I this scoundrel perhaps has killed him And then I went with redoubled strength at the Schoolmaster who tried to stick me with his larding pin but I lay with my breast on his arm and so he only had his fist at liberty You are then quite alone says I to M Murphy whilst we still struggled desperately with the Schoolmaster There are people close at hand he replied but they did not hear me cry out Is it far off They would be here in ten minutes Let us call out for help there are passers by who will come and help us No as we have got him we must hold him here But I am growing weak I am wounded Thunder and lightning then run and get assistance if you have strength left I will try and hold him M Murphy then disengaged himself and I was alone with the Schoolmaster I don t want to brag but by Jove these were moments when I was not having a holiday We were half on the ground half on the bottom step of the flight I had my arms round the neck of the villain my cheek against his cheek and he was puffing like a bull I heard his teeth grind It was dark it rained pouring the lamp left in the passage lighted us a little I had twisted one of my legs around his but in spite of that his loins were so powerful that he moved himself and me on to the bare ground He tried to bite me but couldn t I never felt so strong Thunder my heart beat but it was in the right place I said I am like a man who is grappling with a mad dog to prevent him from fastening on some passer by Let me go and I will do you no harm said the Schoolmaster in an exhausted voice What a coward says I to him So then your pluck is in your strength So you wouldn t have stabbed the cattle dealer at Poissy and robbed him if he had only been as strong as me eh No says he but I will kill you as I did him And saying that he made so violent a heave and gave so powerful a jerk with his legs at the same time that he half threw me over if I had not kept a tight hold of his wrist which held the stiletto I was done for At this moment my left hand was seized with the cramp and I was compelled to loosen my hold that nearly spoiled all and I said to myself I am now undermost and he at top he ll kill me Never mind I had rather be in my place than his M Rodolph said that I had heart and honour I felt it was all over with me and at that moment I saw the Chouette standing close by us with her glaring eye and red shawl Thunder and lightning I thought I had the nightmare Finette cries the Schoolmaster I have let fall the knife pick it up there there under him and strike him home in the back between the shoulders quick quick Only wait only wait till I find it till I see it fourline And then the cursed Chouette turned and poked about us like an old bird of mischief as she was At last she found the dagger and sprung towards it but as I was flat on my belly I gave her a kick in the stomach which sent her neck over crop she got up and in a desperate rage I could do no more I still held on and struggled with the Schoolmaster but he kept giving me such dreadful blows on my jaw that I was about to let go my hold when I saw three or four armed men who came down the stairs and M Murphy pale as ashes and with difficulty supporting himself with the assistance of the doctor here They seized hold of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette and soon bound them hand and foot That was not all I still wanted M Rodolph I sprang at the Chouette remembering the tooth of the poor dear Goualeuse I grasped her arm and twisted it saying Where is M Rodolph She bore it well and silently I took a second turn and then she screeched out At Bras Rouge s in the vault at the Bleeding Heart All right As I went I meant to take Tortillard from his cabbage bed as it was on my road I looked for him but only found my blouse he had gnawed his way out with his teeth I reached the Bleeding Heart and I laid hold of Bras Rouge Where is the young man who came here this evening with the Schoolmaster Don t squeeze so hard and I ll tell you They wanted to play him a trick and shut him up in my cellar we ll go now and let him out We went down but there was no one to be seen He must have gone out whilst my back was turned says Bras Rouge you see plain enough he is not here I was going away sad enough when by the light of the lantern I saw at the bottom of the cellar another door I ran towards it and opened the door and had as it were a pail of water thrown at me I saw your two poor arms in the air I fished you out and brought you here on my back as there was nobody at hand to get a coach That s all my tale M Rodolph and I may say without bragging that I am satisfied with myself My man I owe my life to you it is a heavy debt but be assured I will pay it David will you go and learn how Murphy is added Rodolph and return again instantly The black went out Where is the Schoolmaster my good fellow In another room with the Chouette You will send for the police M Rodolph No You surely will not let him go Ah M Rodolph none of that nonsensical generosity I say again he is a mad dog let the passengers look out He will never bite again be assured Then you are going to shut him up somewhere No in half an hour he will leave this house The Schoolmaster Yes Without gens d armes Yes He will go out from here and free Free And quite alone Quite alone But he will go Wherever he likes said Rodolph interrupting the Chourineur with a meaning smile The black returned Well David well and how is Murphy He sleeps my lord said the doctor despondingly his respiration is very difficult Not out of danger His case is very critical my lord yet there is hope Oh Murphy vengeance vengeance exclaimed Rodolph in a tone of concentrated rage Then he added David a word And he whispered something in the ear of the black He started back Do you hesitate said Rodolph Yet I have often suggested this idea to you the moment is come to put it into practice I do not hesitate my lord the suggestion is well worthy the consideration of the most elevated jurists for this punishment is at the same time terrible and yet fruitful for repentance In this case it is most applicable Without enumerating the crimes which have accumulated to send this wretch to the Bagne for his life he has committed three murders the cattle dealer Murphy and yourself it is in his case justice He will have before him an unlimited horizon for expiation added Rodolph After a moment s silence he resumed And five thousand francs will suffice David Amply my lord My good fellow said Rodolph to the bewildered Chourineur I have two words to say to M David will you go into that chamber on the other side where you will see a large red pocketbook on a bureau open it and take out five notes of a thousand francs each and bring them to me And inquired the Chourineur involuntarily who are those five thousand francs for For the Schoolmaster And do you at the same time tell them to bring him in here CHAPTER XVII THE PUNISHMENT The scene we are about to describe took place in a room hung with red and brilliantly lighted Rodolph clothed in a long dressing gown of black velvet which increased the pallor of his features was seated before a large table covered with a green cloth On this table was the Schoolmaster s pocketbook the pinchbeck chain of the Chouette to which was suspended the little Saint Esprit of lapis lazuli the blood stained stiletto with which Murphy had been stabbed the crowbar with which the door had been forced and the five notes of a thousand francs each which the Chourineur had fetched out of the next apartment The negro doctor was seated at one side of the table the Chourineur on the other The Schoolmaster tightly bound with cords and unable to move a limb was placed in a large armchair on casters in the middle of the salon The people who had brought in this man had withdrawn and Rodolph the doctor the Chourineur and the assassin were left alone Rodolph was no longer out of temper but calm sad and collected he was about to discharge a solemn self imposed and important duty The doctor was lost in meditation The Chourineur felt an indescribable fear he could not take his eyes off Rodolph The Schoolmaster s countenance was ghastly he was in an agony of fear The most profound silence reigned within nothing was heard but the splash splash of the rain without as it fell from the roof on to the pavement Rodolph addressed the Schoolmaster Anselm Duresnel you have escaped from the Bagne at Rochefort where you were condemned for life for forgery robbery and murder It s false said the Schoolmaster in a hollow voice and looking about him with his restless and glaring glance You are Anselm Duresnel and you murdered and robbed a cattle dealer on the road to Poissy It s a lie You shall confess it presently The scoundrel looked at Rodolph with an air of astonishment This very night you came here to rob and you have stabbed the master of this house It was you who suggested this robbery assuming an air of assurance I was attacked and I defended myself The man you stabbed did not attack you he was unarmed True I did suggest this robbery to you I ll tell you why Last night only after having robbed a man and woman in the Cite you offered to kill me for a thousand francs I heard him said the Chourineur The Schoolmaster darted at him a glance of deadliest hate Rodolph continued You see there was no occasion to tempt you to do mischief You are not my judge and I will not answer you another question Illustration Rodolph Addressed the Schoolmaster Etching by Mercier after the drawing by Frank T Merrill I ll tell you why I proposed this robbery to you I knew you were a runaway convict you know the parents of the unfortunate girl all whose misfortunes have been caused by your miserable accomplice the Chouette I wished to draw you here by the temptation of a robbery because this was the only temptation that could avail with you Once in my power I leave you the choice of being handed over to the hands of justice which will make you pay with your head the assassination of the cattle dealer It is false I did not commit that crime Or of being conducted out of France under my direction to a place of perpetual confinement where your lot will be less painful than at the Bagne but I will only allow you this relaxation of punishment on condition that you give me the information which I desire to acquire Condemned for life you have broken away from your confinement and by seizing upon you and placing you hereafter beyond the possibility of doing injury I serve society and from your confession I may perhaps find the means of restoring to her family a poor creature much more unfortunate than guilty This was my first intention it was not legal but your escape and your fresh crimes forbid any such course on my part now and place you beyond all law Yesterday by a remarkable revelation I discovered that you are Anselm Duresnel It s false I am not called Duresnel Rodolph took from the table the chain of the Chouette and pointing to the little Saint Esprit of lapis lazuli said in a threatening voice Sacrilege You have prostituted to an infamous wretch this holy relic thrice holy for your infant boy had this pious gift from his mother and grandmother The Schoolmaster dumfounded at this discovery lowered his head and made no response You carried off your child from his mother fifteen years ago and you alone possess the secret of his existence I had in this an additional motive for laying hands on you when I had detected who you were I seek no revenge for what you have done to me personally but to night you have again shed blood without provocation The man you have assassinated came to you in full confidence not suspecting your sanguinary purpose He asked you what you wanted Your money or your life and you stabbed him with your poniard So M Murphy said when I first came to his aid said the doctor It s false He lied Murphy never lies said Rodolph calmly Your crimes demand a striking reparation You came into this garden forcibly you stabbed a man that you might rob him you have committed another murder you ought to die on this spot but pity respect for your wife and son they shall save you from the shame of a scaffold It will be said that you were killed in a brawl with weapons in your hand Prepare the means for your punishment are at hand Rodolph s countenance was implacable The Schoolmaster had remarked in the next room two men armed with carbines His name was known he thought they were going to make away with him and bury in the shade his later crimes and thus spare his family the new opprobrium Like his fellows this wretch was as cowardly as he was ferocious Thinking his hour was come he trembled and cried Mercy No mercy for you said Rodolph If your brains are not blown out here the scaffold awaits you I prefer the scaffold I shall live at least two or three months longer Why why should I be punished at once Mercy mercy But your wife your son they bear your name My name is dishonoured already If only for eight days let me live in mercy do Not even that contempt of life which is sometimes displayed by the greatest criminals said Rodolph with disgust Besides the law forbids any one to take justice into their own hands said the Schoolmaster with assurance The law the law exclaimed Rodolph Do you dare to invoke the law you who have always lived in open revolt and constant enmity against society The ruffian bowed his head and made no answer then added in a more humble tone At least for pity s sake spare my life Will you tell me where your son is Yes yes I will tell you all I know Will you tell me who are the parents of the young girl whose childhood the Chouette made one scene of torture In my pocketbook there are papers which will put you on the track of the persons who gave her to the Chouette Where is your son Will you let me live First make a full confession And then when I have told you all said the Schoolmaster with hesitation You have killed him No no I have confided him to one of my accomplices who when I was apprehended effected his escape What did he do with him He brought him up and gave him an education which fitted him to enter into a banking house at Nantes so that we might get information manage an introduction to the banker and so facilitate our plans Although at Rochefort and preparing for my escape I arranged this plan and corresponded in cipher with my friend Oh mon Dieu his child his son This man appals me cried Rodolph with horror and hiding his head between his hands But it was only of forgery that we thought exclaimed the scoundrel and when my son was informed what was expected of him he was indignant told all to his employer and quitted Nantes You will find in my pocketbook notes of all the steps taken to discover his traces The last place we ascertained he had lived in was the Rue du Temple where he was known under the name of Francois Germain the exact address is also in my pocketbook You see I do not wish to conceal anything I have told you everything I know Now keep your promise I only ask you to have me taken into custody for this night s robbery And the cattle merchant at Poissy That affair can never be brought to light there are no proofs I own it to you in proof of the sincerity with which I am speaking but before any other person I should deny all knowledge of the business You confess it then do you I was destitute without the smallest means of living the Chouette instigated me to do it but now I sincerely repent ever having listened to her I do indeed Ah would you but generously save me from the hands of justice I would promise you most solemnly to forsake all such evil practices for the future Be satisfied your life shall be spared neither will I deliver you into the hands of the law Do you then pardon me exclaimed the Schoolmaster as though doubting what he heard Can it be Can you be so generous as to forgive I both judge you and award your sentence cried Rodolph in a solemn tone I will not surrender you to the power of the laws because they would condemn you to the galleys or the scaffold and that must not be No for many reasons The galleys would but open a fresh field for the development of your brutal strength and villainy which would soon be exercised in endeavouring to obtain domination over the guilty or unfortunate beings you would be associated with to render yourself a fresh object of horror or of dread for even crime has its ambition and yours has long consisted in a pre eminence in vicious deeds and monstrous vices while your iron frame would alike defy the labours of the oar or the chastisement of those set over you And the strongest chains may be broken the thickest wall pierced through steep ramparts have been scaled before now and you might one day burst your yoke and be again let loose upon society like an infuriated beast marking your passage with murder and destruction for none would be safe from your Herculean strength or from the sharpness of your knife therefore such consequences must be avoided But since the galleys might fail to stop your infamous career how is society to be preserved from your brutal violence The scaffold comes next in consideration It is my life then you seek cried the ruffian My life Oh spare it Peace coward Hope not that I mean so speedy a termination to your just punishment No your eager craving after a wretched existence would prevent you from suffering the agony of anticipated death and far from dwelling upon the scaffold and the block your guilty soul would be filled with schemes of escape and hopes of pardon neither would you believe you were truly doomed to die till in the very grasp of the executioner and even in that terrible moment it is probable that brutalised by terror you would be a mere mass of human flesh offered up by justice as an expiatory offering to the manes of your victims That mode of settling your long and heavy accounts will not half pay the debt No poor wretched trembling craven we must devise a more terrific method of atonement for you At the scaffold I repeat you would cling to hope while one breath remained within you wretch that you are you would dare to hope you who have denied all hope and mercy to so many unhappy beings No no unless you repent and that with all your heart for the misdeeds of your infamous life I would in this world at least shut out from you the faintest glimmer of hope What man is this What have I ever done to injure him whence comes he thus to torture me where am I asked the Schoolmaster in almost incoherent tones and nearly frantic with terror Rodolph continued If even you could meet death with a man s courage I would not have you ascend the scaffold for you it would be merely the arena in which like many others you would make a disgusting display of hardened ferocity or dying as you have lived exhale your last sigh with an impious scoff or profane blasphemy That must not be permitted It is a bad example to set before a gazing crowd the spectacle of a condemned being making sport of the instrument of death swaggering before the executioner and yielding with an obscene jest the divine spark infused into man by the breath of a creating God To punish the body is easily done to save the soul is the great thing to be laboured for and desired All sin may be forgiven said our blessed Saviour but from the tribunal to the scaffold the passage is too short time and opportunity are required to repent and make atonement this leisure you shall have May God grant that you turn it to the right purpose The Schoolmaster remained utterly bewildered for the first time in his life a vague and confused dread of something more horrible far than death itself crossed his guilty mind he trembled before the suggestions of his own imagination Rodolph went on Anselm Duresnel I will not sentence you to the galleys neither shall you die Then do you intend sending me to hell or what are you going to do with me Listen said Rodolph rising from his seat with an air of menacing authority You have wickedly abused the great bodily strength bestowed upon you I will paralyse that strength the strongest have trembled before you I will make you henceforward shrink in the presence of the weakest of beings Assassin murderer you have plunged God s creatures into eternal night your darkness shall commence even in this life Now this very hour your punishment shall be proportioned to your crimes But added Rodolph with an accent of mournful pity the terrible judgment I am about to pronounce will at least leave the future open to your efforts for pardon and for peace I should be guilty as you are were I in punishing you to seek only for vengeance just as is my right to demand it far from being unrelenting as death your sentence shall bring forth good fruits for hereafter far from destroying your soul it shall help you to seek its salvation If to prevent you from further violating the commandments of your Maker I for ever deprive you of the beauties of this outer world if I plunge you into impenetrable darkness with no other companion than the remembrance of your crimes it is that you may incessantly contemplate their enormity Yes separated for ever from this external world your thoughts must needs revert to yourself and your vision dwell internally upon the bygone scenes of your ill spent life and I am not without hope that such a mental and constantly presented picture will send the blush of shame even upon your hardened features that your soul deadened as it now is to every good and holy impulse will become softened and tender by repentance Your language too will be changed and good and prayerful words take place of those daring and blasphemous expressions which now disgrace your lips You are brutal and overbearing because you are strong you will become mild and gentle when you are deprived of that strength Now your heart scoffs at the very mention of repentance but the day will come when bowed to the earth with deep contrition you will bewail your victims in dust and ashes You have degraded the intelligence placed within you by a supreme power you have reduced it to the brutal instincts of rapine and murder from a man formed after the image of his Creator you have made yourself a beast of prey one day as I trust and believe that intelligence will be purified by remorse and rendered again guiltless through divine expiation You more inhuman than the beast which perisheth have trampled on the tender feelings by which even animals are actuated you have been the destroyer of your partner and your offspring After a long life entirely devoted to the expiation of your crimes you may venture to implore of the Almighty the great though unmerited happiness of obtaining the pardon of your wife and son and dying in their presence As Rodolph uttered these last words his voice trembled with emotion and he was obliged to conclude The Schoolmaster s terrors had during this long discourse entirely yielded to an opinion that he was only to be subjected to a long lecture on morality and so forth and then discharged upon his own promise of amendment for the many mysterious words uttered by Rodolph he looked upon as mere vague expressions intended to alarm him nothing more Still further reassured by the mild tone in which Rodolph had addressed him the ruffian assumed his usually insolent air and manner as he said bursting into a loud and vulgar laugh Well done upon my word A very good sermon and very well spoken Only we must recollect where we leave off in our moral catechism that we may begin all right next lesson day Come let us have something lively now What do you say master will you guess a charade or two just to enliven us a bit Instead of replying Rodolph addressed the black doctor Proceed David And if I do wrong may the Almighty punish me alone The negro rang two men entered David pointed to a side door which opened into an adjoining closet The chair in which the Schoolmaster remained bound so as to be incapable of the smallest movement was then rolled into the anteroom Are you going to murder me then Mercy mercy shrieked the wretched man as he was being removed Gag him cried the negro entering the closet Rodolph and the Chourineur were left alone M Rodolph said the Chourineur pale and trembling M Rodolph what is going to be done I never felt so frightened Pray speak I must be dreaming surely What have they done to the Schoolmaster He does not cry out all is so silent it makes me more fearful still At this moment David issued from the cabinet his complexion had that livid hue peculiar to the negro countenance while his lips were ashy pale The men who had conveyed the Schoolmaster into the closet now replaced him still bound in his chair on the spot he had previously occupied in Rodolph s presence Unbind him and remove the gag exclaimed David There was a moment of fearful silence while the two attendants relieved the Schoolmaster of his gag and untied the cords which bound him to the chair As the last ligature gave way he sprang up his hideous countenance expressing rage horror and alarm He advanced one step with extended hands then falling back into the chair he uttered a cry of unspeakable agony and raising his hands towards the ceiling exclaimed with maddened fury Blind by heaven Give him this pocketbook David said Rodolph The negro placed a small pocketbook in the trembling hands of the Schoolmaster You will find in that pocketbook wherewithal to provide yourself with a home and the means of living for the remainder of your days Go seek out some safe and solitary dwelling where by humble repentance you may seek to propitiate an offended God You are free Go and repent the Lord is merciful and his ears are ever open to such as truly repent Blind quite blind repeated the Schoolmaster mechanically grasping the pocketbook Open the doors let him depart said Rodolph Blind blind repeated the bewildered and discomfited ruffian You are free you have the means of providing for yourself begone And whither am I to go exclaimed he with the most unbounded rage You have taken away my sight how then do I know in which direction to go Call you not this a crime thus to abuse your power over one unhappily in your hands Thus to To abuse my power repeated Rodolph in a solemn voice And how have you employed the power granted to you How used your superior strength O Death how gladly would I now accept you cried the wretched man To be henceforward at every one s mercy to fear the weakest the smallest object a child might now master me Gracious God what will become of me You have plenty of money It will be taken from me cried the ruffian Mark those words It will be taken from me See how they fill you with fear and dread You have plundered so many unmindful of their helpless destitute condition begone For the love of God cried the Schoolmaster in a suppliant tone let some person lead me forth What will become of me in the streets Oh in mercy kill me take my miserable life but do not turn me out thus wretched thus helpless Kill for pity s sake and save me from being crushed beneath the first vehicle I encounter No Live and repent Repent shouted the Schoolmaster in a fearful voice Never I will live for vengeance for deep and fearful vengeance And again he threw himself from the chair holding his clenched fists in a menacing attitude towards the ceiling as though calling upon Heaven to witness the fixedness of his resolve In an instant his step faltered he again hesitated as though fearful of a thousand dangers Alas alas I cannot proceed I dare not move And I lately so strong and so dreaded by all look at me now Yet no one pities me no one cares for me no hand is stretched out to help the wretched blind upon his lonely way It is impossible to express the stupefaction and alarm expressed by the countenance of the Chourineur during this terrible scene His rough features exhibited the deepest compassion for his fallen foe and approaching Rodolph he said in a low tone M Rodolph he was an accomplished villain and has only got what he richly deserves he wanted to murder me a little while ago too But he is now blind he does not even know how to find his way out of the house and he may be crushed to death in the streets may I lead him to some safe place where at least he may remain quiet for a time Nobly said replied Rodolph kindly pressing the hand of the Chourineur Go my worthy fellow Go with him by all means The Chourineur approached the Schoolmaster and laid his hand on his shoulder the miserable villain started Who touches me asked he in a husky voice It is I I Who Who are you friend or foe The Chourineur And you have come to avenge yourself now you find I am incapable of protecting myself I suppose Nothing of the sort Here take my arm you cannot find the way out by yourself let me lead you there You Chourineur You Yes for all you doubt it but you vex me by not seeming to like my help Come hold tight by me I will see you all right before I leave you Are you quite sure you do not mean me some harm that you are only laying a trap to ensnare me I am not such a scoundrel as to take advantage of your misfortune But let us begone Come on old fellow it will be daylight directly Day which I shall never more behold Day and night to me are henceforward all the same exclaimed the Schoolmaster in such piteous tones that Rodolph unable longer to endure this scene abruptly retired followed by David who first dismissed his two assistants The Chourineur and the Schoolmaster remained alone After a lengthened silence the latter spoke first by inquiring whether it were really true that the pocketbook presented to him contained money Yes I can positively speak to its containing five thousand francs replied the Chourineur since I put them in it with my own hand With that sum you could easily place yourself to board with some quiet good sort of people who would look to you in some retired spot in the country where you might pass your days happily Or would you like me to take you to the ogress s She she would not leave me a rap Well then will you go to Bras Rouge No no He would poison me first and rob me afterwards Well then where shall I take you I know not Happily for both you are no thief Chourineur Here take my pocketbook and conceal it carefully in my waistcoat that La Chouette may not see it she would plunder me of every sou Oh bless you the Chouette is quite safe just now she lies in the Hopital Beaujon While I was struggling with you both to night I happened to dislocate her leg so she s obliged to lie up for the present But what in heaven s name shall I do with this black curtain continually before my eyes In vain I try to push it away it is still there fixed immovable and on its surface I see the pale ghastly features of those He shuddered and said in a low hoarse voice Chourineur did I quite do for that man last night No So much the better observed the robber And then after some minutes silence he exclaimed under a fresh impulse of ungovernable fury And it is you I have to thank for all this Rascal scoundrel I hate you But for you I should have stiffened my man and walked off with his money My very blindness I owe to you my curses upon you for your meddling interference But through you I should have had my blessed eyes to see my own way with How do I know what devil s trick you are planning at this moment Try to forget all that is past it can t be helped now and do not put yourself in such a terrible way it is really very bad for you Come come along now no nonsense will you yes or no because I am regularly done up and must get a short snooze somewhere I can tell you I have had a bellyful of such doings and to morrow I shall get back to my timber pile and earn an honest dinner before I eat it I am only waiting to take you wherever you decide upon going and then on goes my nightcap and I goes to sleep But how can I tell you where to take me when I do not know myself My lodging No no that will not do I should be obliged to tell Well then hark ye Will you for a day or two make shift with my crib I may meet with some decent sort of people who not knowing who you really are would receive you as a boarder and we might say you were a confirmed invalid and required great care and perfect retirement Now I think of it there is a person of my acquaintance living at Port saint Nicolas has a mother a very worthy woman but in humble circumstances residing at saint Mande very likely she would be glad to take charge of you What do you say will you come or not One may trust you Chourineur I am not at all fearful of going money and all to your place happily you have kept yourself honest amidst all the evil example others have set you Ay and even bore the taunts and jests you used to heap upon me because I would not turn prig like yourself Alas who could foresee Now you see if I had listened to you instead of trying to be of real service to you I should clean you out of all your cash True true But you are a downright good fellow and have neither malice nor hatred in your heart said the unhappy Schoolmaster in a tone of deep dejection and humility You are a vast deal better to me than I fear I should have been to you under the same circumstances I believe you too Why M Rodolph himself told me I had both heart and honour But who the devil is this M Rodolph exclaimed the Schoolmaster breaking out fresh at the mention of his name He is not a man he is a monster a fiend a Hold hold cried the Chourineur Now you are going to have another fit which is bad for you and very disagreeable to me because it makes you abuse my friends Come are you ready Shall we set forth on our journey We are going to your lodging are we not Chourineur Yes yes if you are agreeable And you swear to me that you bear me no ill will for the events of the last twelve hours Swear it Of course I swear it Why I have no ill will against you nor anybody And you are certain that he the man I mean is not dead I am as sure of it as that I am living myself That will at least give me one crime the less to answer for If they only knew And that little old man of the Rue du Roule and that woman of the Canal saint Martin But it is useless thinking of all those things now I have enough to occupy my thoughts without trying to recall past misfortunes Blind blind repeated the miserable wretch as leaning on the arm of the Chourineur he slowly took his departure from the house in the Allee des Veuves CHAPTER XVIII THE ISLE ADAM A month has elapsed since the occurrence of the events we have just narrated We now conduct the reader into the little town of the Isle Adam situated in a delightful locality on the banks of the Oise and at the foot of a forest 
4015-63496-0000	train-other-500	The least things become great events in the country
none	none	 and so the idlers of Isle Adam 
4015-63496-0001	train-other-500	who were on the morning before us walking in the square before the church were very anxiously bestirring themselves to learn when the individual would arrive who had recently become the purchaser of the most eligible premises
4015-63496-0002	train-other-500	for a butcher in that town and which were exactly opposite to the church One of those idlers more inquisitive than his companions went and asked the butcher boy
4015-63496-0003	train-other-500	who with a merry face and active hands was very busy in completing the arrangements of the shop
none	none	 This lad replied that he did not know who was the new proprietor 
4015-63496-0004	train-other-500	for he had bought the property through an agent At this moment two persons who had come from Paris in a cabriolet alighted at the door of the shop The one was Murphy quite cured of his wound
4015-63496-0005	train-other-500	and the other the Chourineur At the risk of repeating a vulgar saying we will assert that the impression produced by dress is so powerful
none	none	 that the guest of the cribs of the Cite 
4015-63496-0006	train-other-500	was hardly to be recognised in his present attire His countenance had undergone the same change he had put off with his rags his savage coarse and vulgar air
4015-63496-0007	train-other-500	and to see him walk with both his hands in the pockets of his long and warm coat of dark broadcloth he might have been taken for one of the most inoffensive citizens in the world Faith my fine fellow
4015-63496-0008	train-other-500	the way was long and the cold excessive were they not
none	none	 Why I really did not perceive it M Murphy 
4015-63496-0009	train-other-500	I am too happy and joy keeps one warm Besides when I say happy why What Yesterday you came to seek for me at the Port saint Nicolas where I was unloading as hard as I could
4015-63496-0010	train-other-500	to keep myself warm I had not seen you since the night when the white haired negro had put out the Schoolmaster s eyes By Jove it quite shook me that affair did
none	none	 And M Rodolph 
4015-63496-0011	train-other-500	what a countenance he who looked so mild and gentle I was quite frightened at that moment I was indeed Well what then You said to me Good day Chourineur
none	none	 Good day M Murphy says I 
4015-63496-0012	train-other-500	What you are up again I see So much the better so much the better
none	none	 And M Rodolph 
4015-63496-0013	train-other-500	He was obliged to leave Paris some days after the affair of the Allee des Veuves and he forgot you my man
none	none	 Well M Murphy I can only say that if M Rodolph has forgotten me 
4015-63496-0014	train-other-500	why I shall be very sorry for it that s all I meant to say my good fellow that he had forgotten to recompense your services but that he should always remember them
none	none	 So M Murphy 
4015-63496-0015	train-other-500	those words cheered me up again directly Tonnerre I I shall never forget him He told me I had heart and honour that s enough Unfortunately my lad
4015-63496-0016	train-other-500	monseigneur left without giving any orders about you I have nothing but what monseigneur gives me and I am unable to repay as I could wish all that I owe you personally
none	none	 Come come M Murphy you are jesting with me But why the devil did you not come back again to the Allee des Veuves 
4015-63496-0017	train-other-500	after that fatal night Then monseigneur would not have left without thinking of you
none	none	 Why M Rodolph 
4015-63496-0018	train-other-500	did not tell me to do so and I thought that perhaps he had no further occasion for me But you might have supposed that he would at least desire to express his gratitude to you
none	none	 Did you not tell me that M Rodolph has not forgotten me M Murphy 
4015-63496-0019	train-other-500	Well well don t let us say another word about it only I have had a great deal of trouble to find you out You do not now go to the ogress s No Why not
4015-63496-0020	train-other-500	Oh from some foolish notions I have had Very well But to return to what you were telling me
none	none	 To what M Murphy 
4015-63496-0021	train-other-500	You told me I am glad I have found you and still happy perhaps
none	none	 Oh yes M Murphy 
4015-63496-0022	train-other-500	Why you see when you came to where I was at work at the timber yard you said My lad I am not rich but I can procure you a situation where your work will be easier than on the Quai
4015-63496-0023	train-other-500	and where you will gain four francs a day Four francs a day
none	none	 Vive la Charte 
4015-63496-0024	train-other-500	I could not believe it twas the pay of an adjutant sub officer I replied
none	none	 That s the very thing for me M Murphy 
4015-63496-0025	train-other-500	but you said then that I must not look so like a beggar as that would frighten the employer to whom you would take me I answered I have not the means of dressing otherwise You said to me Come to the Temple
4015-63496-0026	train-other-500	I followed you I chose the most spicy attire that Mother Hubart had you advanced me the money to pay her
none	none	 and in a quarter of an hour 
4015-63496-0027	train-other-500	I was as smart as a landlord or a dentist You appointed me to meet you this morning
none	none	 at the Porte saint Denis at daybreak 
4015-63496-0028	train-other-500	I found you there in a cab and here we are Well do you find anything to regret in all this
none	none	 Why I ll tell you M Murphy 
4015-63496-0029	train-other-500	You see to be dressed in this way spoils a fellow and so you see when I put on again my old smock frock and trousers I sha n t like it And then to gain four francs a day
4015-63496-0030	train-other-500	I who never earned but two and that all at once
none	none	 why I seem to have made too great a start all of a sudden 
4015-63496-0031	train-other-500	and that it cannot last I would rather sleep all my life on the wretched straw bed in my cock loft than sleep five or six nights only in a good bed That s my view of the thing And you are by no means peculiar in your view
4015-63496-0032	train-other-500	but the best thing is to sleep always in a good bed And no mistake it is better to have a bellyful of victuals every day than to starve with hunger Ah here is a butchery here said the Chourineur
4015-63496-0033	train-other-500	as he listened to the blows of the chopper which the boy was using and observed the quarters of beef through the curtains Yes my lad it belongs to a friend of mine Would you like to see it whilst the horse just recovers his wind
none	none	 I really should for it reminds me of my boyish days 
4015-63496-0034	train-other-500	if it was only when I had Montfaucon for a slaughter house and broken down horses for cattle It is droll but if I had the means a butcher s is the trade in which I should set up for I like it To go on a good nag to buy cattle at fairs
4015-63496-0035	train-other-500	to return home to one s own fireside to warm yourself if cold or dry yourself if wet to find your housekeeper or a good jolly plump wife cheerful and pleasant with a parcel of children to feel in your pockets
none	none	 to see if you have brought them home anything 
4015-63496-0036	train-other-500	And then in the morning in the slaughter house to seize an ox by the horns particularly when he s fierce nom de nom he must be fierce then to put on the ring to cleave him down cut him up
4015-63496-0037	train-other-500	dress him Tonnerre that would have been my ambition as it was the Goualeuse s to suck barley sugar when she was a little un
none	none	 By the way that poor girl M Murphy 
4015-63496-0038	train-other-500	not seeing her any more at the ogress s
none	none	 I supposed that M Rodolph 
4015-63496-0039	train-other-500	had taken her away from there
none	none	 That s a good action M Murphy 
4015-63496-0040	train-other-500	Poor child she never liked to do wrong she was so young And then the habit
none	none	 Ah M Rodolph has behaved quite right I am of your opinion 
4015-63496-0041	train-other-500	But will you come into the shop until our horse has rested awhile The Chourineur and Murphy entered the shop and then went to see the yard where three splendid oxen
none	none	 and a score of sheep were fastened up they then visited the stable 
4015-63496-0042	train-other-500	the chaise house the slaughter house the lofts and the out buildings of the house which were all in excellent order and kept with a cleanliness and care which bespoke regularity and easy circumstances
4015-63496-0043	train-other-500	When they had seen all but the up stairs Murphy said You must own that my friend is a lucky fellow This house and property are his without counting a thousand crowns in hand to carry on his business with
4015-63496-0044	train-other-500	and he is besides only thirty eight strong as a bull with an iron constitution and very fond of his business The industrious and civil journeyman that you saw in the shop supplies his place
4015-63496-0045	train-other-500	with much capability when he goes to the fairs to purchase cattle I say again is he not a lucky fellow
none	none	 He is indeed M Murphy 
4015-63496-0046	train-other-500	But you see there are lucky and unlucky people and when I think that I am going to gain four francs a day and know how many there are who only earn the half or even less Will you come up and see the rest of the house
none	none	 With all my heart M Murphy The person who is about to employ you is up stairs The person who is going to employ me Yes Why then didn t you tell me that before I ll tell you 
4015-63496-0047	train-other-500	One moment said the Chourineur with a downcast and embarrassed air taking Murphy by the arm listen whilst I say a word to you
none	none	 which perhaps M Rodolph did not tell you 
4015-63496-0048	train-other-500	but which I ought not to conceal from the master who employs me because if he is offended by it why then you see why afterwards What do you mean to say
4015-63496-0049	train-other-500	I mean to say Well what That I am a convict who has served his time
none	none	 that I have been at the Bagne said Chourineur in a low voice 
4015-63496-0050	train-other-500	Indeed replied Murphy But I never did wrong to any one exclaimed the Chourineur and I would sooner die of hunger than rob but I have done worse than rob he added bending his head down
4015-63496-0051	train-other-500	I have killed my fellow creature in a passion But that is not all he continued after a moment s pause I will tell everything to my employer I would rather be refused at first than detected afterwards You know him
none	none	 and if you think he would refuse me why spare me the refusal and I will go as I came Come along with me said Murphy The Chourineur followed Murphy up the staircase a door opened and they were both in the presence of Rodolph 
4015-63496-0052	train-other-500	My good Murphy said he
none	none	 leave us together awhile CHAPTER XIX RECOMPENSE Vive la Charte cried the Chourineur How precious glad I am to see you again M Rodolph or rather my lord Good day my excellent friend I am equally glad to see you Oh what a joker M Murphy is He told me you had gone away But stay my lord Call me M Rodolph I like that best Well then M Rodolph I have to ask your pardon for not having been to see you after the night with the Schoolmaster I see now that I was guilty of a great rudeness but I do not suppose that you had any desire to see me I forgive you said Rodolph smiling and then added Murphy has shown you all over the house Yes M Rodolph and a fine house and fine shop it is all so neat and so comfortable Talking of comfortable I am the man that will be so M Rodolph M Murphy is going to put me in the way of earning four francs a day yes four francs a day I have something better than that to propose to you my good fellow Better It s unpolite to contradict you but I think that would be difficult Four francs a day I tell you I have something better for this house all that it contains the shop and a thousand crowns which are in this pocketbook all are yours The Chourineur smiled with a stupid air flattened his long napped hat between his knees and squeezed it convulsively evidently not understanding what Rodolph said to him although his language was plain enough Rodolph with much kindness said to him I can imagine your surprise but I again repeat this house and this money are yours they are your property The Chourineur became purple passed his horny hand over his brow which was bathed with perspiration and stammered out in a faltering voice What eh that is indeed my property Yes your property for I bestow it all upon you Do you understand I give it to you The Chourineur rocked backwards and forwards on his chair scratched his head coughed looked down on the ground and made no reply He felt that the thread of his ideas had escaped him He heard quite well what Rodolph said to him and that was the very reason he could not credit what he heard Between the depth of misery the degradation in which he had always existed and the position in which Rodolph now placed him there was an abyss so wide that the service he had rendered to Rodolph important as it was could not fill it up Does what I give you then seem beyond your hopes inquired Rodolph My lord said the Chourineur starting up suddenly you offer me this house and a great deal of money to tempt me but I cannot take them I never robbed in my life It is perhaps to kill but I have too often dreamed of the sergeant added he in a hoarse tone Oh the unfortunate exclaimed Rodolph with bitterness The compassion evinced for them is so rare that they can only explain liberality as a temptation to crime Then addressing the Chourineur in a voice full of gentleness You judge me wrong you mistake I shall require from you nothing but what is honourable What I give you I give because you have deserved it I said the Chourineur whose embarrassments recommenced I deserve it How I will tell you Abandoned from your infancy without any knowledge of right or wrong left to your natural instinct shut up for fifteen years in the Bagne with the most desperate villains assailed by want and wretchedness compelled by your own disgrace and the opinion of honest men to continue to haunt the low dens infested by the vilest malefactors you have not only remained honest but remorse for your crime has outlived the expiation which human justice had inflicted upon you This simple and noble language was a new source of astonishment for the Chourineur he contemplated Rodolph with respect mingled with fear and gratitude but was still unable to convince himself that all he heard was reality What M Rodolph because you beat me because thinking you a workman like myself because you spoke slang as if you had learned it from the cradle I told you my history over two bottles of wine and afterwards I saved you from being drowned you give me a house money I shall be master Say really M Rodolph once more is it possible Believing me like yourself you told me your history naturally and without concealment without withholding either what was culpable or generous I have judged you and judged you well and I have resolved to recompense you But M Rodolph it ought not to be there are poor labourers who have been honest all their lives and who I know it and it may be I have done for many others more than I am doing for you but if the man who lives honestly in the midst of honest men encouraged by their esteem deserves assistance and support he who in spite of the aversion of good men remains honest amidst the most infamous associates on earth he too deserves assistance and support This is not all you saved my life you saved the life of Murphy the dearest friend I have and what I do for you is as much the dictate of personal gratitude as it is the desire to withdraw from pollution a good and generous nature which has been perverted but not destroyed And that is not all What else have I done M Rodolph Rodolph took his hand and shaking it heartily said Filled with commiseration for the mischief which had befallen the very man who had tried just before to kill you you even gave him an asylum in your humble dwelling No nine close to Notre Dame You knew then where I lived M Rodolph If you forget the services you have done to me I do not When you left my house you were followed and were seen to enter there with the Schoolmaster But M Murphy told me that you did not know where I lived M Rodolph I was desirous of trying you still further I wished to know if you had disinterestedness in your generosity and I found that after your courageous conduct you returned to your hard daily labour asking nothing hoping for nothing not even uttering a word of reproach for the apparent ingratitude with which I repaid your services and when Murphy yesterday proposed to you employment a little more profitable than that of your habitual toil you accepted it with joy with gratitude Why M Rodolph do you see sir four francs a day are always four francs a day As to the service I rendered you why it is rather I who ought to thank you How so Yes yes M Rodolph he added with a saddened air I do not forget that since I knew you it was you who said to me those two words You have both heart and honour It is astonishing how I have thought of that They are only two little words and yet those two words had that effect But in truth sow two small grains of anything in the soil and they will put forth shoots This comparison just and almost poetical as it was struck Rodolph In sooth two words but two magic words for the heart that understood them had almost suddenly developed the generous instincts which were inherent in this energetic nature You placed the Schoolmaster at saint Mande said Rodolph Yes M Rodolph He made me change his notes for gold and buy a belt which I sewed round his body and in which I put his mopuses and then good day He boards for thirty sous a day with good people to whom that sum is of much service When I have time to leave my wood piles I shall go and see how he gets on Your wood piles You forget your shop and that you are here at home Come M Rodolph do not amuse yourself by jesting with a poor devil like me you have had your fun in proving me as you term it My house and my shop are songs to the same tune You said to yourself Let us see if this Chourineur is such a gulpin as to believe that I will make him such a present Enough enough M Rodolph you are a wag and there s an end of the matter And he laughed long loud and heartily But once more believe If I were to believe you then you would say Poor Chourineur go you are a trouble to me now Rodolph began to be really troubled how to convince the Chourineur and said in a solemn impressive and almost severe tone I never make sport of the gratitude and sympathy with which noble conduct inspires me I have said this house and this establishment are yours if they suit you for the bargain is conditional I swear to you on my honour all this belongs to you and I make you a present of it for the reasons I have already given The dignified and firm tone and the serious expression of the features of Rodolph at length convinced the Chourineur For some moments he looked at his protector in silence and then said in a voice of deep emotion I believe you my lord and I thank you much A poor man like me cannot make fine speeches but once more indeed on my word I thank you very much All I can say is that I will never refuse assistance to the unhappy because Hunger and Misery are ogresses of the same sort as those who laid hands on the poor Goualeuse and once in that sink it is not every one that has the fist strong enough to pull you out again My worthy fellow you cannot prove your gratitude more than in speaking to me thus So much the better my lord for else I should have a hard job to prove it Come now let us visit your house my good old Murphy has had the pleasure and I should like it also Rodolph and the Chourineur came down stairs At the moment they reached the yard the shopman addressing the Chourineur said to him respectfully Since you sir are to be my master I beg to tell you that our custom is capital We have no more cutlets or legs of mutton left and we must kill a sheep or two directly Parbleu said Rodolph to the Chourineur here is a capital opportunity for exercising your skill I should like to have the first sample the open air has given me an appetite and I will taste your cutlets You are very kind M Rodolph said the Chourineur in a cheerful voice you flatter me but I will do my best Shall I bring two sheep to the slaughter house master asked the journeyman Yes and bring a well sharpened knife not too thin in the blade and strong in the back I have just what you want master There you could shave with it Take it Tonnerre M Rodolph said the Chourineur taking off his upper coat with haste and turning up his shirtsleeves which displayed a pair of arms like a prize fighter s this reminds me of my boyish days and the slaughter house You shall see how I handle a knife Nom de nom I wish I was at it The knife lad the knife That s it I see you know your trade This is a blade Who will have it Tonnerre with a tool like this I could face a wild bull And the Chourineur brandished his knife his eyes began to fill with blood the beast was regaining the mastery the instinct and thirst for blood reappeared in all the fullness of their fearful predominance The butchery was in the yard a vaulted dark place paved with stones and lighted by a small narrow opening at the top The man drove one of the sheep to the door Shall I fasten him to the ring master Fasten him Tonnerre and I with my knees at liberty Oh no I will hold him here as fast as if in a vice Give me the beast and go back to the shop The journeyman obeyed Rodolph was left alone with the Chourineur and watched him attentively almost anxiously Now then to work said he Oh I sha n t be long Tonnerre you shall see how I handle a knife My hands burn and I have a singing in my ears my temples beat as they used when I was going to see red Come here thou Ah Madelon let me stab you dead Then his eyes sparkled with a fierce delight and no longer conscious of the presence of Rodolph the Chourineur lifted the sheep without an effort with one spring he carried it off as a wolf would do bounding towards his lair with his prey Rodolph followed him and leaned on one of the wings of the door which he closed The butchery was dark one strong ray of light falling straight down lighted up a la Rembrandt the rugged features of the Chourineur his light hair and his red whiskers Stooping low holding in his teeth a long knife which glittered in the darkness visible he drew the sheep between his legs and when he had adjusted it took it by the head stretched out its neck and cut its throat At the instant when the sheep felt the keen blade it gave one gentle low and pitiful bleat and raising its dying eyes to the Chourineur two spurts of blood jetted forth into the face of its slayer The cry the look the blood that spouted out made a fearful impression on the man His knife fell from his hands his features grew livid contracted and horrible beneath the blood that covered them his eyes expanded his hair stiffened and then retreating with a gesture of horror he cried in a suffocating voice Oh the sergeant the sergeant Rodolph hastened to him Recover yourself my good fellow There there the sergeant repeated the Chourineur retreating step by step with his eyes fixed and haggard and pointing with his finger as if at some invisible phantom Then uttering a fearful cry as if the spectre had touched him he rushed to the bottom of the butchery into the darkest corner and there with his face breast and arms against the wall as if he would break through it to escape from so horrible a vision he repeated in a hollow and convulsive tone Oh the sergeant the sergeant the sergeant CHAPTER XX THE DEPARTURE Thanks to the care of Murphy and Rodolph who with difficulty calmed his agitation the Chourineur was completely restored to himself and was alone with the prince in one of the rooms on the first floor in the house My lord said he despondingly you have been very kind indeed to me but hear me I would rather be a thousand times more wretched than I have yet been than become a butcher Yet reflect a little Why my lord when I heard the cry of the poor animal which could not make the slightest resistance when I felt its blood spring into my face hot blood which seemed as coming from a living thing you cannot imagine what I felt then I had my dream all over again the sergeant and those poor young fellows whom I cut and stabbed who made no defence and died giving me a look so gentle so gentle that they seemed as if they pitied me My lord it would drive me mad And the poor fellow hid his face in his hands with a convulsive start Come come calm yourself Excuse me my lord but just now the sight of blood of a knife I could not bear at every instant it would renew those dreams which I was beginning to forget To have every day my hands and feet in blood to cut the throats of poor animals who do not so much as make a struggle oh no no I could not for the world I would rather lose my eyesight at once like the Schoolmaster than be compelled to follow such a business It is impossible to depict the energetic gesture action and countenance of the Chourineur as he thus expressed himself Rodolph was deeply affected by it and satisfied with the horrible effect which the sight of the blood had caused to his protege For a moment the savage feeling the bloodthirsty instinct had overcome the human being in the Chourineur but remorse eventually overwhelmed the instinct That was as it should be and it was a fine lesson Forgive me my lord said the Chourineur in a faltering voice I make but a bad recompense for all your kindness to me but Not at all my good fellow I told you that our bargain was conditional I selected for you the business of a butcher because your inclinations and taste seemed to lie in that direction Alas my lord that s true and had it not been for what you know of that would have been the trade of all others I should have chosen I was only saying so to M Murphy a little while since As it was just possible that your taste did not lie that way I have thought of another arrangement for you A person who has a large tract of property at Algiers will give me up for you one of the extensive farms he holds in that country The lands belonging to it are very fertile and in full bearing but I will not conceal from you this estate is situated on the boundaries of the Atlas mountains that is near the outposts and exposed to the frequent attacks of the Arabs and one must be as much of a soldier as a husbandman it is at the same time a redoubt and a farm The man who occupies this dwelling in the absence of the proprietor will explain everything to you they say he is honest and faithful and you may retain him there as long as you like Once established there you will not only increase your means by your labour and ability but render a real service to your country by your courage The colonists have formed a militia and the extent of your property the number of your tenants who will depend on you will make you the chief of a very considerable troop Headed by your courage this band may be extremely useful in protecting the properties which are throughout the plain I repeat to you that this prospect for you would please me very much in spite of or rather in consequence of the danger because you could at the same time display your natural intrepidity and because having thus expiated and as I may say ransomed yourself from a great crime your restitution to society would be more noble more complete more heroic if it were worked out in the midst of perils in an unconquered clime than in the midst of the quiet inhabitants of a little town If I did not first offer you this it was because it was probable that the other would suit you and the latter is so hazardous that I would not expose you to it without giving you the choice There is still time and if this proposition for Algiers does not suit you tell me so frankly and we will look out for something else if not to morrow everything shall be signed and you will start for Algiers with a person commissioned by the former proprietor of the farm to put you in full possession Two years rent will be due and paid to you on your arrival The land yields three thousand francs a year work improve it be active vigilant and you will soon increase your comfort and the security of the colonists whom you will aid and assist I am sure for you will always be charitable and generous and remember too to be rich implies that we should give much away Although separated from you I shall not lose sight of you and never forget that I and my best friend owe our lives to you The only proof of attachment and gratitude I ask is to learn to write and read as quickly as you can that you may inform me regularly once a week what you do and to address yourself to me direct if you need any advice or assistance It is useless to describe the extreme delight of the Chourineur His disposition his instincts are already sufficiently known to the reader so that he may understand that no proposal could have been made more acceptable to him Next day all was arranged and the Chourineur set out for Algiers CHAPTER XXI RESEARCHES The house which Rodolph had in the Allee des Veuves was not his usual place of residence he lived in one of the largest mansions in the Faubourg saint Germain situated at the end of the Rue Plumet and the Boulevard des Invalides To avoid the honours due to his sovereign rank the prince had preserved his incognito since his arrival in Paris his charge d affaires at the court of France having announced that his master would pay his official and indispensable visits under the name and title of the Count de Duren Thanks to this usage a very common one in the Northern courts a prince may travel with as much liberty as pleasure and escape all the bore of ceremonious introductions In spite of his slight incognito Rodolph kept up in his mansion full state and etiquette We will introduce the reader into the hotel of the Rue Plumet the day after the Chourineur had started for Algiers The clock had just struck ten A M In the middle of a large salon on the ground floor and which formed the antechamber to Rodolph s business chamber Murphy was seated before a bureau and sealing several despatches A groom of the chambers dressed in black and wearing a silver chain around his neck opened the folding doors and announced His Excellency M le Baron de Grauen Murphy without ceasing from his employment received the baron with a nod at once cordial and familiar M le Charge d Affaires said he smiling will you warm yourself at the fire I will be at your service in one moment M the Private Secretary I await your leisure replied M de Grauen gaily and making with mock respect a low and respectful bow to the worthy squire The baron was about fifty years of age with hair gray thin and lightly curled and powdered His chin rather projecting was partly concealed in a high cravat of white muslin starched very stiffly and of unimpeachable whiteness His countenance was expressive of great intelligence and his carriage was distingue whilst beneath his gold spectacles there beamed an eye as shrewd as it was penetrating Although it was only ten o clock in the morning M de Grauen wore a black coat that was etiquette and a riband shot with several bright colours was suspended from his buttonhole He placed his hat on a chair and took his station near the fireplace whilst Murphy continued his work His royal highness no doubt was up the best part of the night my dear Murphy for your correspondence appears considerable Monseigneur went to bed at six o clock this morning He wrote amongst other letters one of eight pages to the Grand Marshal and dictated to me one equally long to the Chief of the Upper Council the Prince Herkhauesen Oldenzaal his royal highness s cousin You know that his son Prince Henry has entered as lieutenant in the guards in the service of his Majesty the Emperor of Austria Yes monseigneur recommended him most warmly as his relation and he really is a fine excellent young man handsome as an angel and as good as gold The fact is my dear Murphy that if the young Prince Henry had had his entree to the grand ducal abbey of Ste Hermenegilde of which his aunt is the superior the poor nuns Baron baron why My dear sir the air of Paris But let us talk seriously Shall I await the rising of his royal highness to communicate all the particulars which I have procured No my dear baron Monseigneur has desired that he should not be called before two or three o clock in the afternoon he desires also that you send off this morning these despatches by a special courier instead of waiting till Monday You will entrust me with all the particulars you have acquired and I will communicate them to monseigneur when he wakes These are his orders Nothing can be better and I think his royal highness will be satisfied with what I have collected But my dear Murphy I hope the despatch of the special courier is not a bad sign the last despatches which I had the honour of sending to his royal highness Announced that all was going on well at home and it is precisely because my lord is desirous of expressing as early as possible his entire satisfaction that he wishes a courier to be despatched this very day to Prince Herkhauesen Oldenzaal Chief of the Supreme Council That is so like his royal highness were it to blame instead of commend he would observe less haste Nothing new has transpired with us my dear baron nothing at all Our mysterious adventures Are wholly unknown You know that since the arrival of his royal highness in Paris his friends have become used to see him but little in public it is understood that he prefers seclusion and is in the habit of making frequent excursions to the environs of Paris and with the exception of the Countess Sarah Macgregor and her brother no person is aware of the disguises assumed by his royal highness and neither of the personages I have mentioned have the smallest interest in betraying the secret Ah my dear baron exclaimed Murphy heaving a deep sigh what an unfortunate thing it is that this accursed countess should be left a widow at this very important moment She was married I think in eighteen twenty seven or eighteen twenty eight In eighteen twenty seven shortly after the death of the unfortunate child who would now be in her sixteenth or seventeenth year and whose loss his royal highness seems daily more to deplore Far more so indeed than he appears to feel for the loss of his legitimate offspring And thus my dear baron we may account for the deep interest his royal highness takes in the poor Goualeuse arising as it does from the fact that the daughter so deeply deplored would had she lived have been precisely the same age as this unfortunate young creature It is indeed an unfortunate affair that the Countess Sarah from whom we fancied we were for ever freed should have become a widow exactly eighteen months after his royal highness had been deprived by death of the wife with whom he had passed years of wedded happiness The countess I am persuaded looks upon this double freedom from all marriage vows as a signal intervention of Providence to further her views And her impetuous passion has become more ardent than ever though she is well aware that my lord feels for her the deepest aversion and well merited contempt Was not her culpable indifference the cause of her child s death Did she not cause Ah baron said Murphy leaving the sentence unfinished this woman is our evil genius God grant she may not reappear amongst us laden with fresh misfortunes But still under present circumstances any views Countess Sarah may entertain must be absurd in the greatest degree the death of the unfortunate child you just now alluded to has broken the last tie which might have attached my lord to this dangerous woman She must be mad as well as foolish to persist in so hopeless a pursuit If she be mad there is a dangerous method in her madness her brother you are aware partakes of her ambitious schemes and obstinate opinions of ultimate success Although this worthy pair have as much reason for utter despair as they had eighteen years since of entire success Eighteen years What an accumulation of evil has been wrought during that period by the criminal compliance of that rascally Polidori By the way talking of that miserable wretch I have traced that he was here about a year or two ago suffering no doubt from the most perfect destitution or else subsisting by disgraceful and dishonourable practices What a pity that a man so largely endowed with penetration talent deep learning and natural intelligence should sink so low The innate perversity of his character marred all these high qualities It is to be hoped he and the countess will not meet the junction of two such evil spirits is indeed to be feared for what frightful consequences might there not result from it Now touching the facts you have been collecting have you them about you Here said the baron drawing a paper from his pocket are the various particulars I have been enabled to collect touching the birth of a young girl known as La Goualeuse and also of the now residence of an individual called Francois Germain son of the Schoolmaster Be kind enough to read me the result of your inquiries my dear De Grauen I am well aware what are his royal highness s intentions in the matter I shall be able to judge then whether the information you possess will be sufficient to enable him to carry them into effect You have every reason to be satisfied with the agent you employ I suppose Oh he is a rare fellow so precise methodical zealous and intelligent I am indeed sometimes obliged to moderate his energy for I am well aware there are certain points the clearing up of which his highness reserves for himself And of course your agent is far from suspecting the deep interest his royal highness has in the matter Entirely so My diplomatic position affords an excellent pretext for the inquiries I have undertaken M Badinot for such is the name of the person I am speaking of is a sharp shrewd individual having connections either recognised or concealed in every grade of society He was formerly a lawyer but compelled to quit his profession from some very serious breach of trust he has however retained very accurate recollections touching the fortunes and situations of his old clients he knows many a secret which he boasts with considerable effrontery of having turned to a good account By turns rich and poor now successful and then a ruined man he only ceased his speculations when none could be found to take part in them with him reduced to live from day to day by expedients more or less illegal he became a curious specimen of the Figaro school so long as his interest was concerned he would devote himself soul and body to his employer and we are sure of his fidelity for the simple reason that he has nothing to gain though a great deal to lose by deceiving us and besides I make him careful of our interests even unknown to himself The particulars he has hitherto furnished us with have been very correct and satisfactory Oh he has a very straightforward manner of going to work And I assure you my dear Murphy that M Badinot is the very original type of one of those mysterious existences which are to be met with and only possible in Paris He would greatly amuse his royal highness if it were not necessary to avoid their being known to each other in this business You can augment the pay of M Badinot if you deem it necessary Why really five hundred francs a month and his expenses amounting to nearly the same sum appear to me quite sufficient we shall see by and by And does he not seem ashamed of the part he plays On the contrary he is not a little vain of his employment and when he brings me any particulars assumes a certain air of importance he would fain pass off as due to his diplomatic functions for the fellow either thinks or feigns to do so that he is deeply engaged in state affairs and ventures to observe at times in a sort of undertone how very marvellous it is that such close and intimate relationship should be found to exist between every day events and the destinies of kingdoms Yes really he had the impudence to remark to me the other day What complicated machinery is contained in the grand machine of state affairs Who would think now M le Baron those little humble notes collected by me will have their part to play in directing and regulating the affairs of Europe Yes yes rascals generally seek to veil their mean and base practices beneath some high sounding pretext But the notes you are to give me my dear baron have you them with you Here they are drawn up precisely from the accounts furnished by M Badinot Pray let me hear them I am all attention M de Grauen then read as follows Note relative to Fleur de Marie About the beginning of the year eighteen twenty seven a man named Pierre Tournemine then under sentence in the galleys at Rochefort for forgery proposed to a woman named Gervais but also known as La Chouette to take perpetual charge of a little girl then between five and six years of age for a sum of one thousand francs paid down The bargain being concluded the child was delivered over to the woman with whom she remained two years when unable longer to endure the cruelty shown her the little girl disappeared nor did the Chouette hear anything of her for several years when she unexpectedly met with her at a small public house in the Cite nearly seven weeks ago The infant now grown into a young woman then bore the appellation of La Goualeuse A few days previously to this meeting the above mentioned Tournemine who had become acquainted with the Schoolmaster at the galleys of Rochefort had sent to Bras Rouge the regular though concealed correspondent of every rogue and felon either in prison or out of it a lengthened detail of every particular relative to the child formerly confided to the woman Gervais otherwise the Chouette From this account and the declarations of the Chouette it appeared that one Madame Seraphin housekeeper to a notary named Jacques Ferrand had in eighteen twenty seven instructed Tournemine to find a person who for the sum of one thousand francs would be willing to take the entire charge of a child of from five to six years of age whom it was desired to get rid of as has before been mentioned The Chouette accepted the proposition and received both the child and the stipulated sum of money The aim of Tournemine in addressing these particulars to Bras Rouge was to enable the latter to extort money from Madame Seraphin whom Tournemine considered but as the agent of a third party under a threat of revealing the whole affair unless well paid for silence Bras Rouge entrusted the Chouette long the established partner in all the Schoolmaster s schemes of villainy and this explains how so important a document found its way to that monster s possession and also accounts for the expression used by the Chouette at her rencontre with the Goualeuse in the cabaret of the White Rabbit when by way of tormenting her victim she said We have found out all about your parents but you shall never know who or what they are The point to be decided was as to the veracity of the circumstances detailed by Tournemine in his letter to the Chouette It has been ascertained that Madame Seraphin and the notary Jacques Ferrand are both living the address of the latter is Rue du Sentier No forty one where he passes for a person of pious and austere life at least he is constant in his attendance at church his attention to his professional duties close and severe though some accuse him of following up the severity of the law with unnecessary rigour In his mode of living he observes a parsimony bordering on avarice Madame Seraphin still resides with him as manager of his household and M Jacques Ferrand spite of his original poverty has invested thirty five thousand francs in the funds the greatest part of this sum having been supplied to him through a M Charles Robert a superior officer of the National Guard a young and handsome man in high repute with a certain class of society Tis true that some ill natured persons are found to assert that owing either to fortunate speculations or lucky hits upon the Stock Exchange undertaken in partnership with the above mentioned Charles Robert the worthy notary could now well afford to pay back the original loan with high interest but the rigidly austere and self denying life of this worthy man gives a flat denial to all such gossiping reports and spite of the incredulity with which he is occasionally listened to he persists in styling himself a man struggling for a maintenance There can be no manner of doubt but that Madame Seraphin this worthy gentleman s housekeeper could if she pleased throw an entire light upon every circumstance connected with La Goualeuse Bravo my dear baron exclaimed Murphy nothing can be better These declarations of Tournemine carry with them an appearance of truth and it seems more than probable that we may through Jacques Ferrand obtain the right clue to discovering the parents of this unfortunate girl Now tell me have you been equally successful in the information collected touching the son of the Schoolmaster Perhaps as regards him I am not furnished with such minute particulars but upon the whole I think the result of our inquiries very satisfactory Upon my word your M Badinot is a downright treasure You see Bras Rouge is the hinge upon which everything turns M Badinot who has several acquaintances in the police pointed him out to us as the go between of several notorious felons and knew the man directly he was set to discover what had become of the ill fated son of Madame Georges Duresnel the unfortunate wife of this atrocious Schoolmaster And it was in going to search for Bras Rouge in his den in the Cite Rue aux Feves No thirteen that my lord fell in with the Chourineur and La Goualeuse His royal highness hoped too that the opportunity now before him of visiting these abodes of vice and wretchedness might afford him the means of rescuing some unfortunate being from the depths of guilt and misery His benevolent anticipations were gratified but at what risk it is painful even to remember Whatever dangers attended the scheme you at least my dear Murphy bravely bore your share in them Was not I for that very purpose appointed charcoal man in waiting upon his royal highness replied the squire smilingly Say rather his intrepid body guard my worthy friend But to touch upon your courage and devotion is only to repeat what every one knows I will therefore spare your modesty and continue my relation Here are the various particulars we have been able to glean concerning Francois Germain son of Madame Georges and the Schoolmaster properly called Duresnel About eighteen months since a young man named Francois Germain arrived in Paris from Nantes where he had been employed in the banking house of Noel and company It seems both from the confession of the Schoolmaster as well as from several letters found upon him that the scoundrel to whom he had entrusted his unfortunate offspring for the purpose of perverting his young mind and rendering him one day a worthy assistant to his unprincipled father in his nefarious schemes proposed to the young man to join in a plot for robbing his employers as well as to forge upon the firm to a considerable amount This proposition was received by the youth with well merited indignation but unwilling to denounce the man by whom he had been brought up he first communicated anonymously to his master the designs projected against the bank and then privately quitted Nantes that he might avoid the rage and fury of those whose sinful practices his soul sickened and shuddered to think of far less to bear the idea of participating in These wretches aware that they had betrayed themselves to the young man and dreading the use he might make of his information immediately upon finding he had quitted Nantes followed him to Paris with the most sinister intentions of silencing him for ever After long and persevering inquiries they succeeded in discovering his address but happily for the persecuted object of their search he had a few days previously encountered the villain who had first sought to corrupt his principles and well divining the motive which had brought him to Paris lost no time in changing his abode and so for this time the Schoolmaster s hapless son escaped his pursuers Still however following up the scent they succeeded in tracing the youth to his fresh abode seventeen Rue du Temple One evening however he narrowly escaped falling into an ambush laid for him the Schoolmaster concealed this circumstance from my lord but again Providence befriended him and he escaped though too much alarmed to remain in his lodgings he once more changed his abode since which time all traces of him have been lost And matters had reached thus far when the Schoolmaster received the just punishment of his crimes since which period by order of my lord fresh inquiries have been instituted of which the following is the result Francois Germain lived for about three months at No seventeen Rue du Temple a house rendered worthy of observation by the habits and ingenious practices of its inhabitants Germain was a great favourite among them by reason of his kind and amiable disposition as well as for the frank gaiety of his temper Although his means of livelihood appeared very slender yet he had rendered the most generous assistance to an indigent family occupying the garrets of the house In vain has been every inquiry made in the Rue du Temple touching the present residence of Francois Germain or the profession he was supposed to follow every one in the house believed him to be employed in some counting house or office as he went out early in the morning and never returned till late in the evening The only person who really knows the present residence of the young man is a female lodging in the house No seventeen Rue du Temple a young and pretty grisette named Rigolette between whom and Germain a very close acquaintance appears to have existed She occupies the adjoining room to that which Germain tenanted and which chamber by the by is still vacant and it was under pretext of inquiring about it that these particulars were obtained Rigolette exclaimed Murphy after having been for several minutes apparently in deep thought Yes I am sure I know her You Sir Walter Murphy replied the baron much amused You most worthy and respectable father of a family you know anything of pretty grisettes And so the name of Mlle Rigolette is familiar to you is it Fie fie Oh positively I am ashamed of you Pon my soul my lord compelled me to have so many strange acquaintances that such a mere trifle as this should pass for nothing But wait a bit Yes now I recollect perfectly that when my lord was relating the history of La Goualeuse I could not help laughing at the very odd name of Rigolette which as far as I can call to mind was the name of a prison acquaintance of that poor Fleur de Marie Well then just at this particular juncture Mlle Rigolette may be of the utmost service to us Let me conclude my report There might possibly be an advantage in engaging the vacant chamber recently belonging to Germain in the Rue du Temple We have no instructions to proceed further in our investigations but from some words which escaped the porteress there is every reason to believe that not only would it be possible to find in this house certain indications of where the Schoolmaster s son may be heard of through the means of Mlle Rigolette but the house itself would afford my lord an opportunity of studying human nature amid wants difficulties and misery the very existence of which he is far from suspecting Thus you see my dear Murphy said M de Grauen finishing his report and presenting it to his companion you see evidently that it is from the notary Jacques Ferrand we must hope to obtain information respecting the parentage of La Goualeuse and that we must go to Mlle Rigolette to trace the dwelling of Francois Germain It seems to me a great point to have ascertained the direction in which to search Undoubtedly baron you are quite right and besides I am sure my lord will find a fine field for observation in the house of which you speak But I have not yet done with you Have you made any inquiries respecting the Marquis d Harville I have and so far as concerns money matters his royal highness s fears are wholly unfounded M Badinot affirms and he is very likely to be well informed on the subject that the fortune of the marquis has never been in a more prosperous condition or better managed Why after having in vain exhausted every other conjecture as to the secret grief which is preying upon M d Harville my lord imagined that it was just probable the marquis had some pecuniary difficulties had it proved so he would have removed them with that delicate assumption of mystery you know he so frequently employs to veil his munificence But since even this conjecture has failed he must abandon all hope of guessing the enigma and this he will do the more reluctantly as his great desire to discover it arose out of his ardent friendship for M d Harville A friendship which is founded on a grateful recollection of the important services rendered by the marquis s father to his own parent Are you aware my dear Murphy that at the remodelling of the States in eighteen fifteen at the Germanic confederation the father of his royal highness had a chance of being excluded from his well known attachment to Napoleon Thanks to the friendship with which the Emperor Alexander honoured him the deceased Marquis d Harville was enabled to render most effectual service to the father of our patron The emperor whose warm regard for the late marquis had taken its date from the period of that nobleman s emigration to Russia exerted his powerful influence in congress so successfully that at the grand meeting to decide the destinies of the princes of Germany the father of our noble employer was reinstated in all his pristine rights As for the friendship now subsisting between the present marquis and his royal highness I believe it commenced when as mere boys they met together on a visit paid by the then reigning grand duke to the late Marquis d Harville So I have heard and they appear to have retained a most lively recollection of this happy period of their youth Nor is this all I have to say on the subject of the interest our noble master takes in every matter concerning the house of D Harville So profound is his gratitude for the services rendered to his father that all bearing the honoured name of D Harville or belonging to the family possess a powerful claim on the kindness of the prince Thus not alone to her virtues or her misfortunes does poor Madame Georges owe the increasing and unwearied goodness of my lord Madame Georges exclaimed the astounded baron What the wife of Duresnel the felon known as the Schoolmaster And the mother of Francois Germain the youth we are seeking for and whom I trust we shall find Is the relation of M d Harville She was his mother s cousin and her most intimate friend the old marquis entertained the most perfect friendship and esteem for Madame Georges But how for heaven s sake my dear Murphy did it ever come about that the D Harville family ever permitted a descendant of theirs to marry such a monster as this Duresnel Why thus it was The father of this unfortunate woman was a M de Lagny who previous to the Revolution possessed considerable property in Languedoc and who having fortunately escaped the proscription so fatal to many availed himself of the first tranquillity which succeeded these days of discord and anarchy to establish his only daughter in marriage Among the various candidates for the hand of the young heiress was this Duresnel the representative of a wealthy and respectable family possessing powerful parliamentary influence and concealing the depravity of his disposition beneath the most specious exterior To this man was Mlle de Lagny united by desire of her father but a very short time sufficed to strip the mask from his vicious character and to display his natural propensities A gambler a spendthrift and profligate addicted to the lowest vices that can disgrace a human being he quickly dissipated not only his own fortune but that of his wife also Even the estate to which Madame Georges Duresnel had retired was involved in the general ruin occasioned by her worthless husband s passion for play and his dissolute mode of life and the unfortunate woman would have been left without a shelter for herself or infant son but for the kind affection of her relation the Marquise d Harville whom she loved with the tenderness of a sister With this valued friend Madame Duresnel found a welcome home while her wretched husband finding himself utterly ruined plunged into the blackest crimes and stopped at no means however guilty and desperate to supply his pleasures He became the associate of thieves murderers pickpockets and forgers and ere long falling into the hands of the law was sentenced to the galleys for the term of his natural life Yet while suffering the just punishment of his crimes his base mind devised the double atrocity of tearing the child from its miserable mother for the sake of breaking down every good principle it might have imbibed and of training it up in vicious readiness to join his future schemes of villainy You know the rest After the condemnation of her husband Madame Georges without giving any reason for so doing quitted the Marquise d Harville and went to hide her shame and her sorrows in Paris where she soon fell into the utmost distress It would occupy too much time to tell you by what train of events my lord became aware of the misfortunes of this excellent woman as well as the ties which connect her with the D Harville family it is sufficient that he came most opportunely and generously to her assistance induced her to quit Paris and establish herself at the farm at Bouqueval where she now is with the Goualeuse In this peaceful retreat she has found tranquillity if not happiness and the overlooking and management of the farm may serve to recreate her thoughts and prevent them from dwelling too deeply on her past sorrows As much to spare the almost morbid sensibility of Madame Georges as because he dislikes to blazon forth his good deeds my lord has not even acquainted M d Harville with the fact of his having relieved his kinswoman from such severe distress I comprehend now the twofold interest which my lord has in desiring to discover the traces of the son of this poor woman You may also judge by that my dear baron of the affection which his royal highness bears to the whole family and how deep is his vexation at seeing the young marquis so sad with so many reasons to be happy What can there be wanting to M d Harville He unites all birth fortune wit youth his wife is charming and as prudent as she is lovely True and his royal highness only had recourse to the inquiries we have been talking over after having in vain endeavoured to penetrate the cause of M d Harville s deep melancholy he showed himself deeply affected by the kind attentions of monseigneur but still has been entirely reserved on the subject of his low spirits It may be some peine de coeur Yet it is said that he is excessively fond of his wife and she does not give him the least cause for jealousy I often meet her in society and although she is constantly surrounded by admirers as every young and lovely woman is still her reputation is unsullied The marquis is always speaking of her in the highest terms he has had however one little discussion with her on the subject of the Countess Sarah Macgregor Has she then seen her By a most unlucky chance the father of the Marquis d Harville knew Sarah Seyton of Halsburg and her brother Tom seventeen or eighteen years ago during their residence in Paris and when they were much noticed by the lady of the English ambassador Learning that the brother and sister were going into Germany the old marquis gave them letters of introduction to the father of our noble lord with whom he kept up a constant correspondence Alas my dear De Grauen perhaps but for these introductions many misfortunes would have been avoided for then monseigneur would not have known this woman When the Countess Sarah returned hither knowing the friendship of his royal highness for the marquis she presented herself at the Hotel d Harville in the hope of meeting monseigneur for she shows as much pertinacity in pursuing him as he evinces resolution to avoid her Only imagine her disguising herself in male attire and following him into the Cite No woman but she would have dreamt of such a thing She perhaps hoped by such a step to touch his royal highness and compel him to an interview which he has always refused and avoided To return to Madame d Harville her husband to whom monseigneur has spoken of Sarah as she deserved has begged his wife to see her as seldom as possible but the young marquise seduced by the hypocritical flatteries of the countess has gone somewhat counter to the marquis s request Some trifling differences have arisen but not of sufficient importance to cause or explain the extreme dejection of the marquis Oh the women the women My dear Murphy I am very sorry that Madame d Harville should have formed any acquaintance with this Sarah So young and charming a woman must suffer by the contact with such an infernal Talking of infernal creatures said Murphy here is a communication relative to Cecily the unworthy spouse of the excellent David Between ourselves my dear Murphy this audacious metisse nine well deserves the terrible punishment that her husband our dear black doctor has inflicted on the Schoolmaster by monseigneur s order She has also shed blood and her unblushing infamy is astounding nine The Creole issue of a white and quadroon slave The metisses only differ from the whites by some peculiarities hardly perceptible Yet she is so very handsome so seductive A perverted mind within an attractive outside always inspires me with twofold disgust In this sense Cecily is doubly hateful But I hope that this despatch annuls the last orders issued by monseigneur with regard to this wretched creature On the contrary baron My lord then desires that her escape from the fortress in which she had been shut up for life may be effected Yes And that her pretended ravisher should bring her to France to Paris Yes and besides this despatch orders the arrangement to be carried out as soon as possible and that Cecily be made to travel hither so speedily that she may arrive here in a fortnight I am lost in astonishment Monseigneur has always evinced such a horror of her And that horror he still experiences if possible stronger than ever And yet he causes her to be sent to him To be sure it will always be easy to apprehend Cecily again if she does not carry out what he requires of her Orders are given to the son of the gaoler of the fortress of Gerolstein to carry her off as if he were enamoured of her and every facility will be given to him for effecting this purpose Overjoyed at this opportunity of escaping the metisse will follow her supposed ravisher and reach Paris then she will always have her sentence of condemnation hanging over her always be but an escaped prisoner and I shall be always ready when it shall please his royal highness to desire again to lay hands upon and incarcerate her I should tell you my dear baron that when David learned from monseigneur of the proposed arrival of Cecily he was absolutely petrified and exclaimed I hope that your royal highness will not compel me to see the monster Make yourself easy replied monseigneur you shall not see her but I may require her services for a particular purpose David felt relieved of an enormous weight off his mind Nevertheless I am sure that some very painful reminiscences were awakened in his mind Poor negro he loves her still They say too that she is yet so lovely Charming too charming It requires the pitiless eye of a creole to detect the mixed blood in the all but imperceptible shade which lightly tinges her rosy finger nails Our fresh and hale beauties of the North have not a more transparent complexion nor a skin of more dazzling whiteness I was in France when monseigneur returned from America accompanied by David and Cecily and I know that that excellent man was from that time attached to his royal highness by ties of the strongest gratitude but I never learned how he became attached to the service of our master and how he had married Cecily whom I saw for the first time about a year after his marriage and God knows the scandal that followed I can tell you every particular that you may wish to learn my dear baron I accompanied monseigneur in his voyage to America when he rescued David and the metisse from the most awful fate You are always most kind my dear Murphy and I am all attention said the baron CHAPTER XXII HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY mister Willis a rich American planter settled in Florida said Murphy had discovered in one of his young black slaves named David 
7239-63500-0000	train-other-500	who was employed in the infirmary attached to his dwelling a very remarkable degree of intelligence combined with a constant and deep commiseration for the sick poor to whom he gave with the utmost attention and care the medicine ordered by the doctors
7239-63500-0001	train-other-500	and moreover so strong a prepossession for the study of botany as applied to medicine that without any tuition he had composed and classified a sort of flora of the plants around the dwelling and the vicinity
7239-63500-0002	train-other-500	The establishment of mister Willis situated on the borders of the sea was fifteen or twenty leagues from the nearest town and the medical men of the district ignorant as they were gave themselves
7239-63500-0003	train-other-500	no great deal of care or trouble in consequence of the long distance and the difficulty in procuring any means of conveyance Desirous of remedying so extreme an inconvenience in a country subject to violent epidemics
7239-63500-0004	train-other-500	and to have at hand at all times a skilful practitioner the colonist made up his mind to send David to France to learn surgery and medicine
none	none	 Enchanted at this offer the young black set out for Paris 
7239-63500-0005	train-other-500	and the planter paid all the expenses of his course of study
none	none	 David having for eight years studied with great diligence and remarkable effect 
7239-63500-0006	train-other-500	received the degree of surgeon and physician with the most distinguished success and then returned to America to place himself and his skill under the direction of his master
7239-63500-0007	train-other-500	But David ought to have considered himself free and emancipated in fact and in law when he set foot in France David s loyalty is very rare he had promised mister Willis to return and he did so
7239-63500-0008	train-other-500	He did not consider as his own the instruction which he had acquired with his master s money and besides he hoped to improve morally as well as physically the sufferings of the slaves his former companions he trusted to become not only their doctor
none	none	 but their firm friend and defender with the colonist He must indeed be imbued with the most unflinching probity and the most intense love for his fellow creatures to return to a master an owner after having spent eight years in the midst of the society of the most democratic young men in Europe Judge of the man by this one trait Well he returned to Florida and truth to tell was used by mister Willis with consideration and kindness eating at his table sleeping under his roof But this colonist was as stupid malevolent selfish and despotic as most creoles are and he thought himself very generous in giving David six hundred francs twenty four l a year salary At the end of some months a terrible typhus fever broke out in the plantation mister Willis was attacked by it 
7239-63500-0009	train-other-500	but soon restored through the careful attentions and efficacious remedies of David Out of thirty negroes dangerously affected by this fatal disease only two perished mister Willis
7239-63500-0010	train-other-500	much gratified by the services which David had so auspiciously rendered
none	none	 raised his wages to twelve hundred francs 
7239-63500-0011	train-other-500	to the extreme gratification of the black doctor whose fellows regarded him as a divinity amongst them for he had with much difficulty it is true obtained from their master some few indulgences and was hoping to procure still more
7239-63500-0012	train-other-500	In the meanwhile he consoled these poor people and exhorted them to patience spake to them of God who watches over the black and the white man with an equal eye of another world not peopled with masters and slaves
7239-63500-0013	train-other-500	but with the just and the unjust of another life in eternity where man was no longer the beast of burden the property the thing of his fellow man but where the victims of this world were so happy that they prayed in heaven for their tormentors
none	none	 What shall I tell you more 
7239-63500-0014	train-other-500	To those unhappy wretches who contrary to other men count with bitter joy the hours which bring them nearer to the tomb to those unfortunate creatures who looked forward only to nothingness hereafter
7239-63500-0015	train-other-500	David breathed the language and the hope of a free and happy immortality
none	none	 and then their chains appeared less heavy and their toil less irksome 
7239-63500-0016	train-other-500	He was their idol A year passed away in this manner
none	none	 Amongst the handsomest of the female slaves at the house 
7239-63500-0017	train-other-500	was a metisse about fifteen years of age named Cecily and for this poor girl mister Willis took a fancy For the first time in his life his advances were repulsed and obstinately resisted Cecily was in love
7239-63500-0018	train-other-500	and with David who during the late fearful distemper had attended her with the most vigilant care Afterwards a deep and mutual love repaid him the debt of gratitude David s taste
7239-63500-0019	train-other-500	was too refined to allow him to boast of his happiness before the time when he should marry Cecily which was to be when she had turned her sixteenth year mister Willis ignorant of their love had thrown his handkerchief right royally at the pretty metisse
7239-63500-0020	train-other-500	and she in deep despair sought David and told him all the brutal attempts that she had been subjected to and with difficulty escaped The black comforted her and instantly went to mister Willis to request her hand in marriage
none	none	 Diable my dear Murphy I can easily surmise the answer of the American sultan 
7239-63500-0021	train-other-500	he refused He did He said he had an inclination for the girl himself that in his life before he had never experienced the repulse of a slave he meant to possess her and he would
7239-63500-0022	train-other-500	David might choose another wife or mistress whichsoever might best suit his inclination
none	none	 there were in the plantation ten capusses or metisses 
7239-63500-0023	train-other-500	as pretty as Cecily David talked of his love love so long and tenderly shared and the planter shrugged his shoulders David urged but it was all in vain
7239-63500-0024	train-other-500	The creole had the cool impudence to tell him that it was a bad example to see a master concede to a slave
none	none	 and that he would not set that example to satisfy a caprice of David s 
7239-63500-0025	train-other-500	He entreated supplicated and his master lost his temper David blushing to humiliate himself further spake in a firm tone of his services and disinterestedness
7239-63500-0026	train-other-500	that he had been contented with a very slender salary mister Willis was desperately enraged and telling him he was a contumacious slave threatened him with the chain David replied with a few bitter and violent words
7239-63500-0027	train-other-500	and two hours afterwards bound to a stake his skin was torn with the lash whilst they bore Cecily to the harem of the planter in his sight The conduct of the planter was brutal and horrible it was adding absurdity to cruelty
7239-63500-0028	train-other-500	for he must after that have required the man s services Precisely so for that very day the very fury into which he had worked himself joined to the drunkenness in which the brute indulged every evening
7239-63500-0029	train-other-500	brought on an inflammatory attack of the most dangerous description the symptoms of which appeared with the rapidity peculiar to such affections The planter was carried to his bed
none	none	 in a state of the highest fever 
7239-63500-0030	train-other-500	He sent off an express for a doctor but he could not reach his abode in less than six and thirty hours Really this attack seems providential The desperate condition of the man was quite deserved by him
7239-63500-0031	train-other-500	The malady made fearful strides David only could save the colonist but Willis distrustful as all evil doers are imagined that the black would revenge himself
none	none	 by administering poison 
7239-63500-0032	train-other-500	for after having scourged him with a rod he had thrown him into prison At last horrified at the progress of his illness broken down by bodily anguish and thinking that as death also stared him in the face
7239-63500-0033	train-other-500	he had one chance left in trusting to the generosity of his slave after many distrusting doubts Willis ordered David to be unchained And David saved the planter For five days and five nights
7239-63500-0034	train-other-500	he watched and tended him as if he had been his father counteracting the disease step by step with great skill and perfect knowledge until at last he succeeded in defeating it to the extreme surprise of the doctor who had been sent for
7239-63500-0035	train-other-500	and who did not arrive until the second day And when restored to health at last the colonist Not desiring to blush before his own slave whose presence constantly oppressed him with the recollection of his excessive nobleness of conduct
none	none	 the colonist made an enormous sacrifice to attach the doctor he had sent for to his establishment and David was again conducted to his dungeon 
7239-63500-0036	train-other-500	Horrible but by no means astonishing David must have been in the eyes of his brutal master a complete living remorse Such conduct was dictated alike by revenge and jealousy
none	none	 The blacks of mister Willis loved David with all the warmth of gratitude 
7239-63500-0037	train-other-500	for he had saved them body and soul They knew the care he had bestowed on him when he lay tossing with fever between life and death and shaking off the deadening apathy which ordinarily besets slavery
7239-63500-0038	train-other-500	these unfortunate creatures evinced their indignation or rather grief most powerfully when they saw David lacerated by the whip mister Willis deeply exasperated affected to discover in this manifestation the appearance of revolt
7239-63500-0039	train-other-500	and when he considered the influence which David had acquired over the slaves he believed him capable of placing himself at the head of a rebellion to avenge himself of his wrongs This fear was another motive with the colonist
7239-63500-0040	train-other-500	for using David in the most shameful manner and entirely preventing him from effecting the malicious designs of which he suspected him Considering him as actuated by an irrepressible amount of terror
7239-63500-0041	train-other-500	this conduct seems less stupid but quite as ferocious A short time after these events we arrived in America Monseigneur had freighted a Danish brig at saint Thomas s and we visited incognito all the settlements of the American coast
7239-63500-0042	train-other-500	along which we were sailing We were most hospitably received by mister Willis who the evening after our arrival after he had been drinking and as much from the excitement of wine as from a desire to boast told us in a horrid tone of brutal jesting
7239-63500-0043	train-other-500	the history of David and Cecily I forgot to say that after having maltreated the girl he had thrown her into a dungeon also as a punishment for her disdain of him His royal highness on hearing Willis s fearful narration
none	none	 thought the man was either drunk or a liar but he was drunk it was no lie To remove any and all doubt the colonist rose from the table and desired a slave to bear a lantern and conduct us to David s cell 
7239-63500-0044	train-other-500	Well what followed In my life I never saw so distressing a spectacle Pale wan meagre half naked and covered with wounds David and the unhappy girl chained by the middle of the body
none	none	 one at one end and the other at the other end of the dungeon 
7239-63500-0045	train-other-500	looked like spectres The lantern that lighted us threw over this scene a still more ghastly hue David did not utter a word when he saw us his gaze was fixed and fearful
7239-63500-0046	train-other-500	The colonist said to him with cruel irony Well doctor how goes it You who are so clever why don t you cure yourself The black replied by a noble word and a dignified gesture he raised his right hand slowly
7239-63500-0047	train-other-500	his forefinger pointed to the roof and without looking at the colonist said in a solemn tone God and then was silent God replied the planter bursting into a loud fit of laughter tell him then
7239-63500-0048	train-other-500	tell God to come and snatch you from my power I defy him Then Willis overcome by fury and intoxication shook his fist to heaven and said in blasphemous language Yes I defy God to carry off my slaves before they are dead
7239-63500-0049	train-other-500	The man was mad as well as brutal We were utterly disgusted Monseigneur did not say a word and we left the cell This dungeon was situated as well as the house on the seashore
7239-63500-0050	train-other-500	We returned to our brig which was moored a short distance off and at one o clock in the morning when all in the building were plunged in profound sleep monseigneur went on shore with eight men well armed and going straight to the prison
7239-63500-0051	train-other-500	burst open the doors and freed David and Cecily The two victims were carried on board so quietly that they were not perceived and then monseigneur and I went to the planter s house Strange contrast
7239-63500-0052	train-other-500	These men torture their slaves and yet do not take any precaution against them but sleep with doors and windows open We easily got access to the sleeping room of the planter which was lighted on the inside by a small glass lamp
none	none	 Monseigneur awakened the man 
7239-63500-0053	train-other-500	who sat upright in his bed his brain still disturbed by the effect of his drunkenness You have to night defied God to carry off your two victims before their death and he has taken them said monseigneur
7239-63500-0054	train-other-500	Then taking a bag which I carried
none	none	 and which contained twenty five thousand francs in gold 
7239-63500-0055	train-other-500	he threw it on the fellow s bed and added
none	none	 This will indemnify you for the loss of your two slaves to your violence that destroys 
7239-63500-0056	train-other-500	I oppose a violence that saves God will judge between us We then retreated leaving mister Willis stupefied motionless and believing himself under the influence of a dream
7239-63500-0057	train-other-500	A few minutes later we were again on board the brig which instantly set sail It appears to me my dear Murphy
none	none	 that his royal highness overpaid this wretch for the loss of his slaves 
7239-63500-0058	train-other-500	for in fact David no longer belonged to him We calculated as nearly as we could the expense which his studies had cost for eight years and then the price thrice over of himself and Cecily as slaves
7239-63500-0059	train-other-500	Our conduct was contrary to the rights of property I know but if you had seen in what a horrible state we found this unfortunate and half dead couple if you had heard the sacrilegious defiance
none	none	 almost cast in the face of the Almighty by this man 
7239-63500-0060	train-other-500	drunk with wine and ferocity you would comprehend how monseigneur desired as he said on this occasion to act as it were in behalf of Providence
7239-63500-0061	train-other-500	All this is as assailable and as justifiable as the punishment of the Schoolmaster my worthy squire And had not this adventure any consequences It could not
none	none	 The brig was under Danish colours 
7239-63500-0062	train-other-500	the incognito of his royal highness was closely kept we were taken for rich Englishmen To whom could Willis have addressed his complaints if he had any to make In fact he had told us himself
7239-63500-0063	train-other-500	and the medical man of monseigneur declared it in a proces verbal that the two slaves could not have lived eight days longer in this frightful dungeon It required the greatest possible care to snatch David and Cecily from almost certain death
none	none	 At last they were restored to life 
7239-63500-0064	train-other-500	From this period David has been attached to the suite of monseigneur as a medical man and is most devotedly attached to him David married Cecily of course on arriving in Europe This marriage
7239-63500-0065	train-other-500	which ought to have been followed by results so happy took place in the chapel of the palace of monseigneur but by a most extraordinary revulsion of conduct hardly was she in the full enjoyment of an unhoped for position
7239-63500-0066	train-other-500	when forgetting all that David had suffered for her and what she had suffered for him blushing in the new world to be wedded to a black Cecily seduced by a man of most depraved morals committed her first fault
none	none	 It would seem as though the natural perversity of this abandoned woman 
7239-63500-0067	train-other-500	having till then slumbered was suddenly awakened and developed itself with fearful energy You know the rest and all the scandal of the adventures that followed After having been two years a wife David
7239-63500-0068	train-other-500	whose confidence in her was only equalled by his love
none	none	 learned the full extent of her infamy a thunderbolt aroused him from his blind security 
7239-63500-0069	train-other-500	They say he tried to kill his wife Yes but through the interference of monseigneur
none	none	 he consented to allow her to be immured for life in a prison and it is thence that monseigneur now seeks to have her released to your great astonishment as well as mine 
7239-63500-0070	train-other-500	my dear baron But it is growing late and his royal highness is anxious that your courier should start for Gerolstein with as little delay as possible In two hours time he shall be on the road
7239-63500-0071	train-other-500	So now my dear Murphy farewell till the evening Till the evening adieu Have you then forgotten that there is a grand ball at the Embassy and that his royal highness will be present
7239-63500-0072	train-other-500	True I have always forgotten that since the absence of Colonel Verner
none	none	 and the Count d Harneim 
7239-63500-0073	train-other-500	I have the honour to fulfil the functions of chamberlain and aide de camp
none	none	 Ah apropos of the count and the colonel 
7239-63500-0074	train-other-500	when may we expect their return Will they have soon completed their respective missions You know that monseigneur will keep them away as long as possible that he may enjoy more solitude and liberty
7239-63500-0075	train-other-500	As to the errand on which his royal highness has employed each of them as an ostensible motive for getting rid of them in a quiet way sending one to Avignon and the other to Strasbourg I will tell you all about it some day
7239-63500-0076	train-other-500	when we are both in a dull mood for I will defy the most hypochondriacal person in existence not to burst with laughter at the narrative as well as with certain passages in the despatches of these worthy gentlemen
7239-63500-0077	train-other-500	who have assumed their pretended missions with so serious an air To tell the truth I have never clearly understood why his royal highness attached the colonel and the count to his private person
7239-63500-0078	train-other-500	Why my dear fellow
none	none	 is not Colonel Verner the accurate type of military perfection 
7239-63500-0079	train-other-500	Is there in the whole Germanic confederation a more elegant figure more flourishing and splendid moustaches and a more complete military figure And when he is fully decorated screwed in
7239-63500-0080	train-other-500	uniformed gold laced plumed et cetera et cetera it is impossible to see a more glorious self satisfied proud handsome animal True but it is his very good looks that prevent him
none	none	 from having the appearance of a man of refined and acute intellect 
7239-63500-0081	train-other-500	Well and monseigneur says that thanks to the colonel he is in the habit of finding even the dullest people in the world bearable Before certain audiences which are of necessity
none	none	 he shuts himself up with the colonel for a half hour or so and then leaves him full of spirits and light as air 
7239-63500-0082	train-other-500	quite ready to meet bores and defy them Just as the Roman soldier who before a forced march used to sole his sandals with lead and so found all fatigue light by leaving them off I now discover the usefulness of the colonel
none	none	 But the Count d Harneim 
7239-63500-0083	train-other-500	Is also very serviceable to our dear lord for always hearing at his side the tinkling of this old cracked bell shining and chattering continually seeing this soap bubble so puffed up with nothingness
7239-63500-0084	train-other-500	so magnificently variegated and as such portraying the theatrical and puerile phase of sovereign power his royal highness feels the more sensibly the vanity of those barren pomps and glories of the world
7239-63500-0085	train-other-500	and by contrast has often derived the most serious and happy ideas from the contemplation of his useless and pattering chamberlain Well well but let us be just my dear Murphy
7239-63500-0086	train-other-500	tell me in what court in the world would you find a more perfect model of a chamberlain
none	none	 Who knows better than dear old D Harneim 
7239-63500-0087	train-other-500	the numberless rules and strict observances of etiquette Who bears with more becoming demeanour an enamelled cross around his neck or more majestically comports himself
7239-63500-0088	train-other-500	when the keys of office are suspended from his shoulders Apropos baron monseigneur declares that the shoulders of a chamberlain have a peculiar physiognomy
none	none	 that is he says 
7239-63500-0089	train-other-500	an appearance at once constrained and repulsive which it is painful to look at for alas and alackaday it is at the back of a chamberlain that the symbol of his office glitters and as monseigneur avers
none	none	 the worthy D Harneim always seems 
7239-63500-0090	train-other-500	tempted to present himself backwards that his importance may at once be seen felt and acknowledged The fact is that the incessant subject of the count s meditations is to ascertain
7239-63500-0091	train-other-500	by what fatal imagination and direction the chamberlain s key has been placed behind the chamberlain s back for it is related of him that he said with his accustomed good sense and with a kind of bitter grief
7239-63500-0092	train-other-500	What the devil one does not open a door with one s back at all events Baron the courier the courier said Murphy pointing to the clock
none	none	 Sad old reprobate to make me chatter thus It is your fault Present my respects to his royal highness said M de Grauen 
7239-63500-0093	train-other-500	taking his hat up in haste
none	none	 And now adieu till the evening my dear Murphy Till the evening my dear baron fare thee well It will be late before we meet for I am sure that monseigneur will go this very day to pay a visit to the mysterious house in the Rue du Temple CHAPTER XXIII A HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE In order to profit by the particulars furnished by Baron de Grauen respecting La Goualeuse and Germain the Schoolmaster s son it became necessary for Rodolph to visit the house in the Rue du Temple formerly the abode of that young man whose retreat the prince likewise hoped to discover through the intervention of Mlle Rigolette Although prepared to find it a difficult task inasmuch as it was more than probable if the grisette were really sufficiently in Germain s confidence to be aware of his present abode she also knew too well his anxiety to conceal it to be likely to give the desired information By renting the chamber lately occupied by the young man Rodolph besides being on the spot to follow up his researches considered he should also be enabled to observe closely the different individuals inhabiting the rest of the house The same day on which the conversation passed between the Baron de Grauen and Murphy Rodolph plainly and unpretendingly dressed wended his way about three o clock on a gloomy November afternoon towards the Rue du Temple Situated in a district of much business and dense population the house in question had nothing remarkable in its appearance it was composed of a ground floor occupied by a man keeping a low sort of dram shop and four upper stories surmounted by attics A dark and narrow alley led to a small yard or rather a species of square well of about five or six feet in width completely destitute of either air or light and serving as a pestilential receptacle for all the filth thrown by the various occupants of the respective chambers from the unglazed sashes with which each landing place was provided At the bottom of a damp dismal looking staircase a glimmering light indicated the porter s residence rendered smoky and dingy by the constant burning of a lamp requisite even at midday to enlighten the gloomy hole into which Rodolph entered for the purpose of asking leave to view the apartment then vacant A lamp placed behind a glass globe filled with water served as a reflector and by its light might be seen at the far end of the lodge as in courtesy it was styled a bed covered with a sort of patchwork counterpane exhibiting a mingled mass of every known colour and material A walnut tree table graced the side of the room bearing a variety of articles suited to the taste and ornamental notions of its owners First in order appeared a little waxen Saint John with a very fat lamb at his feet and a large peruke of flowing white curls on his head the whole enclosed in a cracked glass case the joinings of which were ingeniously secured by slips of blue paper secondly a pair of old plated candlesticks tarnished by time and bearing instead of lights two gilded oranges doubtless an offering to the porteress on the last New Year s day and thirdly two boxes the one composed of variegated straw the other covered with multitudinous shells but both smelling strongly of the galleys or house of correction ten let us hope for the sake of the morality of the porteress in the Rue du Temple that these precious specimens were not presented to her from the original owners and fabricators of them and lastly between the two boxes and just beneath a circular clock was suspended a pair of red morocco dress boots small enough for the feet of fairies but elaborately and skilfully designed and completed This chef d oeuvre as the ancient masters of the craft would style them joined to the fantastic designs sketched on the walls representing boots and shoes abundantly indicated that the porter of this establishment devoted his time and his talents to the repairing of shoes and shoe leather ten These boxes were the exclusive manufacture of the criminals confined either in the galleys or prisons and who spent nearly all their spare hours in making them At the instant when Rodolph ventured into the smoky den M Pipelet the porter temporarily absent had left his better half Madame Pipelet as his representative This individual was seated by the stove in the centre of the lodge deeply engrossed in watching the boiling of a pot placed over it The description of Madame Pipelet may be given in a few words She was the most ugly forbidding wrinkled toothless old hag one might meet in the course of a long life Her dress was dirty tawdry and untidy while her head dress was composed of a Brutus wig originally of a blond colour but changed by time into every shade of red brown and yellow the stiff ends of the perished hair standing out like the ears of wheat in a wheat sheaf Much did Madame Pipelet pride herself upon this tasteful covering to her sexagenarian skull nor was it believed she ever laid it aside whether sleeping or waking At the sight of Rodolph the porteress inquired in a surly tone Well and pray what do you want I believe madame replied Rodolph laying a profound emphasis on the word madame I believe there is an apartment to be let in this house The deep respect implied in his voice and words somewhat mollified the porteress who answered rather less sourly Illustration This Individual Was Seated by the Stove Original Etching by Adrian Marcel Yes there is a room to let on the fourth floor but you cannot see it now Alfred has gone out You are speaking of your son I presume madame may I take the liberty of asking whether he is expected in shortly I am not speaking of my son but my husband I suppose there is no act of parliament why my Pipelet should not be called Alfred Is there pray None certainly madame that I am aware of but with your kind permission I will await his return I am very desirous of taking the vacant chamber both the street and neighbourhood suit me and the admirable order in which the house seems kept pleases me excessively But previously to viewing the lodging I am anxious to take I should be very glad to ascertain whether you madame could do me the favour to take the management of my little housekeeping off my hands I never like to have any one about me but the authorised housekeeper belonging to the house when such arrangements meet with their approbation This proposition so flatteringly expressed and the word housekeeper completely won Madame Pipelet who replied With the greatest of pleasure sir I will attend to all you require I am sure I shall be proud to wait upon such a gentleman and for the small charge of six francs a month you shall be treated like a prince Then for six francs a month I may reckon upon your valuable services Will you permit me to ask your name Pomona Fortunata Anastasia Pipelet Well then Madame Pipelet having agreed as to your own terms will you be pleased to tell me those for the apartment I wish to engage With the adjoining small closet one hundred and fifty francs a month not a farthing less The principal lessee is a screw a regular skinflint What is his name M Bras Rouge This name and the remembrances so unexpectedly presented by it made Rodolph start I think Madame Pipelet you were saying that the principal lessee of the house is M Bras Rouge And he lives Rue aux Feves No thirteen He also keeps an estaminet near the Champs Elysees All doubt was then at an end it was the Bras Rouge of infamous notoriety and singular indeed did the circumstance of thus coming across him strike Rodolph But though M Bras Rouge is your principal lessee he is not I presume the owner of the house may I ask who is M Bourdon but I have never had communication with any one besides M Bras Rouge With the design of still further ingratiating himself with the porteress Rodolph resumed My dear madame this cold day would make a little of something warm and comfortable very acceptable Might I venture to solicit the favour of your stepping as far as the spirit shop kept so conveniently at hand and bring a bottle of cassia and two glasses For I feel very tired and the cold has quite seized me Stay madame we will have three glasses if you please because I hope your husband will join us when he returns So saying he placed a franc in the fat dirty hand of the porteress Ah monsieur you are determined to make us all fall in love with you cried Madame Pipelet nodding her approval of the commission and thereby sending the flush of pleasure into a face glowing with all the fiery honours of an excited Bacchante To be sure There is nothing like a drop of really good cordial such a day as this and they do keep most excellent here at hand I ll go of course I will but I shall only bring a couple of glasses for Alfred and I always drink out of the same glass Poor old darling he is so very nice and particular in showing all those sort of delicate attentions to women Then go along my good Madame Pipelet and we will wait till Alfred comes But then suppose any one wants me whilst I am out who will mind the lodge Oh I ll take care of the lodge The old woman departed on her agreeable errand At the termination of a few minutes the postman tapped at the lodge window and putting his hand into the apartment presented two letters merely saying Three sous Six sous you mean for two letters replied Rodolph One is free answered the man Having paid and dismissed the postman Rodolph mechanically examined the two letters thus committed to his charge but at a further glance they seemed to him worthy a more attentive observation The epistle addressed to Madame Pipelet exhaled through its hot pressed envelope a strong odour of Russia leather it bore on a seal of red wax the initials C R surmounted by a helmet and supported by a cross of the Legion of Honour The direction was written in a firm bold hand The heraldic device of the commingled casque and cross made Rodolph smile and confirmed him in the idea that the writer of the letter in question was not a female Who was this scented emblazoned correspondent of old Anastasia Pipelet Rodolph felt an undefinable curiosity to know The other epistle written upon coarse and common paper was united only by a common wafer pricked over with the point of a pin and was addressed to M Cesar Bradamanti Operating Dentist Evidently disguised the superscription was entirely composed of capital letters Whether founded on a true or false presage this letter seemed to Rodolph to wear a mournful look as though evil or misery were contained within its shabby folds He perceived that some of the letters in the direction were fainter than the others and that the paper there seemed a little rumpled a tear had evidently fallen upon it Madame Pipelet returned bearing the bottle of cassia and two glasses I have dawdled have I not monsieur said she gaily But let you once get into that good Pere Joseph s shop and it is hard work to get out again Oh that old man is a very insinuating Here madame interrupted Rodolph here are two letters the postman left while you were gone Dear me Two letters Pray excuse me monsieur I suppose you paid for them I did You are very good I tell you what then we will settle that out of the first money you have to pay me how much was it Three sous answered Rodolph much amused at the ingenious method of reimbursement employed by Madame Pipelet But may I without offence observe that one of the letters is addressed to you and that you possess in the writer a correspondent whose billets doux are marvellously well perfumed Let us see what it is about said the porteress taking the epistle in the scented envelope Yes upon my word it is scented up like a real billet doux Now I should very much like to know who would dare write me a love letter He must be a villain And suppose it had fallen into your husband s hands Madame Pipelet Oh for goodness sake don t mention that or I shall faint away in your arms But how stupid I am Now I know all about it replied the fat porteress shrugging her shoulders To be sure to be sure it comes from the Commandant Lord bless me what a fright I have had for Alfred is as jealous as a Turk Here is another letter addressed to M Cesar Bradamanti Ah to be sure the dentist on the third floor I will put it in the letter boot Rodolph fancied he had not caught the right words but to his astonishment he saw Madame Pipelet gravely throw the letter alluded to into an old top boot hanging up against the wall He looked at her with surprise Do you mean said he at length to put the gentleman s letter in Oh yes that is all right replied the porteress I have put it in the letter boot there you see So now nobody s letters can be mislaid and when the different lodgers return home Alfred or myself turns the boot upside down we sort them out and everybody gets his own So saying the porteress proceeded to break the seal of the letter addressed to her which having done she turned it round and round looked at it in every direction then after a short appearance of embarrassment and uncertainty she said to Rodolph Alfred generally reads my letters for me because I do not happen to be able to read them myself perhaps you would not mind just looking over this for me With the utmost pleasure quickly replied Rodolph curious to dive into the mysteries of who Madame Pipelet s correspondent might be and forthwith he read what follows written upon hot pressed paper stamped in its right hand corner with the helmet the letters C R the heraldic supporters and the cross of honour To morrow Friday about eleven o clock let there be a good not an overfierce fire lighted in both rooms have everything well dusted and remove the coverings from the furniture taking especial care not to scratch the gilding or to soil or burn the carpet while lighting the fires If I should not be in about one o clock when a lady will arrive in a hackney coach and inquire for me by the name of M Charles let her be shown up to the apartment after which the key is to be taken down stairs again and kept till my arrival Spite of the want of finished composition displayed in this billet Rodolph perfectly comprehended to whom and what it alluded and merely added after perusing it Who lives on the first floor then The old woman placed her yellow shrivelled finger upon her pendulous lip and replied by a half malicious grin Hush There is a woman in the way silence Oh my dear Madame Pipelet I merely asked because before living in a house one likes to know a little Yes yes Of course everybody likes to know all they can that is all fair enough and I am sure I have no objection to tell you all I know myself and that is but very little Well but to begin About six weeks ago a carpet maker came here to look at the first floor which was then to let and to ask the price and other particulars about it Next day he came again accompanied by a young man of fair complexion small moustaches and wearing a cross of honour and very fine linen The carpet maker called him commandant A military man I suppose said Rodolph Military exclaimed Madame Pipelet with a chuckle Not he Why Alfred might as well call himself porter to a prince How so Why he is only in the National Guard The carpet maker only called him commandant to flatter him just the same as it tickles up Alfred s vanity to be styled concierge instead of porter So when the commandant that is the only name we know him by had looked over the rooms he said to the upholsterer his friend Well I think the place will do for me just see the landlord and arrange all about it Yes commandant says the other And the very next day the upholsterer man signed the lease with M Bras Rouge in his own name mind you and further paid six months in advance because he said the gentleman did not wish to be bored about references And such a power of fine furniture as was sent into the first floor Sophesus sarcophagus curtains all silk glasses set in gold and everything you can mention all beautiful enough to astonish you just for all the world like one of them grand cafes on the Boulevards As for the carpets oh you never trod on the like of them I ll be bound Put your foot on them and you d fancy you was stepping on velvet and take it off again for fear of spoiling it When everything was completed the commandant came to look at it just to see if he could find out anything more he wanted but he could not So then he spoke to Alfred and says he Could you take charge of my rooms and keep them in nice order light fires from time to time and get them ready for me when I wish to occupy them I shall not be here often says he and would always write you a line before coming to give you time to prepare them Yes commandant I can answers my flatterer of an Alfred And what shall you charge Twenty francs a month commandant Twenty francs exclaimed the commandant Why porter you are jesting surely And hereupon he began bating Alfred down in the most shabby manner trying to squeeze poor people like us out of two or three miserable francs when he had been squandering thousands in fitting up his grand apartments which after all he did not mean to live in However after a deal of battling we got twelve francs a month out of him a paltry pitiful two farthing captain What a difference now between you and him added the porteress addressing Rodolph with an admiring glance You don t call yourself fine names and titles you only look like a plain body you must be poor or you would not perch yourself on the fourth floor and yet you agreed with me for six francs without attempting to bate me down And when did the commandant pay you his next visit I ll tell you and good fun it is too My gentleman must have been nicely choused by somebody Three times did he write same as to day ordering us to light a fire and have everything ready for the reception of a lady he expected would come Come Yes I daresay he may expect a long time first I rather think Nobody came then Listen The first time the commandant arrived strutting and swelling like a turkey cock humming and singing after his manner all the gay tunes of the day walking up and down his fine room with his hands stuck in his pockets and occasionally stopping to arrange his hair before the glass we were watching him all the time Well this went on for two or three hours when I suppose he knew it was no use waiting any longer so he came down stairs very softly and with quite a different manner to the pride and consequence he had marched up with By way of teasing him Pipelet and I went out to him and said Commandant there has been no lady whatever to inquire for you Very well Very well exclaimed he half mad and half ashamed of being laughed at and buttoning up his coat he walked off as fast as he could The next time before he came himself a small note was brought here by a man directed to M Charles I strongly suspected he was done again and Pipelet and me were enjoying a hearty good laugh over it when the commandant arrived Captain says I putting the back of my hand up to my wig by way of military salute here is a letter for you but I am afraid it contains news of a second countermarch against you He looked at me sour as a crab snatched the letter from my hand read it turned scarlet as a boiled lobster then walked off pretending to whistle but he was finely vexed ready to hang himself I could see he was and it was rare nuts to me Go and swallow that pill my two farthing captain says I to myself that serves you right for only giving twelve francs a month for minding your apartments And the third time Ah the third time I really thought it was all right The commandant arrived more stuck up with pride than ever his eyes staring with self satisfied admiration at himself and the certainty of not being disappointed this time Let me tell the truth about him he really is a good looking man and dresses well though he stinks of musk like a civet cat Well there was my gentleman arrayed in all his finery and scarcely condescending to look at us poor folks he seemed as though he conferred a favour on the earth by deigning to walk on it and went sticking his nose into the air as if he meant to touch the clouds with it He took the key and said to us as he passed up stairs in a jeering self complacent tone as though to revenge himself for having been laughed at twice before You will direct the lady to my apartments when she comes Well Pipelet and I were so anxious to see the lady he expected though we did not much reckon upon her keeping her appointment even if she ever made one that we went and hid ourselves behind the little door that belongs to the alley and behold in a short time a blue hackney coach with its blinds drawn down stopped at the entrance to the house There she is says I to Alfred There is his madame let s keep back a bit for fear we frighten her away The coachman got off his box and opened the door Then we saw a female closely covered with a black veil and carrying a muff she had apparently been crying for she kept her handkerchief to her face for when the steps were let down instead of alighting she said some few words to the driver who much surprised shut the door up again Then the lady did not get out No she threw herself back in the coach and pressed her handkerchief tightly to her eyes I rushed out and before the coachman had time to get on his seat again I called out Hallo there coachy are you going back again Yes says he Where says I Where I came from answers he And where did you come from asks I again From the Rue saint Dominique corner of the Rue Belle Chasse Rodolph started at these words His dearest friend the Marquis d Harville who as elsewhere stated had been for some time labouring under a deep melancholy none could penetrate lived in the very place just mentioned by Madame Pipelet Could this mysterious female in the blue fiacre be the Marquise d Harville And was it from the lightness and frivolity of her conduct that the mind of her excellent husband was bowed down by doubts and misgivings These painful suggestions crowded on Rodolph s mind but although well acquainted with all the various guests received by the marquise he could recollect no one answering the description of the commandant added to which any female might have taken a hackney coach from that spot without necessarily living in the street There was really nothing to identify the unknown of the blue fiacre with Madame d Harville and yet a thousand vague fears and painful suspicions crossed his mind his uneasy manner and deep abstraction did not escape the porteress What are you thinking of sir asked she at length I was wondering what could have induced the lady after coming to the very door to change her mind so suddenly There is no saying some sudden thought dread or fear for we poor women are but weak cowardly things said the porteress assuming a timid frightened manner Well I think if it had been myself now coming secretly to visit Alfred I should have had to try back a great many times before I could have screwed up my courage to venture in But then as for visiting your great dons in this kind of way I never could have done such a thing No never I am sure there is nobody under the face of heaven can say I ever give them the least freedom I should think not indeed while my poor dear old darling of a husband is left No doubt no doubt Madame Pipelet but about the young person you were describing in the blue fiacre Oh mind I don t know whether she was young or old I could not even catch a glimpse of the tip of her nose all I can say is she went as she came and that is all about it As for Alfred and me we were better pleased than if we had found ten francs Why so By enjoying the rage and confusion of the commandant when he found himself a third time disappointed but instead of going and telling him at once that his madame had been and gone we allowed him to fume and fret for a whole hour Then I went softly up stairs with only my list slippers on I reached his door which I found half shut as I pushed against it it creaked the staircase is as black as night and the entrance to the apartment quite as obscure Scarcely had I crept into the room when the commandant caught me in his arms saying in a languishing voice My dearest angel what makes you so late Spite of the serious nature of the thoughts crowding upon his mind Rodolph could not restrain a smile as he surveyed the grotesque periwig and hideously wrinkled carbuncled visage of the heroine of this comic scene Madame Pipelet however resumed her narration with a mirthful chuckle that increased her ugliness That was a go wasn t it But stop a bit Well I did not make the least reply but almost keeping in my breath I waited to see what would be the end of this strange reception For a minute or two the commandant kept hugging me up then all of a sudden the brute pushed me away exclaiming with as much disgust as though he had touched a toad Who the devil are you Me commandant the porteress Madame Pipelet and as such I will thank you to keep your hands off my waist and not to call me your angel and scold me for being late Suppose Alfred had heard you a pretty business we should have made of it What the deuce brings you here cried he Merely to let you know the lady in the hackney coach has just arrived Well then you stupid old fool show her up directly Did I not tell you to do so Yes commandant you said I was to show her up Then why do you not obey me Because the lady Speak out woman if you can The lady has gone again Something you have said or done then to offend her I am sure roared he in a perfect fury Not at all commandant The lady did not alight but when the coach stopped and the driver opened the door she desired him to take her back to where she came from The vehicle cannot have got far by this time exclaimed the commandant hastening towards the door It has been gone upwards of an hour answered I enjoying his fury and disappointment An hour an hour and what in the devil s name hindered you from letting me know this sooner Because commandant Alfred and I thought we would spare you as long as we could the tidings of this third breakdown which we fancied might be too much for you Come thinks I there is something to make you remember flinging me out of your arms as though it made you sick to touch me Begone bawled out the commandant You hideous old hag You can neither say nor do the thing that is right and with this he pulled off his dressing gown and threw his beautiful Greek cap made of velvet embroidered with gold on the ground it was a real shame for the cap was a downright beauty and as for the dressing gown oh my it would set anybody longing Meanwhile the commandant kept pacing the room with his eyes glaring like a wild beast and glowing like two glow worms But were you not afraid of losing his employ He knew too well what he was about for that we had him in a fix we knew where his madame lived and had he said anything to us we should have threatened to expose the whole affair And who do you think for his beggarly twelve francs would have undertaken to attend to his rooms a stranger No That we would have prevented we would soon have made the place too hot to hold any person he might appoint poor shabby fellow that he is What do you think He actually had the meanness to examine his wood and put out the quantity he should allow to be burnt while he was away He is nothing but an upstart I am sure a nobody who has suddenly tumbled into money he does not know how to spend properly a rich man s head and a beggar s body who squanders with one hand and nips and pinches with the other I do not wish him any harm but it amuses me immensely to think how he has been befooled and he will go on believing and expecting from day to day because he is too vain to imagine he is being laughed at At any rate if the lady ever comes in reality I will let my friend the oyster woman next door know she enjoys a joke as well as I do and is quite as curious as myself to find out what sort of person she is whether fair or dark pretty or plain And who knows this woman may be cheating some easygoing simpleton of a husband for the sake of our two penny halfpenny of a commandant Well that is no concern of mine but I am sorry too for the poor dear deceived individual whoever he may be Dear me Dear me My pot is boiling over excuse me a minute I must just look to it Ah it is time Alfred was in for dinner is quite ready and tripe you know should never be kept waiting This tripe is done to a turn Do you prefer the thick or thin tripe Alfred likes it thick The poor darling has been sadly out of spirits lately and I got this dainty dish to cheer him up a bit for as Alfred says himself that for a bribe of good thick tripe he would betray France itself his beloved France Yes the dear old pet would change his country for such fine fat tripe as this he would While Madame Pipelet was thus delivering her domestic harangue upon the virtues of tripe and the powerful influence it possessed over even the patriotism of her husband Rodolph was buried in the deepest and most sombre reflections The female whose visits to the house had just been detailed be she the Marquise d Harville or any other individual had evidently long struggled with her imprudence ere she had brought herself to grant a first and second rendezvous and then terrified at the probable consequences of her imprudence a salutary remorse had in all probability prevented her from fulfilling her dangerous engagement It might be that the fine person this M Charles was described as possessing had captivated the senses of Madame d Harville whom Rodolph knew well as a woman of deep feeling high intellect and superior taste of an elevated turn of mind and a reputation unsullied by the faintest breath of slander After long and mature consideration he succeeded in persuading himself that the wife of his friend had nothing to do with the unknown female in the blue fiacre Madame Pipelet having completed her culinary arrangements resumed her conversation with Rodolph And who lives on the second floor inquired he of the porteress Why Mother Burette does a most wonderful woman at fortune telling bless you she can read in your hand the same as a book and many quite first rate people come to her to have the cards consulted when they are anxious about any particular matter She earns her weight in gold and that is not a trifle for she is a rare bundle of an old body However telling fortunes is only one of her means of gaining a livelihood Why what does she do besides She keeps what you would call a pawnbroker s shop upon a small scale I see your second floor lodger lends out again the money she derives from her skill in foretelling events by reading the cards Exactly so only she is cheaper and more easy to deal with than the regular pawnbrokers she does not confuse you with a heap of paper tickets and duplicates nothing of the sort Now suppose Some one brings Mother Burette a shirt worth three francs well she lends ten sous upon condition of being paid twenty at the end of the week otherwise she keeps the shirt for ever That is simple enough is it not Always in round figures you see a child could understand it And the odd things she has brought her as pledges you would scarcely believe You can hardly guess what she sometimes is asked to lend upon I saw her once advance money upon a gray parrot that swore like a trooper the blackguard did A parrot But to what amount did she advance money I ll tell you the parrot was well known it belonged to a Madame Herbelot the widow of a factor living close by and it was also well understood that Madame Herbelot valued the parrot as much as she did her life Well Mother Burette said to her I will lend you ten francs on your bird but if by this day week at twelve o clock I do not receive twenty francs with interest it would amount to that in round numbers if I am not paid my twenty francs with the expenses of his keep I shall give your Polly a trifling dose of arsenic mixed with his food She knew her customer well bless you However by this threat Mother Burette received her twenty francs at the end of seven days and Madame Herbelot got back her disagreeable screaming parrot Mother Burette has no other way of living besides the two you have named I suppose Not that I know of I don t know however what to say of some rather sly and secret transactions carried on in a small room she never allows any one to enter except M Bras Rouge and an old one eyed woman called La Chouette Rodolph opened his eyes with unmixed astonishment as these names sounded on his ear and the porteress interpreting the surprise of her future lodger according to her own notions said That name would make any one stare with astonishment Certainly La Chouette is uncommonly odd is it not It is indeed Does the woman who is so styled come here frequently We saw her the day before yesterday for the first time these six weeks She was rather lame I observed And what do you suppose she wants with the fortune telling woman That I do not know at least as to what takes place in the little room I was telling you of where La Chouette alone is admitted with M Bras Rouge and Mother Burette I have however particularly observed that on those occasions the one eyed woman always has a large bundle with her in her basket and that M Bras Rouge also carries a parcel of some size beneath his cloak and that they always return empty handed And what can these packets contain The Lord above knows for I don t only they kick up the devil s own row with them whatever they are And then such whiffs of sulphur charcoal and melted lead as you go up the stairs and blow blow blow like a smith s forge I verily believe Mother Burette has dealings with the old one and practises magic in this private apartment leastways that is what M Cesar Bradamanti our third floor lodger said to me A very clever individual is M Cesar When I say an individual I mean an Italian though he speaks as good French as you or me excepting his accent and that is nothing Oh he is very clever indeed knows all about physic and pulls out teeth not for the sake of the money but the honour of his profession yes really sir for downright honour Now suppose you had six decayed teeth and he says the same thing to all who choose to listen to him well then he will take out five for nothing and only charge you for the sixth Besides which he sells all manner of remedies for all sorts of complaints diseases of the lungs coughs colds every complaint you can name but then he makes his own drugs and he has for his assistant the son of our principal lessee little Tortillard He says that his master is going to buy himself a horse and a red coat and to sell his drugs in the market places and that young Tortillard is to be dressed like a page and be at the drum to attract customers This seems to me a very humble occupation for the son of your principal lessee Why his father says unless he gets a pretty strong hand over him and a tolerably powerful taste of whipcord in the way of a sound thrashing every now and then he is safe to come to the scaffold And he is about the ugliest most spiteful ill disposed young rascal one would wish to meet he has played more than one abominable trick upon poor M Cesar Bradamanti who is the best creature possible for he cured Alfred of a rheumatic attack and I promise you we have not forgotten it Yet there are some people wicked enough to But no I will not tell you it would make the hair of your head stand on end As Alfred says if it were true it would send him to the galleys Why what do they accuse him of Oh I really cannot tell you I can t indeed for it is so Then we will drop the subject And to say such things of a young man Upon my life and soul it is too bad Pray Madame Pipelet do not give yourself the trouble of saying any more about it let us speak of other matters Why I don t know but as you are to live in the house it is only fair and right to prepare you for any falsehoods you may hear I suppose you are sufficiently well off to make the acquaintance of M Cesar Bradamanti and unless you are put on your guard against these reports they might lead to your breaking off with him So just put your ear down and I ll whisper what it is people say about him And the old woman in a low tone muttered a few words as Rodolph inclined his head he started from her with mingled disgust and horror Impossible exclaimed he Surely human nature is not capable of such crimes Shocking Is it not But treat it as I do all scandal and lies What do you think the man who cured Alfred s rheumatism who draws five teeth out of six for nothing who has testimonies testimonials from every prince and king in the world and above all pays as he goes down on the nail would go for to do such things Not he I ll stake my blessed life upon it While Madame Pipelet thus vented her indignant opinion concerning the reports in circulation Rodolph recalled to his memory the letter he had seen addressed to the quack dentist he remembered the counterfeited writing and the coarse common paper stained with tears which had well nigh obliterated part of the address too well did he see in the mysterious grief stained epistle the opening of a drama of deep and fearful import and while these sad presages filled his mind a powerful impression whispered within him that the dreadful doings ascribed to the Italian were not altogether unfounded Oh I declare here comes Alfred exclaimed the porteress Now he will tell you his opinion of all these spiteful stories about poor M Bradamanti Bless you Alfred thinks him as innocent as a lamb ever since he cured his rheumatics M Pipelet entered the lodge with a grave magisterial air He was about sixty years of age comfortably fat with a large broad countenance strongly resembling in its cast and style the faces carved upon the far famed nutcrackers of Nuremberg a nose of more than ordinary proportions helping to complete the likeness An old and dingy looking hat with a very deep brim surmounted the whole Alfred who adhered to this upper ornament as tenaciously as his wife did to her Brutus wig was further attired in an ancient green coat with immense flaps turned up with grease if so might be described the bright and shiny patches of long accumulated dirt which had given an entirely different hue to some portions of the garment But though clad in a hat and coat esteemed by Pipelet and his wife as closely resembling full dress Alfred had not laid aside the modest emblem of his trade but from his waist uprose the buff coloured triangular front of his leathern apron partly concealing a waistcoat boasting nearly as great a variety of colours as did the patchwork counterpane of Madame Pipelet The porter s recognition of Rodolph as he entered was gracious in the extreme but alas he smiled a melancholy welcome and his countenance and languid air marked a man of secret sorrow Alfred said Madame Pipelet when she had introduced her two companions here is a gentleman after the apartment on the fourth floor and we have only been waiting for you to drink a glass of cordial he sent for This delicate attention won for Rodolph the entire trust and confidence of the melancholy porter who touching the brim of his hat said in a deep bass voice worthy of being employed in a cathedral We shall give the gentleman every satisfaction as porters and doubtless he will act the same by us as a lodger birds of a feather flock together as the proverb says Then interrupting himself M Pipelet anxiously added Providing sir you are not a painter No I am not a painter but a plain merchant s clerk My most humble duty to you sir I congratulate you that Nature did not make you one of those monsters called artists Artists monsters returned Rodolph Tell me pray why you style them so Instead of replying M Pipelet elevated his clasped hands towards the ceiling and allowed a heavy sound between a grunt and a groan to escape his overcharged breast You must know sir said Madame Pipelet in a low tone to Rodolph that painters have embittered Alfred s life they have worried my poor old dear almost out of his senses and made him half stupefied as you see him now Then speaking loud she added in a caressing tone Oh never mind the blackguard there s a dear but try and forget all about it or you will be ill and unable to eat the nice tripe I have got for your dinner Let us hope I shall have courage and firmness enough for all things replied M Pipelet with a dignified and resigned air but he has done me much harm he has been my persecutor almost my executioner long have I suffered but now I despise him Ah said he turning to Rodolph never allow a painter to enter your doors they are the plague the ruin the destruction of a house You have then had a painter lodging with you I presume Unhappily sir I did have one replied M Pipelet with much bitterness and that one named Cabrion Ah At the recollections brought back by this name the porter s declaration of courage and endurance utterly failed him and again his clenched fists were raised as though to invoke the vengeance he had so lately described himself as despising And was this individual the last occupant of the chamber I am about engaging inquired Rodolph No no The last lodger was an excellent young man named M Germain No this Cabrion had the room before he came Ah sir since Cabrion left he has all but driven me stark staring mad Did you then so much regret him asked Rodolph Regret him Regret Cabrion screamed the astounded porter why only imagine M Bras Rouge paid him two quarters rent to induce him to quit the place for unluckily he had taken his apartments for a term What a scamp he was You have no idea of the horrible tricks he played off upon all the lodgers as well as us Why just to give you one little proof of his villainy there was hardly a single wind instrument he did not make use of as a sort of annoyance to the lodgers from the French horn to the flageolet he made use of all and even carried his rascality so far as to play false and to keep blowing the same note for hours together it was enough to worry one out of one s senses Well I suppose there were upwards of twenty different petitions sent to our chief lessee M Bras Rouge to turn the beggar out and at last he was only got rid of by paying him two quarters rent rather droll is it not for a landlord to pay his lodger But bless you the house was so upset by him that he might have had any price so he would but take himself off however he did go And now you suppose we were clear of M Cabrion I ll tell you Next night about eleven o clock I was in bed when rap rap rap comes to the gate I pulls up the string somebody walks up to my door How do you do porter says a voice will you oblige me with a lock of your hair Somebody has mistaken the door says my wife So I calls out to the stranger You are wrong friend you want next door I think not returns the voice this is No seventeen is it not and the porter s name is Pipelet I m all right so please to open the door and oblige me with a lock of your beautiful hair My name is Pipelet certainly answers I Well then friend Pipelet Cabrion has sent me for a piece of your hair he says he must and he will have it As Pipelet uttered the last words he gave his head a mournful shake and folding his arms assumed an attitude of martyrlike resolution Do you perceive sir He sends to me his mortal enemy whom he overwhelmed with insults and continually outraged in every way to beg a lock of my hair a favour which even ladies have been known to refuse to a lover But supposing this Cabrion had been as good a lodger as was M Germain replied Rodolph with some difficulty preserving the gravity of countenance do you think you might have accorded him the favour Not to the best lodger that treads shoe leather would I grant a similar request replied the man in the flapped hat waving it majestically over his brows as he spoke it is contrary to my principles and habits to give my hair to any one only I should have refused with the most scrupulous regard to politeness That is not all chimed in the porteress Only conceive sir the abominable conduct of that Cabrion who from morning to night at all hours and at all times sends a swarm of vagabonds like himself to ask Alfred for a lock of his hair always for Cabrion Ah monsieur sighed out poor Pipelet had I committed the most atrocious crimes my sleep could not have been rendered more broken and unrefreshing scarcely do I fall into a doze than I wake starting with the idea of being called by that cursed Cabrion I suspect everybody in each person who approaches me I see an emissary from my persecutor come to request a lock of my hair I am losing my good spirits my temper and becoming gloomy suspicious peevish and ill natured This infernal Cabrion has murdered my whole life And Pipelet heaved so profound a sigh that his hat vibrating for some time from the consequences of the convulsive shake of the head occasioned thereby fell forward and completely veiled his care stricken features I can well understand now said Rodolph that you are not particularly partial to painters but I suppose the M Germain you were praising so highly made up for the bad treatment you received from M Cabrion Yes yes sir as I told you M Germain was a delightful young man so honourable and kind hearted open as the day and ever ready to serve and oblige he was cheerful and merry as need be but then he always kept his high spirits within proper bounds instead of worrying people to death by his unmeaning hoaxes like that Cabrion who I wish was at the devil Come come my good M Pipelet I must not let you thus excite yourself and who now is the person fortunate enough to possess such a pattern of a lodger as this M Germain seems to have been That is more than I can tell you no one knows whither he has gone nor are they likely except indeed through Mlle Rigolette And who is Mlle Rigolette demanded Rodolph Why she is a needlewoman also living on the fourth floor cried Madame Pipelet another pattern lodger always pays her rent in advance and keeps her little chamber so nice and clean then she is well behaved to every one so merry and happy like a bird though poor thing very like a caged bird obliged to work early and late to earn two francs a day and often not half that let her try ever so hard How does it happen that Mlle Rigolette should be the only person entrusted with the secret of M Germain s present abode Why when he was going away he came to us and said returned Madame Pipelet I do not expect any letters but if by chance any should come please to give them to Mlle Rigolette And she is well worthy of his confidence if his letters were filled with gold don t you think so Alfred The fact is said the porter in a severe tone that I know no harm of Mlle Rigolette excepting her permitting herself to be wheedled over by that vile scamp Cabrion But you know Alfred that nothing more than a few harmless attentions passed between them interrupted the porteress for though Mlle Rigolette is as merry as a kitten she is as prudent and correct as I am myself You should see the strong bolts she has inside her door and if her next door neighbour will make love to her that is not her fault it follows as a matter of course when people are so close to each other It was just the same with the travelling clerk we had here before Cabrion and so it was when M Germain took the room this abominable painter occupied So as I say there is no blame to Mlle Rigolette it arises out of the two rooms joining one another so closely naturally that brings about a little flirtation but nothing more So then it becomes a matter of course does it said Rodolph that every one who occupies the apartment I am to have should make love to Mlle Rigolette Why of course monsieur how can you be good neighbours without it don t you see Now imagine yourself lodging in the very next room to a nice pretty obliging young person like Mlle Rigolette well then young people will be young people sometimes you want a light sometimes a few live coals to kindle up your fire maybe a little water for one is sure always to find plenty of fresh spring water at Mlle Rigolette s she is never without it it is her only luxury she is like a little duck always dabbling in it and if she does happen to have a little leisure such a washing down of floors and cleaning of windows Never the least soil or neglect about either herself or her apartment and so you will find And so M Germain by reason of his close proximity to Mlle Rigolette became what you style upon perfectly neighbourly terms with her Oh bless you yes Why the two seemed cut out for each other so young and so good looking It was quite a pleasure to look at them as they came down stairs of a Sunday to take the only walk poor things they could afford themselves throughout the week she dressed in a smart little cap and a gown that cost probably not more than twenty five sous the ell but made by herself and that so tastily that it became her as much as though it had been of satin he mind ye dressed and looking like a regular gentleman And M Germain has not been to see Mlle Rigolette I suppose since he quitted the house No monsieur unless on Sunday for Mlle Rigolette has no time during the other six days of the week to think of sweethearting Why the poor girl rises at five or six o clock and works incessantly till ten or eleven o clock at night never once leaving her room except for a few minutes in the morning when she goes out to buy food for herself and her two canary birds and the three eat but very little just a penn orth of milk a little bread some chickweed bird seed and clear fresh water and the whole three of them sing away as merrily as though they fared ever so sumptuously And Mlle Rigolette is kind and charitable too as far as lies in her power that is to say she gives her time her sleep and her services for poor girl she can scarcely manage to keep herself by working closely for twelve hours a day Those poor unfortunate creatures in the attics whom M Bras Rouge is going to turn into the streets in two or three days time if even he wait so long why Mlle Rigolette and M Germain sat up with the children night after night You have a distressed family then here Distressed Oh God bless you my good sir I think we have indeed Why there are five young children an almost dying mother an idiotic grandmother and their only support a man who though he slaves like a negro cannot even get bread enough to eat and a capital workman he is too three hours sleep out of the twenty four is all he allows himself and what sleep it is broken by his children crying for food by the groans of his sick wife tossing on her miserable straw bed or the idiotic screams of the poor bedridden old grandmother who sometimes howls like a wolf from hunger too for poor creature she has not sense or reason to know better and when she gets very hungry you may hear cries and screams all down the staircase Horrible exclaimed Rodolph with a shudder and does no one afford them any assistance Truly sir we do all we can we are but poor ourselves however since the commandant has allowed me his paltry twelve francs a month for looking after his apartments I have managed once a week to make a little broth for these poor unfortunate creatures Mlle Rigolette deprives herself of her night s rest and sits up poor girl though it burns her candles contriving out of one bit and the other of her cutting out to make up a few clothes for the children sometimes from the morsels left of her work she manages a small nightcap or gown and M Germain who had not a franc more than he knew what to do with used to pretend from time to time that he had received a present of a few bottles of wine from his friends and Morel that is the name of the workman with the sick family was sure to be invited to share it with him and it was really wonderful to see how refreshed and strengthened poor Morel used to seem after M Germain had made him take a good pull at his wine to put as he used to say a little life and soul into his half exhausted body And the surgeon dentist what did he do for this wretched family M Bradamanti said the porter Ah he cured my rheumatism and I owe him my eternal gratitude but from that day I said to my wife Anastasia M Bradamanti hum hum did I not say so Anastasia Exactly that is precisely what you did say But I want to know what this M Bradamanti did to assist the poor starving beings in your garrets Why you see monsieur when I mentioned to M Bradamanti the misery and utter destitution of poor Morel by the way he first began the conversation by complaining that the raving and screaming of the old idiot woman throughout the night for food prevented him from sleeping and that he found it very unpleasant however he listened to my description of the state the whole family was in and then he said Well if they are so much distressed you may tell them that if they want any teeth drawn I will excuse them paying even for the sixth I tell you what Madame Pipelet said Rodolph I have a decidedly bad opinion of this man And your female pawnbroker was she more charitable Very much after the fashion of M Bradamanti said the porteress she lent a few sous upon their wretched clothes every garment they had has passed into her hands and even their last mattress but they were not long coming to the last for they never had but two But she gave them no further aid Help them poor creatures Not she Mother Burette is as great a brute in her way as her lover M Bras Rouge is in his for between you and I added the porteress with an uncommonly knowing wink of the eye and sagacious shake of the head there is something rather tender going on between these two Really cried Rodolph I think so I do upon my life And why not Why the folks in saint Martin are as loving as the rest of the world are they not my old pet A melancholy shake of the head which produced a corresponding motion in the huge black hat was M Pipelet s only answer As for Madame Pipelet since she had begun expressing sympathy for the poor sufferers in the attics her countenance had ceased to strike Rodolph as repulsive and he even thought it wore an agreeable expression And what is this poor Morel s trade A maker of false jewelry he works by the piece but dear me that sort of work is so much imitated and so cheaply got up that For a man can but work his best and he cannot do more than he can besides when you have got to find bread for seven persons without reckoning yourself it is rather a hard job I take it And though his eldest daughter does her best to assist the family she has but very little in her power How old is this daughter About eighteen and as lovely a young creature as you would see in a long summer s day She lives as servant with an old miserly fellow rich enough to buy and sell half Paris a notary named M Jacques Ferrand M Jacques Ferrand exclaimed Rodolph surprised at the fresh coincidence which brought under his notice the very individual from whom or from whose confidential housekeeper he expected to glean so many particulars relative to La Goualeuse M Jacques Ferrand who lives in the Rue du Sentier do you mean inquired he The very same are you acquainted with him Not at all but he does the law business for the firm I belong to Ah then you must know that he is a regular money grubbing old usurer but then let me do the man justice He is strictly religious and devout as a monk never absent from mass or vespers making his Easter offerings and going regularly to confession If he ever enjoys himself it is only along with the priests drinking holy water and eating blessed bread Oh he is almost a saint in the strictness of his life but then his heart is as hard as iron and as stern and rigid towards others as he is severe towards himself Why poor Louise daughter to our sick lodger has been his only servant for the last eighteen months And what a good girl she is Gentle as a lamb in temper and disposition but willing as a horse to work and he only gives this poor thing who slaves herself to death for him eighteen francs a month not a farthing more I give you my word and out of this she only keeps back six francs for her own maintenance and hands over the other twelve to her starving family that has been all their dependence for some time past but when seven persons have to live upon it it does not go far But what does the father earn I mean provided he is industrious Industrious God bless you he has always overworked himself he is the soberest steadiest creature alive and I verily believe that if he had the promise of obtaining any favour he liked to ask of Heaven it would be that the day might be made doubly as long as it now is that he might earn bread enough to stop the cries of his starving brats Then the father cannot earn enough if he were to try ever so hard it seems Why the poor man was ill abed for three months and that threw them all behind his wife s health was quite ruined by the fatigue of nursing him and the severe want she experienced of common necessaries for herself and family She now lies in a dying state they have had nothing for all that period besides Louise s wages and what they could obtain from Mother Burette upon the few wretched articles they could dispose of True the master for whom Morel had worked advanced them a trifle out of respect for a man he had always found punctual and honest when he could work But la Eight people only to be found in bread that is what I say just imagine how hard it must be to keep life and soul together upon such small means and if you could only see the hole they are all huddled together in But do not let us talk any more about that monsieur for our dinner is ready and the very thought of their wretched garret turns my stomach However happily M Bras Rouge is going to clear the house of them when I say happily I don t mean it ill naturedly in the least but since these poor Morels have fallen into such misery and it is quite out of our power to help them why let them go and be miserable elsewhere it will be a heartache the less for us all But if they are turned out from here where will they go to Truly I don t know And how much can this poor workman earn daily when in health and without any calls upon his time or attention Why if he had not to attend to his old mother nurse his sick wife and look after the five children he could earn his three or four francs a day because he works like a downright slave but now that at least three quarters of his time are taken up with the family he can hardly manage to earn forty sous That is little indeed poor creatures Yes it is easy to say poor creatures but there are so many equally poor creatures that as we can do nothing for them it is no use to worry ourselves about it is it Alfred And talking of consoling ourselves there stands the cassia and we have never thought of tasting it To tell you the truth Madame Pipelet after what I have just heard I have no inclination to partake of it You and M Pipelet must drink my health in it when I am gone You are extremely kind sir said the porter but will you not like to see the rooms up stairs I shall be glad to do so if perfectly convenient and if they suit I will engage them at once and leave a deposit The porter followed by Rodolph emerged from the gloomy lodge and proceeded up stairs CHAPTER XXIV THE FOUR STORIES The damp dark staircase looked still more gloomy through the fog of a November day The entrance to each separate set of apartments in this house bore its own peculiar and distinctive character to the observant eye Thus the door conducting to those of the commandant bore evidences of having been recently painted in close imitation of ebony being further set off with a brass knob rubbed up to a most dazzling brightness while a gay coloured bell rope finished by an enormous tassel of scarlet silk contrasted strongly with the mean and shabby wall against which it hung The door of the flight above where dwelt the female money lender and dealer in divination was singularly characterised by the appearance of that mystical symbol of deep wisdom and oracular knowledge an owl which stuffed to resemble life as closely as the artist could contrive it was nailed on a small bracket just above the doorway while a sort of small wicket latticed with wire work enabled all visitors to be duly scrutinised ere they were admitted The dwelling of the Italian charlatan who was said to pursue such fearful avocations had likewise its whimsical mode of designating the pursuits of its occupant whose name traced in large letters formed of horses teeth upon a square black board was nailed to the entrance door while instead of adopting the classical agency of a deer s foot or a hare s pad for the handle of his bell there hung dangling from the cord the hand and arm of a dried ape the withered limb the shrivelled hand with its five fingers each so distinctly preserved and the articulation of every joint so clearly defined the tiny tips bearing the nails long and taper as those of a human creature presented a close and hideous resemblance to the hand and arm of a child As Rodolph passed before a door so singularly indicative of all his worst suspicions he fancied he could detect the sound of smothered sobs from within Then rose up a cry so full of agony of convulsive irrepressible misery a cry as if wrung from a breaking heart or the last wail of expiring nature that the whole house seemed to re echo it Rodolph started then by a movement more rapid than thought itself he rushed to the door and violently pulled the bell What is the matter sir inquired the astonished porter That cry said Rodolph did you not hear it Yes yes I heard it I dare say it is some person whose teeth M Bradamanti is taking out perhaps he may be taking out several and it is painful This explanation though a probable one did not satisfy Rodolph as to the horrid scream which still resounded in his ears Though he had rung the bell with considerable violence no person had as yet replied to his summons he could distinctly hear the shutting of several doors and then behind a small oval glass let in beside the door and on which Rodolph had mechanically kept his eyes fixed he saw the haggard cadaverous countenance of a human being a mass of reddish hair strongly mixed with gray and a long beard of the same hue completed the hideous ensemble the face was seen but for an instant and vanished as quickly as though it had been a mere creation of fancy leaving Rodolph in a state of perturbation impossible to describe Short as had been the period of this apparition s visit he had yet in those brief instants recalled features precisely similar and for ever engraved on his memory the eyes shining with the colour and brilliancy of the aqua marina beneath their bushy sandy eyebrows the livid complexion the nose thin projecting and curving like an eagle s beak with its nostrils so curiously expanded and carved out till they exposed a portion of the nasal cartilage resembled closely a certain Polidori whose name had been so unceremoniously committed by Murphy in his conversation with Grauen to regions not mentionable to polite ears Though Rodolph had not seen Polidori during the last sixteen or seventeen years he had a thousand reasons for keeping every feature well in his remembrance The only thing that told against the identity of the individual he believed existed under the disguised name of this quack dentist was the circumstance of his having red hair while the Polidori of Rodolph s acquaintance had almost black That Rodolph experienced no wonder always supposing his conjectures as to the identity correct at finding a man whose profound learning rare talent and vast intelligence he well knew sunk to such a degradation it might even be infamy was because he knew equally well that all these high attainments and noble gifts were allied to such entire perversity such wild and irregular passions inclinations so corrupt and above all an affected scorn and contempt for the opinion of the world which might lead this man when want and misery overtook him to seek from choice the lowest and least honourable paths of subsistence and to enjoy a sort of malevolent satisfaction in the idea of him the talented the learned burying all these precious treasures beneath the ignoble calling to which he had devoted his vast powers of mind and body Still be it remembered that spite of the close resemblance between the charlatan surgeon dentist and the Polidori of bygone years there still existed discrepancies so great that Rodolph balanced in deep uncertainty respecting their proving to be one and the same person At length turning to Pipelet he inquired How long has this M Bradamanti been an inmate of this house About a year sir as nearly as I can remember yes it is a year I recollect he took the lodgings in the January quarter Oh he is a very regular and exact lodger he cured me of a desperate attack of rheumatism Madame Pipelet was telling me of the reports which are circulated of him How could she be so foolish Nay pray do not fear me I assure you I may safely be trusted But really sir rejoined Pipelet I do not think there is the least dependence to be placed in such reports I do not believe them for one I never can believe them my modesty would not let me added M Pipelet turning very red and preceding his new lodger to the floor above The more resolved upon clearing up his doubts in proportion to the very great annoyance he felt that the residence of Polidori in the same house would prove to him and becoming momentarily more disposed to affix a painful solution to the enigma of the piercing cry he had heard from the apartments of the Italian Rodolph bound himself by a rigid promise to investigate the matter so as to place it beyond the power of a doubt and followed the porter to the upper floor where was situated the chamber he was desirous of engaging It was easy to ascertain the abode of his next door neighbour Mlle Rigolette Thanks to the charming gallantry of the painter Pipelet s mortal foe the door of her chamber was ornamented after the manner of Watteau with a panel design representing about half a dozen fat little chubby Loves grouped round a space painted sky blue and on which was traced in pink letters Mademoiselle Rigolette Dressmaker These plump little Cupids had all a task to perform besides encircling this important announcement One held the thimble of Mlle Rigolette upon his tiny finger another held her scissors a third was provided with a smoothing iron for her use whilst a fourth held up a mirror as if to tempt the young sempstress to forsake her work for the more gratifying view of her own pretty countenance The whole was surrounded with a well chosen wreath of flowers whose gay colours contrasted agreeably with the sea green colour of the door the whole offering a very unfavourable contrast to the mean and shabby looking staircase At the risk of opening anew the bleeding wounds of Alfred Rodolph ventured to observe while pointing to the door of Mlle Rigolette This I suppose is the work of M Cabrion It is he destroyed the painting of the door by daubing it over with a parcel of fat indecent children he called his loves Had it not been for the entreaties of Mlle Rigolette and the weakness of M Bras Rouge I would have scratched it all off as well as this palette filled with horrid monsters with their equally abominable master whom you can see drawn amongst them You may know him by his steeple crowned hat And there sure enough on the door of the room Rodolph was about to hire might be seen a palette surrounded by all kinds of odd and whimsical creatures the witty conceit of which might have done honour to Callot Rodolph followed the porter into a tolerably good sized room accessible by a small entrance closet or antechamber having two windows opening into the Rue du Temple Some fantastic sketches from the pencil of M Cabrion on the second door had been scrupulously respected by M Germain Rodolph saw too many reasons for desiring to obtain this lodging to hesitate further therefore modestly placing a couple of francs in the hand of the porter he said Illustration This I Suppose Is the Work of M Cabrion Etching by Mercier after the drawing by Frank T Merrill This chamber will exactly suit me Here is a deposit to complete the bargain To morrow I will send in my furniture but let me beg of you not to destroy the merry creatures painted on the palette at the entrance It is really very droll Don t you think so Droll groaned poor Pipelet not I Ah sir how would you like to dream night after night that you were being hunted by a legion of little ugly devils like these on the door with Cabrion at their head urging them on and then fancying you are trying to get away and cannot Oh I have woke all in a perspiration from such dreams hundreds of times since that infamous Cabrion began persecuting me Why honestly speaking I cannot say the chase would be a very agreeable one even though but a dream However tell me have I any need to see M Bras Rouge your great man here about renting this apartment None whatever sir He rarely comes near the place except when he has any private matters to arrange with Mother Burette I am the only person to treat with about hiring apartments I must beg the favour of your name Rodolph Rodolph what Plain Rodolph M Pipelet nothing more if you please Just as you please sir I did not ask from curiosity Every man has a right to his own free will as well as to decide upon the name he chooses to be called What do you think M Pipelet as to the propriety of my going to morrow as a new neighbour of Morel s to inquire whether I can be of any service to them Since my predecessor M Germain was permitted to assist them according to his means why should they not accept of what trifling help I can afford Why sir I see no harm in your going to call on the Morels because it may please the poor things but I hardly see much good it can do as they are so shortly to be turned out of the house Then as if suddenly struck with a new idea M Pipelet exclaimed winking at Rodolph with what he intended should be a very facetious and penetrating look I see I see you mean to begin making acquaintance with the lodgers at the top of the house that you may be able to work your way down to Mlle Rigolette Ah I ve found you out you see pretty girl Well I think you have discovered my intentions so I will confess at once that I mean to try and be on friendly terms with my agreeable neighbour There is no harm in that sir it is customary only all correct all right and honourable you understand Between you and me I strongly suspect Mlle Rigolette heard us coming up stairs and that she is watching to have a look as we go down I will make a noise purposely in locking the door if you look sharp you will see her as we pass the landing And true to the porter s suspicions the door so tastefully enlivened by the fat Cupids a la Watteau was seen to open gently and Rodolph had a brief view of a little turned up nose and a pair of large staring black eyes peeping through the narrow space but as he slacked his steps the door was hastily shut I told you she was watching us said the porter Then added Excuse me one instant sir I want to step up to my warehouse Where is that At the top of this ladder is the landing place on which the door of Morel s garret opens and in the wainscoting of this landing is a small dark cupboard where I keep my leather and the wall is so full of cracks that when I am in this hole I can see and hear everything the same as if I was in Morel s room Not that I wish to spy what the poor creatures are about God knows quite the contrary But please to excuse me for a few minutes sir whilst I fetch my bit of leather If you will have the goodness to go down stairs I will rejoin you And so saying Pipelet commenced ascending the steep ladder communicating with his warehouse as he styled it a somewhat perilous feat for a person of his age Rodolph thus left alone cast another glance towards the chambers of Mlle Rigolette remembering with deep interest all he had heard of her being the favourite companion of the poor Goualeuse and recalling also the information she was said to possess touching the residence of the Schoolmaster s son when the sound of some person quitting the apartments of the quack doctor below attracted his attention and he could distinctly hear the light step of a female with the rustling of a silk dress Rodolph paused till the sounds had died away and then descended the stairs Something white had fallen about half way down it had evidently been dropped by the person who had just quitted Polidori Rodolph picked it up and carried it to one of the narrow windows which lighted the staircase It was a pocket handkerchief of the finest cambric trimmed with costly lace and bearing in one corner the initials L N beautifully embroidered and surmounted with a ducal coronet The handkerchief was literally soaked in tears Rodolph s first impulse was to follow the person from whose hand this mute evidence of deep woe had fallen with the view of restoring it but reflecting that such a step might be mistaken for impertinent curiosity he determined to preserve it carefully as the first link in an adventure he found himself almost involuntarily engaged in and from which he augured a painful and melancholy termination As he returned to the porteress he inquired whether a female had not just come down stairs A female No indeed sir it was a fine tall slender looking lady not a female and covered over with a thick black veil She has come from M Bradamanti Little Tortillard fetched a coach for her and she has just driven away in it What struck me was the impudence of that little beggar to seat himself behind the coach I dare say though it was to see where the lady went to for he is as mischievous as a magpie and as prying as a ferret for all his club foot So then thought Rodolph the name and address of this unhappy lady will soon be known to this imposter since it is doubtless by his directions she is followed and watched by this imp of an emissary Well sir and what do you think of the apartment Will it suit you inquired Madame Pipelet Nothing could have suited me better I have taken it and to morrow I shall send in my furniture Well then thank God for a good lodger I am sure it was a lucky chance for us sent you here I hope you will find it so madame I think it is well understood between us that you undertake to manage all my little domestic matters for me I shall come and superintend the removal of my goods Adieu So saying Rodolph left the lodge The results of his visit to the house in the Rue du Temple were highly important both as regarded the solution of the deep mystery he so ardently desired to unravel and also as affording a wide field for the exercise of his earnest endeavours to do good and to prevent evil After mature calculation he considered himself to have achieved the following results First he had ascertained that Mlle Rigolette was in possession of the address of Germain the Schoolmaster s son Secondly a young female who from appearances might unhappily be the Marquise d Harville had made an appointment with the commandant for the morrow perhaps to her own utter ruin and disgrace and Rodolph had as we have before mentioned numerous reasons for wishing to preserve the honour and peace of one for whom he felt so lively an interest as he took in all concerning M d Harville An honest and industrious artisan crushed by the deepest misery was with his whole family about to be turned into the streets through the means of Bras Rouge Further Rodolph had undesignedly caught a glimpse of an adventure in which the charlatan Cesar Bradamanti possibly Polidori and a female evidently of rank and fashion were the principal actors And finally La Chouette having lately quitted the hospital where she had been since the affair in the Allee des Veuves had reappeared on the stage and was evidently engaged in some underhand proceedings with the fortune teller and female money lender who occupied the second floor of the house Having carefully noted down all these particulars Rodolph returned to his house Rue Plumet deferring till the following day his visit to the notary Jacques Ferrand It will be no doubt fresh in the memory of our readers that on this same evening Rodolph was engaged to be present at a grand ball given by the ambassador of Before following our hero in this new excursion let us cast a retrospective glance on Tom and Sarah personages of the greatest importance in the development of this history CHAPTER XXV TOM AND SARAH Sarah Seyton widow of Count Macgregor and at this time thirty six or thirty seven years of age was of an excellent Scotch family daughter of a baronet and a country gentleman Beautiful and accomplished an orphan at seventeen years old she had left Scotland with her brother Thomas Seyton of Halsbury The absurd predictions of an old Highland nurse had excited almost to madness the two leading vices in Sarah s character pride and ambition the destiny predicted for her and in which she fully believed was of the highest order in fact sovereign rank The prophecy had been so often repeated that the young Scotch girl eventually fully credited its fulfilment and she constantly repeated to herself to bear out her ambitious dream that a fortune teller had thus promised a crown to the handsome and excellent creature who afterwards sat on the throne of France and who was queen as much by her graces and her kind heart as others have been by their grandeur and majesty Strange to say Thomas Seyton as superstitious as his sister encouraged her foolish hopes and resolved on devoting his life to the realisation of Sarah s dream a dream as dazzling as it was deceptive However the brother and sister were not so blind as to believe implicitly in this Highland prophecy and to look absolutely for a throne of the first rank in a splendid disdain of secondary royalties or reigning principalities on the contrary so that the handsome Scotch lassie should one day encircle her imperial forehead with a sovereign crown the haughty pair agreed to condescend to shut their eyes to the importance of the throne they coveted By the assistance of the Almanach de Gotha for the year of grace eighteen nineteen Seyton arranged before he left Scotland a sort of synopsis of the ages of all the kings and ruling powers in Europe then unmarried Although very ridiculous yet the brother and sister s ambition was freed from all shameful modes Seyton was prepared to aid his sister Sarah in snatching at the thread of the conjugal band by which she hoped eventually to fasten a crown upon her brows He would be her participator in any and all stratagems which could tend to consummate this end but he would rather have killed his sister than see her the mistress of a prince even though the liaison should terminate in a marriage of reparation The matrimonial inventory that resulted from Seyton and Sarah s researches in the Almanach de Gotha was satisfactory The Germanic Confederation furnished forth a numerous contingent of young presumptive sovereigns Seyton was not ignorant of the sort of German wedlock which is called a left handed marriage to which as being legitimate to a certain extent he would as a last resource have resigned his sister To Germany then it was resolved to bend their steps in order to commence this search for the royal spouse If the project appears improbable such hopes ridiculous let us first reply by saying that unbridled ambition excited by superstitious belief rarely claims for itself the light of reason in its enterprises and will dare the wildest impossibilities yet when we recall certain events even in our own times from high and most reputable morganatic marriages between sovereigns and female subjects down to the loving elopement of Miss Penelope Smith and the Prince of Capua we cannot refuse some chance of fortunate result to the imagination of Seyton and Sarah Let us add that the lady united to a very lovely person singular abilities and very varied talents whilst there were added a power of seduction the more dangerous as it was united to a mind unbending and calculating a disposition cunning and selfish a deep hypocrisy a stubborn and despotic will all covered by the outward show of a generous warm and impassioned nature In her appearance there was as much deceit as in her mind Her full and dark eyes now sparkling now languishing beneath her coal black brow could well dissimulate all the warmth of love and desire Yet the burning impulses of love never throbbed beneath her icy bosom no surprise of the heart or of the senses ever intervened to disturb the cold and pitiless calculations of this woman crafty selfish and ambitious When she reached the Continent she resolved in accordance with her brother s advice not to commence her conjugal and regal campaign until she had resided some time in Paris where she determined to complete her education and rub off the rust of her native country by associating with a society which was embellished by all that was elegant tasteful and refined Sarah was introduced into the best society and the highest circles thanks to the letters of recommendation and considerate patronage of the English ambassador s lady and the old Marquis d Harville who had known Tom and Sarah s father in England Persons of deceitful calculating and cold dispositions acquire with great facility language and manners quite in opposition to their natural character as with them all is outside surface appearance varnish bark or they soon find that if their real characters are detected they are undone so thanks to the sort of instinct of self preservation with which they are gifted they feel all the necessity of the moral mask and so paint and costume themselves with all the alacrity and skill of a practised comedian Thus after six months residence in Paris Sarah was in a condition to contest with the most Parisian of Parisian women as to the piquant finish of her wit the charm of her liveliness the ingenuousness of her flirtation and the exciting simplicity of her looks at once chaste and passionate Finding his sister in full panoply for his campaign Seyton left with her for Germany furnished with the best letters of introduction The first state of the German Confederation which headed Sarah s road book was the Grand Duchy of Gerolstein thus styled in the diplomatic and infallible Almanach de Gotha for the year of grace eighteen nineteen Genealogy of the Sovereigns of Europe and their Families GEROLSTEIN Grand Duke MAXIMILIAN RODOLPH tenth December

AUGUSTUS Prince of BURGLEN Son GUSTAVUS RODOLPH born seventeenth April eighteen oh three Mother Dowager Grand Duchess Judith widow of the Grand Duke CHARLES FREDERIC RODOLPH twenty first April seventeen eighty five Seyton with much practical good sense had first noted down on his list the youngest princes whom he coveted as brothers in law thinking that extreme youth is more easily seduced than ripened age Moreover we have already said that the brother and sister were particularly recommended to the reigning Duke of Gerolstein by the old Marquis d Harville caught like the rest of the world by Sarah whose beauty grace and above all delightful manners he could not sufficiently admire It is superfluous to say that the presumptive heir of the Grand Duchy of Gerolstein was Gustavus Rodolph he was hardly eighteen when Tom and Sarah were presented to his father The arrival of the young Scotch lady was an event in the German court so quiet simple and almost patriarchal in its habits and observances The Grand Duke a most worthy gentleman governed his states with wise firmness and paternal kindness Nothing could exceed the actual and moral happiness of the principality whose laborious and steady population by their soberness and piety presented a pure specimen of the German character This excellent people enjoyed so much real felicity and were so perfectly contented with their condition that the enlightened care of the Grand Duke was not much called into action to preserve them from the mania of constitutional innovations As far as modern discovery went and those practical suggestions which have a wholesome influence over the well being and morals of his people the Grand Duke was always anxious to acquire knowledge himself and apply it invariably for the use and benefit of his people his residents at the capitals of the different states of Europe having little else to occupy themselves whilst on their mission but to keep their master fully informed as to the rise and progress of science and all the arts which are connected with public welfare and public utility We have said that the Duke felt as much affection as gratitude for the old Marquis d Harville who in eighteen fifteen had rendered him immense service and so thanks to his powerful recommendation Sarah of Halsbury and her brother were received at the court of Gerolstein with every distinction and with marked kindness A fortnight after her arrival the young Scotch girl endued with so profound a spirit of observation had easily penetrated the firm character and open heart of the Grand Duke Before she began to seduce his son a thing of course she had wisely resolved to discover the disposition of the father Although he had appeared to dote on his son she was yet fully convinced that this father with all his tenderness would never swerve from certain principles certain ideas as to the duty of princes and would never consent to what he would consider a mesalliance for his son and that not through pride but from conscience reason and dignity A man of this firm mould and the more affectionate and good in proportion as he is firm and determined never abates one jot of that which affects his conscience his reason and his dignity Sarah was on the point of renouncing her enterprise in the face of obstacles so insurmountable but reflecting that as Rodolph was very young and his gentleness and goodness his character at once timid and meditative were generally spoken of she thought she might find compensation in the feeble and irresolute disposition of the young prince and therefore persisted in her project and again revived her hopes On this new essay the management of herself and brother were most masterly The young lady knew full well how to propitiate all around her and particularly the persons who might have been jealous or envious of her accomplishments and she caused her beauty and grace to be forgotten beneath the veil of modest simplicity with which she covered them She soon became the idol not only of the Grand Duke but of his mother the Dowager Grand Duchess Judith who in spite of or through her ninety years of age loved to excess every thing that was young and charming Sarah and her brother often talked of their departure but the sovereign of Gerolstein would never consent to it and that he might completely attach the two to him he pressed on Sir Thomas Seyton the acceptance of the vacant post of his first groom of the chamber and entreated Sarah not to quit the Grand Duchess Judith as she could not do without her After much hesitation overcome by the most pressing entreaties Sarah and Seyton accepted such brilliant offers and decided on establishing themselves at the court of Gerolstein where they had been for two months Sarah who was an accomplished musician knowing the taste of the Grand Duchess for the old masters and above all for Gluck sent for the chef d oeuvre of this attractive composer and fascinated the old princess by her unfailing complaisance as well as the remarkable skill with which she sang those old airs so beautiful in their melody so expressive in their character As for Seyton he knew how to make himself very useful in the occupation which had been conferred upon him He was a good judge of horses was orderly and firm in his conduct and arrangements and so in a short time completely remodelled the stables of the Grand Duke which up to that time had been neglected and become disorganised The brother and sister were soon equally beloved feted and admired in this court The master s preference soon commands the preference of those below him Sarah required in aid of her future projects too much aid not to employ her insinuating powers in acquiring partisans Her hypocrisy clothed in most attractive shapes easily deluded the simple hearted Germans and the general feeling soon authorised the extreme kindness of the Grand Duke Thus then our designing pair were established at the court of Gerolstein agreeably and securely placed without any reference to Rodolph By a lucky chance some days after the arrival of Sarah the young prince had gone away to the inspection of troops with an aide de camp and the faithful Murphy This absence doubly auspicious to the views of Sarah allowed her to arrange at her ease the principal threads of the fillet she was weaving without being deterred by the presence of the young prince whose too open admiration might perhaps have awakened the suspicions of the Grand Duke On the contrary in the absence of his son he did not unfortunately reflect that he was admitting into the closest intimacy a young girl of surpassing beauty and of lively wit as Rodolph must discover at every moment of the day Sarah was perfectly insensible to a reception so kind and generous to the full confidence with which she was introduced into the very heart of this sovereign family Neither brother nor sister paused for a moment in their bad designs they determined upon a principle to bring trouble and annoyance into this peaceable and happy court they calmly calculated the probable results of the cruel divisions they should establish between a father and son up to that period so tenderly united A few words concerning Rodolph s early days may be necessary During his infancy he had been extremely delicate His father reasoned thereon in this strange manner English country gentlemen are generally remarkable for their robust health This advantage results generally from their bodily training which is simple rural and develops their full vigour Rodolph must leave the hands of women his temperament is delicate and perhaps by accustoming this child to live like the son of an English farmer with some few exceptions I shall strengthen his constitution The Grand Duke sent to England for a man worthy of the trust and capable of directing such a course of bodily culture and Sir Walter Murphy an athletic specimen of a Yorkshire country gentleman was entrusted with this important charge The direction which he gave to the mind and body of the young prince were such as entirely coincided with the views and wishes of the Grand Duke Murphy and his pupil lived for many years in a beautiful farmhouse situated in the midst of woods and fields some leagues from the capital of Gerolstein and in a most picturesque and salubrious spot Rodolph free from all etiquette and employed with Murphy in outdoor labour proportionate to his age lived the sober manly and regular life of the country having for his pleasure and amusement the violent exercises of wrestling pugilism riding on horseback and hunting In the midst of the pure air of the meadows woods and mountains he underwent an entire change and grew up as vigorous as a young oak his pale cheek became suffused with the ruddy glow of health always lithe and active he underwent now the most severe fatigues his address energy and courage supplying what was deficient in his muscular power so that when only in his fifteenth or sixteenth year he was always the conqueror in his contests with young men his superiors in age His scientific education necessarily suffered from the preference given to his physical training and Rodolph s knowledge was very limited but the Grand Duke very wisely reflected that to have a well informed mind it must be supported by a strong physical frame and that this acquired the intellectual faculties would develop themselves the more rapidly The kind Walter Murphy was by no means a sage and could only convey to Rodolph some primary instruction but no one knew better than he how to inspire his pupil with the feeling of what is just loyal and generous and a horror of every thing that was mean low and contemptible These repugnances these powerful and wholesome admonitions took deep and lasting root in the very soul of Rodolph and although in after life these principles were violently shaken by the storm of passions yet they were never eradicated from his heart The levin bolt strikes splits and rends the deeply planted tree but the sap still maintains its hold in the roots and a thousand green branches spring fresh from what was taken for a withered and dead tree Murphy then gave to Rodolph if we may use the expression health to both body and mind he made him robust active and daring with a love for all that was good and right and a hatred for whatsoever was wicked and bad Having fulfilled his task to admiration the squire called to England on very important business left Germany for some time to the great regret of Rodolph who loved him extremely His son s health having been so satisfactorily established the Grand Duke turned his most serious attention to the mental education of his dearly beloved son A certain Doctor Cesar Polidori a renowned linguist a distinguished chemist learned historian and deeply versed in the study of all the exact and physical sciences was entrusted with the charge of cultivating and improving the rich but virgin soil so carefully and well prepared by Murphy This time the Grand Duke s choice was a most unfortunate one or rather his religious feelings were infamously imposed upon by the person who introduced the doctor to him and caused him to think on Polidori as the preceptor of the young prince Atheist cheat and hypocrite full of stratagem and trick concealing the most dangerous immorality the most hardened scepticism under an austere exterior profoundly versed in the knowledge of human nature or rather only having tried the worst side the disgraceful passions of humanity Doctor Polidori was the most hateful Mentor that could have been entrusted with the education of a young man Rodolph left with the deepest regrets the independent and animating life which he had hitherto led with Murphy to go and become pale with the study of books and submit himself to the irksome ceremonies of his father s court and he at once entertained a strong prejudice against his tutor It could not be otherwise On quitting his young friend the poor squire had compared him and with justice to a young wild colt full of grace and fire carried off from his native prairies where he had dwelt free as air and joyous as a bird to be bridled and spurred that he might under that system learn how to moderate and economise those powers which hitherto he had only employed in running and leaping in any way he pleased Rodolph began by telling Polidori that he had no taste for study but that he greatly preferred the free exercise of his arms and legs to breathe the pure air of the fields to traverse the woods and the mountains and that a good horse and a good gun were preferable to all the books in the universe The doctor was prepared for this antipathy and was secretly delighted at it for in another way the hopes of this man were as ambitious as those of Sarah Although the grand duchy of Gerolstein was only a secondary state Polidori indulged the idea of being one day its Richelieu and of making Rodolph play the part of the do nothing prince But desirous above all things of currying favour with his pupil and of making him forget Murphy by his own concession and compliance he concealed from the Grand Duke the young prince s repugnance for study and boasted of his application to and rapid progress in his studies whilst some examinations arranged between himself and Rodolph which had the air of being impromptu questions confirmed the Grand Duke in his blind and implicit confidence By degrees the dislike which Rodolph at first entertained for the doctor changed on the young prince s part into a cool familiarity very unlike the real attachment he had for Murphy By degrees he found himself leagued with Polidori although from very innocent causes by the same ties that unite two guilty persons Sooner or later Rodolph was sure to despise a man of the age and character of the doctor who so unworthily lied to excuse the idleness of his pupil This Polidori knew but he also knew that if we do not at once sever our connections with corrupt minds in disgust by degrees and in spite of our better reason we become familiar with and too frequently admire them until insensibly we hear without shame or reproach those things mocked at and vituperated which we formerly loved and revered Besides the doctor was too cunning all at once to shock certain noble sentiments and convictions which Rodolph had derived from the admirable lessons of Murphy After having vented much raillery on the coarseness of the early occupations of his young pupil the doctor laying aside his thin mask of austerity had greatly aroused the curiosity and heated the fancy of the young prince by the exaggerated descriptions strongly drawn and deeply coloured of the pleasures and gallantries which had illustrated the reigns of Louis XIV the Regent and especially Louis XV the hero of Cesar Polidori He assured the misled boy who listened to him with a fatal earnestness that pleasures however excessive far from demoralising a highly accomplished prince often made him merciful and generous inasmuch as fine minds are never more predisposed to benevolence and clemency than when acted upon by their own enjoyments Louis XV the bien aime the well beloved was an unanswerable proof of this And then added the doctor how entirely have the greatest men of all ages and all countries abandoned themselves to the most refined epicureanism from Alcibiades to Maurice of Saxony from Anthony to the great Conde from Caesar to Vendome Such conversations must make deep and dangerous impressions on a young ardent and virgin mind and such theories could not be without their results In the midst of this well regulated and virtuous court accustomed after the example of its ruler to honest pleasures and harmless amusements Rodolph instructed by Polidori dreamt of the dissipated nights of Versailles the orgies of Choisy the attractive voluptuousness of the Parc au Cerfs and also from time to time of some romantic amours contrasting with these Neither had the doctor failed to prove to Rodolph that a prince of the Germanic Confederation should not have any military pretension beyond sending his contingent to the Diet The feeling of the time was not warlike According to the doctor to pass his time delightfully and idly amongst women and the refinements of luxury to repose from time to time from the animation of sensual pleasures amidst the delightful attractions of the fine arts to hunt occasionally not as a Nimrod but as an intelligent epicurean and enjoy the transitory fatigues which make idleness and repose taste but the sweeter this this was the only life which a prince should think of enjoying who and this was his height of happiness could find a prime minister capable of devoting himself boldly to the distressing and overwhelming burden of state affairs Rodolph in abandoning himself to ideas which were free from criminality because they did not spring from the circle of fatal probabilities resolved that when Providence should call to himself the Grand Duke his father he would devote himself to the life which Cesar Polidori had painted to him under such brilliant and attractive colours and to have as his prime minister one whose knowledge and understanding he admired and whose blind complaisance he fully appreciated It is useless to say that the young prince kept the most perfect silence upon the subject of those pernicious hopes which had been excited within him Knowing that the heroes of the Grand Duke s admiration were Gustavus Adolphus Charles XII and the great Frederic Maximilian Rodolph had the honour of belonging to the royal house of Brandenburg Rodolph thought reasonably enough that the prince his father who professed so profound an admiration for these king captains always booted and spurred continually mounted on their chargers and engaged in making war would consider his son out of his senses if he believed him capable of wishing to displace the Tudescan gravity of his court by the introduction of the light and licentious manners of the Regency A year eighteen months passed away At the end of this time Murphy returned from England and wept for joy on again embracing his young pupil After a few days although unable to discover the reason of a change which so deeply afflicted him the worthy squire found Rodolph chilled and constrained in his demeanour towards him and almost rude when he recalled to him his sequestered and rural life Assured of the natural kind heart of the young prince and warned by a secret presentiment Murphy thought him for a time perverted by the pernicious influence of Doctor Polidori whom he instinctively abhorred and resolved to watch very narrowly The doctor for his part was very much annoyed by Murphy s return for he feared his frankness good sense and keen penetration He instantly resolved therefore cost what it might to ruin the worthy Englishman in Rodolph s estimation It was at this crisis that Seyton and Sarah were presented and received at the court of Gerolstein with such extreme distinction We have said that Rodolph accompanied by Murphy had been absent from the court on a journey for some weeks During this absence the doctor was by no means idle It is said that intriguers discover and recognise each other by certain mysterious signs which allow of them observing each other until their interests decide them to form a close alliance or declare unremitting hostility Some days after the establishment of Sarah and her brother at the court of the Grand Duke Polidori became a close ally of Seyton s The doctor confessed to himself with delectable cynicism that he felt a natural affinity for rogues and villains and so he said that without pretending to discover the end which Sarah and her brother desired to achieve he was attracted towards them by a sympathy so strong as to lead him to imagine that they plotted some devilish purpose Some questions of Seyton s as to the disposition and early life of Rodolph questions which would have passed without notice with a person less awake to all that occurred than the doctor in a moment enlightened him as to the ulterior aims of the brother and sister all he doubted was that the aspirations of the Scotch lady were at the same time honourable as well as ambitious The arrival of this lovely young woman appeared to Polidori a godsend Rodolph s mind was already inflamed with amorous imaginings Sarah might become or be made the delicious reality which should substantiate so many glorious dreams It was not to be doubted but that she would secure an immense influence over a heart submitted to the witching spell of a first love The doctor instantly laid his plan to direct and secure this influence and to make it serve also as the means of destroying Murphy s power and reputation Like a skilful intriguer he soon informed the aspiring pair that they must come to an understanding with him as he alone was responsible to the Grand Duke for the private life of the young prince Sarah and her brother understood him in a moment although they had not told the doctor a syllable of their secret designs On the return of Rodolph and Murphy all three combined by one common intent tacitly leagued against the squire their most redoubtable enemy What was to happen did happen Rodolph saw Sarah daily after his return and became desperately enamoured 
7246-63505-0000	train-other-500	She soon told him that she shared his love
none	none	 although she foresaw 
7246-63505-0001	train-other-500	that this love would create great trouble He could never be happy the distance that separated them was too wide She then recommended to Rodolph the most profound discretion
7246-63505-0002	train-other-500	for fear of arousing the Grand Duke s suspicions as he would be inexorable and deprive them of their only happiness that of seeing each other every day The young prince promised to be cautious and conceal his love The Scotch maiden was too ambitious
7246-63505-0003	train-other-500	too self possessed to compromise and betray herself in the eyes of the court and Rodolph perceiving the necessity of dissimulation imitated Sarah s prudence The lovers secret was carefully preserved for some time nor was it
7246-63505-0004	train-other-500	until the brother and sister saw the unbridled passion of their dupe reach its utmost excess and that his infatuation which he could hardly restrain threatened to burst forth afresh and destroy all that they resolved
7246-63505-0005	train-other-500	on their final coup The doctor s character authorising the confidence besides the morality which invested it Seyton opened to him on the necessity of a marriage between Rodolph and Sarah otherwise
7246-63505-0006	train-other-500	he added with perfect sincerity he and his sister would instantly leave Gerolstein Sarah participated in the prince s affection but preferring death to dishonour she could only be the wife of his highness
7246-63505-0007	train-other-500	This exalted flight of ambition stupefied the doctor who had never imagined that Sarah s imagination soared so high A marriage surrounded by numberless difficulties
7246-63505-0008	train-other-500	and dangers appeared impossible to Polidori and he frankly told Seyton the reasons why the Grand Duke would never submit to such a union Seyton agreed in the importance of the reasons but proposed
none	none	 as a mezzo termini which should meet all objections a marriage 
7246-63505-0009	train-other-500	which although secret should be legal and only avowed after the decease of the Grand Duke Sarah was of a noble and ancient house and such a union was not without precedent
7246-63505-0010	train-other-500	Seyton gave the prince eight days to decide his sister could not longer endure the cruel anguish of uncertainty and if she must renounce Rodolph s love she must act up to her painful resolve as promptly as might be
7246-63505-0011	train-other-500	Certain that he could not mistake Sarah s views the doctor was sorely perplexed He had three ways before him to inform the Grand Duke of the matrimonial project to open Rodolph s eyes
none	none	 as to the manoeuvres of Tom and Sarah 
7246-63505-0012	train-other-500	to lend himself to the marriage
none	none	 But to inform the Grand Duke would be to alienate from him for ever the heir presumptive to the throne 
7246-63505-0013	train-other-500	To enlighten Rodolph on the interested views of Sarah was to expose himself to the reception which a lover is sure to give when she whom he loves is depreciated in his eyes and then
7246-63505-0014	train-other-500	what a blow for the vanity or the heart of the young prince to let him know that it was for his royal rank alone that the lady was desirous to wed him On the other hand by lending himself to this match
7246-63505-0015	train-other-500	Polidori bound Rodolph and Sarah to him by a tie of the strongest gratitude or at least by the complicity of a dangerous act No doubt all might be discovered and the doctor exposed to the anger
7246-63505-0016	train-other-500	of the Grand Duke but then the marriage would have been concluded the union legal The storm would blow over and the future sovereign of Gerolstein would become the more bound to Polidori in proportion
none	none	 as the doctor had undergone greater dangers in his service 
7246-63505-0017	train-other-500	After much consideration therefore he resolved on serving Sarah but with a certain qualification which we will presently refer to Rodolph s passion had reached a height almost of frenzy
7246-63505-0018	train-other-500	Violently excited by constraint and the skilful management of Sarah who pretended to feel still more than he did the insurmountable obstacles
7246-63505-0019	train-other-500	which honour and duty placed between them and their liberty in a few days more the young prince would have betrayed himself Thus
none	none	 when the doctor proposed that he must never see his enchantress again 
7246-63505-0020	train-other-500	or possess her by a secret marriage Rodolph threw himself on Polidori s neck called him his saviour his friend his father he only wished that the temple and the priest were at hand
7246-63505-0021	train-other-500	that he might marry her that instant The doctor resolved for reasons of his own
none	none	 to undertake 
7246-63505-0022	train-other-500	the management of all He found a priest witnesses and the union all the formalities of which were carefully scrutinised and verified by Seyton was secretly celebrated during a temporary absence
7246-63505-0023	train-other-500	of the Grand Duke at a conference of the German Diet The prophecy of the Scotch soothsayer was fulfilled Sarah wedded the heir to a throne Without quenching the fire of his love
7246-63505-0024	train-other-500	possession rendered Rodolph more circumspect and cooled down that violence which might have compromised the secret of his passion for Sarah but directed by Seyton and the doctor the young couple managed so well
7246-63505-0025	train-other-500	and observed so much circumspection towards each other that they eluded all detection An event impatiently desired by Sarah soon turned this calm into a tempest she was about to become a mother
7246-63505-0026	train-other-500	It was then that this woman evinced all those exactions which were so new to and so much astonished Rodolph She protested with hypocritical tears streaming from her eyes
7246-63505-0027	train-other-500	that she could no longer support the constraint
none	none	 in which she lived a constraint 
7246-63505-0028	train-other-500	rendered the more insupportable by her pregnancy In this extremity she boldly proposed to the young prince to tell all to his father
none	none	 who was as well as the Dowager Grand Duchess 
7246-63505-0029	train-other-500	fonder than ever of her No doubt she added he will be very angry greatly enraged at first but he loves his son so tenderly so blindly and had for her Sarah so strong
7246-63505-0030	train-other-500	an affection that his paternal anger would gradually subside and she would at last take in the court of Gerolstein the rank which was due to her she might say in a double sense because she was about
7246-63505-0031	train-other-500	to give birth to a child which would be the heir presumptive to the Grand Duke These pretensions alarmed Rodolph he knew the deep attachment which his father had for him
7246-63505-0032	train-other-500	but he also well knew the inflexibility of his principles with regard to all the duties of a prince To all these objections Sarah replied unmoved I am your wife in the presence of God and men
7246-63505-0033	train-other-500	In a short time I shall no longer be able to conceal my situation and I ought not to blush at that of which I am on the contrary so proud and would desire openly to acknowledge
7246-63505-0034	train-other-500	The expectation of posterity had redoubled Rodolph s tenderness for Sarah and placed between the desire to accede to her wishes and the dread of his father s wrath he experienced the bitterest anguish
7246-63505-0035	train-other-500	Seyton sided with his sister The marriage is indissoluble said he to his royal brother in law the Grand Duke may exile you from his court you and your wife nothing more
7246-63505-0036	train-other-500	but he loves you too much to have recourse to such an extremity He will endure what he cannot prevent These reasons strong enough in themselves did not soothe Rodolph s anxieties At this juncture
7246-63505-0037	train-other-500	Seyton was charged by the Grand Duke with an errand to visit several breeding studs in Austria This mission which he could not refuse would only detain him a fortnight he set out with much regret
7246-63505-0038	train-other-500	and in a very important moment for his sister She was chagrined yet satisfied at the departure of her brother for she would lose his advice but then he would be safe from the Grand Duke s anger
none	none	 if all were discovered 
7246-63505-0039	train-other-500	Sarah promised to keep Seyton fully informed day by day of the progress of events so important to both of them and that they might correspond more surely and secretly they agreed upon a cipher
none	none	 of which Polidori also held the key This precaution alone proves that Sarah had other matters to tell her brother 
7246-63505-0040	train-other-500	of besides her love for Rodolph In truth this selfish cold ambitious woman had not felt the ice of her heart melt even by the beams of the passionate love which had been breathed to her
7246-63505-0041	train-other-500	Her maternity was only with her a means of acting more effectually on Rodolph and had no softening effect on her iron soul The youth headlong love and
none	none	 inexperience of the prince who was hardly more than a child 
7246-63505-0042	train-other-500	and so perfidiously ensnared into an inextricable position hardly excited an interest in the mind of this selfish creature and in her confidential communications with him
none	none	 she complained with disdain and bitterness of the weakness of this young man who trembled before the most paternal of German princes 
7246-63505-0043	train-other-500	who lived however very long In a word this correspondence between the brother and sister clearly developed their unbounded selfishness their ambitious calculations their impatience
7246-63505-0044	train-other-500	which almost amounted to homicide and laid bare the springs of that dark conspiracy crowned by the marriage of Rodolph One of Sarah s letters to her brother was abstracted by Polidori
7246-63505-0045	train-other-500	the channel of their mutual communications for what purpose we shall see hereafter A few days after Seyton s departure Sarah was at the evening court of the Dowager Grand Duchess
7246-63505-0046	train-other-500	Many of the ladies present looked at her with an astonished air and whispered to their neighbours The Grand Duchess Judith in spite of her ninety years had a quick ear and a sharp eye and this little whispering did not escape her
7246-63505-0047	train-other-500	She made a sign to one of the ladies in waiting to come to her and from her she learned that everybody was remarking that the figure of Miss Sarah Seyton of Halsbury was less slender
7246-63505-0048	train-other-500	less delicate in its proportions than usual The old princess adored her young protegee and would have answered to God himself for Sarah s virtue Indignant
7246-63505-0049	train-other-500	at the malevolence of these remarks she shrugged her shoulders and said aloud from the end of the saloon in which she was sitting My dear Sarah come here Sarah rose It was
7246-63505-0050	train-other-500	requisite to cross the circle to reach the place where the princess was seated who was anxious most kindly to destroy the rumour that was circulated and by the simple fact of thus crossing the room
none	none	 confound her 
7246-63505-0051	train-other-500	calumniators and prove triumphantly that the fair proportions of her protegee had lost not one jot of their symmetry and delicacy Alas the most
7246-63505-0052	train-other-500	perfidious enemy could not have devised a better plan than that suggested by the worthy princess in her desire to defend her protegee Sarah came towards her
7246-63505-0053	train-other-500	and it required all the deep respect due to the Grand Duchess to repress the murmur of surprise and indignation when the young lady crossed the room The nearest sighted persons saw what Sarah
7246-63505-0054	train-other-500	would no longer conceal for her pregnancy might have been hidden longer had she but have chosen but the ambitious woman had sought this display in order to compel Rodolph to declare his marriage
7246-63505-0055	train-other-500	The Grand Duchess who however would not be convinced in spite of her eyesight said in a low voice to Sarah My dear child how very ill you have dressed yourself to day you
7246-63505-0056	train-other-500	whose shape may be spanned by ten fingers I hardly know you again We will relate hereafter the results of this discovery which led to great and terrible events At this moment
7246-63505-0057	train-other-500	we will content ourselves with stating what the reader has no doubt already guessed that Fleur de Marie was the fruit of the
none	none	 secret marriage of Rodolph and Sarah 
7246-63505-0058	train-other-500	and that they both believed their daughter dead It has not been forgotten that Rodolph after having visited the house in the Rue du Temple
none	none	 had returned home and intended in the evening to be present at a ball given by the ambassadress It was to this fete that we shall follow his royal highness the reigning Grand Duke of Gerolstein Gustavus Rodolph travelling in France under the name of the Count de Duren CHAPTER XXVI THE BALL As the eleventh hour of the night sounded from the different clocks in Paris the gates of an hotel in the Rue Plumet were thrown open by a Swiss in rich livery and forthwith issued a magnificent dark blue Berlin carriage drawn by two superb long tailed gray horses on the seat which was covered by a rich hammercloth trimmed with a mossy silk fringe sat a portly looking coachman whose head was ornamented by a three cornered hat while his rotund figure looked still more imposing in his dress livery coat of blue cloth trimmed up the seams with silver lace and thickly braided with the same material the whole finished by a splendid sable collar and cuffs Behind the carriage stood a tall powdered lacquey dressed in a livery of blue turned up with yellow and silver and by his side was a chasseur whose fierce looking moustaches gaily embroidered dress and hat half concealed by a waving plume of blue and yellow feathers completed a most imposing coup d oeil The bright light of the lamps revealed the costly satin lining of the interior of the vehicle we are describing in which were seated Rodolph having on his right hand the Baron de Grauen and opposite to him the faithful Murphy Out of deference for the sovereign represented by the ambassador to whose ball he was then proceeding Rodolph wore no other mark of distinction than the diamond order of Round the neck of Sir Walter Murphy and suspended by a broad orange riband hung the enamelled cross of the grand commander of the Golden Eagle of Gerolstein and a similar insignia decorated the Baron de Grauen amidst an infinite number of the crosses and badges of honour belonging to all countries depending by a gold chain placed in the two full buttonholes of the diplomatist s coat I am delighted said Rodolph with the very favourable accounts I have received from Madame Georges respecting my poor little protegee at the farm of Bouqueval David s care and attention have worked wonders Apropos of La Goualeuse what do you think Sir Walter Murphy any of your Cite acquaintances would say at seeing you so strangely disguised as at present they would consider you most valiant charcoal man to be They would be somewhat astonished I fancy Much in the same degree as the surprise your royal highness would excite among your new acquaintances in the Rue du Temple were you to proceed thither as now attired to pay a friendly visit to Madame Pipelet and to inquire after the health of Cabrion s victim the poor melancholy Alfred My lord has drawn so lively a sketch of Alfred attired in his long skirted green coat and bell crowned hat said the baron that I can well imagine him seated in magisterial dignity in his dark and smoky lodge Let me hope that your royal highness s visit to the Rue du Temple has fully answered your expectations and that you are in every way satisfied with the researches of my agent Perfectly so answered Rodolph My success was even beyond my expectations Then after a moment s painful silence and to drive away the train of thought conjured up by the recollection of the probable guilt of Madame d Harville he resumed in a tone more gay I am almost ashamed to own to so much childishness but I confess myself amused with the contrast between my treating Madame Pipelet in the morning to a glass of cordial and then proceeding in the evening to a grand fete with all the pomp and prestige of one of those privileged beings who by the grace of God reign over this lower world Some men of small fortune would speak of my revenues as those of a millionaire added Rodolph in a sort of parenthesis alluding to the limited extent of his estates And many millionaires my lord might not have the rare the admirable good sense of the man of narrow means Ah my dear De Grauen you are really too good much too good You really overwhelm me replied Rodolph with an ironical smile while the baron glanced at Murphy with the consciousness of a man who has just discovered he has been saying a foolish thing Really my dear De Grauen resumed Rodolph I know not how to acknowledge the weight of your compliment or how to repay such delicate flattery in its own way My lord let me entreat of you not to take the trouble exclaimed the baron who had for the instant forgotten that Rodolph who detested every species of flattery always revenged himself by the most unsparing raillery on those who directly or indirectly addressed it to him Nay baron I cannot allow myself to remain in your debt You have praised my understanding I will in return admire your countenance for by my honour as I sit beside you you look like a youth of twenty Antinous himself could not boast of finer features or a more captivating expression My lord my lord I cry your mercy Behold him Murphy and say whether Apollo could display more graceful limbs more light and youthful proportions I beseech you my lord to pardon me from the recollection of how long it is since I have permitted myself to utter the slightest compliment to your royal highness Observe Murphy this band of gold which restrains without concealing the locks of rich black hair flowing over this graceful neck and My lord my lord for pity s sake spare me I repent most sincerely of my involuntary fault said the unfortunate baron with an expression of comic despair on his countenance truly ludicrous It must not be forgotten that the original of this glowing picture was at least fifty years of age his hair gray frizzled and powdered a stiff white cravat round his throat a pale withered countenance and golden spectacles upon the horny bridge of his sharp projecting nose Pardon my lord pardon for the baron exclaimed the squire laughing I beseech you not to overwhelm him beneath the weight of your mythological allusions I will be answerable to your royal highness that my unlucky friend here will never again venture to utter a flattery since so truth is translated in the new vocabulary of Gerolstein What old Murphy too Are you going to join in the rebellion against sincerity My lord I am so sorry for the position of my unfortunate vis a vis that I beg I may divide his punishment with him Charcoal man in ordinary your disinterested friendship does you honour But seriously now my dear De Grauen how have you forgotten that I only allow such fellows as D Harneim and his train to flatter for the simple reason that they know not how to speak the truth That cuckoo note of false praise belongs to birds of such feather as themselves and the species they claim relationship with but for a person of your mind and good taste to descend to its usage oh fie baron fie It is all very well my lord said the baron sturdily but I must be allowed to say with all due apology for my boldness that there is no small portion of pride in your royal highness s aversion to receive even a just compliment Well said baron Come I like you better now you speak plain truths But tell me how you prove your assertion Why just so my lord because you repudiate it upon the same principle that might induce a beautiful woman well aware of her charms to say to one of her most enthusiastic admirers I know perfectly well how handsome I am and therefore your approval is perfectly uncalled for and unnecessary What is the use of reiterating what everybody knows Is it usual to proclaim in the open streets that the sun shines when all may see and feel certain of his midday brightness Now baron you are shifting your ground and becoming more dangerous as you become more adroit and by way of varying your punishment I will only say that the infernal Polidori himself could not have more ingeniously disguised the poisonous draught of flattery when seeking to persuade some poor victim to swallow it My lord I am now effectually silenced Then said Murphy and this time with an air of real seriousness your royal highness has now no doubt as to its being really Polidori you encountered in the Rue du Temple I have ceased to have the least doubt on the subject since I learned through you that he had been in Paris for some time past I had forgotten or rather purposely omitted to mention to your lordship said Murphy in a sorrowing tone a name that never failed to awaken painful feelings and knowing as I do how justly odious the remembrance of this man was to your royal highness I studiously abstained from all reference to it The features of Rodolph were again overshadowed with gloom and plunged in deep reverie he continued to preserve unbroken the silence which prevailed until the carriage stopped in the courtyard of the embassy The windows of the hotel were blazing with a thousand lights which shone brightly through the thick darkness of the night while a crowd of lacqueys in full dress liveries lined the entrance hall extending even to the salons of reception where the grooms of the chamber waited to announce the different arrivals M le Comte the ambassador with his lady had purposely remained in the first reception room until the arrival of Rodolph who now entered followed by Murphy and M de Grauen Rodolph was then in his thirty sixth year in the very prime and perfection of manly health and strength His regular and handsome features with the air of dignity pervading his whole appearance would have rendered him under any circumstances a strikingly attractive man but combined with the eclat of high birth and exalted rank he was a person of first rate importance in every circle in which he presented himself and whose notice was assiduously sought for Dressed with the utmost simplicity Rodolph wore a white waistcoat and cravat a blue coat buttoned up closely on the right breast of which sparkled a diamond star displayed to admiration the light yet perfect proportions of his graceful figure while his well fitting pantaloons of black kerseymere defined the finely formed leg and handsome foot in its embroidered stocking From the rareness of the Grand Duke s visits to the haut monde his arrival produced a great sensation and every eye was fixed upon him from the moment that attended by Murphy and Baron de Grauen he entered the first salon at the embassy An attache deputed to watch for his arrival hastened immediately to appraise the ambassadress of the appearance of her illustrious guest Her excellency instantly hurried with her noble husband to welcome their visitor exclaiming Your royal highness is indeed kind thus to honour our poor entertainment Nay madame replied Rodolph gracefully bowing on the hand extended to him your ladyship is well aware of the sincere pleasure it affords to pay my compliments to yourself and as for M le Comte he and I are two old friends who are always delighted to meet Are we not my lord Your royal highness in deigning to continue to me so flattering a place in your recollection makes it still more impossible for me ever to forget your many acts of condescending kindness I assure you M le Comte that in my memory the past never dies or at least the pleasant part of it for I make it a strict rule never to preserve any reminiscences of my friends but such as are agreeable and gratifying Your royal highness has found the secret of being happy in your thoughts and rendering others so at the same time rejoined the ambassador smiling with gratified pride and pleasure at a conference so cordially carried on before a gathering crowd of admiring auditors Thus then madame replied Rodolph will your flattering reception of to night live long in my memory and I shall promise myself the happiness of recalling this evening s fete with its tasteful arrangements and crowd of attending beauties Ah Madame la Comtesse who like you can effect such a union of taste and elegance as now sparkles around us Your royal highness is too indulgent But I have a very important question to ask you Why is it that lovely as are your fair guests their charms are never seen to such perfection as when assembled beneath your hospitable roof Your royal highness is pleased to view our fair visitants through the same flattering medium with which you are graciously pleased to behold our poor endeavours for your and their amusement answered the ambassador with a deferential bow Your pardon count replied Rodolph if I differ with you in opinion According to my judgment the cause proceeds wholly from our amiable hostess Madame l Ambassadrice May I request of your royal highness to solve this enigma inquired the countess smiling That is easily given madame and may be found in the perfect urbanity and exquisite grace with which you receive your lovely guests and whisper to each a few charming and encouraging words which if the least bit exceeding strict truth said Rodolph smiling with good tempered satire renders those who are even praised above their merits more radiant in beauty from your kind commendations while those whose charms admit of no exaggeration are no less radiant with the happiness of finding themselves so justly appreciated by you thus each countenance thanks to the gentle arts you practise is made to exhibit the most smiling delight for perfect content will set off even homely features And thus I account for why it is that woman all lovely as she is never looks so much so as when seen beneath your roof Come M l Ambassadeur own that I have made out a good case and that you entirely concur with me in opinion Your royal highness has afforded me too many previous reasons to admire and adopt your opinions for me to hesitate in the present instance And for me my lord said the countess at the risk of being included among those fair ladies who get a little more praise or flattery which was it your highness styled it than they deserve I accept your very flattering explanation with as much qualified pleasure as if it were really founded on truth In order more effectually to convince you madame that nothing is more correct than all I have asserted let us make a few observations touching the fine effect of praise in animating and lighting up the countenance Ah my lord you are laying a very mischievous snare for me said the countess smiling Well then I will abandon that idea but upon one condition that you honour me by taking my arm I have been told wonderful things of a Winter Garden a work from Fairyland May I put up my humble petition to be allowed to see this new wonder of a hundred and one nights Oh my lord with the utmost pleasure But I see that your highness had received a most exaggerated account Perhaps you will accompany me and judge for yourself Only in this instance I would fain hope that your habitual indulgence may induce you to feel as little disappointment as possible at finding how imperfectly the reality equals your expectations The ambassadress then took the offered arm of Rodolph and proceeded with him to the other salons while the count remained conversing with the Baron de Grauen and Murphy whom he had been acquainted with for some time And a more beautiful scene of enchantment never charmed the eye than that presented by the aspect of the winter garden to which Rodolph had conducted his noble hostess Let the reader imagine an enclosure of about forty feet in length and thirty in width leading out of a long and splendid gallery surmounted by a glazed and vaulted roof the building being securely covered in for about fifty feet Round the parallelogram it described the walls were concealed by an infinite number of mirrors over which was placed a small and delicate trellis of fine green rushes which thanks to the strong light reflected on the highly polished glass resembled an arbour and were almost entirely hidden by a thick row of orange trees as large as those of the Tuileries mixed with camellias of equal size while the golden fruit and verdant foliage of the one contrasted beautifully with the rich clusters of waxen flowers of all colours with which the other was loaded The remainder of the garden was thus devised Five or six enormous clumps of trees and Indian or other tropical shrubs planted in immense cases filled with peat earth were surrounded by alleys paved with a mosaic shell work and sufficiently wide for two or three persons to walk abreast It is impossible to describe the wondrous effect produced by this rich display of tropical vegetation in the midst of a European winter and almost in the very centre of a ballroom Here might be seen gigantic bananas stretching their tall arms to the glass roof which covered them and blending the vivid green of their palms with the lanceolated leaves of the large magnolias some of which already displayed their matchless and odoriferous flowers with their bell shaped calices purple without and silvery white within from which started forth the little gold threaded stamens At a little distance were grouped the palm and date trees of the Levant the red macaw and fig trees from India all blooming in full health and vigour and displaying their foliage in all its luxuriance gave to the tout ensemble a mass of rich brilliant tropical verdure which glittering among the thousand lights sparkled with the colours of the emerald Along the trellising between the orange trees and amid the clumps were trained every variety of rare climbing plants sometimes hanging their long wreaths of leaves and flowers in graceful festoons then depending like blooming serpents from the tall boughs now trailing at their roots then ambitiously scaling the very walls till they hung their united tresses round the transparent and vaulted roof from which again they floated in mingled masses waving in the pure light breeze loaded with so many odours The winged pomegranate the passion flower with its large purple flowers striated with azure and crowned with its dark violet tuft waved in long spiral wreaths over the heads of the admiring crowd then as though fatigued with the sport threw their colossal garlands of delicate flowers across the hard prickly leaves of the gigantic aloes The bignonia of India with its long cup shaped flower of dark sulphur colour and slight slender leaves was placed beside the delicate flesh coloured petals of the stephanotis so justly appreciated for its exquisite perfume the two stems mutually clinging to each other for support and mingling their leaves and flowers in one confused mass disposed them in elegant festoons of green fringe spangled with gold and silver spots around the immense velvet foliage of the Indian fig Farther on started forth and then fell again in a sort of variegated and floral cascade immense quantities of the stalks of the asclepias whose leaves large umbellated and in clusters of from fifteen to twenty star shaped flowers grew so thickly so evenly that they might have been mistaken for bouquets of pink enamel surrounded with leaves of fine green porcelain The borders of the cases containing the orange sand camellias were filled with the choicest cape heaths the tulips of Thol the narcissus of Constantinople the hyacinth irides and cyclamina of Persia forming a sort of natural carpet presenting one harmonious blending of the loveliest tints Chinese lanterns of transparent silk some pale blue others pink partly concealed amid the foliage threw a soft and gentle light over this enchanting scene nor could a more ingenious idea have been resorted to than in the happy amalgamation of these two colours by which a charming and almost unearthly light was produced combining the clear cerulean blue of a summer s night with the rose coloured coruscations emitted from sparkling rays of an aurora borealis The entrance to this immense hothouse was from a long gallery glittering with gold with mirrors crystal vases filled with the choicest perfumes and brilliantly lighted and also raised a few steps above the fairy palace we have been endeavouring to describe The dazzling brightness of the approach served as a sort of penumbra in which were indistinctly traced out the gigantic exotics discernible through a species of arch partly concealed by two crimson velvet curtains looped back with golden cords so as to give a dim and misty view of the enchanted land that lay beyond An imaginative mind might easily have persuaded himself he stood near a huge window opening on some beautiful Asiatic landscape during the tranquillity of a summer s twilight The sounds of the orchestra weakened by distance and broken by the joyous hum proceeding from the gallery died languidly away among the motionless foliage of the huge trees Insensibly each fresh visitant to this enchanting spot lowered his voice until his words fell in whispers for the light genuine air embalmed with a thousand rich odours appeared to cast a sort of somnolency over the senses every breath seemed to speak of the clustering plants whose balmy sweetness filled the atmosphere Certainly two lovers seated in some corner of this Eden could conceive no greater happiness to be enjoyed on earth than thus dreamily to rest beneath the trees and flowers of this terrestrial paradise At the end of this winter garden were placed immense divans beneath canopies of leaves and flowers the subdued light of the hothouse forming a powerful contrast with the gallery the distance seemed filled with a species of gold coloured shining fog in the midst of which glittered and flickered like a living embroidery the dazzling and varied robes of the ladies combined with the prismatic scintillations of the congregated mass of diamonds and precious stones Rodolph s first sensation upon arriving at this enchanting triumph of art over nature was that of most unfeigned surprise This is indeed a wonderfully beautiful carrying out of a poetical idea said he almost involuntarily then turning to the ambassadress he exclaimed Madame till now I had not deemed such wonders practicable We have not in the scene before us a mere union of unbounded expense with the most exquisite taste but you give us poetry in action Instead of writing as a master poet or painting as a first rate artist you create that which they would scarcely venture to dream of Your royal highness is too indulgent Nay but candidly all must agree that the mind which could so faithfully depict this ravishing scene with its charm of colours and contrasts beyond us the loud notes of joy and mirthful revelry here the soft silence and sweet gentle murmurs of distant voices that lull the spirit into a fancied flight beyond this fitful existence surely surely without suspicion of flattery it may be said of the planner and contriver of all this such a one was born a poet and a painter combined The praises of your royal highness are so much the more dangerous from the skill and cleverness with which they are uttered and which makes us listen to them with delight even in defiance of our sternest resolutions But allow me to call your royal highness s attention to the very lovely person who is approaching us I must have you admit that the Marquise d Harville must shine preeminently beautiful any and every where Is she not graceful And does not the gentle elegance of her whole appearance acquire a fresh charm from the contrast with the severe yet classic beauty by whom she is accompanied The individuals thus alluded to were the Countess Sarah Macgregor and the Marquise d Harville who were at this moment descending the steps which led from the gallery to the winter garden Neither was the panegyric bestowed by the ambassadress on Madame d Harville at all exaggerated No words can accurately describe the loveliness of her person and the Marquise d Harville was then in the first bloom of youthful charms but her beauty delicate and fragile as it was appeared less to belong to the strict regularity of her features than to the irresistible expression of sweetness and universal kindness which imparted a charm to her countenance impossible to resist or to describe and this peculiar charm served invariably to distinguish Madame d Harville from all other fashionable beauties for goodness of heart and kindliness of disposition are but rarely seen as the prevailing passions revealed in a face as fair as young high born and ardently worshipped by all as was the Marquise d Harville who shone forth in all her lustre as the brightest star in the galaxy of fashion Too wise virtuous and right minded to listen to the host of flatterers by whom she was surrounded Madame d Harville smiled as gratefully on all as though she could have given them credit for speaking the truth had not her own modest opinion of her just claims to such homage have forbidden her accepting of praise she never could have deserved Wholly indifferent to flattery yet sensibly alive to kindness she perfectly distinguished between sympathy and insincerity Her acute penetration correct judgment and lively wit unmixed by the slightest ill nature made her wage an early though good tempered war with those vain and egotistical beings who crowd and oppress society with the view of monopolising general attention and blinded by their own self love expect one universal deference and submission Those kind of persons said Madame d Harville one day laughingly appear to me as if their whole lives were passed in dancing Le Cavalier Seul before an invisible mirror An unassuming and unpretending person however reserved and consequently unpopular he might be with others was sure to find a steady friend and partial observer in Madame d Harville This trifling digression is absolutely essential to the right understanding of facts of which we shall speak hereafter The complexion of Madame d Harville was of the purest white tinged with the most delicate carnation her long tresses of bright chestnut hair floated over her beautifully formed shoulders white and polished as marble It would be an impossible task to describe her large dark gray eyes fringed with their thick lashes and beaming with angelic sweetness her coral lips with their gentle smile gave to her eyes the indefinable charm that her affable and winning mode of expressing herself derived from their mild and angelic expression of approving goodness We will not farther delay the reader by describing the perfection of her figure nor dwell upon the distinguished air which marked her whole appearance She wore a white crape dress trimmed with the natural flowers of the camellia intermixed with its own rich green leaves Here and there a diamond sparkled among the waxy petals as if a dewdrop fresh from its native skies had fallen there A garland of the same flowers equally ornamented with precious stones was placed with infinite grace upon her fair and open brow The peculiar style of the Countess Sarah Macgregor s beauty served to set off the fair feminine loveliness of her companion Though turned thirty five years of age Sarah looked much younger Nothing appears to preserve the body more effectually from all the attacks of sickness or decay than a cold hearted egotistical disregard of every one but ourselves it encrusts the body with a cold icy covering which alike resists the inroads of bodily or mental wear and tear To this cause may be ascribed the wonderful preservation of Countess Sarah s appearance The lady whose name we last mentioned wore a dress of pale amber watered silk beneath a crape tunic of the same colour A simple wreath of the dark leaves of the Pyrus Japonicus encircled her head and harmonised admirably with the bandeaux of raven hair it confined This classically severe mode of head dress gave to the profile of this imperious woman the character and resemblance of an antique statue Many persons mistaking their real cast of countenance imagine some peculiar vocation delineated in their traits Thus one man who fancies he possesses a warlike air assumes the warrior another imagines His eye in a fine frenzy rolling marks him out as a poet instantly he turns down his shirt collar adopts poetical language and writes himself poet So the self imagined conspirator wastes days and hours in pondering over mighty deeds he feels called upon to do The politician upon the same terms bores the world and his friends with his perpetual outpourings upon political economy and the man whose saintly turn of countenance persuades its owner into the belief of a corresponding character within forthwith abjures the pomps and vanities of the world and aims at reforming his brethren by his pulpit eloquence Now ambition being Sarah s ruling passion and her noble and aristocratical features well assisting the delusion she smiled as the word diadem crossed her thoughts and lent a willing ear to the predictions of her Highland nurse and firmly believed herself predestined to a sovereign destiny Spite of the trifling embonpoint that gave to her figure which though fatter than Madame d Harville s was not less slender and nymph like a voluptuous gracefulness Sarah boasted of all the freshness of early youth and few could long sustain the fire of her black and piercing eyes her nose was aquiline her finely formed mouth and rich ruby lips were expressive of the highest determination haughtiness and pride The marquise and Sarah had recognised Rodolph in the winter garden at the moment they were descending into it from the gallery but the prince feigned not to observe their presence The prince is so absorbed with the ambassadress said Madame d Harville to Sarah that he pays not the slightest attention to us You are quite mistaken my dear Clemence rejoined the countess the prince saw us as quickly and as plainly as we saw him but I frightened him away you see he still bears malice with me I am more than ever at a loss to understand the singular obstinacy with which he persists in shunning you you formerly an old friend Countess Sarah and myself are sworn enemies replied he to me once in a joking manner I have made a vow never to speak to her and you may judge how sacred must be the vow that hinders me from conversing with so charming a lady And strange and unaccountable as was this reply I had no alternative but to submit to it And yet I can assure you that the cause of this deadly feud half in jest and half in earnest as it is originates in the most simple circumstance Were it not that a third party is implicated in it I should have explained the whole to you long ago But what is the matter my dear child You seem as though your thoughts were far from the present scene Nothing nothing I assure you replied the marquise faintly but the gallery is so very hot it gave me a violent headache Let us sit down here for a minute or two I hope and believe it will soon be better You are right see here is a nice quiet corner where you will be in perfect safety from the researches of those who are lamenting your absence added Sarah pronouncing the last words with marked emphasis The two ladies then seated themselves on a divan almost concealed beneath the clustering shrubs and overhanging plants I said those who would be lamenting your absence my dear Clemence come own that I deserve praise for so discreetly forming my speech The marquise blushed slightly cast down her eyes but spoke not How unreasonable you are exclaimed Sarah in a tone of friendly reproach Can you not trust me my dear child yes child for am I not old enough to be your mother Not trust you uttered the marquise sadly alas have I not on the contrary confessed that to you which I should hardly have dared to own to myself Well then come rouse yourself now let us have a little talk about him and so you have really sworn to drive him to despair For the love of heaven exclaimed Madame d Harville think what you are saying I tell you I know him better than you do my poor child he is a man of cool and decided energy who sets but little value on his life he has had misfortunes enough to make him quite weary of it and it really seems as if you daily found greater pleasure in tormenting him and playing with his feelings Is it possible you can really think so Indeed in spite of myself I cannot refrain from entertaining that opinion Oh if you but knew how over susceptible some minds are rendered by a continuance of sorrows and afflictions just now I saw two large tears fall from his eyes as he gazed on you Are you quite sure of what you say Indeed I am quite certain and that too in a ballroom at the risk of becoming an object of general derision if this uncontrollable misery were perceived Ah let me tell you a person must truly love to bear all this and even to be careless about concealing his sufferings from the world For the love of heaven do not speak thus replied Madame d Harville in a voice trembling with emotion Alas you have touched me nearly I know too well what it is to struggle with a hidden grief yet wear an outward expression of calmness and resignation Alas alas tis the deep pity and commiseration I feel for him has been my ruin added she almost unconsciously Nonsense What an over nice person you are to talk of a little innocent flirtation being ruinous and that too with a man so scrupulously guarded as to abstain from ever appearing in your husband s presence for fear of compromising you You must admit that M Charles Robert is a man of surprising honour delicacy and real feeling I feel the more inclined to espouse his cause from the recollection that you have never met him elsewhere but at my house and because I can answer for his principles and that his devoted attachment to you can only be equalled by the deep respect he bears you I have never doubted the many noble qualities you have so repeatedly assured me he possesses but you know well that it is his long succession of bitter afflictions which have so warmly interested me in his favour And well does he merit this interest and most fully do his excellent qualities absolve you of all blame in thus bestowing it Surely so fine and noble a countenance bespeaks a mind equally superior to all mankind How completely are you reminded while gazing on his tall and finely proportioned figure of the preux chevaliers of bygone days sans peur et sans reproche I once saw him dressed in his uniform as commandant of the national guard and handsome as he is I really think he looked surpassingly well and I could but say to myself that if nobility were the award of inward merit and external beauty M Charles Robert instead of being so called would take precedence of nearly all our dukes and peers Would he not be a fitting representative of any of the most distinguished families in France You know my dear countess how very little importance I attach to mere birth and you yourself have frequently reproached me with being strongly inclined to republicanism said Madame d Harville smiling gently For my own part I always thought with you that M Charles Robert required not the aid of rank or titles to render him worthy of universal admiration Then what extreme talent he possesses What a fine voice he has And what delightful morning concerts we three have been able to achieve owing to his all powerful assistance Ah my dear Clemence do you remember the first time you ever sang with him what passionate expression did he not throw into the words of that beautiful duet so descriptive of his love and his fear of offending her who was the object of it by revealing it Let me entreat of you said Madame d Harville after a long silence to speak of something else indeed I dare not listen further what you but just now intimated of his depressed and unhappy appearance has caused me much pain Nay my dear friend I meant not to grieve you but merely to point out the probability that a man rendered doubly sensitive by the succession of past misfortunes might feel his courage insufficient to encounter the fresh trial of your rejection of his suit and thus be induced to end his hopeless love and his life together Oh no more no more almost shrieked Madame d Harville interrupting Sarah this fearful idea has glanced across my mind already Then after a second silence of some minutes the marquise resumed Let us as I said before talk of somebody else of your mortal enemy for instance added she with assumed gaiety of manner come we will take the prince for a fresh theme of conversation I had not seen him previously to this evening for a very long time Do you know that I think he looks handsomer than ever Though all but king he has lost none of the winning sweetness and affability of his manner and spite of my republicanism I must confess I have seldom if ever known so irresistible a person Sarah threw a side glance of deep and scrutinising hatred upon her unconscious rival but quickly recovering herself she said gaily Now my dear Clemence you must confess to being a most capricious little lady you have regular alternating paroxysms of admiration and violent dislike for the prince why a few months ago I mean about his first arrival here you were so captivated by him that between ourselves I was half afraid you had lost your heart past all hope of recall Thanks to you replied Madame d Harville smiling my admiration was very short lived for so well did you act up to your character of the prince s sworn foe and such fearful tales did you tell me of his profligacy and misconduct that you succeeded in inspiring me with an aversion as powerful as had been the infatuation which led you to fear for the safety of my heart which by the way I cannot think would ever have been placed in any danger from the attempts of your enemy to disturb its repose since shortly before you gave me those frightful particulars of the prince s character he had quite ceased to honour me with his visits although on the most intimate and friendly terms with my husband Talking of your husband pray is he here to night inquired Sarah No replied Madame d Harville in a tone of embarrassment he preferred remaining at home He seems to me to mix less and less in the world He never liked what is called fashionable gaiety The marquise s agitation visibly increased and Sarah whose quick eye easily perceived it continued The last time I saw him he looked even paler than usual He has been very much out of health lately My dearest Clemence will you permit me to speak to you without reserve Oh yes pray do How comes it that the least allusion to your husband always throws you into such a state of extraordinary alarm and uneasiness What an idea Is it possible you can mean it seriously asked poor Madame d Harville trying to smile Indeed I am quite in earnest rejoined her companion whenever you are speaking of him your countenance assumes even in spite of yourself but how shall I make myself understood and Sarah with the tone and fixed gaze of one who wished to read the most secret thoughts of the person she addressed slowly and emphatically added a look of mingled aversion and fear The fixed pallid features of Madame d Harville at first defied even Sarah s practised eye but her keen gaze soon detected a slight convulsive working of the mouth with a tremulous movement of the under lip of her victim but feeling it unsafe to pursue the subject farther at this moment so as to awaken the marquise s mistrust of her friendly intentions by way therefore of concealing her real suspicions she continued Yes just that sort of dislike any woman would entertain for a peevish jealous ill tempered At this explanation of the countess s meaning as regarded Madame d Harville s imagined dislike for her husband a heavy load seemed taken from her the working of her lip ceased and she replied Let me assure you M d Harville is neither peevish nor jealous Then as if searching for some means of breaking a conversation so painful to her feelings she suddenly exclaimed Ah here comes that tiresome friend of my husband s the Duke de Lucenay I hope he has not seen us Where can he have sprung from I thought he was a thousand miles off It was reported that he had gone somewhere in the East for a year or two and behold at the end of five months here he is back again His unexpected arrival must have sadly annoyed the Duchess de Lucenay though poor De Lucenay is a very inoffensive creature said Sarah with an ill natured smile Nor will Madame de Lucenay be the only one to feel vexation at his thus changing his mind her friend M de saint Remy will duly and affectionately sympathise in all her regrets on the subject Come come my dear Sarah I cannot allow you to scandalise say that this return of M de Lucenay is a nuisance to everybody the duke is sufficiently disagreeable for you to generalise the regret his unexpected presence occasions I do not slander I merely repeat It is also said that M de saint Remy the model of our young elegantes whose splendid doings have filled all Paris is all but ruined Tis true he has by no means reduced either his establishment or his expenditure however there are several ways of accounting for that in the first place Madame de Lucenay is immensely rich What a horrible idea Still I only repeat what others say There the duke sees us he is coming towards us we must resign ourselves to our fate miserable is it not I know nothing so hard to bear as that man s company he makes himself so very disagreeable and then laughs so disgustingly loud at the silly things he says Indeed he is so boisterous that the bare idea of him makes one think of pretending to faint or any other pretext to avoid him Talking of fainting pray let me beg of you if you have the least regard for your fan or
