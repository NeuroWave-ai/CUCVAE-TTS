6636-74078-0000	train-other-500	I calculated as how it would be a good time to come down here
none	none	 Folks at home said I d be buncoed or have my pockets picked fore I d bin here mor n half an hour 
6636-74078-0001	train-other-500	wall I fooled em a little bit I wuz here three days afore they buncoed me
none	none	 I spose as how there are a good many of them thar bunco fellers around New York but I tell you them thar street keer conductors take mighty good care on you I wuz ridin along in one of them keers had my pockit book right in my hand I alowed no feller would pick my pockits and git it long as I had it in my hand and it shet up tight as a barrel when the cider s workin Wall that conductor feller he jest kept his eye on me and every little bit he d put his head in the door and say 
6636-74078-0002	train-other-500	hold fast But I m transgressin from what I started to tell ye I wuz ridin along in one of them sleepin keers comin here and along in the night some time I felt a feller rummagin around under my bed
6636-74078-0003	train-other-500	and I looked out jest in time to see him goin away with my boots wall I knowed the way that train wuz a runnin he couldn t git off with them without breakin his durned neck but in about half an hour he brot them back
none	none	 guess they didn t fit him Wall I wuz sort of glad he took em cause he hed em all shined up slicker n a new tin whistle 
6636-74078-0004	train-other-500	Wall when I got up in the mornin my trubbles commenced I wuz so crouded up like durned if I could git my clothes on and when I did git em on durned if my pants wa nt on hind side afore
none	none	 and my socks got all tangled up in that little fish net along side of the bed and I couldn t git em out and I lost a bran new collar button that I traded Si Pettingill a huskin peg fer 
6636-74078-0005	train-other-500	and I got my right boot on my left foot and the left one on the right foot and I wuz so durned badly mixed up I didn t know which way the train wuz a runnin and I bumped my head on the roof of the bed over me
6636-74078-0006	train-other-500	and then sot down right suddin like to think it over when some feller cum along and stepped right squar on my bunion and I let out a war whoop you could a heerd over in the next county
6636-74078-0007	train-other-500	Wall along cum that durned porter and told me I wuz a wakin up everybody in the keer Then I started in to hunt fer my collar button cause I sot a right smart store by that button thar warns another one like it in Punkin Centre
6636-74078-0008	train-other-500	and I thought it would be kind of doubtful if they d have any like it in New York
none	none	 wall I see one stuck right in the wall so I tried to git it out with my jack knife 
6636-74078-0009	train-other-500	when along came that durned black jumpin jack dressed in soldier clothes and ast me what I wanted and I told him I didn t want anything perticler
none	none	 then he told me to quit ringin the bell guess he wuz a little crazy I didn t see no bell Wall finally I got my clothes on and went into a room whar they had a row of little troughs to wash in 
6636-74078-0010	train-other-500	and fast as I could pump water in the durned thing it run out of a little hole in the bottom of the trough so I jest had to grab a handful and then pump some more
none	none	 Wall after that things went along purty well fer a right smart while 
6636-74078-0011	train-other-500	then I et a snack out of my carpet bag and felt purty good Wall that train got to runnin slower and slower till it stopped at every house and when it cum to a double house
none	none	 it stopped twice I hed my ticket in my hat and I put my head out of the window to look at suthin 
6636-74078-0012	train-other-500	when the wind blew my hat off and I lost the durned old ticket
none	none	 wall the conductor made me buy another one 
6636-74078-0013	train-other-500	I hed to buy two tickets to ride once but I fooled him he don t know a durned thing about it and when he finds it out he s goin to be the maddest conductor on that railroad I got a round trip ticket and I ain t a goin back on his durned old road
6636-74078-0014	train-other-500	When I got off the ferry boat down here I commenced to think I wuz about the best lookin old feller what ever cum to New York
none	none	 thar wuz a lot of fellers down thar with buggies and kerridges and one thing and another 
6636-74078-0015	train-other-500	and jest the minnit they seen me they all commenced to holler handsome handsome
none	none	 I didn t know I wuz so durned good lookin One feller tried to git my carpet bag and another tried to git my umbreller and I jest told em to stand back or durned if I wouldn t take a wrestle out of one or two of them then I asked one of em if he could haul me up to the Sturtevessant hotel and by gosh I never heered a feller stutter like that feller did in all my life he said ye ye ye yes sir and I said wall how much air you a goin to charge me and he said f f f fif fif fifty c c cents and I sed wall I guess I ll ride with you but don t stop to talk about it any more cause I d kinder like to git thar Wall we started out and when we stopped we wuz away up at the other end of the town whar thar warn t many houses and I sed to him this here ain t the Sturtevessant hotel and he sed n n n no n s s n no sir I sed why didn t you let me out at the hotel like I told ye and he sed b b b be c c c b b be cause I c c c c couldn t s s s say w w w whoa q q q q quick enough Wall I hed a great time with that feller but I got here at last Uncle Josh in Society WALL I did nt suppose when I cum down here to New York that I wuz a goin to flop right into the middle of high toned society but I guess that s jist about what I done You see I had an old friend a livin down here named Henry Higgins and I wanted to see Henry mighty bad Henry and me we wuz boys together down home at Punkin Centre and I hadn t seen him in a long time Wall I got a feller to look up his name in the city almanac and he showed me whar Henry lived away up on a street called avenue five Wall when I seen Henry s house it jist about took my breath away I wuz that clar sot back Henry s house is a good deal bigger n the court house at Punkin Centre Wall at first I didn t know whether to go in or not but finally I mustered up my courage and I went up and rang some new fangled door bell when a feller with knee britches on cum out and wanted to know who it wuz I wanted to see Gosh I couldn t say anything fer about a minnit that feller jist looked to me like a picter I d seen in a story book Wall finally I told him I wanted to see Henry Higgins if it wuz the same Henry I used to know down home at Punkin Centre Wall I guess Henry he must a heered me talkin cause he jist cum out and grabbed me by both hands and sed why Josh Weathersby how do you do cum right in Wall he took me into the house and introduced me to more wimmin folks than I ever seen before in all my life at one time I guess they were havin some kind of society doins at Henry s house one old lady sed to me my dear mister Weathersby I am so pleased to meet you I ve heered mister Higgins speak about you so often Wall by chowder I got to blushin so it cum pretty near settin my hair on fire but I sed wall now I m right glad to know you you kind er put me in mind of old Nancy Smith down hum and Nancy she s bin tryin to git married past forty seasons that I kin remember on Wall Henry took me off into a room by myself and when I got on my store clothes and my new calf skin boots I tell you I looked about as scrimptious as any of them Wall they had a dance I think they called it a cowtillion and that wuz whar I wuz right to hum I jist hopped out on the floor balanced to partners swung on the corners and cut up more capers than any young feller thar it jist looked as if all the ladies wanted to dance with me One lady wanted to know if I danced the german but I told her I only danced in English Wall after that we had something to eat in the dinin room and I hadn t any more n got sot down and got to eatin right good when that durn fool with the knee britches on insulted me he handed me a little wash bowl with a towel round it and I told him he needn t cast any insinuations at me cause I washed my hands afore I cum in If it hadn t a bin in Henry s house I d took a wrestle out of him Wall they had a lot of furrin dishes sumthin what they called beef all over mud and another what they called a charlotte russia a little shavin mug made out of cake and full of sweetened lather wall that was mighty good eatin though it took a lot of them they wasn t very fillin Then they handed me somethin what they called ice cream looked to me like a hunk of casteel soap wall I stuck my fork in it and tried to bite it and it slipped off and got inside my vest and in less than a minnit I wuz froze from my chin to my toes I guess I cut a caper at Henry s house Uncle Josh in a Chinese Laundry I S POSE I got tangled up the other day with the dogondest lookin critter I calculate I ever seen in all my born days and I ve bin around purty considerable I d seen all sorts of cooriosoties and monstrosities in cirkuses and meenagerys but that wuz the fust time I d ever seen a critter with his head and tail on the same end You see I sed to a feller now whar abouts in New York do you folks git your washin done when I left hum to come down here I lowed I had enuff with me to do me but I ve stayed here a little longer than I calculated to and if I don t git some washin done purty soon I ll have to go and jump in the river Wall he wuz a bligin sort of a feller and he told me thar wuz a place round the corner whar a feller done all the washin so I went round and there was a sine on the winder what sed Hop Quick or Hop Soon or jump up and hop or some other kind of a durned hop and then thar wuz a lot of figers on the winder that I couldn t make head nor tail on it jist looked to me like a chicken with mud on its feet had walked over that winder Wall I went in to see bout gittin my washin done and gosh all spruce gum thar was one of them pig tailed heathen Chineeze he jist looked fer all the world like a picter on Aunt Nancy Smith s tea cups I wuz sort of sot back fer a minnit coz I sed to myself I don t spose this durned critter can talk English but seein as how I m in here I might as well find out So I told him I d like to git him to do some washin fer me and he commenced a talkin some outlandish lingo sounded to me like cider runnin out of a jug somethin like ung tong oowong fang kai moi oo ung we velly good washee Wall I understood the last of it and jist took his word fer the rest so I giv him my clothes and he giv me a little yeller ticket that he painted with a brush what he had and I ll jist bet a yoke of steers agin the holler in a log that no livin mortal man could read that ticket it looked like a fly had fell into the ink bottle and then crawled over the paper Wall I showed it to a gentleman what was a standin thar when I cum out and I sed to him mister what in thunder is this here thing and he sed Wall sir that s a sort of a lotery ticket every time you leave your clothes thar to have them washed you git one of them tickets and then you have a chance to draw a prize of some kind So I sed wall now I want to know how much is the blamed thing wuth and he sed I spose bout ten cents and I told him if he wanted my chants for ten cents he could hav it I didn t want to get tangled up in any lotery gamblin bizness with that saucer faced scamp So he giv me ten cents and he took the ticket and in a couple of days I went round to git my washin and that pig tailed heathen he wouldn t let me hev em coz I d lost that lotery ticket So I sed now look here mister Hop Soon if you don t hop round and git me my collars and ciffs and other clothes what I left here I ll be durned if I don t flop you in about a minnit I will by chowder Wall that critter he commenced hoppin around and a talkin faster n a buzz saw could turn and all I could make out wuz mee song lay tang moo me oo lay ung yong wo say mee tickee Wall I seen jist as plain as could be that he wuz a tryin to swindle me outen my clothes so I made a grab fer him and in less n a minnit we wuz a rollin round on the floor fust I wuz on top and then mister Hop Soon wuz on top and you couldn t hav told which one of us the pig tail belonged to We upset the stove and kicked out the winder and I sot mister Hop Soon in the wash tub and when I got out of thar I had somebody s washin in one hand and about five yards of that pig tail in tother and mister Hop Soon he wuz standin thar yellin ung wa moo ye song ki le yung noy song oowe pelecee pelecee pelecee I had quite a time with that heathen critter Uncle Josh in a Museum WHEN I wuz in New York one day I wuz a walkin along down the street when I cum to a theater or play doins of some kind or other so I got to lookin at the picters and I noticed whar it sed it only cost ten cents to go in and I alowed I might as well go in and see it Wall I don t spose I d bin in thar over five minutes afore I made myself the laffin stock of every one in thar I noticed a feller a sottin thar gittin his boots blacked and thar was a durned little pick pockit a pickin his pockits Wall I didn t want to see him git robbed so I went right up to him and I sed look out mister you air gittin your pockits picked wall sir that durned cuss never sed a word and every body commenced to laff and I looked round to see what they wuz a laffin at and it wan t no man at all nothin only a durned old wax figger I never felt so durned foolish since the day I popped the question to Samantha Wall then I looked round a spell longer and thar wuz a feller what they called the human pin cushion and he wuz stuck chock full of needles and pins and looked like a hedge hog he d be a mighty handy feller at a quiltin Wall then a feller cum along and sed everybody over to this end of the hall Wall I went along with the rest of them and durn my buttins if thar wa nt a feller what had more picters painted on him than thar is in a story book Wall I d jist got to lookin at him when that feller what had charge sed right this way everybody and we

from a feller one time he said it wuz a good talker Wall I took it hum and hed it about three months and it never sed a durned word I put in most of my spare time tryin to git it to say Uncle Josh but the durned critter wouldn t do it so I got mad at him one day and throwed him out in the barn yard amongst the chickens and left him thar Wall when I went out the next mornin I tell you thar wuz a sight Half of them chickens wuz dead and the rest of em wuz skeered to death and that durned parrit had a rooster by the neck up agin the barn and jist a givin him an awful whippin and every time he d hit him he d say Now you say Uncle Josh gol durn you you say Uncle Josh Uncle Josh in Wall Street I USED to read in our town paper down home at Punkin Centre a whole lot about Wall street and them

whar it wuz and I ll be durned if I know why they call it Wall street it didn t hav any wall round it I walked up and down it bout an hour and a half and I couldn t find any stock exchange or see any place fer watterin any stock I couldn t see a pig nor a cow nor a sheep nor a calf or anything else that looked like stock to me So finally I sed to a gentleman Mister whar do they keep the menagery down here He sed what menagery I sed the place whar they ve got all them bulls and bears a fitin Wall he looked at me as though he thought I wuz crazy and I guess he did but he sed you cum along with

Finally I sed to one of em Mister what are you a tryin to do with that feller up thar on the table And he sed Wall he s got five thousand bushels of wheat and we are tryin to git it away from him Wall jist the minnit he sed that I knowed fer certain they wuz all crazy cos nobody but a crazy man would ever think he had five thousand bushels of wheat in his coat and pants pockits Wall when they wan t

Fire Department ONE day in New York I thot I d rite a letter home Wall after I d got it all writ I sed to the landlord of the tavern now whar abouts in New York do you keep the post offis And he sed what do you want with the post offis So I told him I d jist writ a letter home to mother and Samantha Ann and I d like to go to the post offis and mail it And he told me you don t have to go to the post offis do you see that little box on the post thar on the corner I alowed as how I did Wall he says You jist go out thar and put your letter in that box and it will go right to the post offis I sed wall now gee whiz ain t that handy Wall I went out thar and I had a good deal of trouble in gittin the box open and when I did git it open thar wan t any place to put my letter thar wuz a lot of notes and hooks and hinges and a lot of readin it sed pull on the hook twice and turn the knob or somethin like that I couldn t jist rightly make it out Wall I yanked on that hook till I tho t I d pull it out by the roots but I couldn t git the durned thing open then I turned on the knob two or three times and that didn t do any good so I pulled on the hook and turned on the knob at the same time and jist then I think all the fire bells in New York commenced to ringin all to onct Wall I looked round to see whar the fire wuz and a lot of fire ingines and hook and ladder wagons cum a gallopin up to whar I stood and they had a big sody water bottle on wheels and it busted and squirted sody water all over me Wall one of them fire fellers lookin jist like I d seen them in picters in Ezra Hoskin s insurance papers he cum up to me madder n a hornet and he sed what are you tryin to do with that box So I told him I d jist writ a letter home and I wuz a tryin to mail it He sed why you durned old green horn you ve called out the hull fire department of New York City Wall I guess you could have knocked me down with a feather I sed wall you r a purty healthy lookin lot of fellers it

whether to touch it or not I didn t know but maybe I d call out the state legislater if I opened it Wall while I wuz a standin thar a feller cum along and looked all round and when he thot thar wan t any body watchin him he opened that box and commenced takin the letters out Wall I d heered a whole lot bout them post offis robbers when I wuz post master down home at Punkin Center so jist arrested

old fashioned cooriositys I saw an old book thar they sed it wuz five hundred years old and it belonged at one time to Loois the Seventeenth or Eighteenth or some of them old rascals durned if I believe anybody could read it Wall I commenced a biddin on different things but it jist looked as though everybody had more money than I did and they sort of out bid me but finally they put up an old

departments at one of them stores but what I want to git is some muzlin and some caliker Wall he showed me which way to go and I started out and wuz walkin along down the street lookin at things when some feller throwed a bananer peelin on the sidewalk Wall now I don t think much of a man what throws a bananer peelin on the sidewalk and I don t think much of a bananer what throws a man on the

baskit and hitched it onto a wire and the durned thing commenced runnin all over the store Wall now you can jist bet your boots I lit out right after it I chased it up one side and down the other I knocked down five or six wimmin clerks and I upset five or six bargain counters I took a wrastle out of that bald headed feller and jist then some one commenced to holler CASH and I sed yep that s what I m after Wall I chased that durned little baskit round til I got up to it and when I did I was right thar whar I started from Gee whiz I never felt more foolish in all my life Prosperity Consists principally of contentment for the man who is contented is prosperous in his own way of thinking though his neighbors may have a different opinion Punkin Centre Philosophy Uncle Josh s Comments on the Signs Seen in New York I SEEN a good many funny things when I wuz in New York but I think some of the sines what they ve got on some of the bildins are bout as funny as anything I ever seen in my life I wuz walkin down the street one day and I seen a sine it sed Quick Lunch Wall I felt a little hungry so I went into the resturant or bordin house or whatever they call it and they had some sines hangin on the walls in thar that jist about made me laff all over I noticed one sine sed Put your trust in the Lord and right under it wuz another sine what sed Try our mince pies Wall I tried one of them and I want to tell you right now if you eat many of them mince pies you want to put your trust in the Lord Wall I got out of thar and I walked along fer quite a spell and finally I cum to a store what had a lot of red white and blue and yeller and purple lights in the winder Wall I stopped to look at it cos it wuz a purty thing and they had a sine in that winder that jist tickled me it sed Frog in your throat tenC I wouldn t put one of them critters in my throat fer ten dollars Wall jist a little further up the street I seen another sine what sed Boots blacked on the inside Now any feller what gits his boots blacked on the inside ain t got much respect fer his socks I git mine blacked on the outside Then I cum to a sine what had a lot of lectric lights shinin on it and I could read it jist as plain as day so I happened to turn round and when I looked at that sine agin it wa nt the same sine at all and jist then it changed right in front of my very eyes and I cum to the conclooshun that some feller on the inside wuz a turnin on it jist to have fun with folks so I cum away but I had a mighty good laff or two watchin other folks git fooled cos it would turn fust one way and then the t other and fore you could make up your mind what it wuz the durned thing wouldn t be that at all A little further up the street I seen a sine what sed This is the door Now any durned fool could see it wuz a door And then I seen another sine what sed Walk in Wall now I wunder how in thunder they thought a feller wuz a goin to cum in on hoss back or on a bisickle or how And then I seen another sine it wuz in a winder and had a lot of tools around it and the sine sed Cast iron sinks Wall now any durned fool what don t know that cast iron sinks ought to have some one feel his head and find out what ails him Uncle Josh on a Street Car NOW I ll jist bet I had more fun to the squar inch while I wuz in New York than any old feller what ever broke out of a New England smoke house I had a little the durnd saint time a ridin on them street cars what they got thar Wall I wa nt a ridin on emnear as much as I wuz a runnin after em tryin to ketch em Gosh I wuz a runnin after street cars and fire ingines and every durned thing with red wheels on it I calculate I run about a mile and a half after a feller one day to tell him the water what he had in his wagon wuz all leakin out and when I caught up to him I found out it wuz a durned old sprinklin cart Wall I got on one of them street cars one day and it wuz purty crowded and thar wa nt any place fer me to sot down so I had to hang onto one of them little harness straps along side of the car So I got holt of a strap and I wuz hangin on when the conductor sed old man you r goin to be in the road thar you d better move up a little further wall I moved up a little ways and I stepped on a feller s toe and gee whiz he got madder n a wet hen he sed can t you see whar you r a steppin I sed guess I kin but you brought them feet in here and I ve got to step some whar Wall every one begin to laff and the conductor sed old man you r makin too much trouble you ll have to move for ard again and I got off n the gosh durned old car I paid him a nickel to ride but I guess I might as well have walked I wuz a walkin purty much all the time I wuz in thar Wall I got onto another car and I got sot down and I never laffed so much in all my life Up in one end of the car thar wuz a little slim lady and right along side of her wuz a big fleshy lady and it didn t look as though the little slim lady wuz a gittin more n about two cents and a half worth of room so finally she turned round to the fleshy lady and sed they ought to charge by weight on this line and the big lady sed Wall if they did they wouldn t stop fer you Gosh I had to snicker right out loud Thar wuz a little boy a sottin alongside of the big lady and three ladys got onto the car all to onct and thar wa nt any place fer em to sot down and so the big lady sed little boy you d oughter git up and let one of them ladys sot down and the little boy sed you git up and they can all sot down Wall by that time your uncle wuz a laffin right out Sottin right alongside of me wuz a lady and she had the purtiest little baby I calculate I d ever seen in all my born days I wanted to be sociable with the little feller so I jist sort of waved my hand at him and sed how d e do baby and that lady just looked et me scornful like and sed rubber wall I wuz never more sot back I guess you could have knocked me down with a feather I thought it was a genuine baby I didn t know the little thing was rubber Wall I noticed up in one end of the car thar wuz a little round masheen and the conductor had a clothes line tied to it and every time he got a nickel he d yank on that clothes line and fust it sed in and then it sed out I couldn t tell what all them little ins and outs meant but I jist cum to the conclusion it showed how much the conductor wuz in and the company wuz out Wall I got to talkin to that feller on the front end of the car and he wuz a purty nice sort of a feller he showed me how every thing worked and told me all about it wall when I got off I sed good bye mister hope I ll see you agin some time and he sed oh I ll run across you one of these days I told him by gosh he wouldn t run across me if I seen him a comin My Fust Pair of Copper Toed Boots THAR S a feelin of pleasure mixed in with some pain That over my memory scoots When I think of my boyhood days once again And my fust pair of copper toed boots How our folks stood around when I fust tried them on And bravely marched out on the floor And father remarked thar a mighty good fit And the best to be had at the store That night I remember I took them to bed With the rest of us little galoots And among other things in my prars which I sed Wuz a reference to copper toed boots And then in the mornin the fust one on hand Wuz me and my new acquisition And thar wuzn t a spot in the house that I missed From the garret clar down to the kitchen Then with feelin s expandin and huntin fer room I concluded I d help do the chores Fer I felt as though somethin wuz goin to bust If I didn t git right out of doors But those boots they were new and the ice it wuz slick And I couldn t get one way or tother And I jist had to stand right there in one spot And holler like thunder fer mother But trouble s a blessing sometimes in disguise Fer I larned right thar on the spot That the best sort of knowledge to hav in this world Is that by experience taught So though many years have since passed away And I ve ventured on various routes I m still tryin things jist as risky today As my fust pair of copper toed boots Uncle Josh in Police Court I NEVER wuz in a town in my life what had as many cort houses in it as New York has got It jist seemed to me like every judge in New York had a cort house of his own and most of them cort houses seemed to be along side of some markit house Thar wuz the Jefferson Markit Cort and the Essicks Markit Cort and several other corts and markits and markits and corts I can t remember now Wall I used to be Jestice of the Peece down home at Punkin Center and I wuz a little anxious to see how they handled law and jestice in New York City so one mornin I went down to one of them cort houses and thar wuz more different kinds of people in thar than I ever seen afore Thar wuz all kinds of nationalitys Norweegans Germans Sweeds Hebrews and Skandynavians Irish and colored folks old and young dirty and clean good bad and worse The Judge he wuz a sottin up on the bench and a sayin Ten days ten dollars Geery society foundlin asylum case dismissed bring in the next prisoner and the Lord only knows what else Wall some of the cases they tried in that cort house made me snicker right out loud They brought in a little Irish feller and the Judge sed Prisoner what is your name And the little Irish feller sed Judge your honor my name is McGiness Patrick McGiness And the Judge sed mister McGiness what is your occupation And the little Irish feller sed Judge your honor I am a sailor The Judge sed mister McGiness you don t look to me as though you ever saw a ship in all your life And the little Irish feller sed Wall Judge your honor if I never saw a ship in me life do you think I cum over from Ireland in a wagon The Judge sed Case dismissed Bring in the next prisoner Wall the next prisoner what they brought in had sort of an impediment in his talk and the way he stuttered jist beat all The Judge sed Prisoner what is your name And the prisoner sed Jd Jd J J Judge yr yr yo yo your h h h honorable honorable honor m mm my my n n na na name is is is The Judge sed Never mind that will do Officer what is this prisoner charged with And the officer sed Judge your honor the way he talks sounds to me like he might be charged with sody water Gosh I got to laffin so I had to git right out of the cort house It sort of made me think of a law soot we had down hum when Jim Lawson wuz Jestice of the Peece You see it wuz like this One spring Si Pettingill wuz goin out to Mizoori to be gone bout a year and he d sold off bout all his things cept one cow and he didn t want to part with the cow cause she wuz a mighty good milker so he struck a bargin with Lige Willet Lige wuz to keep the cow paster and feed her and generally take keer on her fer the milk she giv Wall finally Si cum hum and he went to Lige s place one day and sed Wall Lige I ve cum over to git my cow And Lige sed Cum after your cow Wall if you ve got any cow round here I ll be durned if I know it Si sed Wall Lige I left my cow with you And Lige sed Wall that s a year ago and she s et her head off two or three times since then So Si sed Wall Lige you ve had her milk fer her keep And Lige sed Milk be durned she went dry three weeks after you left and she ain t give any milk since and near as I can figger it out seems to me as how I ve pestered her and fed her all this time she s my cow Si sed No Lige that wa nt the bargin But Lige sed Bargin or no bargin I ve got her and seein as how posession is bout nine points in the law I m goin to keep her So they went to law about it and all Punkin Centre turned out to heer the trial Wall after Jim Lawson had heered both sides of the case he sed The Cort is compelled from the evidence sot forth in this case to find for the plaintiff the aforesaid Silas Pettingill as agin the defendant the aforesaid Elijah Willet We find from the evidence sot forth that the cow critter in question is a valuable critter and wuth more n a year s paster and keep and tharfore it is the verdict of this cort that the aforesaid defendant Elijah Willet shall keep the cow two weeks longer and then she is hisn Uncle Josh at Coney Island I D heerd tell a whole lot at various times bout that place what they call Coney Iland and while I wuz down In New York I jist made up my mind I wuz a goin to see it so one day I got on one of them keers what goes across the Brooklyn bridge and I started out for Coney Iland Settin right along side of me in the keer wuz an old lady and she seemed sort of figity bout somethin or other and finaly she sed to me mister do these cars stop when we git on the other side of the bridge I sed wall now if they don t you ll git the durndest bump you ever got in your life Wall we got on the other side and I got on one of them tra la lu cars what goes down to Coney Iland I give the car feller a dollar and he put it in his pockit jist the same as if it belonged to him Wall when I wuz gittin purty near thar I sed Mister don t I git any change He sed didn t you see that sign on the car I sed no sir Wall he sez you better go out and look at it Wall I went out and looked at it and that settled it It sed This car goes to Coney Iland without change Guess it did I ll be durned if I got any Wall we got down thar and I must say of all the pandemonium and hubbub I ever heered in my life Coney Iland beats it all Bout the fust thing I seen thar wuz a place what they called Shoot the Shoots It looked like a big hoss troff stood on end one end in a duck pond and tother end up in the air and they would haul a boat up to the top and all git in and then cum scootin down the hoss troff into the pond Wall I alowed that ud be right smart fun so I got into one of the boats along with a lot of other folks I never seed afore and don t keer if I never see agin They yanked us up to the top of that troff and then turned us loose and I jist felt as though the whole earth had run off and left us We went down that troff lickety split and a woman what wuz settin alongside of me got skeered and grabbed me round the neck and I sed you let go of me you brazen female critter But she jist hung on and hollered to beat thunder and everybody wuz a yellin all to onct and that durned boat wuz a goin faster n greased lightnin and I had one hand on my pockit book and tother on my hat and we went kerslap dab into that duck pond and the durned boat upsot and we went into the water and that durned female critter hung onto me and hollered save me I m jist a drownin Wall the water wasn t very deep and I jist started to wade out when along cum another boat and run over us and under we went ker souse Wall I managed to get out to the bank and that female woman sed I was a base vilian to not rescue a lady from a watery grave And I jist told her if she had kept her mouth shet she wouldn t hav swallered so much of the pond Wall they had one place what they called the Middle Way Plesumps and another place what they called The Streets of Caro and they had a lot of shows a goin on along thar Wall I went into one of em and sot down and I guess if they hadn t of shet up the show I d a bin sottin thar yet I purty near busted my buttins a laffin They had a lot of gals a dancin some kind of a dance I don t know what they called it but it sooted me fust rate When I got home the more I thought about it the more I made up my mind I d learn that dance Wall I went out in the corn field whar none of the neighbors could see me and I ll be durned if I didn t knock down about four akers of corn but I never got that dance right I wuz the talk of the whole community mother didn t speak to me fer about a week and Aunt Nancy Smith sed I wuz a burnin shame and a disgrace to the village but I notice Nancy has asked me a good many questions about jist how it was and I wouldn t wonder if we didn t find Nancy out in the cornfield one of these days Uncle Josh at the Opera WALL I sed to mother when I left hum now mother when I git down to New York City I m goin to see a regular first class theater We never had many theater doin s down our way Wall thar wuz a theater troop cum to Punkin Centre along last summer but we couldn t let em hav the Opery House to show in cause it wuz summer time and the Opery House wuz full of hay and we couldn t let em hav it cause we hadn t any place to put the hay An then about a year and a half ago thar wuz a troop cum along that wuz somethin about Uncle Tom s home they left a good many of their things behind em when they went away Ezra Hoskins he got one of the mules and he tried to hitch it up one day Doctor says he thinks Ezra will be around in about six weeks I traded one of the dogs to Ruben Hendricks fer a shot gun Rube cum over t other day borrowed the gun and shot the dog Wall I got into one of your theaters here got sot down and wuz lookin at it and it wuz a mighty fine lookin pictur with a lot of lights shinin on it and I wuz enjoyin it fust rate when a lot of fellers cum out with horns and fiddles and they all started in to fiddlin and tootin end all to once they pulled the theatre up and thar wuz a lot of folks having a regular family quarrel I knowed that wasn t any of my business and I sort of felt uneasy like but none of the rest of the folks seemed to mind it any so I calculated I d see how it cum out though my hands sort of itched to get hold of one feller cause I could see if he would jest go way and tend to his own business thar wouldn t be any quarrel Wall jest then a young feller handed me a piece of paper what told all about the theater doin s and I got to lookin at that and I noticed on it whar it sed thar wuz five years took place tween the fust part and the second part I knowed durned well I wouldn t have time to wait and see the second part so I got up and went out Wall them theater doin s jest put me in mind of somethin what happened down hum on the last day of school You see the school teacher got all the big boys and the big girls and the boys they read essays and the girls recited poetry One of the Skinner girls recited a piece that sooted me fust rate Neer as I kin remember it went somethin like this How nice to hear the bumble bee When you go out a fishin But if you happen to sot down on him He ll spoil your disposition I liked that thar wuz somethin so touchin about it Then the school teacher he got all the girls in the stronomy class and he dressed them up to represent the different kinds of planits He had one girl to represent the sun she wuz red headed and another one to represent the moon and another one fer Mars and another one fer Jerupetir and it looked mighty fine and everythin wuz a gettin along fust rate til old Jim Lawson lowed he could make an improvement on it so he went out and got a colord girl and he wanted to sot her between the sun and the moon and make an eklips And as usual he busted up the whole doin s Uncle Josh at Delmonico s I USED to hear the summer boarders tell a whole lot about a place here in New York kept by mister Delmonico Thar s bin about ten thousand summer boarders down to Punkin Centre one time and another and I guess I ve carried the bundles and stood the grumblin from about all of them and when anyone of em would find fault with anythin I used to ast him whar he boarded at in New York and they all told me at mister Delmonico s so I d cum to the conclusion that mister Delmonico must hav a right smart purty good sized tavern and I sed to mother now mother when I git down to New York that s whar I m goin to board at mister Delmonico s Wall I got a feller to show me whar it wuz and when I got on the inside I don t s pose I wuz ever more sot back in all my life guess you could have knocked my eyes off with a club they stuck out like bumps on a log Wall sir they had flowers and birds everywhere and trees a settin in wash tubs didn t look to me as though they would stand much of a gale and about a hundred and fifty patent wind mills runnin all to onct and out in the woods somewhar they had a band a playin I couldn t see em but I could hear em guess some of em wuz a havin a dance to settle down their dinner I couldn t tell whether it was a society festival or a camp meetin at feedin time Wall one feller cum up to me and commenced talkin some furrin language I didn t understand somethin about bon sour mon sour I jist made up my mind he wuz one of them bunco fellers and I wouldn t talk to him Then another feller cum up right smart like and wanted to know if I d hav my dinner table de hotel or all over a card and I told him if it wuz all the same to him he could bring me my dinner on a plate Wall he handed me a programme of the dinner and I et about half way down it and drank a bottle of cider pop what he give me and it got into my head and I never felt so durn good in all my life I got to singin and I danced Old Dan Tucker right thar in the dinin room and I took a wrestle out of mister bon sour mon sour and jist when I got to enjoyin myself right good they called in a lot of constables and it cost me sixteen dollars and forty five cents and then they took me out ridin in a little blue wagon with a bell on it and they kept ringin the bell every foot of the way to let folks know I wuz one of mister Delmonico s boarders It is Fall THE days are gettin shorter and the summer birds are leaving The wind sighs in the tree tops as though all nature was grieving The leaves they drop in showers there s a blue haze over all And a feller is reminded that once again it s Fall It is a glorious season the crops most gathered in The wheat is in the granary and the oats are in the bin A feller jest feels splendid right in harmony with all The old cider mill a humin gosh I know it s Fall I hear the Bob White whistlin down by the water mill While dressed in gorgeous colors is each valley knoll and hill The cows they are a lowing as they slowly wander home And the hives are just a bustin with the honey in the comb Soon be time for huskin parties or an apple paring bee And the signs of peace and plenty are just splendid for to see The flowers they are drooping soon there won t be none at all Old Jack Frost has nipped them and by that I know it s Fall The muskrat has built himself a house down by the old mill pond The squirrels are laying up their store from the chestnut trees beyond While walking through the orchard I can hear the ripe fruit fall There s an air of quiet comfort that only comes with Fall The wind is cool and bracing and it makes you feel first rate And there s work to keep you going from early until late So you feel like giving praises unto Him who doeth all Nature heaps her blessings on you at this season and it s Fall The nights are getting frosty and the fire feels pretty good I like to see the flames creep up among the burning wood Away across the hilltops I can hear the hoot owl call He is looking for his supper I guess he knows its Fall And though the year is getting old and the trees will soon be bare There s a satisfactory feeling of enough and some to spare For there s still some poor and needy who for our help do call So we ll share with them our blessings and be thankful that it s Fall Si Pettingill s Brooms WALL one day jist shortly after sap season wuz over we wuz all sottin round Ezra Hoskins s store talkin on things in general when up drove Si Pettingill with a load of brooms Wall we all took a long breath and got ready to see some as tall bargainin as wuz ever done in Punkin Centre Cause Si he could see a bargain through a six inch plank on a dark night and Ezra could hear a dollar bill rattle in a bag of feathers a mile off and we all felt mighty sartin suthin wuz a goin to happen Wall Si he sort er stood round didn t say much and Ezra got most uncommonly busy he had more business than a town marshal on circus day Wall after he had sold Aunt Nancy Smith three yards of caliker and Ruben Hendricks a jack knife and swapped Jim Lawson a plug of tobacker fer a muskrat hide he sed How s things over your way Si Si remarked things wuz bout as usual only the water had bin most uncommon high White Fork had busted loose and overflowed everything Sprosby s mill wuz washed out and Lige Willits s paster wuz all under water which made it purty hard on the cows and Lige had to strain the milk two or three times to git the minnews out of it Whitaker s young uns wuz all havin measles to onct and thar wuz a revival goin on at the Red Top Baptist church and most every one had got religion and things wuz a runnin long bout as usual Deacon Witherspoon sed Did you git religion Si Si sed No Deacon I got baptized but it didn t take calculated I might as well have it done while thar wuz plenty of water Thought I d cum over today Ezra I ve got some brooms I d like to sell ye Ezra sed Bring em in Si spring house cleanin is comin on and I ll most likely need right smart of brooms so jist bring em in Si sed Wall Ezra don t see as thar s any need to crowd the mourners can t we dicker on it a little bit I want cash fer these brooms Ezra I don t want any store trade fer em Ezra sed Wall I don t know bout that Si seems to me that s a gray hoss of another color I always gin ye store trade fer your eggs don t I Si sed Y a s and that s a gray hoss of another color ye never seen a hen lay brooms did ye Brooms is sort of article of commerce Ezra and I want cash fer em Wall Ezra he looked round the store and thot fer a spell and then he sed Tell ye what I ll do Si I ll gin ye half cash and the other half trade how ll that be Si sed Guess that ll be all right Ezra Whar will I put the brooms Ezra sed Put them in the back end of the store Si and stack em up good I hadn t got much room and I ve got a lot of things comin in from Boston and New York Wall after Si had the brooms all in he sed Wall thar they be five dozen on em Ezra sed Sure thar s five dozen Si sed Yas counted em on the wagon counted em off agin and counted em when I made em So Ezra sed Wall here s your money now what do you want in trade Si looked round fer a spell and sed I don t know Ezra don t see anything any of our folks pertickerly stand in need on If it s all the same to you Ezra I ll take BROOMS Wall Jim Lawson fell off n a wash tub and Ruben Hendricks cut his thumb with his new jack knife and Deacon Witherspoon sed No Si that baptizin didn t take And Ezra wall it wan t his say Suspicion Consists mainly of thinking what we would do if we wuz in the other feller s place Punkin Centre Philosophy Uncle Josh Plays Golf WALL about two weeks ago the boys sed to me Uncle we d like to hav you cum out and play a game of golf Wall they took me out behind the woodshed whar mother couldn t see us and them durned boys dressed your uncle up in the dogondest suit of clothes I ever had on in my life I had on a pair of socks that had more different colors in em than in Joseph s coat I looked like a cross atween a monkey and a cirkus rider and a goin across the medder our turkey gobbler took after me and I had an awful time with that fool bird I calculate as how I ll git even with him bout Thanksgiving time Wall the boys took me into the paster and they had it all dug up into what they called a T and they had a wheelbarrer full of little Injun war clubs They called one a nibbler and another a brassie and a lot of other fool names I never heerd afore and can t remember now Then they brought out a little wooden ball bout as big as a hen s egg and they stuck it up on a little hunk of mud Then they told me to take one of them thar war clubs and stand alongside of the ball and hit it Wall I jist peeled off my coat and got a good holt on that war club and I jist whaled away at that durned little ball and by gum I missed it and the boys all commenced to holler foozle Wall I got a little bit riled and I whaled away at it again and I hit it right whar I missed it the fust time and I whirled round and sot down so durned hard I sot four back teeth to akin and I pawed round in the air and knocked a lot of it out of place I hit myself on the shin and on the pet corn at the same time and them durned boys wuz jist a rollin round on the ground and a hollerin like Injuns Wall I begun to git madder n a wet hen and I lowed I d knock that durned little ball way over into the next county So I rolled up my sleeves and spit on my hands and got a good holt on that war club and I whaled away at that little ball agin and by chowder I hit it I knocked it clar over into Deacon Witherspoon s paster and hit his old muley cow and she got skeered and run away jumped the fence and went down the road and the durned fool never stopped a runnin til she went slap dab into Ezra Hoskins grocery store upsot four gallons of apple butter into a keg of soft soap and sot one foot into a tub of mackral and t other foot into a box of winder glass and knocked over Jim Lawson who wuz sottin on a cracker barrel and broke his durned old wooden leg and then she went right out through the winder and skeered Si Pettingill s hosses that wuz a standin thar and they run away and smashed his wagon into kindlin wood and Silas has sued me fer damages and mother won t speak to me and Jim he wants me to buy him a new wooden leg and the neighbors all say as how I ought to be put away some place fer safe keepin and Aunt Nancy Smith got so excited she lost her glass eye and didn t find it for three or four days and when she did git it the boys wuz a playin marbles with it and it wuz all full of gaps and Jim Lawson he trimmed it up on the grindstane and it don t fit Nancy any more and she has to sort of put it in with cotton round it to bold it and the cotton works out at the corners and skeers the children and every time I see Nancy that durned eye seems to look at me sort of reproachful like and all I know about playin golf is the feller what knocks the ball so durned far you can t find it or whar it does the most damage wins the game Jim Lawson s Hogs WHEN it cum to raisin hogs I don t s pose thar wuz ever enybody in Punkin Centre that had quite so much trouble as Jim Lawson One fall Jim had a right likely bunch of shoats but somehow or other he couldn t git em fat it jist seemed like the more he fed em the poorer they got and Jim he wuz jist about worried clar down to a shadder He kept givin them hogs medecin and feedin of em everything he could think on but it wan t no use every day or so one of em would lay down and die All the neighbors would cum and lean over the fence and talk to Jim and give him advice but somehow them hogs jist kept on a dyin and nobody could see what wuz alin of em til one day Jim cum over to Ezra Hoskins s store and he looked as tickled as though he d found a dollar and he sed I want you all to cum over to my place I ve found out what s alin them hogs Deacon Witherspoon sed Wall what is it Jim and Jim sed Wall you see the ground over in my hog lot is purty soft and when it rains it gits right smart muddy and the mud gits on them hogs tails and that mud it gits more mud and finally they git so much mud on their tails that it draws their skin so tight that they can t shet their eyes and them hogs air jist a dyin fer the want of sleep Wall the followin winter Jim had his hogs all fat and ready fer markit and he jist conclooded he d drive em to Concord Wall he started out and when he d drov em two whole days he met old Jabez Whitaker Jabe sed Whar you goin with your hogs Jim Jim sed Goin to Concord Jabez Jabez sed Wall now I want to know That s what cums from not readin the papers Why Jim they ve got more hogs up Concord way than they know what to do with Lige Willit took his hogs up thar and Eben Sprosby took his n and Concord s jist chuck full of hogs and so consequintly the markit s away down in Concord But the paper sez it s good in Manchester and you d make money Jim by goin thar So Jim shifted his chew of terbacker over to the northeast and sed Wall boys I calculate we ll hav to go to Manchester so jist head the hogs off and turn them round Wall they druv them hogs bout three days towards Manchester and jist bout when they wuz gittin thar along cum Caleb Skinner and he sed Wall thunder and fish hooks whar be you a goin Jim And Jim sed As near as he could figure it out from his present bearin s he wuz most likely goin to Manchester And Caleb sed What fer Jim sed Didn t know exactly what all he wuz goin fer but if he ever got thar he d most likely sell his hogs And Caleb sed Wall your goin to the wrong town Manchester has got a quarantine agin any more hogs comin in cos what hogs they is thar has all got colery and you d better go to Concord Besides the paper says markit is purty well up in Concord Wall Jim sed a good many things that wouldn t sound good at a prayer meetin and then he sed Wall boys gess we ll start back fer Concord so turn round Wall they went along bout two days and them poor hogs couldn t stand it no longer cos they wuz jist clean tuckered out so Jim had to sell em to Josiah Martin fer what he could git cos it wuz jist right at Josiah s place whar the hogs gin out and thar wan t no way of moovin them from thar fer some time to cum Wall along bout two weeks after that we wuz all over to Ezra Hoskins s store and some one sed Jim you didn t do very well with your hogs this year did you And Jim sed Oh I don t know that s jist owin to how you look at it I never caught up to that blamed markit but I had the society of the hogs fer two weeks Uncle Josh and the Lightning Rod Agent WALL I s pose I git buncode offener than any feller what ever lived in Punkin Centre A short time ago we wanted to build a new town hall and calculated we d have a brick building and some one sed Wall now if you ll jist wait til Josh Weathersby makes another trip or two down to New York thar ll be gold bricks enuff a layin round Punkin Centre to build a new town hall Wall one day last summer I wuz a sottin out on my back porch when along cum one of them thar lightning rod agents Wall he jist cum right up and commenced a talkin at me jist as if he d bin the town marshal or a tax assessor or like he d known me all his life He sed My dear sir I am astonished at you I ve looked over your entire premises and I find you haven t got a lightning rod on any buildin that you possess Why my dear sir don t you know you are flyin right in the face of Providence Don t you know that lightning may strike at any time and demolish everything within the sound of my voice Don t you know you are criminally negligent Why my dear sir I am astonished to think that a man of your jedgment and good common sense should allow yourself to Wall about that time I d got my breath and wits at the same time and I sed Now hold on gosh durn ye what hav ye got to sell anyhow Wall he told me he had some lightnin rods and he brought out a little masheen and told me to take hold of the handles and he d show me what a powerful thing lectricity wuz Wall I took hold of them handles and he turned on a crank and that durned masheen jist made me dance all over the porch and it wouldn t let go Gee whiz I felt as though I d fell in a yeller jacket s nest and about four thousand of em wuz a stingin me all to onct Wall I told him I guessed he could put up a lightning rod or two seein as how I didn t hav any Wall he went to work and I went over to Ezra Hoskins and when I got back home my place wuz a sight to behold it looked like a harrer turned upside down Thar wuz seven lightning rods on the barn one on the hen house one on the corn crib one on the smoke house two on the granery three on the kitchen six on my house and one on the crab apple tree and when I got thar that durned fool had the old muley cow cornered up a tryin to put a lightnin rod on her Wall I paid him fer what he had done and thanked the Lord he hadn t done any more Wall he got me to sine a paper what sed he had done a good job and he sed he had to show that to the company Wall about a week after that we had a thunder storm and I think the lightnin struck everything on the place except the spring wagon and old muley cow and they didn t have any lightnin rod on em Wall I thought I wuz a gittin off mighty lucky til next day when along cum a feller with that paper what I had sined and durned if it wan t a note fer six hundred dollars and by gosh if I didn t hav to pay it Buncode agin by chowder Energy There is a lot of energy in this life that wasted I notis that the man who has a good strong pipe most usually rides in front Punkin Centre Philosophy A Meeting of the Annanias Club WALL sometimes a lot of us old codgers used to git down to Ezra Hoskins grossery store and we d sot round and chaw terbacker and whittle sticks and eat crackers and cheese and proons and anything Ezra happened to have layin round loos and then we d git to spinnin yarns that would jist about put Annanias and Safiry right out of business if they wuz here now Wall one afternoon we wuz all settin round spinnin yarns when Deacon Witherspoon sed that eckos wuz mighty peculiar things cos down whar he wuz born and raised thar wuz a passell of hills cum together and you couldn t git out thar and talk louder n a whisper on account of the ecko But one day a summer boarder what wuz thar remarked as how he wasn t afraid to talk right out in meetin in front of any old lot of hills what wuz ever created so he went out and hollered jist as loud as he could holler and he started a ecko a goin and it flew up agin one hill and bounced off onto another one and gittin bigger and louder all the time til it got back whar it started from and hit a stone quarry and knocked off a piece of stone and hit that feller in the head and he didn t cum too fer over three hours Wall we thought that wuz purty good fer a Deacon Wall none of us sed anything fer a right smart spell and then Si Pettingill remarked he didn t know anything about eckos but he calculated he d seen some mighty peculiar things sed he guessed he d seen it rain bout as hard as anybody ever seen it rain Someone sed Wall Si how hard did you ever see it rain and he sed Wall one day last summer down our way it got to rainin and it rained so hard that the drops jist rubbed together comin down which made them so allfired hot that they turned into steam why it rained so gosh dinged hard thar wuz a cider bar l layin out in the yard that had both heads out n it and the bung hole up wall it rained so hard into that bung hole that the water couldn t run out of both ends of the bar l fast enough and it swelled up and busted Wall we all took a fresh chew of terbacker and nudged each other and Ezra Hoskins sed he didn t remember as how he d ever seen it rain quite so hard as that but he d seen some mighty dry weather he sed one time when he wuz out in Kansas it got so tarnation dry that fish a swimmin up the river left a cloud of dust behind them And hot too why it got so allfired hot that one day he tied his mule to a pen of popcorn out behind the barn and it got so hot that the corn got to poppin and flyin round that old mule s ears and he thought it wuz snow and laid down and froze to death Wall about that time old Jim Lawson commenced to show signs of uneasiness and someone sed What is it Jim and Jim remarked as he shifted his terbacker and cut a sliver off from his wooden leg I wuz a thinkin about a cold spell we had one winter when we wuz a livin down Nantucket way It wuz hog killin time if I remember right anyhow we had a kittle of bilin water sottin on the fire and we sot it out doors to cool off a little and that water froze so durned quick that the ice wuz hot Ezra sed Guess its bout shettin up time Jim Lawson s Hoss Trade SPEAKIN of hoss tradin now Jim Lawson was calculated to be about the best hoss trader in Punkin Centre Yes Jim he could sot up on a fence chew terbacker whittle a stick and jist about swap ye outen your eye teeth if you d listen to him Yas Jim wuz some punkins on a swap Jim d swap anything he had fer anything he didn t want jist to be swappin Wall a gypsy cum along one day and tackled Jim fer a swap and about that time Jim he d got hold of a critter that had more cussedness in him to the squar inch than any critter we d ever sot eyes on cept a cirkus mule that Ezra Hoskins owned Wall the gypsy traded Jim a mighty fine lookin critter and we all calculated that Jim had right smart of a bargain til one day Jim went to ride him n he found out if he fetched the peskey critter on the sides he d squat right down Wall Jim knowed if he didn t git rid of that hoss his reputation as a hoss trader wuz forever gone so he went over in t other township to see old Deacon Witherspoon You see the Deacon he wuz mighty fond of goin a huntin and as he had rheumatiz purty bad it wuz sort of hard fer him to git round so he had to do his huntin on hoss back Wall Jim didn t say much to fuss just kinder hinted around that huntin was a goin to be mighty good this fall cos he d seen one or two flocks of partridges over back of Sprosby s medder and some right smart of quail over by Buttermilk ford and finally he sed Deacon I ve got a hoss you ought to hev he s a setter Wall you could hav knocked the Deacon s eyes off with a club they stuck out like bumps on a log and he sed Why Jim I never heered tell of sech a thing in all my life the idea of a horse being a setter Jim sed Yes Deacon he s bin trained to set for all kinds of game I calculated as how I d git a shotgun this fall and do right smart of hunting So the Deacon sed Wall now I want to know bring him over Jim I d like to see him Wall Jim took the hoss over and all Punkin Centre jest sort of held its breath to see how it would cum out Jim and the Deacon went a hunting and as they wuz a ridin along through the timber down by Ruben Hendrick s paster Jim keepin his eyes peeled and not sayin much when all to onct he seen a rabbit settin in a brush heap and he jist tetched the old hoss on the sides and he squatted right down The Deacon sed Why what s the matter of your hoss Jim look what he be a doin Jim sed Sh Deacon don t you see that rabbit over thar in the brush heap the old hoss is a settin of him Deacon sed Wall now that s the most remarkable thing I ever seen in my life how d you like to trade Jim Jim sed Wall Deacon I hadn t calculated on disposin of the hoss but I ain t much of a hand at huntin and seein as how it s you if you want him I ll trade you Deacon fifty dollars to boot Wall the Deacon had a mighty fine animal but he sed I ll trade you Jim They traded hosses and when they wuz a comin home they had to ford the crick what runs back of Punkin Centre and when the old hoss wuz a wadin through the water Deacon went to pull his feet up to keep them from gettin wet and he tetched the old boss on the sides and he squatted right down in the crick Deacon sed Now look a here Jim what s the matter with this ungodly brute he ain t a settin now be he Jim sed Yes he is Deacon he sees fish in the water tell you he s trained to set fer suckers same as fer rabbits Deacon oh he s had a thorough eddication Paradox I can t exactly describe it but it looks to me like a tramp who once told me how to be successful in life Punkin Centre Philosophy A Meeting of the School Directors WE had bin havin a good deal of argufyin about the school house You see it had got to be a sort of a tumble down ram shackle sort of an affair and when it wuz bad weather we couldn t have school in it cause you might jist as well be a sittin under a siv when it rained as to be a settin in that school house Wall it wuz a cummin along the fall term and we wanted our boys and girls to git all the schoolin an eddication what they could so we called a meetin of the school directors to devise ways and means of buildin a new school house without stoppin school Wall we all met down at the school house thar wuz Deacon Witherspoon Ezra Hoskins Ruben Hendricks Si Pettingill old Jim Lawson and me Before we commenced debatin and argufyin on the matter Si Pettingill alowed he d sing a song Wall he got up and sang the durndest old fashioned song I calculate I ever heered in my life went somethin like this Oh a frog went a courtin and he did ride oohoo oohoo Oh a frog went a courtin and he did ride With a sword and a pistol by his side oohoo oohoo He rode till he came to the mouse s door oohoo oohoo He rode till he came to the mouse s door And there he knelt upon the floor oohoo oohoo He took Miss Mousey on his knee oohoo oohoo He took Miss Mousey on his knee Said he Missy Mouse will you marry me oohoo oohoo Wall we headed Si off right thar I guess if we hadn t he d bin singin about that frog and the mouse yet Wall jist then old Jim Lawson he sed I make a moshen and Deacon Witherspoon he wuz chairman and he sed Now look here young feller don t you make any moshens at me or durned if I don t git down thar and flop you in about a minnit You take your feet off n that desk and that corncob pipe out n your mouth and conduct yourself with dignity and decorum and address the chairman of this yere meetin in a manner benttin to his station Wall Jim he got right smart riled over the matter and he sed Wall you gosh durned old gospel pirate I want you to understand that I m a member of this body a citizen a taxpayer and a honorably discharged servant of the government and I make a moshen that we build a new school house out of the bricks of the old school house and I do further offer an amendment to the original moshen that we don t tear down the old schoolhouse until the new one is built Wall Deacon Witherspoon sed The gentleman is out of order and Jim sed I ain t so durned much out of order but that I kin trim you in about two shakes of a dead sheep s tail Wall before we knowed it them two old cusses wuz at it The Deacon he grabbed Jim and Jim he grabbed the Deacon and when we got em separated the Deacon he wuz stuck fast tween a desk and the woodbox and Jim had his wooden leg through a knot hole in the floor and couldn t get it out and they ve both gone to law about it Jim says he s goin to git out a writ of corpus cristy fer the Deacon and the Deacon says he s goin to prosecute Jim for bigamy and arson and have him read out of the church Wall we ve got the same old schoolhouse Justice Those who hanker fer it would be generally better off if they didn t git it Punkin Centre Philosophy The Weekly Paper at Punkin Centre WALL t other day down in New York I wuz a walkin along on that street what they call the broad way when I cum to the Herald squar noospaper buildin and it wuz all winders and masheenery Wall I wuz jist flobgasted I jist stood thar lookin at it On the front thar wuz a bell and a couple of fellers standin along side of it with slege hammers in their hands and every onct in a while they would go to poundin on that bell and folks d stand round and watch em do it they reminded me of a couple of fellers splittin rales And all round the edge of the buildin they had hoot owls sottin with electric lites in their ize and thar wuz no end to the masheenery in that buildin If anyone hed ever told me thar wuz that much masheenery in the whole world durned if I d a beleeved them biggest masheen I d ever seen before wuz Si Pettingill s new thrashin masheen Wall I jist stood thar a watchin them printin presses a runnin paper goin in to one end and cumin out at t other all printed and full of picters and folded up ready to sell it jist beat all the way they done it Wall we never had but one paper down home at Punkin Centre we called it The Punkin Centre Weakly Bugle old Jim Lawson he wuz editor of it You see Jim he wuz sort of a triflin no count old cuss so to keep him out of mischief we made him editor Wall Jim he had his place up over Ezra Hoskins grossery store He never got any money for the noospaper always got paid in produce and Ezra s store wuz a mighty good place fer him to take in his subskriptions Wall things went along pretty smooth fer quite a spell til one day a feller he cum in and give Jim a keg of hard cider fer a year s subskription to the noospaper and we all calculated right then that somethin wuz a goin to happen and sure enough it did You see bout that time Jim had got two advertisements one wuz fer Ruben Jackson s resterant and the other wuz the time table of the Punkin Centre and Paw Paw Valley Railroad Wall Jim he got to drinkin the hard cider and settin type at the same time and when the paper cum out on Thursday it wuz wuth goin miles to see Neer as I kin remember it sed that Ruben Jackson s resterant would leave the depo every mornin at eight o clock fer beefstake and mutton stews and would change cars at White River Junkshen for mins and punkin pise and cottage puddin would be a flag stashen fer coffy and do nuts like mother used to make and the train wouldn t run on Sundays cos the stashun agint what done the cookin would have to run en extra on that day over the chicken and ham sandwitch divishion I believe that wuz the last issu of the Punkin Centre Weakly Bugle Enthusiasm Sometimes inspired sometimes acquired sometimes the result of immediate surroundings and sometimes the result of hard cider Punkin Centre Philosophy Uncle Josh at a Camp Meeting WALL we ve jist bin havin a camp meeting at Punkin Centre Yes fer several days we wuz purty busy bakin and cookin and makin preparations fer the camp meetin and some of the committee alowed we ought to have lemonade fer the Sunday school children Wall as we wanted to git it jist as cheap as possible we damed up the crick what runs back of the camp meeting grounds and put in ten pounds of brown sugar and half a dozen lemons and let the Sunday school children drink right out of the crick free of charge Wall we had right smart difficulty in gittin a pulpit fixed up fer the ministers but finally we sawed down a hemlock tree and used the stump fer a pulpit Wall some of the sarmons preached at that camp meetin beat anything I ever heered in my life afore You see we d bin havin a good many argyments bout corporations monopolies and trusts and one minister got up and sed Ah my dear beloved brethren and sisters we should not be too severe on the monopolists If we read the scripters closely we observe our forefathers wuz all monopolists Adam and Eve had a monopoly upon the garden of Eden and would have had it til this day no doubt had not Mother Eve got squeezed in the apple market Yea verily Lot s wife had a corner on the salt market And while Pharoe s daughter was not in the milk business yet we observe she took a great proffit out of the water yea verrily Most on us cum to the conclusion he wuz ridin on a free pass Samantha Hoskins concluded she would have to sing her favorit hymn it went something like this Oh you need not cum in the mornin And neither in the heat of the day But cum along in the evenin Lord And wash my sins away Chorus Standin on the walls of Zion Lookin at my ship cum a sailln ov Standin on the walls of Zion To see my ship cum in Jist about that time Ruben Hendricks skeered a skunk out of a holler log Si Pettingill stirred up a hornet s nest Deacon Witherspoon sot down in a huckleberry pie and Aunt Nancy Smith got a spider on her and she started in to yellin and jumpin like she had a fit and two dogs got to fitin and old Jim Lawson he tried to git em apart and he stumped round and got his old wooden leg into a post hole and fell down and the dogs got on top of him and you couldn t tell which wuz Jim nor which wuz dog and durned if it didn t bust up the camp meetin The Unveiling of the Organ IT wuz down in Punkin Centre I believe in eighty nine We had some doin s at the meetin house That we thought wuz purty fine It wuz a great occasion The choir led by Sister Morgan Had called us thar to witness The unveilin of the organ In order fer to git it We d bin savin here and there Lookin forward to the time When we d have music fer to spare And as the time it had arrived And the organ had cum too We had all of us assembled thar To hear what the thing could do Wall it wuz a gorgeous instrument In a handsome walnut case And thar wuz expectation Pictured out on every face Then when Deacon Witherspoon Had led us all in prayer The congregation all stood up And Old Hundred rent the air Jist then the doin s took a turn Though I m ashamed to say it We found that old Jim Lawson Wuz the only one could play it But Jim the poor old feller Had one besettin sin A fondness fer hard cider Which he d bin indulgin in But he sot down at that organ Planked his feet upon the pedals And he showed us he could play it Though he hadn t any medals He dwelt upon the treble And he flirted with the base He almost made that organ Jump right out of its case Wall the cider got in old Jim s head And in his fingers too So he played some dancin music And old Yankee Doodle Doo He shocked old Deacon Witherspoon And scared poor Sister Morgan And jist busted up the meetin At the unveilin of the organ Uncle Josh Plays a Game of Base Ball I HAD heered a whole lot bout them games of foot ball they have in New York so while I was thar I jist cum to the conclusion I d see a game of it so went out to one of their city pasters to see a game of foot ball Wall now I must say I didn t see much ball playin of any kind All I got to see wuz about fifty or sixty ambulances and I think about that many surgons and phisicians Wall from what I could see of the game I calculate they needed all of them I saw one feller and bout fifty others had him down and it jist looked as though they wuz all trying to get a kick at him They had a half back and a quarter back I suppose when they got through with that feller he wuz a hump back Anyhow if that s what they call foot ball playin your Uncle Josh don t want any foot ball in his n I never played but one game of ball in my life that I kin remember on and don t believe that I ever will forgit that You see it wuz along in the spring time of the yeer and the weather wuz purty warm and sunshiny and the boys sed to me Uncle we d like to have you help us play a game of base ball I sed Boys I m gittin a little too old fer those kinds of passtimes but I ll help you play one game I ll be durned if I don t Wall we got out in the paster and wuz gittin ready to play we got the bases and bats put around in thar places and a buckit of drinkin water up in the fence corner whar we could get a drink when we wanted it We didn t have any bleachers but we had thirty or forty hogs and they wuz the best rooters you ever seen jist then I happened to look around and thar wuz the biggest billy goat I ever saw in all my life You ought to seen the boys a gittin out of the paster I would hav got out too but I got stuck in the fence Wall you ought to hav seen that billy goat a gittin me through the fence He didn t git me all the way through cos I wuz half way through when he got thar but he got the last half through I didn t make any home run but I wuz the only feller what had a score of the game I couldn t see the score but I had it Every time I d go to sot down I knowed jist exactly how the game stood They hav a good many new fangled games now but when they git anything that can beet a game of base ball with a billy goat fer a battery durned if I don t want to see it The Punkin Centre and Paw Paw Valley Railroad WONDERS will never cease we ve got a railroad in Punkin Centre now oh we re gittin to be right smart cityfied I guess that s about the crookedest railroad that ever wuz bilt I think that railroad runs across itself in one or two places it runs past one station three times It s so durned crooked they hav to burn crooked wood in the ingine Wall the fust ingine they had on the Punkin Centre wuz a wonderful piece of masheenery It had a five foot boiler and a seven foot whissel and every time they blowed the whissel the durned old ingine would stop Wall we ve got the railroad and we re mighty proud of it but we had an awful time a gittin it through You see most everybody give the right of way cept Ezra Hoskins and he didn t like to see it go through his medder field and it seemed as though they d hav to go round fer quite a ways and maybe they wouldn t cum to Punkin Centre at all Wall one mornin Ezra saw a lot of fellers down in the medder most uncommonly busy like so he went down to them and he sed Wat be you a doin down here And they sed Wall mister Hoskins we re surveyin fer the railroad And Ezra sed So we re goin to hav a railroad be we Is it goin right through here And they sed Yes mister Hoskins that s whar it s a goin right through here Ezra sed Wall I s pose you ll have a right smart of ploughin and diggin and you ll jist about plow up my medder field won t ye They sed Yes mister Hoskins we ll hav to do some gradin Ezra sed Wall now let me see is it a goin jist the way you ve got that instrument p inted They sed Yes sir jist thar And Ezra sed Wall near as I kin calculate from that I should jedge it wuz a goin right through my barn They sed Yes mister Hoskins we re sorry but the railroad is a goin right through your barn Wall Ezra didn t say much fer quite a spell and we all expected thar would be trouble but finally he sed Wall I s pose the community of Punkin Centre needs a railroad and I hadn t oughter offer any objections to its goin through but I m goin to tell ye one thing right now afore you go any further When you git it bilt and a runnin you ve got to git a man to cum down here and take keer on it cos it s a cumin along hayin and harvestin time and I ll be too durned busy to run down here and open and shet them barn doors every time one of your pesky old trains wants to go through Love An indescribable longing something that existed since Mother Eve was in the apple trust and will exist until the end of time Somethin that no man has ever yet defined or ever will define A somethin that is past all description Which will make a hired man fergit to do the chores and will make an old man act boyish and will make a woman show herself to be stronger than the strongest man Gosh durn it an indescribable somethin that has never yet bin described Punkin Centre Philosophy Uncle Josh on a Bicycle A LONG last summer Ruben Hoskins that is Ezra Hoskins boy he cum home from college and bro t one of them new fangled bisickle masheens hum with him and I think ever since that time the whole town of Punkin Centre has got the bisickle fever Old Deacon Witherspoon he s bin a ridin a bisickle to Sunday school and Jim Lawson he couldn t ride one of them cause he s got a wooden leg but he jist calculated if he could git it hitched up to the mowin masheen he could cut more hay with it than any man in Punkin Centre Somebody sed Si Pettingill wuz tryin to pick apples with a bisickle Wall all our boys and girls are ridin bisickles now and nothin would do but I must learn how to ride one of them Wall I didn t think very favorably on it but in order to keep peace in the family I told them I would learn Wall gee whilikee by gum I wish you had bin thar when I commenced I took that masheen by the horns and I led it out into the middle of the road and I got on it sort of unconcerned like and then I got off sort of unconcerned like Wall I sot down a minnit to think it over and then the trouble commenced I got on that durned masheen and it jumped up in the front and kicked up behind and bucked up in the middle and shied and balked and jumped sideways and carried on worse n a couple of steers the fust time they re yoked Wall I managed to hang on fer a spell and then I went up in the air and cum down all over that bisickle I fell on top of it and under it and on both sides of it I fell in front of the front wheel and behind the hind wheel at the same time Durned if I know how I done it but I did I run my foot through the spokes and put about a hundred and fifty punctures in a hedge fence and skeered a hoss and buggy clar off the highway I done more different kinds of tumblin than any cirkus performer I ever seen in my life and I made more revolutions in a fifteen foot circle than any buzz saw that ever wuz invented Wall I lost the lamp I lost the clamp I lost my patience I lost my temper I lost my self respect my last suspender button and my standin in the community I broke the handle bars I broke the sprockets I broke the ten commandments I broke my New Year s pledge and the law agin loud and abusive language and Jim Lawson got so excited he run his wooden leg through a knot hole in the porch and couldn t git it out agin Wall I m through with it once is enough fer me You kin all ride your durned old bisickles that want to but fer my part I d jist as soon stand up and walk as to sit down and walk No more bisickles fer your Uncle Josh not if he knows it and your Uncle Josh sort of calculates as how he do Notoriety A next door neighbor to glory but another way of gittin it Punkin Centre Philosophy A Baptizin at the Hickory Corners Church A LONG about two summers ago we had a baptizin at the Hickory Corners Church and before the baptizin we had preachin and before the preachin we had Sunday school Wall now some of them questions and answers in that Sunday school jist made me snicker right out loud You see old Deacon Witherspoon wuz a teachin the Sunday school class and he sed Now let me see what little boy can tell me who slew the Philistines and whar at Wall no one sed anything fer about a minnit then a little red headed feller down at the foot of the class sed Commodore Dewey at Manila The Deacon sed No Henry it wasn t Commodore Dewey what slew the Philistines it wuz Sampson Another little feller sed No Deacon I think you ve sort of got it mixed up he wasn t there Schley is the feller what done the job at Santiague The Deacon sed Now boys you ve bin readin too much about them war doin s in the papers Now what little boy can tell me what is the first commandment And Ezra Hoskins boy sed Remember the main Gosh I had to go right out of the meetin house whar I could have a good laugh Wall I wouldn t have bin down thar in the fust place or the second place fer that matter if it hadn t bin fer old Jim Lawson You see Jim he s a peculiar old critter He s got one eye out lost it lookin fer a pension I believe Wall Jim he cum over to my house and he sed Josh let s you and me go down to the baptizin I sed What do you want to go down thar fer Jim you can t git any pension thar kin ye Jim sed Wall you see Josh thar wuz a pedler left some hymn books at my house and I want to go down thar and see if I can t sell em Wall we hadn t bin thar more n a minnit when Jim he told the minister he had the hymn books to sell and the minister sed he d tell the congregation all about it Then Jim he sot right down in the meetin house and went to sleep and then he went to snorin you could hear him clar across a forty acre lot I wouldn t a keered a gosh durn but he woke me up Wall about the time the minister wuz a gittin through with his sermon he sed Now all members of the congregation having babies here to day and wantin of them baptized after the sermon is over bring them up to the

Pittsburg and Lake Erie Railroad Pittsburg Pa WALL John I read your poetry And laughed till I nearly cried Seein how you became an engineer And got on the right hand side It made me think of the days gone by When I wuz one of you fellers too What used to run an old machine And go tootin the country through But the engine that I had then John Wuz far from a Nancy Hanks She wuz old and worn and loggy And jist chuck full of pranks And she wuz wonderfully got up John Full of bolts and valves and knobs And the boiler wouldn t hold water Gosh it wouldn t hold cobs But I wuz younger then John And I didn t care a cuss So I d pull the throttle open And jist let her wheeze and fuss The road that I wuz a runnin on Wuz out in the woolly west Two streaks of rust and the right of way Wuz puttin it at its best So we sort of plugged along John And didn t put on any frills Never thought of doin anything But doublin all the hills I tell you those were rocky times And we hadn t no air brake And fifteen miles an hour John Wuz durn good time to make And thar wuz as good a lot of boys As you could meet with anywhere Rough and ready open up And always on the square And I d like to see them all again And grasp each honest hand But some of them like me have quit Some have gone to another land I have changed somewhat since then John Jist a little more steady grown But I often think of my railroad days As the happiest ones I ve known And John I often watch the train As they go whizzing by As I think of Bill or Jim or Jack Thar s a tear comes in my eye Perhaps you d like to know John Just why I quit the rail And as some feller one time sed Thereby hangs a tale I wuz goin along one night John At a purty lively rate The old machine a doin her best And me forty minutes late When all at once there came a crash I felt the old track yield And fireman machine and I Went into a farmer s field There s little more to say John They laid me up for repairs But my fireman poor fellow Hadn t time to say his prayers So now you have my story John Still you don t know how it feels To know you ve got to plug around On a couple of flat wheels But it doesn t bother me John Gosh not fer a minnit I m as happy as the day is long And feel jist strictly in it But sometimes I like to meet the boys And talk them days all over And I feel as gay and chipper As a calf in a field of clover But the happiest days I ve known John The ones that to me see best Wuz when I run an old machine Way out in the woolly west Glory Gittin killed and not gittin paid fer it Punkin Centre Philosophy Uncle Josh at a

wuz the name he had And he came from no one knowed whar Quiet easy goin sort of a cuss And wuz reckoned on the squar Ridin a route for the Wells Fargo folks May have made him stern and grim But thar wasn t a man that crossed the divide But ud swar by Yosemite Jim He wa n t one of the regular sort What you d meet thar any day But as near as the camp could figure it out In a show down he d likely stay A shambling awkward figure Rawboned tall and slim And his schaps and togs in general Jist looked like they d fell on him I wuz somewhat of a tenderfoot then Hadn t jist got the lay of the land Thar wuz a good many things in them thar parts As I couldn t quite understand But I took a likin to Yosemite Jim Wuz with him on my very first trick And from that time on I stuck to him Like a kitten to a good warm brick Our headquarters then wuz the valley camp It wuz down by the redwood way With Chaparel across the spur Bout fifty miles away Wall what I m goin to tell you pard Happened thar whar the trail runs into the sky And if it hadn t a bin fer Yosemite Jim Wall I d be countin my chips on high The galoot that wuz punchin the broncos fer me Wuz a greaser from down Monterey And Jim used to say Keep your eye on him pard I don t think he s cum fer to stay His eyes are too shifty and yeller And his face is sullen and hard And taint that so much as a feelin I have Anyhow keep your eye on him pard One day when the mercury wuz way out of sight And the frost it wuz on every nail With jist the mail sack and specie box The greaser and I hit the trail We picked two passengers up at Big Pine And while the broncos were changed that day I noticed them havin a sneakin chat With the greaser from down Monterey Did you ever hear tell of the Great White Death That creeps down the mountain side Leavin behind it a ghastly track Whar those who have met it died Wall pard as true as I m a livin No man wants to see it twice White and grim as a funeral shroud A mass of mist and ice Wall we hadn t got far from the Big Pine relay When my hair it commenced to rise For I saw across by the Lone Bear spur A cloud of most monstrous size And the greaser acted sort of peculiar And the broncos commenced to neigh Wall some thoughts went through my mind jist then I won t forgit till my dyin day In less time than it takes to tell it We were into the Great White Death With its millions of frozen snowflakes A takin away our breath And jist then somethin happened pard The greaser from down Monterey Tried to sneak off with the specie box Along with the passengers from Big Pine relay All at once a figure on hossback Cum a whoopin it down the trail And bullets from out of a Winchester Commenced to fly like hail The greaser and them two passengers Cashed in their chips to him Fer the feller what wuz doin the shootin Wuz my friend Yosemite Jim Wall we planted them thar together When the cloud had passed away And all they ve got fer a tombstone Is the mountains dull and gray So pard let s take one together And I ll drink a toast to him Fer though he wuz rough and ready He d a heart YOSEMITE JIM The Great White Death so named by the Indians occurs in the higher altitudes of the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains It is almost indescribable It might properly be termed a frozen fog It has the effect of bringing on acute congestion of the lungs from which few rarely recover Viewed at a distance it is a magnificent sight each and every particle of the frozen moisture being a miniature prism which reflects the sun s rays in a manner once seen never to be forgotten By CAL STEWART
