6104_58843_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 This is the fourth and last cautionary announcement 
6104_58843_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Any who are not seated will seat themselves at once 
6104_58843_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Prepare for take off acceleration of one and one half gravities that is everyone will weigh one half again as much as his normal Earth weight for about fifteen minutes 
6104_58843_000006_000004	train-clean-360	We lift in twenty seconds I will count down the final five seconds 
6104_58843_000006_000009	train-clean-360	lift 
none	none	in twenty seconds I will count down the final 
6104_58843_000006_000005	train-clean-360	five 
none	none	seconds Five Four Three Two One Lift one Transcriber s Note The original read will pay attention please Illustration The immense vessel rose from her berth slowly at first but with ever increasing velocity and in the main lounge where many of the passengers had gathered to watch the dwindling Earth no one moved for the first five minutes 
6104_58843_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Then a girl stood up 
none	none	She was not a startlingly beautiful girl no more so than can be seen fairly often of a summer afternoon on Seaside Beach 
6104_58843_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Her hair was an artificial yellow 
6104_58843_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Her eyes were a deep cool blue 
6104_58843_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Her skin what could be seen of it she was wearing breeches and a long sleeved shirt was lightly tanned 
6104_58843_000010_000004	train-clean-360	She was only about five feet three and her build was not spectacular 
6104_58843_000010_000005	train-clean-360	However every ounce of her one hundred fifteen pounds was exactly where it should have been 
none	none	First she stood tentatively flexing her knees and testing her weight Then stepping boldly out into a clear space she began to do a high kicking acrobatic dance and went on doing it as effortlessly and as rhythmically as though she were on an Earthly stage You mustn t do that Miss A stewardess came bustling up Or rather not exactly bustling 
6104_58843_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Very few people and almost no stewardesses either actually bustle in or really enjoy one point five gees 
6104_58845_000052_000002	train-clean-360	really 
none	none	enjoy one point five gees You really must resume your seat Miss 
6104_58843_000012_000004	train-clean-360	I must insist 
6104_58843_000012_000005	train-clean-360	Oh you re Miss Warner 
6104_58843_000013_000000	train-clean-360	She paused 
6104_58843_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s right Barbara Warner 
6104_58843_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Cabin two eight one 
6104_58843_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 But really Miss Warner it s regulations and if you should fall 
none	none	Foosh to regulations and pfui on em 
6104_58843_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I won t fall 
6104_58843_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I ve been wondering every time out if I could do a thing and now I m going to find out 
6104_58843_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Jackknifing double she put both forearms flat on the carpet and lifted both legs into the vertical 
6104_58843_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Then silver slippers pointing motionlessly ceilingward she got up onto her hands and walked twice around a vacant chair 
6104_58843_000017_000002	train-clean-360	She then performed a series of flips that would have done credit to a professional acrobat the finale of which left her sitting calmly in the previously empty seat 
6104_58843_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 See she informed the flabbergasted stewardess 
none	none	I could do it and I didn t Her voice was drowned out in a yell of approval as everybody who could clap their hands did so with enthusiasm
6104_58843_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 More Keep it up gal Do it again 
6104_58843_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I didn t do that to show off Barbara Warner flushed hotly as she met the eyes of the nearby spectators 
none	none	Honestly I didn t I just had to know if I could Then as the applause did not die down she fairly scampered out of the room For one hour before the Procyon s departure from Earth and for three hours afterward 
6104_58843_000056_000003	train-clean-360	First Officer Carlyle Deston 
none	none	Chief Electronicist sat attentively at his board He was five feet eight inches tall and weighed one hundred sixty two pounds net 
6104_58843_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Just a little guy as spacemen go Although narrow waisted and for his heft broad shouldered he was built for speed and maneuverability not to haul freight 
6104_58843_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Watching a hundred lights and half that many instruments listening to two phone circuits one with each ear and hands moving from switches to rheostats to buttons and levers he was completely informed as to the instant by instant status of everything in his department 
6104_58843_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Although attentive he was not tense even during the countdown 
6104_58843_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The only change was that at the word Two his right forefinger came to rest upon a red button and his eyes doubled their rate of scan 
none	none	If anything in his department had gone wrong the Procyon s departure would have been delayed 
6104_58843_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And again well out beyond the orbit of the moon just before the starship s mighty Chaytor engines hurled her out of space as we know it into that unknowable something that is hyperspace he poised a finger But Immergence too was normal all the green lights except one went out needles dropped to zero both phones went dead all signals stopped 
6104_58843_000024_000001	train-clean-360	He plugged a jack into a socket below the one remaining green light and spoke 
6104_58843_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Procyon One to Control Six 
6104_58843_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Flight Eight Four Nine 
6104_58843_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Subspace Radio Test One 
6104_58843_000025_000003	train-clean-360	How do you read me Control Six 
6104_58843_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Control Six to Procyon One 
6104_58843_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I read you ten and zero 
6104_58843_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 ten and zero 
6104_58843_000026_000002	train-clean-360	How do you read me Procyon One 
none	none	Ten and zero 
6104_58843_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Out Deston flipped a toggle and the solitary green light went out 
6104_58843_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Perfect signal and zero noise 
6104_58843_000028_000001	train-clean-360	That was that 
6104_58843_000028_000002	train-clean-360	From now until Emergence unless something happened he might as well be a passenger Everything was automatic unless and until some robot or computer yelled for help 
6104_58843_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Deston leaned back in his bucket seat and lighted a cigarette He didn t need to scan the board constantly now any trouble signal would jump right out at him 
none	none	Promptly at Dee plus Three Zero Zero three hours no minutes no seconds after departure his relief appeared
6104_58843_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 All black Babe the newcomer asked 
6104_58843_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 As the pit Eddie 
6104_58843_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Take over Eddie did so 
6104_58843_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 You ve picked out your girl friend for the trip I suppose 
6104_58843_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Not yet 
6104_58843_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I got sidetracked watching Bobby Warner 
6104_58843_000032_000002	train-clean-360	She was doing handstands and handwalks and forward and back flips in the lounge under one point five gees yet 
none	none	Wow And after that all the other women looked like a dime s worth of catmeat She doesn t stand out too much until she starts to move but then Oh brother Eddie rolled his eyes made motions with his hands and whistled expressively
6104_58843_000032_000005	train-clean-360	 Talk about poetry in motion 
6104_58843_000032_000006	train-clean-360	Just walking across a stage she d bring down the house and stop the show cold in its tracks 
6104_58843_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 O 
6104_58845_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 O 
6104_58845_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 O 
6104_58845_000054_000005	train-clean-360	O K 
6104_58843_000033_000001	train-clean-360	K O K don t blow a fuse Deston said resignedly 
6104_58843_000033_000002	train-clean-360	 I know You ll love her undyingly all this trip maybe 
6104_58843_000033_000003	train-clean-360	So bring her up next watch and I ll give her a gold badge 
6104_58843_000033_000004	train-clean-360	As usual 
none	none	You how dumb can you get Eddie demanded D you think I d even try to play footsie with Barbara Warner
6104_58843_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 You d play footsie with the Archangel Michael s sister if she d let you and she probably would 
6104_58843_000035_000001	train-clean-360	So who s Barbara Warner 
6104_58843_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Eddie Thompson gazed at his superior pityingly 
none	none	I know you re ten nines per cent monk Babe but I did think you pulled your nose out of the megacycles often enough to learn a few of the facts of life 
6104_58843_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Did you ever hear of Warner Oil 
6104_58843_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I think so Deston thought for a moment 
6104_58843_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Found a big new field didn t they 
6104_58843_000037_000002	train-clean-360	In South America somewhere 
6104_58843_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Just the biggest on Earth is all 
none	none	And not only on Earth 
6104_58843_000038_000002	train-clean-360	He operates in all the systems for a hundred parsecs around and he never sinks a dry hole 
6104_58843_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Every well he drills is a gusher that blows the rig clear up into the stratosphere 
6104_58843_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Everybody wonders how he does it 
6104_58843_000038_000005	train-clean-360	My guess is that his wife s an oil witch which is why he lugs his whole family along wherever he goes 
6104_58845_000028_000001	train-clean-360	why 
none	none	he lugs his whole family along wherever he goes 
6104_58843_000038_000006	train-clean-360	Why else would he 
6104_58843_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe he loves her 
6104_58843_000039_000001	train-clean-360	It happens you know 
6104_58843_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh Eddie snorted 
6104_58843_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 After twenty years of her 
6104_58843_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Comet gas 
none	none	Anyway would you have the sublime gall to make passes at Warner Oil s heiress with more millions in her own sock than you ve got dimes
6104_58843_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t make passes 
6104_58843_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 That s right you don t 
6104_58843_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Only at books and tapes even on ground leaves more fool you 
none	none	Well then would you marry anybody like that
6104_58843_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly if I loved Deston paused thought a moment then went on Maybe I wouldn t either 
6104_58843_000043_000001	train-clean-360	She d make me dress for dinner 
none	none	She d probably have a live waiter maybe even a butler 
6104_58843_000043_000003	train-clean-360	So I guess I wouldn t at that 
6104_58843_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You nor me neither brother 
none	none	But what a dish What a lovely luscious toothsome dish Eddie mourned
6104_58843_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll be raving about another one tomorrow Deston said unfeelingly as he turned away 
6104_58845_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know 
none	none	but even if I do she won t be anything like her Eddie said to the closing door 
6104_58843_000047_000000	train-clean-360	And Deston outside the door grinned sardonically to himself 
6104_58843_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Before his next watch Eddie would bring up one of the prettiest girls aboard for a gold badge the token that would let her under approved escort of course go through the Top 
6104_58843_000048_000000	train-clean-360	He himself never went down to the Middle which was passenger territory There was nothing there he wanted 
6104_58843_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He was too busy had too many worthwhile things to do to waste time that way but the hunch was getting stronger and stronger all the time 
6104_58843_000048_000002	train-clean-360	For the first time in all his three years of deep space service he felt an overpowering urge to go down into the very middle of the Middle to the starship s main lounge 
6104_58843_000049_000000	train-clean-360	He knew that his hunches were infallible 
6104_58843_000049_000001	train-clean-360	At cards dice or wheels he had always had hunches and he had always won 
6104_58843_000049_000002	train-clean-360	That was why he had stopped gambling years before before anybody found out 
6104_58843_000049_000003	train-clean-360	He was that kind of a man 
none	none	Apart from the matter of unearned increment however he always followed his hunches but this one he did not like at all 
6104_58843_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He had been resisting it for hours because he had never visited the lounge and did not want to visit it now 
none	none	But something down there was pulling like a tractor so he went He didn t go to his cabin didn t even take off his side arm 
6104_58843_000050_000004	train-clean-360	He didn t even think of it the forty one automatic at his hip was as much a part of his uniform as his pants 
6104_58843_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Entering the lounge he did not have to look around 
6104_58843_000051_000001	train-clean-360	She was playing bridge and as eyes met eyes and she rose to her feet a shock wave swept through him that made him feel as though his every hair was standing straight on end 
6104_58843_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Excuse me please she said to the other three at her table 
6104_58843_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I must go now She tossed her cards down onto the table and walked straight toward him eyes still holding eyes 
6104_58843_000053_000000	train-clean-360	He backed hastily out into the corridor and as the door closed behind her they went naturally and wordlessly into each other s arms 
6104_58843_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Lips met lips in a kiss that lasted for a long long time 
6104_58843_000053_000002	train-clean-360	It was not a passionate embrace passion would come later it was as though each of them after endless years of bootless fruitless longing had come finally home 
6104_58843_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Come with me dear where we can talk she said finally eying with disfavor the half dozen highly interested spectators 
none	none	And a couple of minutes later in cabin two hundred eighty one Deston said So this is why I had to come down into passenger territory 
6104_58843_000055_000001	train-clean-360	You came aboard at exactly zero seven forty three 
6104_58845_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Uh uh 
6104_58843_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Uh uh She shook her yellow head 
6104_58843_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 A few minutes before that 
6104_58843_000056_000002	train-clean-360	That was when I read your name in the list of officers on the board 
none	none	First Officer Carlyle Deston 
6104_58843_000056_000004	train-clean-360	I got a tingle that went from the tips of my toes up and out through the very ends of my hair 
6104_58843_000056_000005	train-clean-360	Nothing like when we actually saw each other of course 
6104_58843_000056_000006	train-clean-360	We both knew the truth then 
6104_58843_000056_000007	train-clean-360	It s wonderful that you re so strongly psychic too 
6104_58843_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know about that he said thoughtfully 
none	none	All my training has been based on the axiomatic fact that the map is not the territory Psionics as I understand it holds that the map is practically the territory but can t prove it So I simply don t know what to believe On one hand I have had real hunches
6104_58845_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 all my life 
6104_58843_000057_000003	train-clean-360	On the other the signal doesn t carry much information 
6104_58843_000057_000004	train-clean-360	More like hearing a siren when you re driving along a street 
6104_58843_000057_000005	train-clean-360	You know you have to pull over and stop but that s all you know 
none	none	It could be police fire ambulance anything Anybody with any psionic ability at all ought to do a lot better than that I should think
6104_58843_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Not necessarily 
6104_58843_000058_000001	train-clean-360	You ve been fighting it 
none	none	Ninety nine per cent of your mind doesn t want to believe it is dead set against it So it has to force its way through whillions and skillions of ohms of resistance so only the most powerful stimuli maximum signal in your jargon perhaps can get through to you at all Suddenly she giggled like a schoolgirl
6104_58843_000058_000004	train-clean-360	 You re either psychic or the biggest wolf in the known universe and I know you aren t a wolf 
6104_58843_000058_000005	train-clean-360	If you hadn t been as psychic as I am you d ve jumped clear out into subspace when a perfectly strange girl attacked you 
6104_58843_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you know so much about me 
6104_58843_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I made it a point to 
none	none	One of the juniors told me you re the only virgin officer in all space
6104_58843_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 That was Eddie Thompson 
6104_58843_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Uh huh She nodded brightly 
6104_58843_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Well is that bad 
6104_58843_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Anything else but 
6104_58843_000064_000001	train-clean-360	That is he thought it was terrible outrageous a betrayal of the whole officer caste but to me it makes everything just absolutely perfect 
none	none	Me too 
6104_58843_000065_000001	train-clean-360	How soon can we get married 
6104_58843_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I d say right now except She caught her lower lip between her teeth and thought 
6104_58843_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 No no except 
6104_58843_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Right now or as soon as you can You can t without resigning can you 
6104_58843_000066_000003	train-clean-360	They d fire you 
6104_58843_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t worry about that he grinned 
6104_58843_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 My record is good enough I think to get a good ground job 
6104_58843_000067_000002	train-clean-360	Even if they fire me for not waiting until we ground there s lots of jobs 
6104_58843_000067_000003	train-clean-360	I can support you sweetheart 
6104_58843_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I know you can 
none	none	I wasn t thinking of that You wouldn t like a ground job
6104_58843_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 What difference does that make he asked in honest surprise 
6104_58843_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 A man grows up 
6104_58843_000069_000002	train-clean-360	I couldn t have you with me in space and I d like that a lot less 
6104_58843_000069_000003	train-clean-360	No I m done with space as of now 
none	none	But what was that except business
6104_58843_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought at first I d tell my parents first they re both aboard but I decided not to 
none	none	She d scream bloody murder and he d roar like a lion and none of it would make me change my mind so we ll get married first 
6104_58843_000071_000000	train-clean-360	He looked at her questioningly she shrugged and went on We aren t what you d call a happy family 
6104_58843_000071_000001	train-clean-360	She s been trying to make me marry an old goat of a prince and I finally told her to go roll her hoop to get a divorce and marry the foul old beast herself 
6104_58843_000071_000002	train-clean-360	And to consolidate two empires he s been wanting me to marry a multi billionaire who is also a louse and a crumb and a heel 
none	none	Last week he insisted on it and I blew up like an atomic bomb 
6104_58843_000071_000004	train-clean-360	I told him if I got married a thousand times I d pick every one of my husbands myself without the least bit of help from either him or her 
none	none	I d keep on finding oil and stuff for him I said but that was all Oil Deston exclaimed involuntarily as everything fell into place in his mind 
6104_58843_000072_000001	train-clean-360	The way she walked poetry in motion the oil witch two empires more millions than he had dimes 
6104_58843_000072_000002	train-clean-360	 Oh you re Barbara Warner then 
6104_58843_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Why of course but my friends call me Bobby 
6104_58843_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Didn t you but of course you didn t you never read passenger lists 
6104_58843_000073_000002	train-clean-360	If you did you d ve got a tingle too 
6104_58843_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I got plenty of tingle without reading believe me 
6104_58843_000074_000001	train-clean-360	However I never expected to 
none	none	Don t say it dear She got up and took both his hands in hers
6104_58843_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 I know how you feel 
none	none	I don t like to let you ruin your career either but nothing can separate us now that we ve found each other 
6104_58843_000075_000003	train-clean-360	So I ll tell you this Her eyes looked steadily into his 
6104_58843_000075_000004	train-clean-360	 If it bothers you the least bit later on I ll give every dollar I own to some foundation or other I swear it 
none	none	He laughed shamefacedly as he took her in his arms Since that s the way you look at it it won t bother me a bit Uh huh you do mean it She snuggled her head down into the curve of his neck
6104_58843_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 I can tell 
6104_58843_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I know you can sweetheart Then he had another thought and with strong deft fingers he explored the muscles of her arms and back 
none	none	But those acrobatics in plus gee and you re trained down as hard and fine as I am and it s my business to be how come
6104_58843_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 I majored in Physical Education and I love it 
6104_58843_000079_000001	train-clean-360	And I m a Newmartian you know so I teach a few courses 
6104_58843_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Newmartian 
none	none	you know so I teach a few courses Newmartian 
6104_58843_000080_000001	train-clean-360	I ve heard but you aren t a colonial you re as Terran as I am 
6104_58843_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 By blood yes but I was born on Newmars 
6104_58843_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 yes but 
6104_58845_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 yes but 
none	none	I was born on Newmars 
6104_58843_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Our actual and legal residence has always been there 
6104_58843_000081_000002	train-clean-360	The tax situation you know 
6104_58843_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know no Taxes don t bother me much 
6104_58843_000082_000001	train-clean-360	But go ahead 
6104_58843_000082_000002	train-clean-360	You teach a few courses 
none	none	In
6104_58843_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh bars trapeze ground and lofty tumbling acrobatics aerialistics high wire muscle control judo all that kind of thing 
6104_58843_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Ouch 
6104_58843_000084_000001	train-clean-360	So if you ever happen to accidentally get mad at me you ll tie me right up into a pretzel 
6104_58843_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I doubt it very seriously 
none	none	I ve tossed lots of two hundred pounders around of course but they were not space officers She laughed unaffectedly as she tested his musculature much more professionally and much more thoroughly than he had tested hers
6104_58843_000085_000002	train-clean-360	 Definitely I couldn t 
6104_58843_000085_000003	train-clean-360	A good big man can always take a good little one you know 
6104_58843_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 But I m not big I m just a little squirt 
6104_58843_000086_000001	train-clean-360	You ve probably heard what they call me 
6104_58843_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and I m going to call you Babe too and mean it the same way they do 
6104_58843_000087_000001	train-clean-360	Besides who wants a man a foot taller than she is and twice as big 
none	none	You re just exactly the right size
6104_58843_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 That s spreading the good old oil Bobby but I ll never tangle with you if I can help it 
6104_58843_000088_000001	train-clean-360	Buzz saws are small too and sticks of dynamite Shall we go hunt up the parson or should it be a priest 
6104_58843_000088_000002	train-clean-360	Or a rabbi 
none	none	Even that doesn t make a particle of difference to you
6104_58843_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not 
6104_58843_000096_000002	train-clean-360	Of course not 
6104_58843_000090_000001	train-clean-360	How could it 
none	none	A parson please Then with a bright quick grin We have got a lot to learn about each other haven t we
6104_58843_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Some details of course but nothing of any importance and we ll have plenty of time to learn them 
6104_58843_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 And we ll love every second of it 
6104_58843_000093_000001	train-clean-360	You ll live down here in the Middle with me won t you all the time you aren t actually on duty 
6104_58843_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t imagine doing anything else and the two set out arms around each other to find a minister 
6104_58843_000094_000001	train-clean-360	And as they strolled along 
none	none	Of course you won t actually need a job ever or my money either You never even thought of
6104_58843_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 dowsing 
none	none	did you Dowsing 
6104_58843_000096_000001	train-clean-360	Oh that witch stuff 
none	none	Of course not
6104_58843_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Listen darling 
6104_58843_000097_000001	train-clean-360	All the time I ve been touching you I ve been learning about you 
6104_58843_000097_000002	train-clean-360	And you ve been learning about me 
none	none	Yes but
6104_58843_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 No buts buster 
none	none	You have really tremendous powers and they aren t latent either All you have to do is quit fighting them and use them You re ever so much stronger and fuller than I am 
6104_58843_000099_000003	train-clean-360	All I can do at dowsing is find water oil coal and gas 
6104_58843_000099_000004	train-clean-360	I m no good at all on metals I couldn t feel gold if I were perched right on the roof of Fort Knox I couldn t feel radium if it were frying me to a crisp 
none	none	But I m positive that you can tune yourself to anything you want to find He didn t believe it and the argument went on until they reached the Reverend s quarters Then of course it was dropped automatically and the next five days were deliciously deliriously ecstatically happy days for them both II At the time of this chronicle the status of interstellar flight was very similar to that of intercontinental jet plane flight in the nineteen sixties Starships were designed by humanity s best brains carried every safety device those brains could devise They were maintained and serviced by ultra skilled ultra trained ultra able crews they were operated by the creme de la creme of manhood Only a man with an extremely capable mind in an extremely capable body could become an officer of a subspacer Statistically starships were the safest means of transportation ever used by man so safe that Very Important Persons used them regularly unthinkingly and as a matter of course Statistically the starships fatality rate per million passenger light years was a small fraction of that of the automobiles per million passenger miles Insurance companies offered odds of tens of thousands to one that any given star traveler would return unharmed from any given star trip he cared to make Nevertheless accidents happened A chillingly large number of lives had as a total been lost and no catastrophe had ever been even partially explained No message of distress or call for help had ever been received No single survivor had ever been found nor any piece of wreckage And on the Great Wheel of Fate the Procyon s number came up In the middle of the night Carlyle Deston came instantaneously awake feeling with his every muscle and with his every square inch of skin listening with all the force he could put into his auditory nerves while deep down in his mind a huge terribly silent voice continued to yell DANGER DANGER DANGER In a very small fraction of a second Carlyle Deston moved and fast Seizing Barbara by an arm he leaped out of bed with her We re abandoning ship get into this suit quick But what but I ve got to dress No time Snap it up He practically hurled her into her suit clamped her helmet tight Then he leaped into his own Skipper he snapped into the suit s microphone Deston Emergency Abandon ship The alarm bells clanged once the big red lights flashed once the sirens barely started to growl then quit The whole vast fabric of the ship trembled and shuddered and shook as though it were being mauled by a thousand impossibly gigantic hammers Deston did not know and never did find out whether it was his captain or an automatic that touched off the alarm Whichever it was the disaster happened so fast that practically no warning at all was given And out in the corridor Come on girl sprint He put his arm under hers and urged her along She did her best but in comparison with his trained performance her best wasn t good I ve never been checked out on sprinting in spacesuits she gasped Let go of me and go on ahead I ll follow Everything went out Lights gravity air circulation everything You haven t been checked out on free fall either Hang onto this tool hanger here on my belt and we ll travel Illustration Where to she asked hurtling through the air much faster than she had ever gone on foot Baby Two that is Lifecraft Number Two my crash assignment Good thing I was down here in the Middle I d never have made it from up Top Next corridor left I think Then as the light of his headlamp showed numbers on the wall Yes Square left I ll swing you He swung her and they shot to the end of the passage He kicked a lever and the lifecraft s port swung open to reveal a blaze of light and a startled gray haired man What happened What hap the man began Wrecked We ve had it We re abandoning ship Get into that cubby over there shut the door tight behind you and stay there But can t I do something to help Without a suit and not knowing how to use one You d get burned to a cinder Get in there and jump The oldster jumped and Deston turned to his wife Stay here at the port Bobby Wrap one leg around that lever to anchor you What does your telltale read That gauge there your radiation meter It reads twenty same as mine Just pink so we ve got a minute or so I ll roust out some passengers and toss em to you you toss em along in there Can do She was white and trembling she was very evidently on the verge of being violently sick but she was far from being out of control Can do sir Good girl sweetheart Hang on one minute more and we ll have gravity and you ll be O K The first five doors he tried were locked and since they were made of armor plate there was nothing he could do about them except give each one a resounding kick with a heavy steel boot The sixth was unlocked but the passengers a man and a woman were very evidently and very gruesomely dead So was everyone else he could find until he came to a room in which a man in a spacesuit was floundering helplessly in the air He glanced at his telltale Thirty two High in the red almost against the pin Bobby What do you read Twenty six Good I ve found only one but we re running out of time I m coming in In the lifecraft he closed the port and slammed on full drive away from the ship Then wheeling he shucked Barbara out of her suit like an ear of corn and shed his own He picked up a fire extinguisher like affair and jerked open the door of a room a little larger than a clothes closet Jump in here He slammed the door shut Now strip quick He picked the canister up and twisted four valves Before he could get the gun into working position she was out of her pajamas the fact that she had been wondering visibly what it was all about had done nothing whatever to cut down her speed A flood of thick creamy foam almost hid her from sight and Deston began to talk quietly Thanks sweetheart for not slowing us down by arguing and wanting explanations This stuff is DEKON short for Decontaminant Complete Compound Adsorbent and Chelating Type DCQ four hundred twenty nine Used soon enough it takes care of radiation Rub it in good all over you like this He set the foam gun down on the floor and went vigorously to work Yes hair too Every square millimeter of skin and mucous membrane Yes into your eyes It stings em a little but that s a lot better than going blind And your mouth Swallow six good big mouthfuls it s tasteless and goes down easy Now the soles of your feet O K The last will hurt plenty but we ve got to get some of it into your lungs and we can t do it the hospital way So when I slap a gob of it over your mouth and nose inhale hard and deep Just once is all anybody can do but that s enough And don t fight Any ordinary woman I could handle but I can t handle you fast enough So if you don t inhale deep I ll have to knock you cold Otherwise you die of lung cancer Will do Will do sweetheart Good and deep No fight and she emptied her lungs He slapped it on She inhaled good and deep and went into convulsive paroxysms of coughing He held her in his arms until the worst of it was over but she was still coughing hard when she pulled herself away from him But how about you She could just barely talk her voice was distorted almost inaudible Let me help you quick No need darling Two other men out there The old man probably won t need it I think I got him into the safe quick enough the other guy and I will help each other So lie down there on the bunk and take it easy until I come back here and help you get the gunkum off So long for half an hour pet Forty five minutes later while all four were still cleaning up the messes of foam something began to buzz sharply Deston stepped over to the board and flipped a switch The communicator came on Since everything aboard a starship is designed to fail safe they were of course in normal space On the visiplates hundreds of stars blazed in vari colored points of hard bright light Baby Two acknowledging Deston said First Officer Deston and three passengers Deconned to zero Report please Baby Three Second Officer Jones and four passengers Deconned to Thank God Herc Formality vanished With you to astrogate us we may have a chance But how d you make it I d ve sworn a flying saucer couldn t ve got down from the Top in the time we had Same thing right back at you Babe I didn t have to come down We were in Baby Three when it happened Full vision was on a big square jawed lean tanned face looked out at them from the screen Huh How come And who s we My wife and I Second Officer Theodore Hercules Jones was somewhat embarrassed I got married too day before yesterday After the way the old man chewed you out though I knew he d slap irons on me without saying a word so we kept it dark and hid out in Baby Three These three are all we could find before our meters went high red I deconned Bun then Bun Barbara broke in Bernice Burns How wonderful Formerly Bernice Burns The face of a platinum blonde beauty appeared on the screen beside Jones And am I glad to see you Barbara even if I did just meet you yesterday I didn t know whether I d ever see another girl s face or not Let s cut the chat Deston said then Herc give me course blast and time for rendezvous hey My watch stopped So did mine Jones said So just hold one gravity on eighteen dash forty seven dash two seventy one and I ll correct you as necessary After setting course and still thinking of his watch Deston said But it s nonmagnetic It never stopped before The gray haired man spoke It was never in such a field before You see those two observations of fact invalidate twenty four of the thirty eight best theories of hyper space But tell me am I correct in saying that none of you were in direct contact with the metal of the ship when it happened We avoid it in case of trouble You Name and job Deston jerked his head at the younger stranger I know that much Henry Newman Crew chief normal space jobs unlimited Your passengers Herc Vincent Lopresto financier and his two bodyguards They were sleeping in their suits on air mattresses Grounders Don t like subspace or space either Just so The gray haired man nodded almost happily We survivors then absorbed the charge gradually But what the Deston began One moment please young man You perhaps saw some of the bodies What were they like They looked well not exactly as though they had exploded but he paused
6104_58845_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Precisely 
none	none	Gray Hair beamed That eliminates all the others except three Morton s Sebring s and Rothstein s You re a specialist in subspace then Oh no I m not a specialist at all I m a dabbler really A specialist you know is one who learns more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing at all I m just the opposite I m learning less and less about more and more hoping in time to know nothing at all about everything In other words a Fellow of the College I m glad you re aboard sir Oh a Theoretician Barbara s face lit up and she held out her hand With dozens of doctorates in everything from Astronomy to Zoology I ve never met I m ever so glad to meet you Doctor Adams Andrew Adams But I have only eight at the moment Earned degrees that is But what were you doing in this lifecraft No let me guess You were X ray eying it and fine toothing it for improvements made since your last trip and storing the details away in your eidetic memory Not eidetic by any means Merely very good And how many metric tons of apparatus have you got in the hold Deston asked Less than six Just what I must have in order to Babe Jones voice cut in Course change Stay on alpha eighteen Shift beta to forty four and gamma to two sixty five Rendezvous was made Both lifecraft hung motionless relative to the Procyon s hulk No other lifecraft had escaped A conference was held Weeks of work would be necessary before Deston and Jones could learn even approximately what the damage to the Procyon had been Decontamination was automatic of course but there would be literally hundreds of hot spots each of which would have to be sought out and neutralized by hand The passengers effects would have to be listed and stored in the proper cabins Each body would have to be given velocity away from the ship And so on Every survivor would have to work and work hard The two girls wanted to be together The two officers almost had to be together to discuss matters at unhampered length and to make decisions Each was of course almost as well versed in engineering as he was in his own specialty All ships officers from First to Fifth had to be And as long as they lived or until the Procyon made port all responsibility rested First upon First Officer Deston and second upon Second Officer Jones Therefore Theodore and Bernice Jones came aboard Lifecraft Two and Deston asked Newman to flit across to Lifecraft Three Not me I like the scenery here better Newman s eyes raked Bernice s five feet eight of scantily clad sheer beauty from ankles to coiffure If you re too crowded I know a lifecraft carries only fifty people go yourself As a crew chief you know the law Deston spoke quietly too quietly as the other man should have known I am in command You ain t in command of me pretty boy Newman sneered You can play God when you re on sked with a ship full of trained dogs to bite for you but out here where nobody has ever come back from I make my own law with this He patted his side pocket Draw it then Deston s voice now had all the top deck rasp of his rank Or crawl The First Officer had not moved his right hand still hung quietly at his side Newman glanced at the girls both of whom were frozen at Jones who smiled at him pityingly at Adams who was merely interested I my yours is right where you can get at it he faltered You should have thought of that sooner But this once I won t move a finger until your hand is in your pocket Just wing him Babe Jones said then He looks strong enough except for his head We can use him to shovel out the gunkum and clean up Uh uh I ll have to kill him sometime and the sooner the better Square between the eyes Do you want a hundred limit at ten bucks a millimeter on how far the hole is off dead center The two girls gasped stared at each other and at the two officers in horror but Jones said calmly without losing any part of his smile I don t want a dime s worth of that I ve lost too much money that way already At which outrageous statement both girls knew what was going on and smiled in relief And Newman misinterpreted those smiles completely especially Bernice s The words came hard but he managed to say then I crawl Crawl what I crawl sir You ll want my gun Keep it There s a lot more difference than that between us How close can you count seconds Plus or minus five per cent sir Close enough Your first job will be to build some kind of a brute force belt or gear thing to act as a clock You will really work Any more insubordination or any malingering at all and I ll put you into a lifecraft and launch you into space where you can make your own laws and be monarch of all you survey Dismissed Now flit Newman flitted fast and Barbara turning to her husband opened her mouth to speak and shut it No he would have killed the man he would have had to He still might have to Wherefore she said instead Why d you let him keep his pistol The the slime And after you actually saved his life too With some people what s past doesn t count The other was just a gesture Psychology It ll slow him down I think Besides he d have another one as soon as we get back into the Procyon But you can lock up all their guns can t you Bernice asked I m afraid not How about the other three Herc With thanks to you Barbara for the word slime If Lopresto is a financier I m an angel with wings and halo complete Gangsters hoodlums racketeers you d have to open every can of concentrate aboard to find all their spare artillery Check The first thing to do is One word first Bernice put in I want to thank you First Off no not First Officer but I could hardly Sure you can I m Babe to us all and you re Bun As to the other forget it You and I Herc will go over and And I Adams put in definitely I must photograph everything before it is touched therefore I must be the first on board I must do some autopsies and also Of course You re right Deston said And if I haven t said it before I m tremendously glad to have a Big Brain along oh excuse that crack please doctor Adams It slipped out on me Adams laughed In context I regard that as the highest compliment I have ever received To you youngsters my advanced age of fifty two represents senility Nevertheless you men need not Doctor me Either Adams or Andy will do very nicely As for you two young women I m going to call you Uncle Andy Barbara said with a grin Now Uncle Andy you being a Big Brain the term being used in its most complimentary sense and the way you talked one of your eight doctorates is in medicine Of course Are you any good at obstetrics In the present instance I am perfectly safe in saying Wait a minute Deston snapped Bobby you are not I am too That is I don t suppose I am yet since we were married only last Tuesday but if he s competent and I m sure he is I m certainly going to If we get back to Earth I want to and if we don t both Bun and I have got to Castaways Code you know So how about it Uncle Andy I know what you two girls are Adams said quietly I know what you two men must of necessity be Therefore I can say without reservation that none of you need feel any apprehension whatever Deston was about to say something but Barbara forestalled him Well we can think about it anyway and talk it over But for right now I think it s high time we all got some sleep Don t you It was and they did and after they had slept and had eaten breakfast the three men wafted themselves across a couple of hundred yards of space to the crippled starship Powerful floodlights were rigged What a mess Deston s voice was low and wondering The whole Top looks as though she d crash landed and spun out for eight miles But the Middle and Tail look untouched Inside however devastation had gone deep into the Middle Bulkheads walls floors structural members were torn sheared twisted into weirdly distorted shapes impossible to understand or explain And much worse were the absences for in dozens of volumes of as many sizes and of shapes incompatible with any three dimensional geometry every solid thing had vanished without leaving any clue whatever as to where or how it had gone Illustration After three long days of hard work Adams was satisfied He had taken pictures as fast as both officers could process the film he had covered many miles of tape with words only half of which either spaceman could understand Then finally he said Well that covers the preliminary observations as well as I know how to do it Thank you boys for your forbearance and your help Now if you ll help me find my stuff and bring some of it a computer and so on up to the lounge They did so the and so on proving to be a bewildering miscellany indeed Thank you immensely gentlemen now I won t bother you any more You ve learned a lot Doc and we haven t learned much of anything Deston grinned ruefully That makes you the director You ll have to tell us in general terms what to do Oh I can offer a few suggestions It is virtually certain One that no subspace equipment will function Two that all normal space equipment except for some items you know about will function normally Three that we can t do anything about subspace without landing on a planet Four that such landing will require extreme I might almost say fantastic precautions Although both officers thought that they understood Item Four neither of them had any inkling as to what Adams really meant They did understand thoroughly however Items One Two and Three Hell s jets Deston exclaimed Do you mean we ll have to blast normal to a system It isn t as bad as you think Babe Jones said Stars are much thicker here we re in the center somewhere than around Sol The probability is point nine plus that any emergence would put us less than point four light years away from a star A couple of them show disks I haven t measured any yet have you Doc Yes Point two two approximately to the closest So what Deston demanded What s the chance of it having an Earth type planet Any solid planet will do Adams said Just so it has plenty of mass That s still quite a trip Deston was coming around Especially since we can t use more than one point One point zero gravities Jones put in Over the long pull and the women you re right Deston agreed and took out his slide rule Let s see one gravity plus and minus velocity time it ll take about eleven months Just about Jones agreed and Adams nodded Well if that s what the cards say there s no use yowling about it and all nine survivors went to work Deston besides working directed the activities of all the others except Adams who worked harder and longer than did anyone else He barely took time out to eat and to sleep Nor did either Deston or Jones ask him what he was doing Both knew that it would take five years of advanced study before either of them could understand the simplest material on the doctor s tapes III The tremendous engines of the Procyon were again putting out their wonted torrents of power 
6104_58845_000001_000001	train-clean-360	The starship now a mere spaceship was on course at one gravity 
6104_58845_000001_000002	train-clean-360	The lifecraft were in their slots but the five and the four still lived in them rather than in the vast and oppressive emptiness that the ship itself now was 
6104_58845_000001_000003	train-clean-360	And socially outside of working hours the two groups did not mix 
6104_58845_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Clean up was going nicely at the union rate of six hours on and eighteen hours off 
6104_58845_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Deston could have set any hours he pleased but he didn t 
6104_58845_000002_000002	train-clean-360	There was plenty of time 
6104_58845_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Eleven months in deep space is a fearfully a tremendously long time 
6104_58845_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Morning afternoon evening and night were of course purely conventional terms 
6104_58845_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The twenty four hour day measured off by the brute force machine that was their masterclock carried no guarantee expressed or implied as to either accuracy or uniformity 
6104_58845_000004_000000	train-clean-360	One evening then four hard faced men sat at two small tables in the main room of Lifecraft Three 
6104_58845_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Two of them Ferdy Blaine and Moose Mordan were playing cards for small stakes 
6104_58845_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Ferdy was of medium size compact rather than slender built of rawhide and spring steel 
6104_58845_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Lithe and poised he was the epitome of leashed and controlled action 
none	none	Moose was six feet four and weighed a good two forty stolid massive solid Ferdy and Moose a tiger and an elephant both owned in fee simple by Vincent Lopresto 
6104_58845_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The two at the other table had been planning for days 
6104_58845_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They had had many vitriolic arguments but neither had made any motion toward his weapon 
6104_58845_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Play it my way and we ve got it made I tell you Newman pounded the table with his fist 
none	none	Seventy million if it s a cent Heavier grease than your lousy spig Syndicate ever even heard of 
6104_58845_000006_000003	train-clean-360	I m as good an astrogator as Jones is and a damn sight better engineer 
6104_58845_000006_000004	train-clean-360	In electronics I maybe ain t got the theory Pretty Boy has but at building and repairing the stuff I ve forgot more than he ever will know 
none	none	At practical stuff and that s all we give a whoop about I lay over both them sissies like a Lunar dome
6104_58845_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yeah Lopresto sneered 
6104_58845_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 How come you aren t ticketed for subspace then 
6104_58845_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 For hell s sake act your age Newman snorted in disgust 
none	none	Eyes locked and held but nothing happened D ya think I m dumb 
6104_58845_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Or that them subspace Boy Scouts can be fixed 
6104_58845_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Or I don t know where the heavy grease is at 
none	none	Or I can t make the approach Why ain t you in subspace
6104_58845_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I see Lopresto forced his anger down 
none	none	But I ve got to be sure we can get back without em You can be damn sure 
6104_58845_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I got to get back myself don t I 
none	none	But get one thing down solid I get the big peroxide blonde
6104_58845_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You can have her 
6104_58845_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Too big 
6104_58845_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I like the little yellowhead a lot better 
none	none	Newman sneered into the hard held face so close to his and said And don t think for a second you can make me crawl you small time chiseling punk Rub me out after we kill them off and you get nowhere You re dead 
6104_58845_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Chew on that a while and you ll know who s boss 
6104_58845_000013_000000	train-clean-360	After just the right amount of holding back and objecting Lopresto agreed 
6104_58845_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 You win Newman the way the cards lay 
6104_58845_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Have you ever planned this kind of an operation or do you want me to 
6104_58845_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You do it Vince Newman said grandly 
6104_58845_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He had at least one of the qualities of a leader 
none	none	Besides you already have ain t you Of course 
6104_58845_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Ferdy will take Deston 
6104_58845_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 No he won t 
none	none	He s mine the louse If you re that dumb all bets are off 
6104_58845_000017_000001	train-clean-360	What are you using for a brain 
6104_58845_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Can t you see the guy s chain lightning on ball bearings 
6104_58845_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But we re going to surprise em ain t we 
none	none	Sure but even Ferdy would just as soon not give him an even break You wouldn t stand the chance of a snowflake in hell and if you ve got the brains of a louse you know it O 
6104_58845_000020_000001	train-clean-360	K we ll let Ferdy have him 
6104_58845_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Me and you will match draws to see who 
6104_58845_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I can draw twice to your once but I suppose I ll have to prove it to you 
6104_58845_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I ll take Jones you will gun the professor Moose will grab the dames one under each arm and keep em out of the way until the shooting s over 
6104_58845_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The only thing is when 
6104_58845_000021_000003	train-clean-360	The sooner the better Tomorrow 
6104_58845_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Not quite Vince 
6104_58845_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Let em finish figuring course time distance all that stuff 
6104_58845_000022_000002	train-clean-360	They can do it a lot faster and some better than I can 
6104_58845_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I ll tell you when 
none	none	O 
6104_58845_000023_000001	train-clean-360	K and I ll give the signal 
none	none	When I yell NOW we give em the business 
6104_58845_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Newman went to his cabin and the muscle called Moose spoke thoughtfully That is as nearly thoughtfully as his mental equipment would allow 
6104_58845_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t like that ape boss 
6104_58845_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Before you gun him let me work him over just a little bit huh 
6104_58845_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 It ll be quite a while yet but that s a promise Moose 
6104_58845_000026_000001	train-clean-360	As soon as his job s done he ll wish he d never been born 
6104_58845_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Until then we ll let him think he s Top Dog 
6104_58845_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Let him rave 
6104_58845_000026_000004	train-clean-360	But Ferdy any time he s behind me or out of sight watch him like a hawk 
6104_58845_000026_000005	train-clean-360	Shoot him through the right elbow if he makes one sour move 
6104_58845_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I get you boss 
6104_58845_000028_000000	train-clean-360	A couple of evenings later in Lifecraft Two Barbara said You re worried Babe and everything s going so smoothly 
none	none	Why
6104_58845_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Too smoothly altogether 
6104_58845_000029_000001	train-clean-360	That s why 
none	none	Newman ought to be doing a slow burn and goldbricking all he dares instead of which he s happy as a clam and working like a nailer and I wouldn t trust Vincent Lopresto or Ferdinand Blaine as far as I can throw a brick chimney by its smoke This whole situation stinks 
6104_58845_000029_000003	train-clean-360	There s going to be shooting for sure 
none	none	But they couldn t do anything without you two Bernice exclaimed It d be suicide and with no motive could they Ted possibly 
6104_58845_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Jones dark face did not lighten 
6104_58845_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 They could and I m very much afraid they intend to 
none	none	As a crew chief Newman is a jack leg engineer and a very good practical troncist and if he s what I think he is He paused
6104_58845_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Could be Deston said doubtfully 
6104_58845_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 In with a mob of normal space pirate smugglers 
6104_58845_000032_000002	train-clean-360	I ll buy that but there wouldn t be enough plunder to 
6104_58845_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Just a sec 
6104_58845_000033_000001	train-clean-360	So he s a pretty good rule of thumb astrogator too and we re computing every element of the flight 
6104_58845_000033_000002	train-clean-360	As for motive salvage With either of us alive none 
6104_58845_000033_000003	train-clean-360	With both of us dead can you guess within ten million bucks of how much they ll collect 
none	none	Blockhead Deston slapped himself on the forehead I never even thought of that angle 
6104_58845_000034_000002	train-clean-360	That nails it down solid 
6104_58845_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 With the added attraction Jones went on coldly and steadily of having two extremely desirable female women for eleven months before killing them too 
6104_58845_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Both girls shrank visibly and Deston said Check 
6104_58845_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I thought that was the main feature but it didn t add up 
6104_58845_000036_000002	train-clean-360	This does 
6104_58845_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Now how will they figure the battle 
6104_58845_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Both of us at once of 
6104_58845_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Barbara asked 
none	none	I d think they d waylay you one at a time Uh uh 
6104_58845_000038_000001	train-clean-360	The survivor would lock the ship in null G and it d be like shooting fish in a barrel 
none	none	Since we re almost never together on duty and it won t come until after we ve finished the computations they ll think up a good reason for everybody to be together and that itself will be the tip off 
6104_58845_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Ferdy will probably draw on me 
6104_58845_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 And he ll kill you Jones said flatly 
6104_58845_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 So I think I ll blow his brains out tomorrow morning on sight 
6104_58845_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 And get killed yourself 
6104_58845_000040_000001	train-clean-360	No much better to use their own trap 
none	none	We can t Fast as you are you aren t in his class 
6104_58845_000041_000002	train-clean-360	He s a professional probably one of the fastest guns in space 
none	none	Yes but 
6104_58845_000042_000001	train-clean-360	I ve got a 
6104_58845_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I mean I think I can 
6104_58845_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Bernice grinning openly now stopped Deston s floundering 
6104_58845_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It s high time you fellows told each other the truth 
6104_58845_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Bobby and I let our back hair down long ago we were both tremendously surprised to know that both you boys are just as strongly psychic as we are 
6104_58845_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps even more so 
none	none	Oh so you get hunches too Jones demanded
6104_58845_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 So you ll have plenty of warning 
none	none	All my life 
6104_58845_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The old alarm clock has never failed me yet 
6104_58845_000045_000002	train-clean-360	But the girls can t start packing pistols now 
6104_58845_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t know how to shoot one if I did Bernice laughed 
6104_58845_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll throw things I m very good at that 
6104_58845_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh Jones asked 
6104_58845_000047_000001	train-clean-360	He didn t know his new wife very well either 
none	none	What can you throw straight enough to do any good
6104_58845_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Anything I can reach she replied confidently 
6104_58845_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Baseballs medicine balls cannon balls rocks bricks darts discus hammer javelin what have you 
6104_58845_000048_000002	train-clean-360	In a for real battle I d prefer chairs I think 
6104_58845_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Flying chairs are really hard to cope with 
none	none	Knives are too uh uh I d much rather have you fellows do the actual executing I ll start wearing a couple of knives in leg sheaths but I won t throw em or use em unless I absolutely have to 
6104_58845_000048_000006	train-clean-360	So who will I knock out with the first chair 
6104_58845_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll answer that Barbara said quietly 
6104_58845_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 If it s Blaine against Babe it ll be Lopresto against Herc 
6104_58845_000049_000002	train-clean-360	So you ll throw your chairs or whatever at that unspeakable oaf Newman 
none	none	I d rather brain him than anyone else I know but that would leave that gigantic gorilla to why he d listen you ll simply have to go armed
6104_58845_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I always do Barbara held out her hands 
6104_58845_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 Since they don t want to shoot us two yet these are all the weapons I ll need 
none	none	Against a man mountain like that You re that good Really Especially against a man mountain like that 
6104_58845_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I m that good 
6104_58845_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Really and both Joneses began to realize what Deston already knew just how deadly those harmless seeming weapons could be 
6104_58845_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Barbara went on We should have a signal in case one of us gets warning first 
6104_58845_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Something that wouldn t mean anything to them musical say 
6104_58845_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Brahms 
6104_58845_000054_000003	train-clean-360	That s it 
none	none	The very instant any one of us feels their intent to signal their attack he yells BRAHMS and we all beat them to the punch O K 
6104_58845_000055_000000	train-clean-360	It was O K and the four Adams was still hard at work in the lounge went to bed 
6104_58845_000056_000000	train-clean-360	And three days later within an hour after the last flight datum had been put in the tank the four intended victims allowed themselves to be inveigled into the lounge 
6104_58845_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Everything was peaceful everyone was full of friendship and brotherly love 
6104_58845_000056_000002	train-clean-360	But suddenly BRAHMS rang out with four voices in absolute unison followed a moment later by Lopresto s stentorian NOW 
6104_58845_000057_000000	train-clean-360	It was a very good thing that Deston had had ample warning for he was indeed competing out of his class 
6104_58845_000057_000001	train-clean-360	As it was his bullet crashed through Blaine s head while the gunman s went harmlessly into the carpet 
6104_58845_000057_000002	train-clean-360	The other pistol duel wasn t even close 
6104_58845_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Lopresto s hand barely touched his gun 
6104_58845_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Bernice even while shrieking the battle cry leaped to her feet hurled her chair and reached for another but one chair was enough 
6104_58845_000058_000001	train-clean-360	That fiercely but accurately sped missile knocked the half drawn pistol from Newman s hand and sent his body crashing to the floor where Deston s second bullet made it certain that he would not recover consciousness 
6104_58845_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Barbara s hand to hand engagement took about one second longer 
6104_58845_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Moose Mordan was big and strong and for such a big man was fairly fast physically 
6104_58845_000059_000002	train-clean-360	If he had had time to get his muscles ready he might have had a chance 
none	none	His thought processes however were lamentably slow and Barbara Warner Deston was almost as fast physically as she was mentally Thus she reached him before he even began to realize that this pint sized girl actually intended to hit him and thus it was that his belly muscles were still completely relaxed when her small but extremely hard left fist sank half forearm deep into his solar plexus With an agonized WHOOSH he began to double up but she scarcely allowed him to bend Her right hand fingers tightly bunched was already boring savagely into a selected spot at the base of his neck Then left hand at his throat and right hand pulling hard at his belt she put the totalized and concentrated power of her whole body behind the knee she drove into his groin 
6104_58845_000061_000000	train-clean-360	That ended it 
6104_58845_000061_000001	train-clean-360	The big man could very well have been dying on his feet To make sure however or to keep the girl from knowing that she had killed a man Deston and Jones each put a bullet through the falling head before it struck the rug 
6104_58845_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Both girls flung themselves sobbing into their husband s arms 
6104_58845_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The whole battle had lasted only a few seconds 
none	none	Adams although he had seen almost everything had been concentrating so deeply that it took those few seconds for him actually to realize what was going on He got up felt two of Newman s head then looked casually at the three other bodies two Transcriber s note As in original Oh I killed him Carl Barbara sobbed convulsively And the worst of it is I really meant to I never did anything like that before in my whole life
6104_58845_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t kill him Barbara Adams said 
6104_58845_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh She raised her head from Deston s shoulder the contrast between her streaming eyes and the relief dawning over her whole face was almost funny 
6104_58845_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 Why I did the foulest things possible and as hard as I possibly could 
none	none	I m sure I killed him
6104_58845_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 By no means my dear 
6104_58845_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Judo techniques however skillfully and powerfully applied do not and can not kill instantly 
6104_58845_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Bullets through the brain do 
6104_58845_000068_000003	train-clean-360	I will photograph the cadavers of course and perform the customary post mortem examinations for the record but I know already what the findings will be 
6104_58845_000068_000004	train-clean-360	These four men died instantly of gunshot wounds 
6104_58845_000069_000000	train-clean-360	With the four gangsters gone life aboardship settled down quickly into a routine 
6104_58845_000069_000001	train-clean-360	That routine however was in no sense dull 
6104_58845_000069_000002	train-clean-360	The officers had plenty to do operating the whole ship and rebuilding the mechanisms that were operating on jury rigging or on straight bread board hookups 
none	none	And in their spare time they enjoyed themselves tremendously in becoming better and better acquainted with their wives 
6104_58845_000069_000004	train-clean-360	For Bernice and Jones like Barbara and Deston had for each other an infinite number of endless vistas of personality the exploration of which was sheerest delight 
6104_58845_000070_000000	train-clean-360	The girls each of whom became joyously pregnant as soon as she could kept house and helped their husbands whenever need or opportunity arose 
6104_58845_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Their biggest chore however was to see to it that Adams got sleep food and exercise 
6104_58845_000070_000002	train-clean-360	For if left to his own devices he would never have exercised at all would have grabbed a bite now and then and would have slept only when he could no longer stay awake 
none	none	Uncle Andy why don t you use that Big Brain of yours Barbara snapped at him one day
6104_58845_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 For a man that s actually as smart as you are I swear you ve got the least sense of anybody I know 
6104_58845_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 But it s necessary my dear child Adams explained unmoved 
6104_58845_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 This material is new 
6104_58845_000072_000002	train-clean-360	There are many extremely difficult problems involved and I have less than a year to work on them 
none	none	Less than one year and it is a task for a team of specialists and all the resources of a research center To the officers however Adams went into more detail
6104_58845_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 Considering the enormous amounts of supplies carried the scope quantity and quality of the safety devices employed it is improbable that we are the first survivors of a subspace catastrophe to set course for a planet 
6104_58845_000074_000000	train-clean-360	After some argument the officers agreed 
none	none	Illustration While I cannot as yet detect it classify it or evaluate it we are carrying an extremely heavy charge of an unknown nature the residuum of a field of force which is possibly more or less analogous to the electromagnetic field This residuum either is or is not dischargeable to an object of planetary mass and I m virtually certain that it is The discharge may be anything from an imperceptible flow up to one of such violence as to volatilize the craft carrying it 
6104_58845_000076_000002	train-clean-360	From the facts One that in the absence of that field the subspace radio will function normally and Two that no subspace radio messages have ever been received from survivors the conclusion seems inescapable that the discharge of this unknown field is in fact of extreme violence 
6104_58845_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Good God Deston exclaimed 
none	none	Oh that was what you meant by fantastic precautions back there Precisely But what can we do about it I don t know I simply do not know Adams lost himself in thought for over a minute This is all so new I know so little and am working with such pitifully inadequate instrumentation However we have months of time yet and if I am unable to arrive at a conclusion before arrival I don t mean a rigorous analysis of course but merely a stop gap empirical pragmatic solution we will simply remain in orbit around that sun until I do IV The Procyon bored on through space at one unchanging gravity of acceleration It may not seem at first glance that one gravity would result in any very high velocity but when it is maintained steadily for days and weeks and months it builds up to a very respectable speed Nor was there any question of power for the Procyon s atomics did not drive the ship but merely energized the Chaytors the Chaytor Effect engines that tapped the energy of the expanding universe itself Thus in less than six months the Procyon had attained a velocity almost half that of light At the estimated mid point of the flight the spaceship still at one gravity of drive was turned end for end so that for the ensuing five and a fraction months she would be slowing down A few weeks after the turnover Adams seemed to have more time At least he devoted more time to the expectant mothers even to the point of supervising Deston and Jones in the construction of a weirdly wired device by means of which he studied and photographed the unborn child each woman bore He said nothing however until Barbara made him talk Listen you egregious clam she said firmly I know darn well I ve been pregnant for at least seven months and I ought to be twice this big Our clock isn t that far off Carl said that by wave lengths or something it s only about three per cent fast And you ve been pussyfooting and hem hawing around all this time Now Uncle Andy I want the truth Are we in for a lot of trouble Trouble Of course not Certainly not No trouble at all my dear Why you ve seen the pictures here look at them again see Absolutely normal fetus yours too Bernice Perfect No malformations of any kind Yes but for what age Bernice asked pointedly Four months say I see I was exposed to a course in embryology myself once But that s the interesting part of it Adams enthused Fascinating And indubitably supremely important In fact it may point out the key datum underlying the solution of our entire problem If this zeta field is causing this seemingly peculiar biological effect that gives us a tremendously powerful new tool for certain time vectors in the generalized matrix become parameters Thus certain determinants notably the all important delta prime sub mu become manipulable by but you aren t listening I m listening pops but nothing is coming through But thanks much anyway I feel a lot better knowing I m not going to give birth to a monster Or are you sure really Of course I m sure Adams snapped testily and Barbara led Deston aside Have you got the slightest idea of what he was talking about she asked Just the slightest if any Either that time is relative no that s so elementary he wouldn t mention it Maybe he s figured out a variable time of some kind or other Anyway you girls slowness in producing has given the old boy a big lift and I m mighty glad of it But aren t you worried sweetheart Not even the least little bit Of course not and Deston very evidently meant just that I am I can t help but be Why aren t you Because Doc isn t and he knows his stuff believe me He can t lie any better than a three year old and he s sure that all four of you are just as safe as though you were in God s lefthand hip pocket Oh that s right I never thought of it that way So I don t have anything to worry about do I She lifted her lips to be kissed and the kiss was long and sweet Time flew past until one day a couple of weeks short of arrival Adams rushed up to Deston and Jones I have it he shouted and began to spout a torrent of higher very much higher mathematics Hold it Doc Deston held up an expostulatory hand I read you zero and ten Can t you delouse your signal Whittle the stuff down to our size W e l l the scientist looked hurt but did consent to forego the high math The discharge is catastrophic in energy equivalent something of the order of magnitude of ten thousand discharges of lightning And unfortunately I do not know what it is It is virtually certain however that we will be able to dissipate it in successive decrements by the use of long thin leads extending downward toward a high point of the planet Wire you mean What kind The material is not important except in that it should have sufficient tensile strength to support as many miles as possible of its own length We ve got dozens of coils of hook up wire Deston said but not too many miles and it s soft stuff Graham wire Jones snapped his finger Of course Deston agreed Hundreds of miles of it Float the senser down on a Hotchkiss Tear out Jones objected Bailey it spidered out to twenty or so big flat feet That ll take metal but we can cannibal the whole Middle without weakening the structure Sure surges backlash Remote it Check Remote everything to Baby Two and Would you mind delousing your signal Adams asked caustically Scuse please Doc A guy does talk better in his own lingo doesn t he Well Graham wire is one point three millimeter diameter ultra high tensile steel wire Used for re wrapping the Grahams you know No I don t know What are Grahams Why they re the intermediates between the Chaytors O K O K they re something like bottles that have to stand terrifically high pressures That s what I want to know Such wire will do very nicely Note now that our bodies must be grounded very thoroughly to the metal of the ship You re so right We ll wrap the girls in silver mesh underwear up to the eyeballs and run leads as big as my wrist to the frame The approach was made and the fourth planet out from that strange sun was selected as a ground That planet was not at all like Earth It had very little water very little atmosphere and very little vegetation It was twice as massive as Earth its surface was rugged and jagged one of its stupendous mountain ranges had sharp peaks more than forty thousand feet high There s one thing more we must do Adams said I have barely begun to study this zeta field and this one may very well be unique irreplaceable We must therefore launch all the lifecraft except Number Two of course into separate orbits around this sun so that a properly staffed and properly equipped expedition can study it Your proper expedition might get its pants burned off too There is always that possibility but I will insist on being assigned to the project This information young man is necessary O K Doc and it was done and in a few days the Procyon hung motionless a good five hundred miles high directly above the highest sharpest mountain peak they had been able to find The Bailey boom with its spider web like network of grounding cables and with a large pulley at its end extended two hundred feet straight out from the side of the ship A twenty five mile coil of Graham wire was mounted on the remote controlled Hotchkiss reel The end of the wire was run out over the pulley a fifteen pound weight to act both as a senser and to keep the wire from fouling was attached and a few hundred feet of wire were run out Then in Lifecraft Two as far away from the business district as they could get the human bodies were grounded and Deston started the reel The wire ran out and ran and ran and ran The full twenty five miles were paid out and still nothing happened Then very slowly Deston let the big ship move straight downward Until finally it happened There was a blast beside which the most terrific flash of lightning ever seen on Earth would have seemed like a firecracker In what was almost a vacuum though she was the whole immense mass of the Procyon was hurled upward like the cork out of a champagne bottle And as for what it felt like since the five who experienced it could never describe it even to each other it is obviously indescribable by or to anyone else As Bernice said long afterward when she was being pressed by a newsman Just tell em it was the living end and that is as good a description as any The girls were unwrapped from their silver mesh cocoons and after a minute or so of semihysterics were as good as new Then Deston stared into the scope and gulped Without saying a word he waved a hand and the others looked It seemed as though the entire tip of the mountain was gone had become a seething flaming volcano on a world that had known no volcanism three for hundreds of thousands of years three Transcriber s note The original read vulcanism And what said Deston finally do you suppose happened to the other side of the ship The boom of course was gone So were all twenty of the grounding cables which each the size of a man s arm had fanned out in all directions to anchorages welded solidly to the vessel s skin and frame The anchorages too were gone and tons upon tons of high alloy steel plating and structural members for many feet around where each anchorage had been Steel had run like water had been blown away in gusts of vapor Shall I try the radio now Doc Deston asked By no means This first blast would of course be the worst but there will be several more of decreasing violence There were The second while it volatilized the boom and its grounding network merely fused portions of the anchorages The third took only the boom itself the fourth took only the dangling miles of wire At the sixth trial nothing apparently happened whereupon the wire was drawn in and a two hundred pound mass of steel was lowered until it was in firm and quiescent contact with the solid rock of the planet Now you may try your radio Adams said Deston flipped a switch and spoke quietly but clearly into a microphone Procyon One to Control Six Flight Eight Four Nine Subspace Radio Test Ninety Five I think How do you read me Control Six The reply was highly unorthodox It was a wild yell followed by words not directed at Deston at all Captain Reamer Captain French Captain Holloway ANYBODY It s the Procyon The PROCYON that was lost a year ago Unless some fool is playing a dumb joke It s no joke I hope Another voice crisp and authoritative came in growing louder as its source approached the distant pickup Or somebody will rot in jail for a hundred years Procyon One to Control Six Deston said again His voice was not quite steady this time both girls were crying openly and joyfully How do you read me Frenchy old horse It is Procyon One the Runt himself Hi Babe the new voice roared then quieted to normal volume I read you eight and one Survivors Five Second Officer Jones our wives and doctor Andrew Adams a Fellow of the College of Advanced Study He s solely responsible for our being here so Skip that for now In a lifecraft No after this long it must be the ship Not navigable of course Not in subspace and only so so in normal The Chaytors are O K but the whole Top is spun out and the rest of her won t hold air air hell She won t hold shipping crates All the Wesleys are shot and all the Q converters Half the Grahams are leaking like sieves and Skip that too Just a sec I ll cut in the downstairs recorder Now start in at your last check and tell us what s happened since It s a long story Unwind it Runt I don t give a damn how long it is Not a full detailed report just hit the high spots but don t leave out anything really important Wow Jones remarked audibly Wottaman Frenchy Like the ex urbanite said to the gardener I don t want you to work hard just take big shovelfulls and lots of em per minute That s enough out of you Herc my boy You ll be next Go ahead Babe Deston went ahead and spoke almost steadily for thirty minutes He did not mention the gangsters nor any personal matters Otherwise his report was accurate and complete He had no idea that everything he said was going out on an Earth wide hookup or that many other planets monitoring constantly all subspace channels were hooking on When he was finally released Captain French said with a chuckle Off the air for a minute You ve no idea what an uproar this has stirred up already They let them have all your stuff but we aren t putting out a thing until some Brass gets out there and gets the real story That is the real story damn it Oh sure and a very nice job too for an extemporaneous effort if it was Semantics says though that in a couple of spots it smells like slightly rancid cheese and no no keep still Too many planets listening in verbum sap Anyway THE PRESS smells something too and they re screaming their lungs out especially the sob sisters Now Herc on the air you re orbiting the fourth planet of a sun What sun Where I don t know Unlisted We re in completely unexplored territory Standard reference angles are as follows and Jones read off a long list of observations not only of the brightest stars of the galaxy but also of the standard reference points such as S Doradus lying outside it When you get that stuff all plotted you ll find a hell of a big confusion but I hope there aren t enough stars in it but what you can find us sometime Off the air for good I hope Don t make me laugh Buster Your probable center will spear it If there s ever more than one star in any confusion you set up I ll eat all the extras But there s a dozen Big Brains here gnawing their nails off up to the wrist to talk to Adams all the rest of the night so put him on and let s get back to sleep huh They re cutting this mike now Just a minute Deston snapped What s your time Three fourteen thirty seven So go back to bed you night prowling owl Of what day month and year Deston insisted Friday Sep French s voice was replaced by a much older one very evidently that of a Fellow of the College After listening for a moment to the newcomer and Adams Barbara took Deston by the arm and led him away Just a little bit of that gibberish is a bountiful sufficiency husband mine So I think we d better take Captain French s advice don t you Since there was only one star in Jones Confusion by the book Volume of Uncertainty finding the Procyon was no problem at all High Brass came in quantity and the entire story except for one bit of biology was told Two huge subspace going machine shops also came and a thousand mechanics who worked on the crippled liner for almost three weeks Then the Procyon started back for Earth under her own subspace drive under the command of Captain Theodore Jones His first last and only subspace command of course since he was now a married man Deston had wanted to resign while still a First Officer but his superiors would not accept his resignation until his promotion for outstanding services came through Thus Ex Captain Carlyle Deston and his wife were dead heading not quite back to Earth but to the transfer point for the planet Newmars Theodore Warner Deston is going to be born on Newmars where he should be Barbara had said and Deston had agreed But suppose she s Theodora Bernice had twitted her Uh uh Barbara had said calmly I just know he s Theodore Uh huh I know Bernice had nodded her spectacular head And we wanted a girl so she is Barbara Bernice Jones her name is A living doll Although both pregnancies were well advanced neither was very near full term Thus it was clear that both periods of gestation were going to be well over a year in length but none of the five persons who knew it so much as mentioned the fact To Adams it was only one tiny datum in an incredibly huge and complex mathematical structure The parents did not want to be pilloried as crackpots as publicity seeking liars or as being unable to count and they knew that nobody would believe them if they told the truth even or especially no medical doctor The more any doctor knew about gynecology and obstetrics in fact the less he would believe any such story as theirs Of what use is it to pit such puny and trivial things as facts against rock ribbed iron bound entrenched AUTHORITY The five however knew and Deston and Jones had several long and highly unsatisfactory discussions at first with Adams and later between themselves At the end of the last such discussion a couple of hours out from the transfer point Jones lit a cigarette savagely and rasped Wherever you start or whatever your angle of approach he always boils it down to this Subjective time is measured by the number of learning events experienced I ask you Babe what does that mean If anything It sounds like it ought to mean something but I ll be damned if I know what Deston gazed thoughtfully at the incandescent tip of his friend s cigarette However if it makes the old boy happy and gives the College a toehold on
