GEORGE WASHINGTON CHAPTER I BOY HOOD George Wash ing ton was born in the State of Vir gin i a at a place known as Bridg es Creek on Feb ru a ry twenty two seventeen thirty two His great grand sire John Wash ing ton came from Eng land in the year sixteen fifty seven and took up lands in that state and was a rich man George was the son of his grand son Au gus tine Au gus tine s first wife was Jane But ler who died and left him with two boys His next wife was Ma ry Ball and George was her first child The old home stead in which George was born stood near the banks of the Po to mac Riv er and was built with a steep roof that sloped down to low eaves that hung out far from the main wall There were four rooms on the ground floor and some near the roof and at each end of the house was a great fire place built of brick with broad hearth stones such as were in style in those days A stone is all that marks the birth place of George Wash ing ton He was not more than eight years of age when his fa ther went to live on a farm near the Rap pa han nock Riv er The house was built much in the same style as the one at Bridg es Creek but it stood on high ground and here all his boy hood days were spent As there were no good schools in A mer i ca at that time those who had the means sent their sons to Eng land to be taught and trained Law rence Wash ing ton was sent when he was fifteen years of age and as he was the first born it was thought that he would in time take his fa ther s place as head of the house The school to which George was sent stood in a field on his fa ther s land and was taught by a man named Hob by This gave it the name of the Hob by School There were but three things taught there How to read How to write and How to do sums and some folks thought that these were all their boys and girls had need to learn Books were scarce and dear and as most of the men raised fine crops and kept up a brisk trade they were well pleased to have their boys learn how to buy and sell and to make out bills George had been trained by his fa ther who was a strict and yet a just man to love the truth and to do right at all times He was made to feel that it was a sin to tell a lie and much worse to hide a fault than to own it George had a small axe of which he was quite proud and boy like he cut right and left with it and thought not of the harm he might do On the lawn stood a small tree which his fa ther hoped to see grow up to a good height and to bear fine fruit George made a great gash in this tree with his sharp axe and when his fa ther saw it he was quite sad He called the boy to his side and in a stern voice said Who did this Who cut this tree George hung his head with shame He knew he had done wrong and he stood in fear of his fa ther who he knew would use the rod where there was need of it It was a chance for the boy to show what kind of stuff he was made of George raised his face still red with the blush of shame and said in his frank way and with out a sign of fear I did it fa ther I can not tell a lie There was no need to use the rod on such a boy as that and the fa ther must have felt a thrill of joy when he found that the great truths he had taught his son had such a hold on his mind and had struck their roots deep in to his heart It is told that he clasped George to his breast and said with tears in his eyes that it would grieve him less to lose scores and scores of trees than to have his boy tell one lie But you must not think that George Wash ing ton was such a good good boy that he could guide him self and did not need to be kept in check He was high strung as quick as a flash and felt that he was born to rule and these traits his mo ther had to keep down and train so that they would not wreck the young boy for when George was not yet twelve years of age his fa ther died and his mo ther was left with the care of five young folks The task was one for which she was well fit as she had rare good sense a fine mind a strong will and a kind heart She used to read to her boys and girls each day out of some good book talk with them and tell them how they could best serve God and man and George laid up each word in his heart and sought to pay her back as well as he could for all her kind love and care She said of George that he was a good boy and it has been said in her praise that a no ble mo ther must have borne so brave a son When George was thirteen and his half bro ther Law rence twenty one Eng land and Spain went to war and Law rence went with the troops that were sent to the West In dies The sight of Law rence in war like trim the sound of drum and fife and the march of troops through the streets fired the heart of the young lad and from that time his plays and games in school and out took on a war like turn There was a boy at school named Wil li am Bus tle who took up arms and marched with as much zeal as George Wash ing ton But George was at all times com mand er in chief He was fond of all the sports that boys love and could run and jump and climb and toss bars and took part in all those feats that kept him in health and strength He could pitch quoits with great skill and the place is shown at Fred er icks burg where when a boy he flung a stone a cross the Rap pa han nock He was fond of a horse and there was no steed so wild that George could not mount on his back and tame him missus Wash ing ton had a colt which she thought so much of that she let it run loose in the field He was so fierce that no one had dared to get on his back One day George went out to view the colt with some of his boy friends and he told them that if they would help him put the bit in the colt s mouth he would mount The boys drove the colt in to a small lot put the bit in his mouth and Wash ing ton was soon on his back The beast rushed in to the field but was soon curbed by the strong arms of the boy on his back Then the colt reared and plunged and tried in all sorts of ways to get rid of the lad who clung to the colt s bare back as if he had been glued there Mad with rage the colt tried once more to throw him but strained too hard and fell to the ground and died in a short time The group of boys were well scared at this sad end of their fun and scarce knew what to do When they went back to the house missus Wash ing ton asked the boys if they had seen her fine breed of colts The one I am most proud of said she I am told is as large as his sire Some of the lads hung their heads and knew not what to say but George spoke up in his frank way and said that the colt was dead Dead cried she and from what cause Then George told her just what had been done and how hard the beast had fought to get free and how at the last with one wild fierce plunge he fell down and died A flush rose to the mo ther s cheek and then she said to her boy It is well but while I grieve at the loss of my fine colt I feel a pride and joy in my son who speaks the truth at all times George was fond of his books too and was so wise a lad and so full of thought and had so keen a sense of what was just that his school mates came to him when they got in to a war of words or of blows that he might say which side was right and which was wrong and thus put an end to the fight This use of his mind made George look at things in a clear light and gave him that look of true pride which all men of high mind the real kings of earth are wont to wear In due time George out grew the Hob by School and was sent to live with his half bro ther Au gus tine at Bridg es Creek where there was a school of a high grade But George had no taste for Lat in or Greek and liked best to do sums and to draw maps He wrote with great care page after page of what he called Forms of Wri ting These were notes of hand bills of sale deeds bonds and the like such as one would think a boy of thirteen would not care much a bout In this same book it is kept to this day George wrote out one hun dred and ten Rules which were to guide him in act and speech at home and a broad Some few of these I will give you that you may see at how young an age this boy set out to train him self and fit him self for the high place he was to fill It al most seems as if he must have known the high rank he was to take but this could not be His soul was fixed on high things he had no low tastes and he was led by the hand of God Here are some of the rules that George Wash ing ton took as the guide of his youth In the pres ence of o thers sing not to your self with a hum ming noise nor drum with your fin gers or feet Sleep not when o thers speak sit not when o thers stand speak not when you should hold your peace walk not when o thers stop Turn not your back to o thers when speak ing jog not the ta ble or desk on which

breast that lit tle spark of ce les ti al fire called con sci ence It is not known where George found these rules he took so much pains to write out but it is plain that he set great store by them and made use of them through out his whole life CHAPTER II YOUTH George was a great pet with his bro ther Law rence Wash ing ton who thought it would be a nice thing for him to serve on board one of the King s ships of war While Law rence was in the West In dies he was on good terms with general er al Went worth and Ad mi ral Ver non and he had no doubt they would do their best to get his bro ther a good place 
8635_295756_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He spoke to George a bout it and the boy was wild with joy 
none	none	His mo ther s pride was roused and at first she did not put a straw in his way but gave him all the help she could 
8635_295756_000002_000004	train-clean-360	But as the time drew near her heart which had been so strong and brave and full of pride gave way and she felt that she could not part with her dear boy 
none	none	One of her friends wrote to Law rence that missus Wash ing ton had made up her mind not to let George go to sea She said that some of her friends had told her it was a bad plan and I find said he that one word a gainst his go ing has more weight than ten for it 
8635_295756_000004_000000	train-clean-360	So they gave up the scheme and George was sent back to school 
none	none	He would on fine days go out in the fields and tracts of land a round the school house and with line and rod take the size and shape the length and width and mark it all down in one of his books and so much pains did he take that from the first to the last page not a blot or blur is to be seen 
8635_295756_000006_000000	train-clean-360	These neat ways formed in his youth were kept up through all his life and what seems strange is that day books and such books as you will find in great use now a days were not known at that time 
none	none	The plan had been thought out by George Wash ing ton when a boy of sixteen and shows the cast of his mind Near this time George was sent to live with his bro ther Law rence at his fine place on the Po to mac which he had called Mount Ver non to show how much he thought of the ad mi ral of that name Here George had a chance to make friends with those of high rank and he spent much of his time with George Fair fax who made his home at Bel voir near Mount Ver non Lord Fair fax a man of wealth and worth was much at Bel voir at that time He had bought large tracts of land in Vir gin i a which had not been staked out or set off in to lots 
8635_295756_000008_000003	train-clean-360	In fact he did not know their size or shape but he had heard that men had sought out some of the best spots and had built homes there and laid out farms for which they paid no rent and he thought it quite time to put a stop to such things 
none	none	In March seventeen forty eight George Wash ing ton who had been picked out by Lord Fair fax for this task went on his first trip with George Fair fax to stake off these wild lands 
8635_295756_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He wrote down what was done from day to day and by these notes we learn that he had quite a rough time of it and yet found much that was to his taste 
none	none	He and the men with him rode for miles and miles through lands rich in grain hemp and to bac company and through fine groves of trees on the bank of a broad stream Illustration WASHINGTON S FIRST SPEECH TO THE INDIANS P nineteen 
8635_295756_000011_000000	train-clean-360	One night writes George when they had been hard at work all day they came to the house where they were to be fed and lodged 
none	none	The wood men went to bed with their clothes on but George took his off and as he turned in he found his bed was of loose straw with not a thing on it but the thread bare blank et he was to wrap him self in The fleas and bugs soon forced George to get up and put on his clothes and lie as the rest of the men did and had we not been so tired he says I am sure we should not have slept much that night He made a vow then that he would sleep out of doors near a fire when on such tramps and run no more such risks On March eighteen they reached a point on the Po to mac which they were told they could not ford There had been a great rain fall and the stream had not been so high by six feet as it was at that time 
8635_295756_000012_000002	train-clean-360	They made up their minds to stay there for a day or two went to see the Warm Springs and at night camped out in the field 
none	none	At the end of two days as the stream was still high they swam their steeds to the Mar y land side 
8635_295756_000012_000004	train-clean-360	The men crossed in birch bark boats and rode all the next day in a rain storm to a place two score miles from where they had set out that morn 
none	none	Wash ing ton writes that the road was the worst that had ever been trod by man or beast 
8635_295756_000013_000000	train-clean-360	On March twenty three they fell in with a score or two of red men who had been off to war and brought home but one scalp and they had a chance to see a war dance 
8635_295756_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The red men cleared a large space and built a fire in the midst of it round which they all sat 
8635_295756_000013_000002	train-clean-360	One of the men then made a grand speech in which he told them how they were to dance 
8635_295756_000014_000000	train-clean-360	When he had done the one who could dance the best sprang up as if he had just been roused from sleep and ran and jumped round the ring in a queer kind of way 
8635_295756_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The rest soon joined him and did just as he did By this time the band made it self heard and I shall have to tell you what a fine band it was 
8635_295756_000015_000000	train-clean-360	There was a pot half full of water with a piece of deer skin stretched tight on the top and a gourd with some shot in it and a piece of horse s tail tied to it to make it look fine 
none	none	One man shook the gourd and one drummed all the while the rest danced and I doubt if you would care to hear the noise that was made 
8635_295756_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Late in the day of March twenty six they came to a place where dwelt a man named Hedge who was in the pay of King George as justice of the peace 
8635_295756_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Here they camped and at the meal that was spread there was not a knife nor a fork to eat with but such as the guests had brought with them 
8635_295756_000017_000000	train-clean-360	On the night of the first of A pril the wind blew and the rain fell The straw on which they lay took fire and George was saved by one of the men who woke him when it was in a blaze 
none	none	I have not slept for four nights in a bed wrote Wash ing ton at this time to one of his young friends at home but when I have walked a good deal in the day I lie down on a heap of straw or a bear skin by the fire with man wife young ones dogs and cats and he is in luck who gets the place next the fire For three years he kept up this mode of life but as it was a hard life to lead he could be out but a few weeks at a time His pay was a doub loon a day and some times six pis toles A doub loon is a gold coin of Spain worth not quite sixteen dol lars A pis tole is a small gold coin of Spain worth not quite four dol lars 
8635_295756_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This rough kind of life though he did not know it was to fit him for the toils and ills of war of which he may have dreamt in those days as he still kept up his love for war like things 
none	none	While at work on the land round the Blue Ridge he now and then made his way to Green way Court where Lord Fair fax dwelt at this time Here he had a chance to read choice books for Lord Fair fax had a fine mind though his tastes were queer 
8635_295756_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He lived on a knoll in a small house not more than twelve feet square 
none	none	All round him were the huts for his help black and white 
8635_295756_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Red men half breeds and wood men thronged the place where they were sure they would get a good meal 
8635_295756_000022_000004	train-clean-360	He had steeds of fine breed and hounds of keen scent for he was fond of the chase and the woods and hills were full of game 
none	none	Here was a grand chance for George who had a great taste for field sports and his rides and walks and talks with Lord Fair fax were a rich treat to the home bred youth 
8635_295756_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This wise friend lent George good books which he took with him to the woods and read with great care and in this way stored his mind with rich thoughts 
none	none	In Vir gin i a there were some few men who had served in the late war twixt Eng land and Spain and they put George through such a drill with sword and with gun that he learned to use them both with great skill 
8635_295756_000025_000000	train-clean-360	A Dutch man named Van Bra am was one of these men and he claimed to know a great deal of the art of war 
none	none	He it was that took George in hand to teach him the use of the sword and how to fence When he was nineteen years of age the red men and the French had made such in roads on the front that it was thought best to place men on guard to keep back these foes and to up hold the laws of the state of Vir gin i a There was need of some one to take charge of a school of arms at one of the chief out posts where the French sought to get a foot hold and the choice fell on George Wash ing ton who set to work at once to fit him self for the place His broth er s ill health caused this scheme to be dropped for a time as Law rence was forced to go to the West In dies for change of air and begged George to go with him George gave up all thought of self and the two set sail for Bar ba does Sep tem ber twenty eight seventeen fifty one 
8635_295756_000027_000002	train-clean-360	At sea he kept a log book took notes of the course of the winds and if the days were fair or foul and learned all he could of the ways of a ship and how to sail one 
none	none	They reached Bar ba does on No vem ber three and were pleased with the place and all the strange sights that met their gaze On all sides were fields of corn and sweet cane and groves of trees rich in leaves and fruit and all things held out a hope of cure for the sick man whose lungs were in a weak state 
8635_295756_000029_000000	train-clean-360	They had been but two weeks in Bar ba does when George fell ill with small pox and this for a time put an end to all their sports 
8635_295756_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But he had the best of care and at the end of three weeks was so well that he could go out of doors 
8635_295756_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Law rence soon tired of this place and longed for a change of scene They had to ride out by the first dawn of day for by the time the sun was half an hour high it was as hot as at mid day 
none	none	There was no change in the sick man s health and he made up his mind to go to Ber mu da in the spring He was lone some with out his wife so it was planned that George should go back home and bring her out to Ber mu da George set sail De cem ber twenty two and reached Vir gin i a at the end of five weeks He must have been glad to step on shore once more for the cold winds and fierce storms to be met with at sea at that time of the year made life on ship board some thing of a hard ship 
8635_295756_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Law rence did not gain in health and ere his wife could join him he wrote her that he would start for home to his grave He reached Mount Ver non in time to die neath his own roof and with kind friends at his bed side 
none	none	His death took place on the twenty sixth of Ju ly seventeen fifty two when he was but thirty four years of age He had been like a fa ther to George and their hearts were bound by ties so strong and sweet that it was a great grief for them to part But George had no time to sit down and mourn his loss There was work for him to do New cares were thrust on him by his bro ther s death that took up all his time and thoughts for some months and he had to keep up his drills with the men at the school of arms for which he was paid by the State CHAPTER III THE FIRST STEP TO FAME The time had now come when Wash ing ton was to take a fresh start in life and win for him self high rank The French who thought they had just as good a right as the Eng lish to take up land in A mer i ca pressed their claims and built forts on the great Lakes and on the banks of the O hi o Riv er They made friends of the red men at or near these posts and made it known that they would fight the Eng lish at all points The red men on the north shore of Lake On ta ri o were good friends with the French but those on the south shore were not They had been well dealt with by the Eng lish and their chief Half King did not like the war like move that was made by the French He went to the French post on Lake E rie and spoke thus to the troops there You have no right to come here and build towns and take our land from us by fraud and force We raised a flame in Mon tre al some time a go where we asked you to stay and not to come here on our land I now ask you to go back to that place for this land is ours Had you come in a peace ful way like the Eng lish we should have let you trade with us as they do but we will not let you come and build on our land and take it by force You and the Eng lish are white We live in a land be tween you to which you and they have no right The Great Be ing gave it to us We have told the Eng lish to move off and they have heard us and now we tell it to you We do not fear you and we mean to keep you both at arm s length The French man said to Half King You talk like a fool This land is mine and I will have it let who will stand up a gainst me I have no fear of such as you I tell you that down the O hi o I will go and build forts on it If it were blocked up I have troops e nough to break through it and to tread down all who would try to stop me My force is as the sand of the sea This proud speech made Half King feel as if he had been stabbed to the heart It was the death blow to his race But he turned with hope and trust to the Eng lish who thus far had not shown a wish to do what was not just to his tribe On Oc to ber thirty seventeen fifty three Wash ing ton set out from Will iams burg in Vir gin i a with a small band of men He was just of age and ranked as Ma jor Wash ing ton He was to go to the French out post near Lake E rie with a note from Gov er nor Din wid die to the head man there and to ask for a re ply in the name of King George He was to find out where forts had been built and how large a force of troops had crossed the Lakes and to learn all that he could of those who had dared to set up the flag of France on soil which the Eng lish claimed as their own Wash ing ton s route lay through thick woods and swamps where the foot of man had not trod he had to climb steep and rough hills where wild beasts had their lairs and to cross streams on frail rafts if they could not swim or ford them There were but eight men in the whole band and the post they were to reach lay five hundred sixty miles off and the whole of the way had to be made on horse back or on foot They met some of the In di an chiefs at a place called Logs town and Wash ing ton made his first speech to the red men He told them what he had come for and asked that some of their braves might go with him as guides and safe guards for the rest of the way He then gave them what was called a speech belt wrought with beads as a sign that they were friends and full of peace and good will The chiefs were mild and full of peace They said that Wash ing ton might have some of their men as guides but he would have to wait for two or three days as the young braves had gone out in search of game This Wash ing ton could not do There was no time to lose and so he set out with but four red men as guides and Half King was one of them Through rain and snow through a long stretch of dark woods that seemed to have no end through deep streams and swamps where there was no sure foot hold for man or beast the brave band kept on their way At the end of thirty five days from the time they left Will iams burg they reached a place called Ven an go where they saw a house from the top of which a French flag flew and Wash ing ton called a halt The head man in charge asked him and his friends to sup with him The wine was passed with a free hand but Wash ing ton did not drink like his French host He knew he would need to keep a cool head for his work When the French man had his tongue loosed by the wine he told a good deal We have got the land he said and we mean to keep it You Eng lish may have two men to our one but you are slow It takes you a long time to move The man s tongue wagged on in a free way and Wash ing ton who had kept his wits wrote down all he said that could be of use to him The next day it rained hard and they could not go on Then for the first time the French man found that there were red men with the Eng lish Wash ing ton had kept them back for he feared to trust them to the wiles of the French But now the shrewd man made a great time and hailed them as dear friends He was so glad to see them How could they be so near and not come to see him He gave them gifts and plied them with strong drink till Half King and his braves thought no more of what they had pledged to the Eng lish They were soon in such a state that they did not care to move It took some time for Wash ing ton to get them free from the wiles of the French and it took four days more of snow and rain through mire and swamp to reach the fort for which they had set out Here Wash ing ton met the chief of the fort and made known the cause that had brought him He gave him the note from Gov er nor Din wid die in which it was asked why the French had come in to a State that was owned by Great Brit ain and they were bid to go in peace The French took two days in which to think of the course they should take and in this time Wash ing ton set down in his note book the size and strength of the fort and all that he could find out He told his men to use their eyes and to count the boats in the stream and the guns in the fort The first chance he had Wash ing ton drew a plan of this fort and it was sent to Eng land for King George to see Wash ing ton saw that the Half King and the braves with him had much to say to the French and he did not trust them He heard that the Eng lish who sought to trade on the O hi o were seized by the French and that some red men had passed the fort with two or three white scalps All this made him wish to get off safe with his small band and when the French chief gave him a sealed note he had a shrewd guess as to what was in it At last when the start was to be made the French chief had large stores of food and wine put on their boats and made a great show of good will but at the same time he tried to keep the red men with him and told them he would give them guns for gifts the next day Wash ing ton was pressed by the red men to wait that long for them and the next morn the French had to give the guns Then they tried to get the red men to drink once more but Wash ing ton plead with them and at last got them to start It was hard to steer the boats as the stream was full of ice and at times they had to leap out and stand in the wet for half an hour at a time to drag the boats by main force off the shoals On the part of the trip that had to be made by land they had a hard time too It was cold the roads were deep in mire and the steeds were so worn out that it was feared they would fall by the way Wash ing ton gave up his horse to help bear the food and things for use and he asked his friends to do so too They all went on foot and the cold grew worse There was deep snow that froze as it fell For three days they toiled on in a slow way At last Wash ing ton made up his mind to leave the men and steeds in charge of one of his band and to strike off with his pack on his back and his gun in his hand by a way which it seemed to him would take him home by a short cut He had the sealed note that he wished to give up as soon as he could He took but one man with him At night they lit a fire and camped by it in the woods At two in the morn they were once more on foot They fell in with a red man who claimed to know mister Gist the man who was with Wash ing ton and called him by his name in his own tongue and seemed glad to see him They asked the red man if he would go with them and show them a short cut to the Forks of the Al le gha ny Riv er The red man seemed glad to serve them and took Wash ing ton s pack on his own back Then the three set out and walked at a brisk pace for eight or ten miles By this time Wash ing ton s feet were so sore that he could not take a step with out pain and he was well tired out He thought it best to camp where they were and the red man begged Wash ing ton to let him bear his gun But the Ma jor would not let it go out of his own hands This made the red man cross and he urged them to keep on and said there were red skins in the woods who would scalp them if they lay out all night He would take them to his own hut where they would be safe The white men lost faith in their guide and were soon quite ill at ease When the red man found that he could not make them go his way or do as he said he ceased to wear the face of a friend At heart he was the foe of all white men All at once he made a stop and then turned and fired on them Wash ing ton found that he was not hit so he turned to mister Gist and said Are you shot No said Gist Then the red man ran to a big white oak tree to load his gun Gist would have killed him but Wash ing ton would not let him Gist says We let him charge his gun We found he put in a ball then we took care of him The Ma jor or I stood by the guns We made him make a fire for us by a small run as if we meant to sleep there I said to the Ma jor As you will not have him killed we must get rid of him in some way and then we must march on all night on which I said to the red man I suppose you were lost and fired your gun He said he knew the way to his log hut and it was not far off Well said I do you go home and as we are tired we will fol low your track in the morn ing and here is a cake of bread for you and you must give us meat in the morn ing He was glad to get off Wash ing ton says We walked all the rest of the night and made no stop that we might get the start so far as to be out of their reach the next day since we were quite sure they would get on our track as soon as it was light But no more was seen or heard of them and the next night at dusk the two white men came to the Al le gha ny which they thought to cross on the ice This they could not do so they had to go to work with but one small axe and a poor one at that and make a raft It was a whole day s work They next got it launched and went on board of it then set off But when they were in mid stream the raft was jammed in the ice in such a way that death seemed to stare them in the face Wash ing ton put out his pole to stay the raft so that the ice might pass by but the tide was so swift that it drove the ice with great force It bore down on the pole so hard that Wash ing ton was thrown in to the stream where it was at least ten feet deep He would have been swept out of sight if he had not caught hold of one of the raft logs As they found they could not cross the stream or get back to the shore they had left they quit the raft and got on a small isle near which they were borne by the tide But this was not the end of their ill luck It was so cold that mister Gist s hands and feet froze and both he and Wash ing ton were in great pain through out the long dark night A gleam of hope came with the dawn of day for they found the ice twixt them and the east bank of the stream was so hard as to bear their weight and they made their way on it and the same day came to a place where they could rest Here they spent two or three days They set out on the first of Jan u a ry and the next day came to Mon on ga he la where Wash ing ton bought a horse On the eleventh he got to Bel voir where he stopped one day to take the rest he was in need of and then set out and reached Will iams burg on the sixteenth of Jan u a ry He gave to Gov er nor Din wid die the note he had brought from the French chief showed him the plans of the fort and told him all that he had seen and done The fame of his deeds of the ills he had borne and the nerve and pluck he had shown was soon noised a broad and George Wash ing ton though a mere youth was looked up to by young and old CHAPTER IV TO THE FRONT The French chief in his note to Gov er nor Din wid die had said in words that were smooth but clear that he would not leave the banks of the O hi o so the Eng lish felt as if it were time for them to make a move though they did not wish to bring on a war Land was set off on the O hi o where a fort was built and the rest of it left for the use of the troops Wash ing ton was asked to lead the troops but he shrank from it as a charge too great for one so young So Josh u a Fry was made colonel o nel and Wash ing ton Lieu ten ant colonel o nel of a force of three hundred men It was hard work to get men to join the ranks The pay was small and those who had good farms and good homes did not care to leave them Those who had a mind to go were for the most part men who did not like to work and had no house or home they could call their own Some were bare foot some had no shirts to their backs and not a few were with out coat or waist coat as the vest was called in those days If it was hard work to get this kind of men it was still more of a task to find those who would serve as chiefs and Wash ing ton found him self left in charge of a lot of raw troops who knew no will but their own But Van Bra am who had taught Wash ing ton how to use the sword was with him and gave him just the aid he had need of at this time On A pril two seventeen fifty four Wash ing ton at the head of one hundred fifty men set off for the new fort at the Fork of the O hi o The roads were rough and the march was slow and it was not till A pril twenty that they reached Will s Creek Here they were met by a small force in charge of Cap tain Ad am Ste phen The rest of the force with the field guns were to come by way of the Po to mac These last were in charge of colonel o nel Fry When Wash ing ton reached Will s Creek word was brought him that a large force of French troops had borne down on the new fort Cap tain Trent who was in charge of the few troops in the fort was a way at the time and the young En sign Ward did not know what to do He sought the aid of Half King who told him to plead with the French and to beg them to wait till the Cap tain came back and the two went at once to the French camp But the French would not wait or make terms of peace They had come as foes and told En sign Ward that if he did not leave the fort at once with all his men they would put him out by force All the French would grant was that our men might take their tools with them so the next morn they filed out of the fort gave up their arms and took the path to the woods The French took the fort and built it up and called it Fort Du quesne kane which was the name of the Gov er nor of Can a da When the sad news was brought to Wash ing ton he was at a loss to know what to do or which way to turn Here he was with a small band of raw troops right in the midst of foes red and white who would soon hem them in and use them ill if they found out where they were Yet it would not do to turn back or show signs of fear colonel o nel Fry had not yet come up and the weight of care was thrown on Wash ing ton He let the Gov er nors of Penn syl va ni a and Ma ry land know of his plight and urged them to send on troops But none came to his aid He had a talk with his chief men and they all thought it would be best to push on through the wild lands make the road as they went on and try to reach the mouth of Red stone Creek where they would build a fort By this means the men would be kept at work their fears would be quelled and a way made for the smooth and swift march of the troops in the rear There was so much to be done that the men work as hard as they might could not clear the way with much speed There were great trees to be cut down rocks to be moved swamps to be filled up and streams to be bridged While in the midst of these toils the bread gave out and the lack of food made the men too weak to work In spite of all these ills they made out to move at the rate of four miles a day up steep hills and through dense woods that have since borne the name of The Shades of Death While at a large stream where they had to stop to build a bridge Wash ing ton was told that it was not worth while for him to try to go by land to Red stone Creek when he could go by boat in much less time This would be a good plan if it would work and to make sure Wash ing ton took five men with him in a bark boat down the stream One of these men was a red skin guide When they had gone ten miles the guide said that that was as far as he would go Wash ing ton said Why do you want to leave us now We need you and you know that we can not get on with out you Tell us why you wish to leave The red man said Me want gifts The red men will not work with out them The French know this and are wise If you want the red men to be your guides you must buy them They do not love you so well that they will serve you with out pay Wash ing ton told the guide that when they got back he would give him a fine white shirt with a frill on it and a good great coat and this put an end to the strike for that time They kept on in the small boat for a score of miles till they came to a place where there was a falls in the stream at least forty feet This put a stop to their course and Wash ing ton went back to camp with his mind made up to go on by land He was on his way to join his troops when word was brought him from Half King to be on his guard as the French were close at hand They had been on the march for two days and meant to strike the first foe they should see Half King said that he and the rest of his chiefs would be with Wash ing ton in five days to have a talk Wash ing ton set to work at once to get his troops in shape to meet the foe Scouts were sent out There was a scare in the night The troops sprang to arms and kept on the march till day break In the mean time at nine o clock at night word came from Half King who was then six miles from the camp that he had seen the tracks of two French men and the whole force was near that place Wash ing ton put him self at the head of two score men left the rest to guard the camp and set off to join Half King The men had to grope their way by foot paths through the woods The night was dark and there had been quite a fall of rain so that they slipped and fell and lost their way and had to climb the great rocks and the trees that had been blown down and blocked their way It was near sun rise when they came to the camp of Half King who at once set out with a few of his braves to show Wash ing ton the tracks he had seen Then Half King called up two of his braves showed them the tracks and told them what to do They took the scent and went off like hounds and brought back word that they had traced the foot prints to a place shut in by rocks and trees where the French were in camp It was planned to take them off their guard Wash ing ton was to move on the right Half King and his men on the left They made not a sound Wash ing ton was the first on the ground and as he came out from the rocks and trees at the head of his men the French caught sight of him and ran to their arms A sharp fire was kept up on both sides De Ju mon ville who led the French troops was killed with ten of his men One of Wash ing ton s men was killed and two or three met with wounds None of the red men were hurt as the French did not aim their guns at them at all In less than half an hour the French gave way and ran but Wash ing ton s men soon came up with them took them and they were sent in charge of a strong guard to Gov er nor Din wid die This was the first act of war in which blood had been shed and Wash ing ton had to bear a great deal of blame from both France and Eng land till the truth was made known He was thought to have been too rash and too bold and in more haste to make war than to seek for peace These sins were charged to his youth for it was not known then how much more calm and wise and shrewd he was than most men who were twice his age The French claimed that this band had been sent out to ask Wash ing ton in a kind way to leave the lands that were held by the crown of France But Wash ing ton was sure they were spies and Half King said they had bad hearts and if our men were such fools as to let them go he would give them no more aid Half King was full of fight and Wash ing ton was flushed with pride and in haste to move on and brave the worst He wrote home The Min goes have struck the French and I hope will give a good blow be fore they have done Then he told of the fight he had been in and how he had won it and was not hurt though he stood in the midst of the fierce fire The balls whizzed by him and said Wash ing ton I was charmed with the sound This boast came to the ears of George II who said in a dry sort of a way He would not say so if he had heard ma ny When long years had passed some one asked Wash ing ton if he had made such a speech If I did said he it was when I was young And he was but twenty two years of age He knew that as soon as the French heard of the fight and their bad luck they would send a strong force out to meet him so he set all his men to work to add to the size of the earth work and to fence it in so that it might be more of a strong hold Then he gave to it the name of Fort Ne ces si ty for it had been thrown up in great haste in time of great need when food was so scant it was feared the troops would starve to death At one time for six days they had no flour and of course no bread News came of the death of colonel o nel Fry at Will s creek and Wash ing ton was forced to take charge of the whole force Fry s troops three hundred in all came up from Will s Creek and Half King brought forty red men with their wives and young ones and these all had to be fed and cared for Young as he was Wash ing ton was like a fa ther to this strange group of men On Sundays when in camp he read to them from the word of God and by all his acts made them feel that he was a good and true man and fit to be their chief The red men did quite well as spies and scouts but were not of much use in the field and they and some men from South Car o li na did much to vex young Wash ing ton Half King did not like the way that white men fought so he took him self and his band off to a safe place The white men from South Car o li na who had come out to serve their king were too proud to soil their hands or to do hard work nor would they be led by a man of the rank of colonel o nel In the midst of all these straits Wash ing ton stood calm and firm The South Car o li na troops were left to guard the fort while the rest of the men set out to clear the road to Red stone Creek Their march was slow and full of toil and at the end of two weeks they had gone but thirteen miles Here at Gist s home where they stopped to rest word came to Wash ing ton that a large force of the French were to be sent out to fight him Word was sent to the fort to have the men that were there join them with all speed They reached Gist s at dusk and by dawn of the next day all our troops were in that place where it was at first thought they would wait for the foe But this plan they gave up for it was deemed best to make haste back to the fort where they might at least screen them selves from the fire of the foe The roads were rough the heat was great the food was scant and the men weak and worn out There were but few steeds and these had to bear such great loads that they could not move with speed Wash ing ton gave up his own horse and went on foot and the rest of the head men did the same The troops from Vir gin i a worked with a will and would take turns and haul the big field guns while the King s troops from South Car o li na walked at their ease and would not lend a hand or do a stroke of work On the morn of Ju ly three scouts brought word to the fort that the French were but four miles off and in great force Wash ing ton at once drew up his men on the ground out side of the fort to wait for the foe Ere noon the French were quite near the fort and the sound of their guns was heard Wash ing ton thought this was a trick to draw his men out in to the woods so he told them to hold their fire till the foe came in sight But as the French did not show them selves though they still kept up their fire he drew his troops back to the fort and bade them fire at will and do their best to hit their mark The rain fell all day long so that the men in the fort were half drowned and some of the guns scarce fit for use The fire was kept up till eight o clock at night when the French sent word they would like to make terms with our men Wash ing ton thought it was a trick to find out the state of things in the fort and for a time gave no heed to the call The French sent two or three times and at last brought the terms for Wash ing ton to read They were in French There was no thing at hand to write with so Van Bra am who could speak French was called on to give the key It was a queer scene A light was brought and held close to his face so that he could see to read The rain fell in such sheets that it was hard work to keep up the flame Van Bra am mixed up Dutch French and Eng lish in a sad way while Wash ing ton and his chief aids stood near with heads bent and tried their best to guess what was meant They made out at last that the main terms were that the troops might march out of the fort and fear no harm from French or red skins as they made their way back to their homes The drums might beat and the flags fly and they could take with them all the goods and stores and all that was in the fort but the large guns These the French would break up And our men should pledge them selves not to build on the lands which were claimed by the King of France for the space of one year The weak had to yield to the strong and Wash ing ton and his men laid down their arms and marched out of the fort A note of thanks was sent to Wash ing ton and all his head men but Van Bra am who was thought to have read the terms in such a way as to harm our side and serve the French But there were those who felt that Van Bra am was as true as he was brave and that it was the fault of his head and not his heart for it was a hard task for a Dutch man to turn French in to Eng lish and make sense of it CHAPTER V AS AIDE DE CAMP In spite of the way in which the fight at Great Mead ows came to an end Gov er nor Din wid die made up his mind that the troops led by Wash ing ton should cross the hills and drive the French from Fort Du quesne Wash ing ton thought it a wild scheme for the snow lay deep on the hills his men were worn out and had no arms nor tents nor clothes nor food such as would fit them to take the field 
8635_295759_000000_000001	train-clean-360	It would need gold to buy these things as well as to pay for fresh troops 
8635_295759_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Gold was placed in the Gov er nor s hands to use as he pleased 
8635_295759_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Our force was spread out in to ten bands of one hundred men each 
none	none	The King s troops were put in high rank and colonel o nel Wash ing ton was made Cap tain 
8635_295759_000001_000003	train-clean-360	This of course was more than he could bear so he left the ar my at once and with a sad heart 
none	none	In a short time Gov er nor Sharpe of Ma ry land was placed by King George at the head of all the force that was to fight the French He knew that he would need the aid of Wash ing ton and he begged him to come back and serve with him in the field But Wash ing ton did not like the terms and paid no heed to the call The next Spring general er al Brad dock came from Eng land with two large bands of well trained troops which it was thought would drive the French back in to Can a da 
8635_295759_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Our men were full of joy and thought the war would soon be at an end 
none	none	Brad dock urged Wash ing ton to join him in the field Wash ing ton felt that he could be of great use as he knew the land and the ways of red men so he took up the sword once more as Brad dock s aide de camp Ben ja min Frank lin who had charge of the mails lent his aid to the cause and did all that he could to serve Brad dock and his men Brad dock with his staff and a guard of horse men set out for Will s Creek by the way of Win ches ter in A pril seventeen fifty five 
8635_295759_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He rode in a fine turn out that he had bought of Gov er nor Sharpe which he soon found out was not meant for use on rough roads 
8635_295759_000004_000002	train-clean-360	But he had fought with dukes and men of high rank and was fond of show and liked to put on a great deal of style 
8635_295759_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He thought that this would make the troops look up to him and would add much to his fame 
none	none	In May the troops went in to camp and Wash ing ton had a chance to learn much of the art of war that was new and strange to him and to see some things that made him smile 
8635_295759_000007_000000	train-clean-360	All the rules and forms of camp life were kept up 
8635_295759_000007_000001	train-clean-360	One of the head men who died while in camp was borne to the grave in this style A guard marched in front of the corpse the cap tain of it in the rear Each man held his gun up side down as a sign that the dead would war no more and the drums beat the dead march 
8635_295759_000007_000002	train-clean-360	When near the grave the guard formed two lines that stood face to face let their guns rest on the ground and leaned their heads on the butts 
8635_295759_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The corpse was borne twixt these two rows of men with the sword and sash on the top of the box in which he lay and in the rear of it the men of rank marched two and two 
8635_295759_000007_000004	train-clean-360	When the corpse was put in the ground the guard fired their guns three times and then all the troops marched back to camp 
none	none	The red men the Del a wares and Shaw nees came to aid general er al Brad dock 
8635_295759_000008_000001	train-clean-360	With them were White Thun der who had charge of the speech belts and Sil ver Heels who was swift of foot 
8635_295759_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Half King was dead and White Thun der reigned in his stead 
8635_295759_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The red men had a camp to them selves where they would sing and dance and howl and yell for half the night 
none	none	It was fun for the King s troops to watch them at their sports and games and they soon found a great charm in this wild sort of life 
8635_295759_000010_000000	train-clean-360	In the day time the red men and their squaws rigged up in their plumes and war paint hung round Brad dock s camp and gazed spell bound at the troops as they went through their drills 
8635_295759_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But this state of things did not last long and strife rose twixt the red and white men and some of the red skins left the camp 
8635_295759_000011_000001	train-clean-360	They told Brad dock they would meet him on his march but they did not keep their word 
none	none	Wash ing ton was sent to Will iams burg to bring the gold of which there was need and when he came back he found that Brad dock had left a small guard at Fort Cum ber land on Will s Creek and was then on his way to Fort Du quesne He would give no heed to those who knew more of the back woods than he did nor call on the red men to serve as scouts and guides He was not used to that kind of war fare and scorned to be taught by such a youth as George Wash ing ton 
8635_295759_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The march was a hard one for man and beast 
none	none	Up steep hills and through rough roads they had to drag the guns and Brad dock soon found out that these new fields were not like the old ones on which he had been wont to fight Hard as it was for his pride to seek the aid of so young a man he was at last forced to ask Wash ing ton to help him out of these straits They had then made a halt at Lit tle Mead ows Wash ing ton said there was no time to lose 
8635_295759_000015_000002	train-clean-360	They must push on at once 
8635_295759_000016_000000	train-clean-360	While at this place Cap tain Jack and his brave band of hunts men came in to camp 
8635_295759_000016_000001	train-clean-360	They were fond of the chase and were well armed with knives and guns and looked quite like a tribe of red skins as they came out of the wood 
8635_295759_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Brad dock met them in a stiff sort of way 
8635_295759_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Cap tain Jack stepped in front of his band and said that he and his men were used to rough work and knew how to deal with the red men and would be glad to join the force 
8635_295759_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Brad dock looked on him with a gaze of scorn and spoke to him in a way that roused the ire of Cap tain Jack 
8635_295759_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He told his men what had been said and the whole band turned their backs on the camp and went through the woods to their old haunts where they were known and prized at their true worth 
none	none	In the mean time Wash ing ton who had had a head ache for some days grew so ill that he could not ride on his horse and had to be borne part of the time in a cart Brad dock who well knew what a loss his death would be said that he should not go on Wash ing ton plead with him but Brad dock was firm and made him halt on the road Here he was left with a guard and in care of Doc tor Craik and here he had to stay for two long weeks 
8635_295759_000020_000003	train-clean-360	By that time he could move but not with out much pain for he was still quite weak 
8635_295759_000020_000004	train-clean-360	It was his wish to join the troops in time for the great blow and while yet too weak to mount his horse he set off with his guards in a close cart and reached Brad dock s camp on the eighth of Ju ly 
none	none	He was just in time for the troops were to move on Fort Du quesne the next day The fort was on the same side of the Mon on ga he la as the camp but twixt them lay a pass two miles in length with the stream on the left and a high range of hills on the right 
8635_295759_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The plan was to ford the stream near the camp march on the west bank of the stream for five miles or so and then cross to the east side and push on to the fort 
none	none	By sun rise the next day the troops turned out in fine style and marched off to the noise of drum and fife To Wash ing ton this was a grand sight Though still weak and ill he rode his horse and took his place on the staff as aide de camp 
8635_295759_000023_000000	train-clean-360	At one o clock the whole force had crossed the ford north of the fort and were on their way up the bank when they were met by a fierce and sharp fire from foes they could not see

none	none	What Wash ing ton feared had come to pass Brad dock did his best to keep the troops in line but as fast as they moved up they were cut down by foes screened by rocks and trees 
8635_295759_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Now and then one of the red men would dart out of the woods with a wild yell to scalp a red coat who had been shot down 
8635_295759_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Wild fear seized Brad dock s men who fired and took no aim 
8635_295759_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Those in the front rank were killed by those in the rear 
none	none	Some of the Vir gin i a troops took post back of trees and fought as the red men did Wash ing ton thought it would be a good plan for Brad dock s men to do the same But he thought there was but one way for troops to fight and that brave men ought not to skulk in that way 
8635_295759_000024_000005	train-clean-360	When some of them took to the trees Brad dock stormed at them and called them hard names and struck them with the flat of his sword 
none	none	All day long Wash ing ton rode here and there in the midst of the fight 
8635_295759_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He was in all parts of the field a fine mark for the guns of the foe and yet not a shot struck him to do him harm 
8635_295759_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Four small shots went through his coat 
none	none	Two of his steeds were shot down and though those who stood near him fell dead at his side Wash ing ton had not one wound 
8635_295759_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The fight raged on 
8635_295759_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Death swept through the ranks of the red coats The men at the guns were seized with fright 
none	none	Wash ing ton sprang from his horse wheeled a brass field piece with his own hand and sent a good shot through the woods 
8635_295759_000026_000003	train-clean-360	But this act did not bring the men back to their guns 
8635_295759_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Brad dock was on the field the whole day and did his best to turn the tide 
none	none	But most of his head men had been slain in his sight five times had he been forced to mount a fresh horse as one by one was struck down by the foe man s shot and still he kept his ground and tried to check the flight of his men 
8635_295759_000028_000000	train-clean-360	At last a shot struck him in the right arm and went in to his lungs He fell from his horse and was borne from the field 
8635_295759_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The troops took fright at once and most of them fled

8635_295759_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Brad dock is killed 
none	none	Wash ing ton had been sent to a camp forty miles off and was on his way back when he heard the sad news But Brad dock did not die at once He was brought back to camp and for two days lay in a calm state but full of pain Now and then his lips would move and he was heard to say Who would have thought it We shall know how to deal with them the next time He died at Fort Ne ces si ty on the night of Ju ly thirteen Had he done as Wash ing ton told him he might have saved his own life and won the day 
8635_295759_000033_000002	train-clean-360	But he was a proud man and when he made up his mind to do a thing he would do it at all risks 
8635_295759_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Through this fault he missed the fame he hoped to win lost his life and found a grave in a strange land 
none	none	His loss was a great gain to Wash ing ton for all felt that he so calm so grave so free from fear was the right sort of man to lead troops to war Those who had seen him in the field thought that he bore a charmed life for though he stood where the shot fell thick and fast he was not hurt and showed no signs of fear But Wash ing ton was weak and in need of rest and as the death of Brad dock left him with no place in the force he went back to Mount Ver non where he thought to spend the rest of his days The fight which he took part in as aide de camp and which had so sad an end goes by the name of Brad dock s de feat CHAPTER VI colonel O NEL OF VIR GIN I A TROOPS The troops in Vir gin i a were left with out a head There was no one to lead them out to war and if this fact came to the ears of the French they would be more bold Wash ing ton s friends urged him to ask for the place But this he would not do His brother wrote him thus Our hopes rest on you dear George You are the man for the place all are loud in your praise But Wash ing ton was firm He wrote back and told in plain words all that he had borne and how he had been served for the past two years I love my land he said and shall be glad to serve it but not on the same terms that I have done so His mo ther begged him not to risk his life in these wars He wrote her that he should do all that he could to keep out of harm s way but if he should have a call to drive the foes from the land of his birth he would have to go And this he was sure would give her much more pride than if he were to stay at home On the same day Au gust thirteen that this note was sent word came to Wash ing ton that he had been made chief of all the troops in Vir gin i a and the next month he went to Win ches ter to stay Here he found much to do There was need of more troops and it was hard work to get them Forts had to be built and he drew up a plan of his own and set men to work it out and went out from time to time to see how they got on with it He rode off thus at the risk of his life for red men lay in wait for scalps and were fierce to do deeds of blood The stir of war put new life in to the veins of old Lord Fair fax He got up a troop of horse and put them through a drill on the lawn at Green way Court He was fond of the chase and knew how to run the sly fox to the ground The red man was a sort of fox and Fair fax was keen for the chase and now and then would mount his steed and call on George Wash ing ton who was glad to have his kind friend so near In a short time he had need of his aid for word came from the fort at Will s Creek that a band of red men were on the war path with fire brands and knives and were then on their way to Win ches ter A man on a fleet horse was sent post haste to Wash ing ton who had been called to Will iams burg the chief town In the mean time Lord Fair fax sent word to all the troops near his home to arm and haste to the aid of Win ches ter Those on farms flocked to the towns where they thought they would be safe and the towns folks fled to the west side of the Blue Ridge In the height of this stir Wash ing ton rode in to town and the sight of him did much to quell their fears He thought that there were but a few red skins who had caused this great scare and it was his wish to take the field at once and go out and put them to flight But he could get but a few men to go with him The rest of the town troops would not stir All the old fire arms that were in the place were brought out and smiths set to work to scour off the rust and make them fit to use Caps such as are now used on guns were not known in those days Flint stones took their place One of these was put in the lock so that when it struck a piece of steel it would flash fire and the spark would set off the gun These were called flint lock guns Such a thing as a match had not been thought of and flint stones were made use of to light all fires Carts were sent off for balls and flints and for food with which to feed all those who had flocked to Win ches ter The tribes of red men that had once served with Wash ing ton were now on good terms with the French One of their chiefs named Ja cob laughed at forts that were built of wood and made his boast that no fort was safe from him if it would catch fire The town where these red men dwelt was two score miles from Fort Du quesne and a band of brave white men with John Arm strong and Hugh Mer cer at their head set out from Win ches ter to put them to rout At the end of a long march they came at night on the red men s strong hold and took them off their guard The red men led by the fierce chief Ja cob who chose to die ere he would yield made a strong fight but in the end most of them were killed their huts were set on fire and the brave strong hold was a strong hold no more In the mean time Wash ing ton had left Win ches ter and gone to Fort Cum ber land on Will s Creek Here he kept his men at work on new roads and old ones Some were sent out as scouts Brig a dier general er al Forbes who was in charge of the whole force was on his way from Phil a del phi a but his march was a slow one as he was not in good health The plan was when he came to move on the French fort The work that was to have been done north of the fort by Lord Lou doun hung fire It was felt that he was not the right man for the place and so his lord ship was sent back to Eng land Ma jor general er al Ab er crom bie then took charge of the King s troops at the north These were to charge on Crown Point Ma jor general er al Am herst with a large force of men was with the fleet of Ad mi ral Bos caw en that set sail from Hal i fax the last of May These were to lay siege to Lou is berg and the isle of Cape Bre ton which is at the mouth of the Gulf of saint Law rence Forbes was to move on Fort Du quesne and was much too slow to suit Wash ing ton who was in haste to start His men had worn out their old clothes and were in great need of new ones which they could not get for some time He liked the dress the red men wore It was light and cool and what had to be thought of most it was cheap Wash ing ton had some of his men put on this dress and it took well and has since been worn by those who roam the woods and plains of our great land I will not tell you of all that took place near the great Lakes at this time as I wish to keep your mind on George Wash ing ton The schemes laid out by general er al Forbes did not please Wash ing ton who urged a prompt march on the fort while the roads were good He wrote to Ma jor Hal ket who had been with Brad dock and was now on Forbes staff I find him fixed to lead you a new way to the O hi o through a road each inch of which must be cut when we have scarce time left to tread the old track which is known by all to be the best path through the hills He made it plain that if they went that new way all would be lost and they would be way laid by the red skins and meet with all sorts of ills But no heed was paid to his words and the warm days came to an end Six weeks were spent in hard work on the new road with a gain of less than three score miles when the whole force might have been in front of the French fort had they marched by the old road as Wash ing ton had urged At a place known as Loy al Han nan the troops were brought to a halt as Forbes thought this was a good place to build a fort Some men in charge of Ma jor Grant went forth as scouts At dusk they drew near a fort and set fire to a log house near its walls This was a rash thing to do as it let the French know just where they were But not a gun was fired from the fort This the King s troops took for a sign of fear and were bold and proud and quite sure that they would win the day So Brad dock had thought and we know his fate At length when Forbes and his men were off their guard the French made a dash from the fort and poured their fire on the King s troops On their right and left flanks fell a storm of shot from the red skins who had hid back of trees rocks and shrubs The King s troops were then brought up in line and for a while stood firm and fought for their lives But they were no match for the red skins whose fierce yells made the blood run chill Ma jor Lew is fought hand to hand with a brave whom he laid dead at his feet Red skins came up at once to take the white man s scalp and there was but one way in which he could save his life This was to give him self up to the French which both he and Ma jor Grant were forced to do as their troops had been put to rout with great loss Wash ing ton won much praise for the way in which the Vir gin i a troops had fought and he was at once put in charge of a large force who were to lead the van serve as scouts and do their best to drive back the red skins work that called for the best skill and nerve It was late in the fall of the year when the King s troops all met at Loy al Han nan and so much had to be done to clear the roads that snow would be on the ground ere they could reach the fort But from those of the French that they had seized in the late fight they found out that there were but few troops in the fort that food was scarce and the red skins false to their trust This lent hope to the King s troops who made up their minds to push on They took up their march at once with no tents or stores and but few large guns Wash ing ton rode at the head It was a sad march for the ground was strewn with the bones of those who had fought with Grant and with Brad dock and been slain by the foe or died of their wounds At length the troops drew near the fort and made their way up to it with great care for they thought the French would be in wait for them and that there would be a fierce fight But the French had had such bad luck in Can a da that they had lost heart and those in the fort were left to take care of them selves So when the Eng lish were one day s march from the fort the French stole out at night got in to boats set the fort on fire and went down the O hi o by the light of the flames So the fort which had been the cause of so much blood shed fell at last with out a blow and on No vem ber twenty five seventeen fifty eight Wash ing ton with his van guard marched in and placed the Brit ish flag on the wreck of the once proud strong hold the name of which was changed to Fort Pitt The French gave up all claim to the O hi o from that time The red skins were quick to make friends with those who held sway and there was peace with all the tribes twixt the O hi o and the Lakes Wash ing ton had made up his mind to leave the field when this war came to an end and in De cem ber of the same year he bade his troops good bye He had been with them for five years in a hard school and the strain on his mind had been so great that he lost his health and felt that he could war no more CHAPTER VII THE HOME OF WASH ING TON In the year seventeen fifty eight while Wash ing ton was with his troops at Win ches ter he met and fell in love with missus Mar tha Cus tis Her home was known as the White House and here she dwelt in fine style for she had great wealth She had a boy six years of age and a girl of four Such were her charms that men of wealth and rank sought for her hand but Wash ing ton so calm and grave and with his way yet to make in the world won her heart and they were to be wed at the close of the war She had heard of the brave deeds he had done and was proud to be the wife of such a man so on Jan u a ry six seventeen fifty nine the two were made one In the course of a few months Wash ing ton went to live at Mount Ver non where he spent much of his time in the care of his own lands and those of his wife He had a seat with those who made laws for the State and no man was thought more of than George Wash ing ton Wash ing ton loved to be at Mount Ver non where he had spent a great part of his boy hood with his bro ther Law rence of whom he was so fond 
8635_295761_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The house stood on a knoll and near it were wild woods and deep dells haunts of the fox and the deer and bright streams where fish could be found at all times 
8635_295761_000003_000000	train-clean-360	His chief sport was the chase and at the right time of the year he would go out two or three times a week with dogs and horns and trained steeds in search of the sly fox who would lead him and his friends a fine run 
8635_295761_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Some times he would go out with his gun and shoot wild ducks great flocks of which might be found on the streams close at hand 
none	none	Or he would scour the woods for the game with which they were filled and which none but those who owned the place had a right to kill 
8635_295761_000005_000000	train-clean-360	A man who had a bad name and paid no heed to the laws that were made was wont to make his way to the grounds near Mount Ver non and shoot just what game he chose 
none	none	More than once he had been told to leave and not come back but he paid no more heed than if he had been deaf and was sure to take his pick from the best kind of ducks One day when Wash ing ton was out on horse back he heard the sound of a gun down near the edge of the stream 
8635_295761_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He put spurs to his horse dashed through bush and brake and soon came up to the rogue who had just time to jump in his boat and push from shore 
none	none	Then the bad man raised his gun cocked it and took aim at Wash ing ton whom he would no doubt have shot down in cold blood But Wash ing ton rode at once in to the stream and seized the prow of the boat and drew it to shore Then he sprang from his horse wrenched the gun from the thief s hand and laid on the lash in such a way that the rogue took to his heels when let loose and came no more near Mount Ver non As I have told you men of great wealth dwelt on the shores of the Po to mac and kept house in fine style 
8635_295761_000008_000001	train-clean-360	They had a large force of slaves and made great feasts for their friends 
none	none	One of them used to come out in a rich barge to meet Wash ing ton 
8635_295761_000008_000003	train-clean-360	This barge was rowed by six black men in check shirts and black vel vet caps 
none	none	Wash ing ton had a coach and four with black foot men for missus Wash ing ton to use when she drove out but he chose to go on horse back Some times he and his wife went to An na po lis to a ball or feast of some sort where Wash ing ton took part in the dance and all the belles of the day were proud to dance with him for he had a grand style that made him seem like no one else in the room When storms kept him in the house he would read or spend the time at his desk with pen in hand He was kind to his slaves and took the best of care of them when they were sick but was quick to see that they did not shirk their work 
8635_295761_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He knew too just the kind of work each one was fit for and which he could do the best 
none	none	Four of his slaves set out to hew and shape a large log Wash ing ton kept his eye on them and thought they loafed too much So he sat down took out his watch and timed them how long it took them to get their cross cut saw and the rest of their tools how long to cut off the limbs from the tree they had laid low how long to hew and saw it what time they spent in talk and how much work they did while he sat there and took notes 
8635_295761_000012_000003	train-clean-360	In this way he found out just how much work four men could do in the course of a day and take their ease 
none	none	Wash ing ton was quick to lend a hand in time of need and once when word was brought him that the dam had broke loose and the mill would soon be swept off he ran at the head of all his slaves and work men and toiled as hard as they in a fierce rain storm to check the force of the flood 
8635_295761_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The cares of home and state made such calls on his time and thoughts that he could not be said to live quite at his ease and he left his mark a high one on all that he did 
8635_295761_000015_000000	train-clean-360	His crops were of the best and he sought to cheat no one 
none	none	The flour he sold from year to year was put up with so much care and was of such a good kind and so true in weight that all that bore the brand of George Wash ing ton Mount Ver non was held at a high rate in the West In di a ports Quite a trade was kept up with Eu rope where all the goods had to be bought that were used in the house or on the farm Twice a year Wash ing ton sent on a long list of such things as he had need of ploughs hoes scythes horse goods and clothes for all the house hold 
8635_295761_000017_000001	train-clean-360	For these last he had to give size and height name and age of those who were to wear them 
none	none	In one of these lists Wash ing ton who had need of a new suit of clothes said he was six feet in height quite thin and had long limbs 
8635_295761_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He was then thirty one years old 
none	none	You will see by what I have told you just how Wash ing ton spent much of his time for at least five years 
8635_295761_000019_000001	train-clean-360	They were five sweet years to him full of peace and rest and joy 
8635_295761_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He was fond of his home and felt as much pride in Nel lie and John Parke Cus tis as if they had been his own boy and girl 
8635_295761_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Nel lie was a frail child and did not gain in strength though she had the best of care 
none	none	Her death took place June nineteen seventeen seventy three when she was but seventeen years of age This was a sad blow to Wash ing ton as well as to his wife and then all their hopes were placed on the son who bade fair to be a fine strong man 
8635_295761_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But he died in the year seventeen eighty one at the age of twenty eight 
none	none	While Wash ing ton dwelt in peace at Mount Ver non war was rife in the land but as he had with drawn from those who bore arms he took no part in it It was called Pon ti ac s war as it was led by a chief of that name but the O hi o tribes were with him and the plot was deep laid 
8635_295761_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Large tracts of wood land were laid waste homes were burnt and those who dwelt in them robbed and slain and so sly and shrewd were the red skins that it was some time ere the white men could put a stop to their deeds of blood 
none	none	It was in seventeen sixty that King George the Third made up his mind to tax the folks in A mer i ca for all the goods they bought in Eng land 
8635_295761_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The trade was large and in this way the king could add much to his wealth 
8635_295761_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But the scheme did not work well 
none	none	It was first tried in Bos ton and set all the folks there by the ears They claimed that they had rights as well as the king 
8635_295761_000023_000005	train-clean-360	They had come to this land to be free and free they would be 
8635_295761_000023_000006	train-clean-360	They would do with out tea and such things and dress as well as they could in clothes made out of home made goods 
8635_295761_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The king next said that goods bought from Eng land must bear the king s stamp for which a sum was to be paid more than the cost of the goods 
8635_295761_000024_000001	train-clean-360	This was known as the Stamp Act 
none	none	The folks in A mer i ca were poor 
8635_295761_000024_000003	train-clean-360	They had not the means to pay this tax 
none	none	The thought of it filled them with rage and for five years there was much talk of the wrong the king had done to those who dwelt in A mer i ca On the first day of No vem ber seventeen sixty five the Stamp Act was to go in to force and all New Eng land was in arms At Bos ton bells were tolled flags were hung at half mast shops were shut and bon fires built 
8635_295761_000026_000000	train-clean-360	In New York the Act in clear print was borne through the streets on a pole on top of which was a death s head 
none	none	A man named colonel den whose place it was to serve out the stamps had to flee to the fort round which was placed a strong guard from a ship of war The mob broke in to his coach house drew out his coach put in it a form stuffed and dressed to look some what like colonel den and marched up to the Park where they hung it on a tree 
8635_295761_000028_000000	train-clean-360	At night they took the form down put it in a coach and bore it back to Bow ling Green where the whole thing coach and all was burnt right in range of the guns of the fort where the King s troops were 
none	none	In March seventeen sixty six the king drew back the Stamp Act which gave great joy to those who had the good of A mer i ca at heart and to none more than to George Wash ing ton 
8635_295761_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But he made it known that he felt it to be his right as their king to tax them as he chose and this hurt the pride of those who wished to make their own laws and be in bonds to no one 
none	none	Wash ing ton as did most of those who had Eng lish blood in their veins looked up on that land as his home and was loath to break the chain that bound him to it But he did not think well of the Stamp Act and saw what was sure to come to pass if the king pressed too hard on the A mer i cans On Sep tem ber five seventeen seventy four a band of true men from all the States met for the first time in Phil a del phi a and Wash ing ton set out from Mount Ver non on horse back to take his seat with them With him were Pat rick Hen ry and Ed mund Pen dle ton and as they rode side by side they talked of the land they loved and of the hopes they had that all would be well 
8635_295761_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The band met with closed doors 
8635_295761_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Each man wore a grave face 
none	none	Pat rick Hen ry made a strong speech at the close of which he said All A mer i ca is thrown in to one mass Where are your land marks 
8635_295761_000032_000004	train-clean-360	They are all thrown down 
none	none	He said he did not call him self by the name of the State in which he was born but by the name of the land which gave him birth then known as the land of the free Wash ing ton was not a man of words but of deeds 
8635_295761_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But what he said was of great weight as it came from a wise brain and a true heart 
none	none	Pat rick Hen ry said there was no man in the whole band so great as George Wash ing ton The band broke up in No vem ber and Wash ing ton went back to Mount Ver non But not to the gay times and good cheer he once had known 
8635_295761_000035_000003	train-clean-360	George Fair fax who had been his friend from boy hood had gone to Eng land to live and Bel voir took fire one night and was burnt to the ground 
none	none	The stir in Bos ton and in the West where the red skins were on the war path made the whole land ill at ease Troops were kept on drill and the roll of the drum was heard in all the small towns Men came to talk with Wash ing ton and to find out what he thought was the best thing to do and the best way to drill or to arm troops 
8635_295761_000037_000000	train-clean-360	It was of no use to plead with the king 
none	none	He had made up his mind and would not yield an inch A large force of the best men in Vir gin i a met at Rich mond March twenty seventeen seventy five and Wash ing ton was called on for some plan as to what their course should be 
8635_295761_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He told them that he thought there was but one thing to do 
none	none	Pat rick Hen ry put it in to words that rang through the land We must fight I repeat it Sir we must fight An ap peal to arms and the God of hosts is all that is left us All hearts were full of zeal and Wash ing ton wrote to his bro ther Au gus tine that if there was need of it he would lead troops to war and risk his life and all his wealth in the cause which seemed to him a most just one CHAPTER VIII THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL In the year seventeen seventy five war was rife in New Eng land The King s laws were felt to be more for slaves than for free men and all made up their minds to throw off the yoke They could not bear the sight of the red coats and the King s troops were just as fierce in their hate of our men Ships of war brought a large force of troops to New Eng land led by men of rank and fame They filled the streets of Bos ton and it was thought they might bring the A mer i cans to terms and not a drop of blood be shed But this was not to be A large force of our men were in camp on the hills and fields near Bos ton the sight of whom might well cause the well clad Brit ish to smile They had left their farms in great haste at the cry of To arms had seized their guns and come in the home spun clothes it was their pride to wear Those from Mas sa chu setts were led by general er al Ar te mas Ward those from New Hamp shire by colonel o nel John Stark those from Rhode Isl and by general er al Na than i el Greene and those from Con nect i cut by general er al Is ra el Put nam all brave and true men and full of fight But the troops had need to be well armed and all the guns and such things as there was need of in war times were in Bos ton where the red coats were on guard But though sharp eyes were on the watch sly deeds were done by those who knew the ways in and out of each store house Carts went out of town heaped high with dirt in which guns and balls were hid and all sorts of tricks were used to get such things past the red coats At length it came to the ears of general er al Gage that some field guns were at Sa lem and he sent troops there to seize them But when they reached Sa lem they found no guns there Then word came to general er al Gage that there was a large stock of arms and war stores at Con cord which was less than a score of miles from Bos ton In the night of A pril eighteen the red coats set out for Con cord general er al Gage had said that no one but the troops should leave the town but the news was borne to Lex ing ton a town on the road to Con cord by those who were as swift as the hare and as sly as the fox The folks there met in groups with hearts on fire Bells were rung and guns were fired Men who heard these sounds ran as fast as they could to Lex ing ton to hold the bridge and keep back the foe At five o clock on the morn of A pril nineteen the red coats came in sight and at once three score and ten men stood out on the green near the wall to meet them Ma jor Pit cairn who was at the head of the King s troops called out to these brave men to lay down their arms and leave the place But they paid no heed to his words Then he sprang from the ranks shot off a small gun swung his sword in air and told his men to fire The troops ran up with loud cheers and poured a storm of shot on our men some of whom were killed Then they pushed on to Con cord and did all the harm they could at that place spiked guns threw pounds and pounds of shot down the wells and spoiled a large lot of flour and food that had been stored there for use in time of need When the King s troops turned back to Lex ing ton they were quite worn out with what they had done and would have been cut down by our men if Gage had not sent a force to their aid For the blue coats had flown to arms and poured in to Lex ing ton by all the roads that led led there to The red coats might laugh at their clothes and the way in which they tried to keep step but they found out that they knew how to use guns and that each man was a dead shot The fresh troops Gage sent up from Bos ton had to form a square so that the worn out men who had had a long march and hard work might have a chance to rest Then they all set out to march back to Bos ton with two field guns in the rear to keep off the flock of Yan kees who dogged their steps and kept up a fire in front and rear and from each stone wall and hedge that lined the road There was loss on both sides but what hurt the King s troops the most was to be put to flight by such a lot of scare crows as they thought our troops were A close watch was kept on Bos ton by our men who were soon in such force that it would not have been safe for the red coats to try to leave the town The Kings troops did not like to be shut in in this way and lost no chance to mock at and taunt those who kept them at bay On the north side of Bos ton lay a long strip of land from the heights of which one could see the town and all the ships at or near the wharves Put nam thought it would be a good plan to seize these heights and place troops there but Ward and War ner thought it was not safe to risk it It might bring on a fierce fight and cause much blood to be shed Put nam had no fear of his own men He knew how brave they were and how well they could fight back of a screen They have no fear of their heads he said their chief thought is their legs Shield them and they ll fight on till doom s day Two or three of those who had led troops in the French war were of the same mind as Put nam and their words had weight The chief man was colonel o nel Pres cott who was just the style of man in port and in dress that a lot of raw troops would look up to He wore a fine hat a top wig and a blue coat faced and lapped up at the skirts He it was whom general er al Ward chose to lead the troops which were to seize the heights build the earth works there and guard them from the foe There were twelve hundred in all and they set out on the night of June sixteen seventeen seventy five Not a light was shown Not a sound was heard but the tramp tramp tramp of these men on their way to face death A small neck of land joined Charles town to the main land and as they drew near this the troops hushed their steps and moved with great care For on this the red coats kept a close watch Five of their ships of war stood so that their guns would sweep this neck of land and earth works were on Copp s Hill which faced Charles town On the blue coats went past the guards past the guns past the Neck and up to the heights of Bunk er s Hill Here they were to make their stand but it was found that Breed s Hill which was half a mile off was not quite so steep and would give them more of a chance at the red coats while Bunk er s Hill would shield them in the rear Put nam thought Breed s Hill was the right place and was in haste for the work to go on There was no time to lose So pick and spade were brought out and the earth dug out so as to serve as a wall to screen them from the fire of the foe The night was warm and still Now and then Pres cott would steal down to the edge of the stream to see and hear if the red coats had made a stir There was not a sound save the cry of All s well All s well from the watch man on guard in the town and on the ships of war All night the work on the heights went on At dawn of day the men there were seen by the sea men on the ships of war and at once their guns were brought up and turned on the hill Their shot did not harm the works but one man who went out side was killed and this threw the rest in to a great fright They were not used to scenes of war and the sight of a man shot down in their midst was more than their nerves could stand Some took to their heels at once and did not come back and had Pres cott not been a brave man him self he could not have held his troops as he did He stood up on top of the earth works in full view of the red coats and talked with his men and his words of cheer put new strength in their hearts so that they were in less dread of the balls that whizzed near them The noise of the guns roused the red coats in Bos ton and general er al Gage gazed at Breed s Hill like one in a dream A fort full of men had sprung up in the night How had it been done What kind of men were these he had to meet As he stood on Copp s Hill and looked through his field glass he spied the tall form of Pres cott in his blue coat on the wall of the fort Will he fight asked Gage Yes sir said one who stood near and who knew Pres cott He will fight to the last drop of blood but I can t say as much for his men We must seize the works cried Gage and at once called up his chiefs for a talk and to plan the best way to do this deed The noise in the streets of Bos ton the roll of the drum the sound of the trump that calls to war the sharp click of hoofs and the deep roll of wheels that bore the field guns were heard on the heights and let the troops there know that war was at hand The men were worn out with their hard task and their loss of sleep They had not brought much food with them and their thirst was great The heat made them feel weak and dull There was need of more men and a lot of raw New Hamp shire troops led by colonel o nel Stark came to their aid In the mean time those on the height had to bear the fire of the guns from the ships and from Copp s Hill which broke on them at ten o clock At noon the blue coats saw more than a score of boats full of troops cross from Bos ton in straight lines The sun shone on their red coats and flashed from the tips of the guns they bore and from the brass field guns that stood on the deck It was a gay scene They made their way to a point north of Breed s Hill where general er al Howe who led them could see the full strength of the blue coats They had more troops than he thought and he caught sight of fresh ones on their way to Breed s Hill Howe at once sent to Gage for more troops and more balls for the field guns and as it would take some time for them to be sent round the red coats in the mean time were served with food and drink The grog was passed round in pails and the men sat round on the grass and ate and drank their fill while the poor men on the heights looked down and longed to share their feast But while the red coats took their ease the blue coats had a chance to add to the strength of their fort and to push out the breast works to a point known as the Slough Near this was a pass where the foe might turn the left flank of the troops or seize Bunk er s Hill Put nam chose one of his men a Cap tain Knowl ton to hold this pass with his Con nect i cut troops He at once set to work to build a sort of fort back of which his men could fight with more ease than if they stood out in the field Not a long way off was a post and rail fence set in a low foot wall of stone and this fence ran down to the Mys tic Riv er The posts and rails of a fence near this were torn up in haste and set a few feet at the rear of it and the space twixt the two was filled with new mown hay brought from the fields near at hand While Knowl ton and his men were at work on this fence Put nam and his troops threw up the work on Bunk er s Hill In the mean time Stark had set out from Med ford on a six mile march He was a cool calm man and had been through the French war of which I have told you He led his men at a slow pace so that they would be fresh and strong to take part in the fight As they came up to the Neck which they had to cross and which was lined with guns on both sides one of the aides urged him to let the men take a quick step The old man shook his head and said One fresh man in a fight is worth ten tired ones and kept on at the same pace and did good work that day back of the post and rail screen War ren who had been made a Ma jor general er al came to serve in the ranks Put nam said he might lead the troops at the fence He said he did not care to lead he was there to fight Where will the fire be the hot test he asked He was told that the fort on Breed s Hill was the point the foe sought to gain If we can hold that said Put nam the day is ours War ren at once made his way there and the troops gave a round of cheers when he stepped in to the fort Pres cott who was not so high in rank sought to have War ren take charge of the troops But he would not I have come to serve in the ranks he said and shall be glad to learn from one so well skilled as your self The red coats thought to take the works with ease and win the day general er al Pig ot with the left wing was to mount the hill and seize the earth works while general er al Howe came up with the right wing to turn the left flank of our men and stop all flight at the rear Pig ot and his men came up the height and not a gun was fired by our troops till the red coats were in range Then as they were all good marks men each shot told and some of the best men fell at the first fire The foe fell back in haste but were brought up once more by those who stood at their head with drawn swords They were met by a fire more fierce than the first and vexed by the guns that bore on their flank from the band of men in Charles town So much blood had been shed and the men were in such a state of fright that Pig ot was forced to give the word to fall back We will now see what sort of luck general er al Howe had He led his troops up the bank of the stream and thought to take the slight breast work with ease and so get in the rear of the fort But he did not know the ground and could not bring his large guns through the swamp he met with In the pause some of his men were hurt and some killed by the guns that were set by the post and rail fence Howe s men kept up a fire as they came on but as they did not take good aim the balls flew o er the heads of our troops who had been told to hold their fire till the red coats were quite near Some few did not do as they were told and Put nam rode up and swore he would cut down the next man that fired ere he had the word to do so When the red coats were in the right range such a storm of lead poured on them from guns in the hands of men who did not miss a mark that the place was like a field of blood Such a host were slain that the red coats lost heart and fell back in great haste Some of them ran back as far as the boats and got on board of them that they might be safe from the fire of the marks men Once more the red coats charged the fort which it was their aim to get in to their own hands In the mean time the shells from Copp s Hill and the ships of war had set Charles town on fire The town was built of wood and was soon a mass of flames The dense smoke put out the light of the sun On all sides was heard the din of war The big guns kept up their great roar Bomb shells burst in the air The sharp hiss of the small balls and the shouts and yells of the men made a scene to strike the heart with awe Our men stood firm and with eyes fixed on the foe who as soon as they were close at hand were shot down by the guns whose aim was so sure The red coats stood the first shock and then kept on but were met by such a stream of fire that they were soon brought to a halt In vain did the men who led them urge them on with drawn swords Whole ranks were mowed down Some of general er al Howe s staff were slain and the troops wild with fear broke ranks and fled down the hill For a third time general er al Howe brought up his men some of whom threw off their knap sacks and some their coats that they might not be weighed down by them The red coats made a feint as if they would take the fort at the fence and did much harm there to our men While some of his troops were at work at that point Howe brought the rest of his force to the front and rear of the main fort which was then stormed on three sides at once Pres cott told some of his men to stand at the back part of the fort and fire at the red coats that showed them selves on the wall Soon one leaped up and cried out The day is ours and was shot down at once as were all those who had joined him Illustration WASHINGTON CHOSEN FOR COMMANDER IN CHIEF P sixty two But our men had fired their last round and there was nought for them to do but to meet the foe in a hand to hand fight With stones and the butt ends of their guns they sought to drive back the red coats but the tide was too strong for them and they had to give way War ren who had done brave work that day was the last to leave the fort He scarce had done so ere he was struck by a ball and fell dead on the spot As our troops fled by way of Bunk er Hill Put nam ran to the rear and cried Halt make a stand here We can check them yet In God s name form and give them one shot more But the troops could not be brought to a stand and the red coats won the day but with the loss of more than half of their men And it hurt their pride to think that it had cost them so dear to take these earth works that had been thrown up in one night by a mere hand ful of raw troops Their loss was ten fifty four Our loss was four hundred fifty CHAPTER IX COMMANDER IN CHIEF The deeds done ere this by the King s troops had made a great stir through out the land The chief men of each State met in Phil a del phi a and sought out ways and means to help those who were in arms as foes of King George and a large force of men from Ma ry land Penn syl va ni a and Vir gin i a were soon on hand to march and join the troops near Bos ton But who was to lead them The choice at once fell on George Wash ing ton but he held back He thought that Mas sa chu setts troops might not care to be led by a man from the south and too general er al Ward who was then at their head had the first right for Wash ing ton s rank was not so high as his There was much talk on this score and in the midst of it a Mas sa chu setts man John Ad ams rose and said that the man he thought fit to lead our troops was in that room and he came from Vir gin i a All knew whom he meant and as Wash ing ton heard his own name he rose from his seat and left the room Then votes were cast and all were for Wash ing ton and he felt that he could not say No to such a call He spoke his thanks in a few words and said that he would do the best that he could and serve with out pay He set out from Phil a del phi a June twenty one seventeen seventy five With him were general er al Lee and general er al Schuy ler and a troop of light horse which went all the way to New York As soon as it was known that Wash ing ton was on the road crowds ran out to meet him and to show their pride in him When he reached New York he heard of the fight at Bunk er Hill and made haste to join the troops in their camp at Cam bridge He reached there Ju ly two The next day all the troops were drawn out in line and Wash ing ton rode out at the head of his staff till he came to a large elm tree Here he wheeled his horse and drew his sword and took charge of all our troops as their Com mand er in chief He found much to do and much to bear from his own men as well as from the red coats It came to his ears that our men who fell in to the hands of the red coats at Bunk er s Hill were not well used and he wrote at once to Gage and asked him to be less harsh Gage who had fought by his side in seventeen fifty three when both were young men wrote back that he thought he should have praise and not blame since he had saved the lives of those who were doomed to be hung Wash ing ton at first thought he would do as he was done by but his heart failed him and those of the red coats that were in the hands of our troops were set free if they gave their word they would not fight for King George By such acts Wash ing ton sought to show that A mer i cans are as mer ci ful as they are brave The camps in which Wash ing ton found his troops were as odd as the men them selves Some of the tents were made of boards some of sail cloth or bits of both while here and there were those made of stone and turf brick and brush wood Some were thrown up in haste and bore no marks of care while a few were wrought with wreaths and twigs and spoke well for the taste of those who made them The best camp of all was that of the Rhode Is land men in charge of general er al Na than i el Greene Here were found as good tents as the red coats had and the men were well drilled and well dressed Greene was brought up on a farm His fa ther was a black smith and at times his son worked with the plough or took his place at the forge At the first note of war Greene left the farm and in the month of May seventeen seventy five was in charge of all the troops of his own small state He went to Bos ton and took notes while there of all that the red coats did and in this way learned much that he could put to good use His troops had fought at Bunk er Hill and there were none in the whole force that bore them selves so well or made so fine a show Greene was six feet tall and not quite two score years of age He was strong and well built and his frank way won the heart of Wash ing ton and the two were warm friends from that time Wash ing ton now set to work to add strength to the weak parts of his line and to throw up fresh works round the main forts All the live stock had to be kept off the coast so that they would not fall in to the hands of the foe He sought to draw the red coats out of Bos ton but they would not stir When Wash ing ton took charge of the troops he thought that he could go back to his home when the cold days came on and spend some time there with his wife But there was no chance for him to leave so he wrote to missus Wash ing ton to join him in the camp She came and staid with him till the next spring and this was her course all through the war She came in her own coach and four with her son and his wife The black foot men were drest in red and white and the whole turn out was in the style in use in Vir gin i a at that day Wash ing ton had his rooms in the Crai gie House in Cam bridge and here missus Wash ing ton took charge and gave the place more of a home like air At that time the camp of Cam bridge was filled with all sorts of troops Some had spent the most of their lives in boats some were brought up on farms some came from the woods and each group wore the dress that pleased them best and laughed at those who were not drest the same This made sport for some time and jokes flew thick and fast One day some men came in to camp drest in an odd garb such as was worn to hunt in The suit was made of deer skin and the long shirt had a deep fringe all round This dress was the cause of much mirth to men who came from the sea shore and were used to short coats and rough plain clothes There was snow on the ground and when the jokes gave out snow balls took their place for a war of words is quite sure to end in blows Men came up to the aid of both sides Fists were used and all took part in the hand to hand fight and there was a great stir in the camp While the fight was at its height Wash ing ton rode up None of his aides were with him He threw the reins of his own horse in to the hands of the black man who rode near sprang from his seat and rushed in to the thick of the fray Then he seized two of the tall stout hunts men by the throat and talked to them and shook them while he held them at arm s length This put an end to the brawl at once and the rest of the crowd slunk off in haste and left but three men on the ground Wash ing ton and the two he held in his grasp As the cold days and nights came on the men grew home sick and longed to be by their own fire sides It was right that some of them should go for they had served out their time and this made the rest lone some and sad Songs would not cheer them and they paid no heed to the words of those who sought to rouse them from these depths of woe Wash ing ton was full of fears which were shared by all those who were near him in rank yet he did not lose hope general er al Greene wrote They seem to be so sick of this way of life and so home sick that I fear a large part of our best troops will soon go home Still his heart did not lose hope All would come right in time and his words of cheer were a great help to Wash ing ton at this time The year seventeen seventy five had been a dark one for our land and there was no ray of hope to light the dawn of seventeen seventy six There were but ten thousand troops to take the field There was a lack of arms a lack of clothes and a lack of food and these things made camp life hard to bear and were a great grief to the heart of the chief He could not sleep Had the foe known of their plight they would have borne down on them and swept them out of sight But God took care of them In the first month of the year there was a stir on the Bos ton wharves A large fleet of boats lay in the stream on board of which the red coats swarmed and there were two sloops of war filled with guns and war like stores All were in charge of general er al Howe and Wash ing ton guessed what his plans were and felt that the time had come for him to strive to wrest Bos ton from the King s troops The out look was bright More troops had come to his aid and he made up his mind to place part of his force on Dor ches ter Heights and if he could draw out the foe to fight at that place At a sign the troops on the Heights and at Nook s Hill were to fire at the same time and rake the town with balls and bomb shells At the same time boats full of troops were to start from the mouth of Charles Riv er and act in the rear of the red coats It was thought that these moves on the part of our troops would bring on such a fight as they had had on Breed s Hill On the night of March four our men made their way to the Heights and at dawn of the next day strong forts loomed up and seemed as if they must have been brought there at the touch of a wand Howe gazed on them and said The reb els have done more work in one night than my whole ar my would have done in a month He must drive them from the Heights or leave Bos ton While pride urged him on fear held him back for he knew that his loss would be great But he must make a move of some sort so he made up his mind to send boats out that night with a force of troops in charge of Lord Per cy But a storm came up from the east the surf beat high on the shore where the boats would have to land and the scheme was put off till the next day But it stormed just as hard the next day the rain came down in sheets and the boats staid where they were In the mean time our men kept at work on the hills on the north side and south side and when the storm ceased general er al Howe saw that the forts were now so strong there would be no chance to take them Nor was it safe for him to stay in Bos ton Yet the Ad mi ral said that if Howe s troops did not seize the Heights the ships of war should not stay near Bos ton so his lord ship would have to leave with what grace he could much as it might wound his pride When the word went forth that the troops were to leave strange sights were seen in Bos ton town and bay For some days the red coats went this way and that in great haste More than three score and ten boats were cast loose for sea with at least twelve thousand men on board of them While this stir took place not a shot was sent from the Heights and it was well that this was so as the red coats had laid plans to set the town in a blaze if our troops fired one gun The red coats left Bos ton March seventeen and our troops in charge of Old Put as the brave Put nam was called marched in to town in fine style For some days the fleet lay off the coast of Rhode Isl and and it was feared for a while that they meant to strike a blow and win back what they had lost But no such thing took place and ere long the fleet sailed out of sight Where they are bound wrote Wash ing ton and where they next will pitch their tents I know not He thought they were on their way to New York but such was not the case They had steered for Hal i fax to wait there for more troops and for the large fleet that was to come from Eng land A vote of thanks and a large gold coin with his face on one side of it were sent to Wash ing ton by the chief men of the land as part of his due for what he had so far done to save A mer i ca from King George s rule Wash ing ton who thought the next move of the red coats would be on New York set out for that place and reached there A pril thirteen He went to work at once to build forts and to send out troops and to make the place as strong as it ought to be He did not know the plans of the foe nor from what point they would hurl the bolts of war All was guess work but still in the midst of doubt it would not do to be slack The town was put in charge of the troops and the rules were quite strict Those who went in or out had to give the pass word We all live here shut up like nuns wrote one who was fond of a gay life There s no one in town that we can go to see and none to come and see us Good times in New York were at an end Our troops had been forced to leave Can a da and it was known that the red coats would push their way to New York Forts were built on high banks up the Hud son and on the isles at its mouth and all done that could be done to check them in their march In the mean time it had been thought a good plan to set a day in which it might be shown through out the land that A mer i ca was and of a right ought to be a free land So in Ju ly an Act was drawn up and signed by the wise men who met in Phil a del phi a to frame the laws for the new States and there was great joy for it was a great day Bells were rung Shouts and cheers rent the air Fires blazed and hearts burned and men knelt to pray and give thanks to God John Ad ams said the Fourth of Ju ly ought to be kept up with great pomp through out A mer i ca with shows games sports guns bells and bon fires till the end of time The news did not reach New York till Ju ly nine and at six o clock that night Wash ing ton read the Act to his troops New York was wild with joy and felt that more must be done than just to ring bells and light fires In Bow ling Green in front of the fort there stood a cast of George Third made of lead This a mob of men pulled down and broke up that the lead might be run in to small shot and be used in the cause for which they fought This did not please Wash ing ton and he told his troops that they must not take part in such deeds The joy did not last long for on Ju ly twelve the ships of war in the bay sent out a broad side and it was thought they would at once fire the town Crowds were on the streets The troops flocked to their posts Fear was in each heart and New York was in a great stir But two ships the Phoe nix and the Rose left the fleet and shaped their course up the Hud son Then the guns were still and fear died out for a while That night there was a fresh scare Guns boomed and clouds of smoke were seen near the ships of war down the bay Men on the look out told that a ship of the line had come in from sea and each man of war gave her a round of guns as she passed by At her fore top mast head she bore the flag of saint George No need to tell more Lord Howe is come Lord Howe is come was the cry that went from mouth to mouth and the word soon flew through the town and all felt that the hour of doom was close at hand Lord Howe sought peace and not blood shed and hoped by the terms he would make to bring not a few hearts back to their King But he came too late The Kings troops did not think much of the rank that was borne by our men who they felt had no right to put on the airs they did and call them selves grand names In a few days Lord Howe sent one of his men on shore with a flag of truce to seek speech with Wash ing ton The man s name was Brown His boat was met half way by a barge which had on board one of our troops named Reed to whom Brown said he had a note for Mis ter Wash ing ton Reed said that he knew no man of that name Brown held out to him the note he had in his hand which bore on its face George Wash ing ton esquire Reed said that he could not take the note He knew what was due to his chief So there was naught for Brown to do but to take to his oars He had not gone far when he came back to ask What style should be used to please general here he caught him self and said Mis ter Wash ing ton Reed told him that Wash ing ton s rank was well known and Lord Howe could be at no loss as to the right style In a day or two an aide de camp came with a flag from Lord Howe and asked if colonel o nel Pat ter son might have speech with Gen er al Wash ing ton Reed who met the aide was prompt to grant this and pledged him self that no harm should come to him who came in the King s name So the next day Pat ter son came and when he stood face to face with Wash ing ton bowed and said Your Ex cel len cy Wash ing ton met him with much form and state He was not a vain man but was proud of the rank he held and thought that no man were he a king had a right to look down on A mer i ca or show the least slight to her Com mand er in chief When he came to hear the terms on which Lord Howe sought to make peace he found they were not such as he could take so the war went on CHAPTER X IN AND NEAR NEW YORK The red coats had a camp on Stat en Isl and and for the next month or so ships of war came that far up the bay and brought with them a large force of troops North east of them was the long stretch of land known as Long Isl and where they could land their troops with ease and make their way to New York Wash ing ton knew that he could not keep them back but he meant to vex them all he could general er al Greene was placed with a large force on Brook lyn Heights to guard the shore and troops were sent a mile back to throw up earth works to check the march of the foe if they should try to come up on the land side At mid night of Au gust twenty one a spy brought word that the King s troops were on the move and would soon show their strength and put all to the sword The next day the sound of great guns was heard and a cloud of smoke was seen to rise from the groves on the south side of Long Isl and Word soon came to New York that the King s troops were at Graves end and that our troops had fled and set fire to the stacks of wheat to keep them out of the hands of the foe Wash ing ton at once sent off a large force to check the foe at Brook lyn and to lend aid to those in the fort on the Heights He told them to be cool but firm not to fire when the foe were a long way off but to wait till they were so near that each shot would tell And if one of them should skulk or lie down or leave his place in the ranks he was to be shot down at once Sir Hen ry Clin ton led the King s troops and Lord Corn wal lis had charge of the field guns Corn wal lis made haste to seize a pass that ran through the hills but found colonel o nel Hand there with a fine lot of marks men and so made a halt at Flat bush This was so near New York that great fright spread through the town Those who had the means left the place There was good cause for fear as it had been told that if our troops had to leave New York it would at once be set on fire This was false but they did not know it Their hearts were full of dread general er al Put nam was sent to take the place of general er al Greene who was sick in bed The brave man was glad when he had leave to go for he did not want to be kept in New York when there was a chance to fight for the land he loved It was nine o clock on the night of Oc to ber twenty six that Sir Hen ry Clin ton set out with his van guard on his march from Flat bush Lord Corn wal lis brought up the rear guard with all the large guns and the large force of troops led by general er al Howe Not a drum was heard nor the sound of a trump as they took their course through by roads and on cause ways till they came near the pass through the Bed ford Hills where they made a halt No guard had been put on the road or the pass by general er al Greene who must have thought it too far out of the way to need such care Clin ton was quick to see this and at the first break of day his troops were on the Heights and with in three miles of Bed ford In the mean time scouts had brought word to our lines that the foe were in force on the right and Put nam at once sent out troops to hold them in check At day light small fights took place here and there A brisk fire was kept up at Flat bush Now was heard the big boom of a large field piece Then a ship of war would send forth a broad side on the fort at Red Hook Wash ing ton was still in doubt if this was part of the main fight in which New York was to share Five ships of the line tried to beat up the bay but were kept back by a strong head wind As the day wore on and there were no signs that the red coats meant to strike New York Wash ing ton went to Brook lyn in his barge and rode with all speed to the Heights He was just in time to see the fight in the woods which he could do naught to stay He stood on a hill and through his large spy glass had a view of the whole field He saw his men cut their way through a host of foes He saw them caught in traps and hemmed in so that they were twixt two fires The whole pass was a scene of blood and through it rang the clash of arms the tramp of steeds the storm of shot and the cries of men who fought for their lives On this side and that our troops were swept down or put to rout by a force they had not strength to meet Wash ing ton wrung his hands at the sight Good God he cried what brave men I must this day lose The red coats went in to camp that night in front of our lines but out of reach of the guns of the fort Our loss was three thousand Theirs less than four hundred The next day New York Bay and the small isles were wrapped in a dense fog from which New York was quite free Here was a chance for the troops to leave the works on the Heights and make their way to New York Fresh troops were sent down from Fort Wash ing ton and King s Bridge and Wash ing ton felt that no time should be lost His fear was that the King s ships would come up the bay at the turn of the tide sail up the East Riv er and catch in a trap all our troops that were on Long Isl and It was late at night when the troops stole out from the breast works In the dead of night a big gun went off with a great roar that gave a shock to the nerves of those who were in dread that the least sound might warn the foe of their flight to the New York side But no harm came of it the fog shut out the view and by day break our troops had all left the fort and were safe on the New York side Wash ing ton who had not slept for two days and nights and had spent the most of the time on horse back would not step in to the boat till he saw that all his troops were on board The fog rose as the rear boats were in mid stream and when the red coats climbed the crest of the earth works they found not a sign of life there and not a thing they could use Our men had made a clean sweep and were proud of the way in which they stole a march on the red coats Still New York was not safe and Wash ing ton sought in all ways to find out the plans of the foe Ships of war went up the Sound and up the Hud son and guns were fired on the forts that lay on each side of the town But he knew that if the red coats took New York they would soon be made to give it up and so he made up his mind that his best course was to with draw his troops to Har lem Heights This was done with the loss of a few men who had a fight with some red coats on the way and there he staid a few days and spent much time on horse back He took note of the land and chose sites for forts and breast works and on Oc to ber twenty three took his stand at White Plains where a strong fort was built Soon the din of war was heard The guns from Fort Wash ing ton and Fort Lee poured their fire on the men of war but could not keep them back and the red coats still gave chase to our troops Fort Wash ing ton fell in to the hands of the foe in spite of a strong fight made to hold it One day Wash ing ton went out with some of his staff to look at a height at the north where it was thought he might make a stand and leave the camp where he then was One of them said There is the ground where we ought to be Let us go then and view it said Wash ing ton They were on their way to the place when a horse man rode up in haste and cried out The red coats are in camp Sir Then said Wash ing ton we have some thing else to do than this and at once put spurs to his horse and set off for the camp at full speed When he reached there he found all his troops drawn up to meet the foe that was close at hand In his calm way he turned to those who had been out with him on the hills and said Go back to your posts and do the best you can A short sharp fight took place in which our troops made a brave stand but the red coats were too strong for them and drove them back to the camp and seized the hill on which they had stood That night the troops of Wash ing ton and Howe lay not far a part Wash ing ton kept his men at work and forts were built and earth works thrown up These works were made of the stalks of corn or maize which the men took from a field near at hand The roots of the stalks with the earth on them were placed on the face of the works in the same way that sods of grass and logs of wood were used The tops were turned in and loose earth thrown on them so that they were held in place and made a good shield from the fire of small arms The next day when Howe saw how much had been done by our troops to add to their strength he made a change in his plans His own men were in a sad plight and not fit to cope with the well fed troops that kept them at bay The nights were cold the Fall rains set in and not a few of the red coats were ill Their chiefs knew how to fight in straight lines but were not so shrewd and so quick to make use of what lay at hand as our chiefs were So he broke up his camp and in a few days the whole force of red coats fell back from White Plains But the strife was kept up at the North and the foes were at work on sea and on land from New York to Al ba ny Our troops met with ill luck and Wash ing ton was filled with grief Fort Wash ing ton was in the hands of the foe Fort Lee was of no use and the next move of the red coats was to cross the Hud son north of Fort Lee and make their way through New Jer sey By that means they could shut in all our troops twixt the Hud son and the Hack en sack Wash ing ton at once sent off his men to save the bridge at Hack en sack No time was to be lost They left the camp with all haste but ere they could reach the Hack en sack the van guard of the foe was close at their heels It was thought that a fight would take place but Corn wal lis turned back and some of his troops slept that night in the tents that our men had left These were dark days Wash ing ton led his troops through New Jer sey hard pressed by Corn wal lis whose van guard came in to New ark just as Wash ing ton s rear guard had left it His whole camp were in flight He staid a few days at New Bruns wick in hopes that fresh troops would be sent to his aid but none came though his needs were so great The men who as he thought would seize their guns and join his ranks fled from their homes and sought a safe place as soon as they heard that the red coats were near Illustration CROSSING THE DELAWARE P seventy eight On De cem ber two Wash ing ton was at Tren ton where he made but a brief halt Then he crossed the Del a ware and left New Jer sey in the hands of the foe If he and his men once got to Phil a del phi a they would find troops there with whose aid they might hope to turn back the red coats so close on their track general er al Lee who was at the heels of the foe was at Mor ris town De cem ber eleven where his troops had been forced to halt for two days for want of shoes He was a man who loved his ease and to lie late in bed One day as he sat at a desk with pen in hand one of his aides named Wil kin son who was with him looked down the lane that led from the house to the main road and saw a band of red coats on horse back He cried out to Lee Here are the red coats Where said Lee Round the house Where is the guard said Lee with an oath Where is the guard Why don t they fire The guards had not thought it worth while to keep watch when their chief was so much at his ease so they had stacked their arms and sat down on the south side of a house to sun them selves As the horse men came up they gave chase to the guards who fled for their lives and left Lee and his aide to do the best that they could The red coats drew near the house where Lee was and swore that they would set fire to it if the general er al showed fight So he was forced to yield and was brought out in great haste for they wished to make sure of their prize and placed on Wil kin son s horse which stood at the door He was but half drest had no hat on his head and wore low shoes and a loose rough coat In this style he had to ride to New Bruns wick where the King s troops at sight of him set off their big guns for their joy was great The loss of Lee was thought at the time to be a great blow to our cause as it was hoped that he would do much to bring the war to an end and to lead the troops out of their sore straits In the mean time Wash ing ton was on his way to cross the Del a ware There was snow on the ground and the march of the troops could be traced by the blood spots from the feet of those whose shoes were worn out The red coats were in force at Tren ton in charge of a man named Rahl who had done brave work for King George at White Plains and Fort Wash ing ton Wash ing ton s plan was to add to his force and as soon as he could cross the Del a ware and strive to wrest Tren ton from the hands of the foe He and his force were to cross the stream nine miles north of the town general er al Ew ing was to cross with his troops a mile south of the town and general er al Put nam to leave at a point south of Bur ling ton It was a bold scheme full of risk to all who took part in it yet there was naught to be done but to push on and hope for the best CHAPTER XI A SAD YEAR Christ mas night was the time set to cross the Del a ware and at sun set the troops were on the move It was a dark cold night The wind was high the tide strong and the stream full of cakes of ice which drove the boats out of their course It seemed at times as if the boats would be crushed to bits Men who were used to boats and had been brought up on the sea and had fought with fierce storms and wild gales found it hard work with all their skill to make their way from shore to shore Wash ing ton who crossed with the troops stood on the east bank till all the field guns were brought to land and it was four o clock ere the men took up their line of march Tren ton was nine miles off and they could not reach there till day light too late to take the King s troops off their guard Most of the troops at Tren ton were Hes sians from Hesse a small Ger man state whose prince had lent his troops to King George for hire As I have told you they were in charge of Rahl Rahl thought more of his brass band than he did of his men was full of good cheer and liked to have a good time He would sit up till a late hour in the night and then lie in bed till nine o clock the next day The one who leads troops to war should be like a watch dog quick to see and to hear all that goes on and to be on guard at all times Each day he had the guns drawn out and dragged through the town just to make a stir and have the band out But when the Ma jor told him that he should have earth works thrown up on which to place the guns he said Pooh pooh Let the foe come on We ll charge on them with the bay o net But Herr colonel o nel said the old Ma jor it costs not much and if it does not help it will not harm But Rahl laughed as if he thought it a good joke turned on his heel and went off and the works were not thrown up On this night too there was a great stir in the camp at Tren ton for the men did their best to keep Christ mas and their thoughts were of home and the dear ones there They made what cheer they could and did not dream that the foe was so near A storm of hail and snow set in as soon as our troops took up their march They could scarce see their way through the sleet they had to face The night was so cold that two of the men froze to death At dawn of day some of the men came to a halt at a cross road where they did their best to dry their guns But some were past use and word was sent to Wash ing ton of the state of their arms They were in doubt what to do Wash ing ton in a burst of rage bade the man go back to his chief at once and tell him to push on and charge if he could not fire At eight o clock Wash ing ton drew near the town at the head of his troops He went up to a man who had come out to chop wood by the road side and asked him where the guard was who stood at the out post of Rahl s camp The man said in a harsh voice I don t know You may tell him said one of our men who stood near for that is general er al Wash ing ton At once a great change came o er the man to whom Wash ing ton spoke He raised his hands and cried God bless you God bless you and then showed where the guards could be found Soon was heard the cry from Rahl s men The foe the foe turn out turn out Drums beat to arms The whole place was in a stir Wash ing ton came in on the north Sul li van on the west and Stark at the south end of the town Rahl scarce knew how to act He rode to the front of his troops and got them out of the town Then he seemed to feel that it was a shame to fly in that way for he was a brave man so he led his men back in a wild dash out of the woods and in to the town to meet the foe In the midst of the fight a shot struck him and he fell from his horse The troops would heed no voice but that of their chief and fled up the banks of a creek on the way to Prince ton Wash ing ton saw the stir and thought they had wheeled to form a new line He was told that they had laid down their arms and his joy was great The day was ours But for the wild flight of Rahl s men it would have gone hard with our troops Wash ing ton did not know it at the time but he found out that Ew ing and Put nam had tried to cross the stream but were kept back by the ice and he with his raw troops would he was sure have been put to rout had Rahl and his men been on their guard The poor Ma jor who had in vain urged Rahl to throw up breast works had a bad wound of which he died in Tren ton and Rahl him self to whom the red coats owed their ill luck was laid to rest in a grave yard in that town And where was general er al Howe all this time In New York where he thought to take his ease till the Del a ware froze so that his troops could cross He was much shocked at the news that the Hes sians who had been brought up to war should have laid down their arms for a troop of raw men in rags He sent Lord Corn wal lis back to take Jer sey and as he said to bag the fox By the third of Jan u a ry red coats with Corn wal lis at their head were near at hand Wash ing ton was in a tight place with a small creek twixt his few raw troops and the large force of the foe Back of him lay the Del a ware which it was now not safe to cross In this dark hour a gleam of hope came to his mind He saw a way out of the trap and that was by a quick night march to get at the rear of the King s troops dash on the camp at Prince ton seize the stores that were left there and push on to New Bruns wick A thaw had set in which made the roads deep with mire but in the course of the night the wind veered to the north and in two hours the roads were once more hard and frost bound That the foe might not guess his plan Wash ing ton bade some of his men keep at work with their spades on the pits near the bridge go the rounds change guards at each bridge and ford and keep up the camp fires till day break when they were to join those on the way to Prince ton In the dead of the night Wash ing ton drew his troops out of camp and the march took place The road which they had to take was cut through woods and the stumps of the trees made the march a slow one so that it was near sun rise when Wash ing ton came to the bridge at the brook three miles from Prince ton As our troops left the woods they came face to face with a force of red coats and a sharp fight took place which did not last long Wash ing ton was in the midst of it In the heat of the fight his aide de camp lost sight of him in the dusk and smoke The young man dropped the reins on the neck of his horse drew down his cap to hide the tears in his eyes and gave him up for lost When he saw Wash ing ton come out from the cloud with his hat raised and the foe in flight he spurred up to his side Thank God you are safe cried he A way and bring up the troops said Wash ing ton the day is our own At day break when general er al Howe thought to bag his fox he found the prize had slipped from his grasp and soon learned that the King s troops had lost their hold on New Jer sey The fame of Wash ing ton and of the brave deeds of those who fought to be free went a cross the sea and made friends for him and the cause Not a few came to their aid One of these brave souls was a Pole whose name was Kos ci us ko The com mand er in chief said to him What do you seek here To fight for the cause you have at heart What can you do Try me This style of speech and the air of the man pleased Wash ing ton so well that he at once made him an aide de camp This was in seventeen seventy seven He served the cause well and went back to his own land in seventeen eighty six with the rank of Brig a dier general er al In seventeen seventy seven La fay ette came from France to join the troops led by Wash ing ton He had wealth and high rank in his own land and had lived but a score of years He left his young wife and the gay court of France and made his way to A mer i ca to do what he could to aid the foes of King George He came he said to learn and not to teach and would serve with out pay and as one who came of his own free will He soon won his way to the heart of Wash ing ton and a strong bond of love grew up twixt the two which naught but death could break In the mean time the whole of our land south of the Great Lakes was a scene of strife and blood shed and it was hard work for our troops to keep the red skins and red coats at bay I have not space to tell you of all the fights that took place nor the ways in which Wash ing ton sought to vex the King s troops On the third of Oc to ber of this year seventeen seventy seven we find him at Ger man town where the main force of the red coats were in camp His plan was to drive them out but though his troops fought with much skill and in the midst of a dense fog they were forced back and the day was lost The ships of war in the Del a ware led Wash ing ton to think that Lord Howe meant to turn his guns on Phil a del phi a and his mind was filled with doubts and fears In the same month word came to him that Bur goyne who was at the head of the King s troops in the north had been forced to yield to general er al Gates at Fish kill This was such a blow to the King s cause that the troops at West Point and else where on the Hud son who were to have gone to the aid of Bur goyne left the forts and made their way to New York CHAPTER XII FOES IN THE CAMP It is much worse to have one foe in the camp than to have a host of foes out side for who can tell what harm he may do who comes in the guise of a friend In the year seventeen seventy four a young man named John An dre came with the King s troops and fought in their ranks at saint John s and Crown Point He had a brave heart and a fine mind and did much to keep up the hearts of the men when in the camp He was fond of the fair sex and had praised in rhyme the charms of a Miss Ship pen who wed Ben e dict Ar nold in the year seventeen eighty Ar nold had fought well on our side at the north and won much praise He had been a sea man in his youth and was both strong and brave But he grew proud and vain and sought to rank as high as the Com mand er in chief with whom he found much fault Wash ing ton had great faith in him and did not dream he was false at heart For some ill deeds while at Phil a del phi a Ar nold had been brought to court and tried and his guilt proved and this had made him wroth with Wash ing ton and the cause he had sworn to aid He sought for a way to pay back the slight and raise him self to fame With this end in view he wrote to Sir Hen ry Clin ton but did not use his own name that he would like to join the cause of King George on the terms that he set forth He was in need of funds for he was deep in debt but Clin ton did not see fit to make use of him Two or three more of his schemes failed and at last he asked that he might have charge of the post at West Point This Wash ing ton gave him and in Au gust Ar nold fixed him self in a fine house that stood on the east side of the stream half a mile or so south of West Point From this place he sent notes to An dre the aide de camp of Clin ton who wrote back and signed his name John An der son Ar nold s plan was to throw West Point and the High lands in to the hands of Sir Hen ry Clin ton at the time that Wash ing ton was at King s Bridge and the Eng lish troops in New York A fleet with a large land force on board was to come up to the High lands and Ar nold would at once yield up the post in to their hands This act he thought would bring the war to an end with the flag of King George at high mast and then great would be the name and fame of Ben e dict Ar nold That the scheme might not fail Ar nold wrote to An dre to meet him at Dobb s Fer ry Sep tem ber eleven at noon But Ar nold had spent the night of the tenth at Hav er straw on the west shore and on his way back in his barge as he had no flag he was fired on by the guard boats of the King s troops So he had to put off his plans for a day or two In the mean time the sloop of war Vul ture a good name for such a bird of prey was brought up the Hud son so as to be near at hand to aid in the vile scheme On Sep tem ber eighteen Wash ing ton with his suite crossed the Hud son at Ver planck s Point in Ar nold s barge on his way to Hart ford Ar nold went with him as far as Peeks kill and talked with him in a frank way and as if he were most true to the cause An dre went up the Hud son on the twentieth and went on board the Vul ture where he thought to meet Ar nold But Ar nold knew it would not be safe for him to be there so he kept in the back ground The next night a boat crept up to the side of the Vul ture in which were two men Their oars scarce made a sound An dre who wore a blue great coat went on board this boat and was rowed to the west side of the stream Six miles south of Sto ny Point they came to shore at the foot of a high mount known as the Long Clove It was mid night Dark was the hour and dark the place and dark the deed Ar nold was there hid in the shade of the woods A man was near who came to wait on him and take care of his horse He and An dre had a long talk One two three hours passed and still there was more to say One of the men who had brought An dre and whose name was Smith warned them that it was near day break and the boat would be seen by our guards if they did not go back soon Ar nold feared that the sight of a boat on its way to the Vul ture might bring harm to him and his scheme so he urged An dre to stay on shore till the next night The boat was sent to a creek up the Hud son and An dre on the horse that Ar nold s man had rode set off with Ar nold for Smith s house The road took them through the small town of Hav er straw As they rode on in the dark the voice of one of the guards at an out post made An dre start for he knew he must be with in our lines But it was too late to turn back and at day break they reached Smith s house Scarce was the door closed on them when the boom of great guns was heard from down the stream An dre felt ill at ease and had good cause for fear The fact was that as soon as Liv ing ston who had charge of our troops at Ver planck s Point heard that the Vul ture was with in shot of Tel ler s Point which juts out twixt Hav er straw Bay and Tap pan Sea he sent some men and some big guns to that point in the night to fire on the sloop of war An dre kept a close watch on the scene from a top room in Smith s house At one time he thought the Vul ture was on fire but his heart gave a throb of joy when he saw the sloop of war drop down the stream out of reach of gun shot Ar nold gave An dre the plans of the works at West Point and told him what and how he was to do As the Vul ture had changed her place he told An dre it would be far more safe for him to go back to New York by land And he would reach there in less time But An dre said that he must be put on board the sloop of war the next night and in case he should change his mind Ar nold gave him a pass that he might go by sea or by land At ten o clock that morn Ar nold left him to his fate Time moved at a slow pace with poor An dre Once on board the Vul ture he would be safe his task would be done and West Point would soon be in the hands of the red coats As night set in he grew still more ill at ease and asked Smith how he had planned to get him on board the Vul ture It gave him a shock to learn that Smith had not done the least thing The boat men had gone home and he would not take him on board the Vul ture But he said he would cross the Hud son with him and start him on the road to New York by land and go some of the way with him on horse back They set off at sun set and went for eight miles on the road to White Plains when they were brought to a halt by a band of our troops who were out as watch men An dre showed his pass signed with Ar nold s name and so they took him for a friend and not a foe He wore a coat of Smith s that made him look like a plain man The two were warned that it was not safe for them to be on the road at night as they might meet the Cow Boys from the King s troops who but a short time since had swept through that part of the land Smith was full of fears and An dre had to yield to his wish to take a bed in a farm house near at hand This they did but An dre could not sleep He knew that he was not safe At day break he woke Smith and made him haste to leave the place Two and a half miles from Pine s Bridge on the Cro ton Riv er An dre and Smith took a scant meal at a farm house which had been stripped by the Cow Boys Here Smith took leave of An dre who was to go the rest of the way to New York a lone He felt no fear now as he had passed our lines and was clear of those who kept watch on the out posts Six miles from Pine s Bridge he came to a fork in the road The left branch led to White Plains The right branch led to the Hud son He had thought at first that he would take the left hand road as the right one was said to be filled with Cow Boys But he had naught to fear from them as he was on their side and as it was a more straight road to New York he turned down it and took his course on the banks of the Hud son He had not gone far when he came to a place where a small stream crossed the road and ran down a dell that was thick with trees A man stepped out with a gun and brought An dre to a stand Two more armed men came up to aid the first one whose name was Paul ding Paul ding s coat was in rags and was of the kind that was worn by the King s troops When An dre caught sight of it his heart leapt for joy for he was sure he was safe So sure that he did not guard his tongue He asked the men if they were on his side and they said they were He then told who he was and that he had been sent to a post up the Hud son and was in haste to get back As he spoke he drew out a gold watch such as few owned in those days and none but men of wealth Think what a shock it must have been to An dre when Paul ding said they were not his friends but his foes and he was in their hands Then An dre tried to make out that what he first told was a lie but that he would now tell the truth and he drew forth his pass to prove that he was all right Had he done this in the first place he might have gone on his way A still tongue shows a wise head The men seized his horse by the rein and told An dre to get off He warned them that he had been sent out by general er al Ar nold and that they would be ill dealt with if they held him back We care not for that they said as they led him through the shrubs on the edge of the brook They then went to work to search him and took note of the way in which he was drest They were poor men and had not had a chance to see such fine clothes An dre wore a round hat a blue great coat neath which was a red coat decked off with gold lace a nan keen vest small clothes and boots They made him take off his coat and vest and found naught to prove that he had sought to harm their cause and they had a mind to let him go Paul ding who had been twice in the hands of the red coats and ill used by them was still not quite free from doubt A thought came to his mind Boys said he his boots must come off At this An dre s face flushed and he said that his boots were hard to get off and he begged that he might not lose time in this way But the men were firm They made him sit down his boots were drawn off and the plans that Ar nold gave him were brought to light Paul ding looked at them and cried out He is a spy He then asked An dre where he had got these plans From a man at Pine Bridge he said a man whom I did not know As he put on his clothes An dre begged the men to let him go He would pay them a large sum and stay with two of the men while one went to New York to get it Here Paul ding broke in Keep your gold We want none of it Were it ten times as much you should not stir one step An dre had to yield to his fate and was led by the men to our post which was ten or twelve miles off An dre rode on horse back with one man in front and one at each side At noon they came to a farm house and those who dwelt there sat at the mid day meal The house wife whose heart was touched by a sight of An dre s youth and look of grief asked him to draw near and take some of the food Then as she caught sight of his gold laced coat the good dame said that she knew it was poor fare for such as he but it was the best she had Poor An dre shook his head and said Oh it is all good but in deed I can not eat When the four reached the out post and Jame son who was in charge saw the plans that had been found on An dre he at once saw that they had been drawn up by the hand of Ben e dict Ar nold He at once did the thing he ought not to have done which was to write to Ar nold and tell him that a man who said his name was John An derson had been caught and held though he bore a pass signed by him The plans found on him had been sent to the Com mand er in chief and An dre with a strong guard was sent with the note to Ar nold In a short time Ma jor Tall madge who was next in rank to Jame son came back from a trip to White Plains He had a clear head and as soon as he heard the case he at once urged Jame son to send a man in haste to bring An dre back This was done but Jame son had not thought to have the note to Ar nold brought back so it sped on to let the knave know that his plot had failed As soon as Ar nold read the note he sprang on the horse of the man who brought it and rode with all speed to the dock where his six oared barge lay moored He threw him self in to it and bade his men pull out in mid stream and row as fast as they could to Tel ler s Point as he must be back in time to meet Wash ing ton who was then on his way to West Point The guards knew his barge so they did not fire on it and a bit of white cloth waved in the air served as a flag of truce He soon was on board the Vul ture where he gave him self up and the cox swain and six barge men with him This was a mean act and showed just what kind of a man Ar nold was but as soon as the men made it known that they had been led to think that all was right and that a flag of truce gave them a safe pass they were at once set free Ar nold gave the red coats much aid and they were glad to make use of him But they did not care to make friends with so base a man At the close of the war he went to Eng land and made his home there He was shunned by all and died in the year eighteen oh one at the age of three score As Wash ing ton drew near the fort at West Point he thought it strange that no guns were fired Is not general er al Ar nold here he asked of the man who came down to the shore to meet him No sir He has not been here for two days past nor have I heard from him in that time This was strange but soon the note from Jame son was placed in his hands and when he had read of the deep laid scheme he said with a deep sigh Whom can we trust now Word was at once sent out to the guards to check Ar nold s flight but it was too late He had slipped from their grasp Let us now see how An dre bore his hard fate He had the best of care and made hosts of friends who grieved that one so young so well bred and of such high rank should have done a crime for which he must be hung It was a great grief to Wash ing ton who would have felt no pang had Ar nold been in An dre s place But death to the spy was one of the rules of war and Oc to ber two was the day set for An dre to be hung He had asked that since it was his lot to die he might choose the mode of death and begged that he might be shot This Wash ing ton could not grant though in his heart he longed to do so but thought it best that An dre should not know On the morn of the twod An dre drest him self with great care in the full suit worn by those who bore his rank in the King s troops He was calm while all those near him were in tears He walked with a firm step to the place where he was to end his life arm in arm with two of our troops When he caught sight of the rope he gave a start and asked if he was not to be shot When told that no change could be made he said How hard is my fate But it will be but a brief pang Illustration WINTER AT VALLEY FORGE P ninety four Then he stepped in to the cart took off his hat and stock loosed his shirt at the throat put the noose round his neck and bound his own eyes When told that there was a chance for him to speak if he chose he said I pray you to note that I meet my fate like a brave man Then the cart was moved off and he was left in mid air and death took place in a short time An dre was laid in a grave near the place where he was hung but in eighteen twenty one was borne to the land of his birth and placed near the tombs of Kings and Queens He that breaks laws must pay the price If you want to make friends and to have them love and trust you be true Let no one coax you to sin The eye of God is on you and he sees all your deeds You may hide your crime for a while but you may be sure your sin will find you out Be not an Ar nold nor an An dre CHAPTER XIII THE HARDSHIPS OF WAR We will now go back to the place we left and see where Wash ing ton was at the close of the year seventeen seventy seven He had been forced to leave New Jer sey in the hands of the King s troops His own troops were worn down by long and hard toil and had need of rest They were in want of clothes too and could not keep warm in the tents so he sought out a place where they could build huts and screen them selves from the cold winds and storms He chose Val ley Forge which was on the west bank of the Schuyl school kill Riv er and a score of miles from Phil a del phi a Sad was the march of the troops to Val ley Forge Food was scant their clothes were worn out and a track of blood marked the way they trod They had fought hard but not to win and this made their hearts low On De cem ber seventeen they reached Val ley Forge and had to freeze in their tents till they could cut down the trees and build the huts they were to live in The walls were six feet and a half high and were made of logs filled in with clay The roofs were made of logs split in half No pen can paint the hard lot of those poor men shut in at Val ley Forge For some days they had no meat For three days they had no bread Some of the men had to sit up all night by the fires as there were no clothes for their beds and they could not sleep for the cold Some of the men were so scant of clothes that they could not leave their huts Wash ing ton was kept short of funds and of troops though he plead hard for both and was sore pressed on all sides He scarce knew what to do There was but one thing he could do and that was to wait While his troops were in this sad plight some of them sick un to death the red coats who held Phil a del phi a in siege led a gay sort of life and were much at their ease Near the first of March a Ger man came to Wash ing ton s camp to lend him his aid His name was Bar on Steu ben He had fought for long years in the wars that had been waged in Eu rope had been aide de camp to Fred er ick the Great and had won much fame by his brave deeds The French who were friends to our cause knew that we had need of such a man as Bar on Steu ben and urged him to come to A mer i ca and he was at once sent to join the troops at Val ley Forge Our troops had had no chance to drill there was no one to teach them and they had fought with a rush and a dash and in a pell mell sort of way Steu ben went to work to drill these men the best of whom had much to learn and he found it a hard task at first as he could not speak our tongue At last a man was found who spoke French and him Steu ben made his aide de camp and kept him close at hand The men were slow to learn for the drills were new to them and Steu ben would get wroth with them and call them block heads and all sorts of hard names But though he had a sharp tongue and was quick to get in a rage he had a kind true heart and soon won the love of the men For eight months the red coats had held Phil a del phi a In the spring general er al Howe went home and left his troops in charge of Sir Hen ry Clin ton who made up his mind to lead the troops back to New York But he did not wish his plans to be known In the mean time Wash ing ton knew that a scheme of some sort was on foot so he sent troops out to check the King s troops should they move by land The red coats left Phil a del phi a on June eighteen and as there was but one road for them to take their train stretched out for twelve miles They made a halt at Al len town and Clin ton had not quite made up his mind which way to go from that place He at first thought he would go as far as the Rar i tan Riv er and then ship his troops to New York but when he found that our troops were not far off he turned to the right and took the road to Mon mouth His march was a slow one the heat was great the rains made the roads bad and they had to stop to bridge the streams and to build cause ways so that they could cross the swamps Wash ing ton in the mean time had gone on to Kings ton but as soon as he learned Clin ton s course he moved his troops so as to get in the rear of the red coats On the night of June twenty seven the foe went in camp on the high ground near Mon mouth Court House The van guard of our troops was five miles off and in charge of general er al Lee At day break the van guard of the red coats set forth down the hill while Clin ton with his choice troops staid in camp on the heights of Free hold to give the long train of carts and pack mules a chance to get well on the way At eight o clock all were in line of march to Mid dle town As soon as Lee heard that the foe were on the move he set out to meet them and was joined by the troops in charge of La fay ette As Lee stood on one of the hills he caught sight of a band of red coats hid some what by the woods which he thought was a part of the main force So he sent some of his troops to draw their fire and check them in the rear while he with the rest of his force would take a short cut through the woods get in front of the corps and cut it off from the main force Wash ing ton was on his way with his main force when the boom of big guns rang out on the air The sound caused him to change his pace to a quick step and when he drew near Free hold church where the road forked he sent Greene with part of his force to the right while he with the rest of the troops took the left hand road Wash ing ton stood on the ground with his arm thrown up on the neck of his horse when a man rode up and said the blue coats were in flight Wash ing ton was vexed for he was quite sure it was not true Then up came one with fife in hand quite out of breath and in great fright He was seized at once so that he would not scare the troops then on their way and told that he would be flogged if he dared to spread the tale he had brought Wash ing ton sprang on his horse and sent men out to learn the truth while he spurred past the Free hold church The news seemed too strange to be true He had heard but a few guns and did not think there had been much of a fight Was Lee to blame for this wrong move He feared so As he reached the high ground he saw Lee and his men in full flight and by this time he was in a fine rage What do you mean by this he asked in a fierce stern tone as Lee rode up to him At sight of Wash ing ton s face Lee was struck dumb for a while but when he could speak he tried to tell why he had thought it best to fall back There was not much time for a talk as the foe were not far off The sight of their Com mand er in chief put a stop to the flight and plans were at once made to turn the luck The place where they were was good for a stand as it was on high ground which the foe could not reach but by a cause way Lee knew that Wash ing ton had lost faith in him so he held back and would give no aid to his chief Wash ing ton rode back to Lee in a calm mood and said to him Will you keep the com mand on this height or not If you will I will go back to the main force and have it formed on the next height Lee said it was all the same to him where he was placed that he would do just as Wash ing ton said and not be the first to leave the ground Soon guns were heard on both sides Lee and his men who were in the fore ground made a brave stand but were at length forced to fall back Lee brought off his troops in good style by the cause way that crossed the swamps in front of our troops in charge of Lord Stir ling and was the last to leave the ground When he had formed his men in line back of the swamp he rode up to Wash ing ton and said Here sir are my troops what do you wish me to do with them Wash ing ton saw that the men were worn out with long tramps hard fights and the great heat so he told Lee to take them to the rear and call in all those he might meet with who had fled from his ranks The foe sought to turn both our flanks but were checked by a sharp fire and at length they gave way and fell back to the ground where Lee had been that morn Here the woods and swamps were on their flanks and their front could not be reached but by the cause way Great as was the risk Wash ing ton made up his mind to charge on the foe and this was his plan general er al Poor was to move round on their right general er al Wood ford on the left while the big field guns should gall them in front But night set in ere they could act on this plan Some of the troops had sunk on the ground and all were in need of rest Wash ing ton told them to lie on their arms just where they chanced to be when it grew dark as he meant to go on with the fight at dawn of the next day He lay on his cloak at the foot of a tree and La fay ette lay near him At day break the beat of drums roused them from their sleep but the foe had fled and had been so long on the way that Wash ing ton could not hope to check them Our loss in the fight at Mon mouth was sixty nine while two hundred fifty of the King s troops were left dead on the field Some of the troops on both sides had died in the swamp and some were found on the edge of a stream that ran through it where worn out with their toils and weak from heat and thirst they had crawled to drink and die Lee s pride had been so hurt that he wrote to Wash ing ton in a way that he should not have done to his Com mand er in chief and he was brought to court by the Board of War and tried for his wrong deeds His guilt was proved and he was told that he could not serve for the next twelve months He went to his home in Vir gin i a where he led a queer kind of a life His house was a mere shell and had but one room but lines were chalked on the floor and each space was used as if it was a room by it self Here was his bed there were his books in this space he kept all his horse gear and in that one he cooked and ate his meals With pen and with tongue he strove to harm Wash ing ton whom his shafts failed to hurt and who spoke not an ill word of Lee He liked him as a friend but did not think he was fit to lead troops to war Lee died in the course of four years and on his death bed he thought he was on the field of war and his last words were a call to his men to stand by him For a year or two more the strife was kept up on the coast from Maine to Flor i da and both red coats and red skins took part in scenes that chill the blood to read of Houses were burnt and land laid waste forts were stormed and seized from our troops whose force was too small to hold them Now and then there was a gain for our side but in spite of his ill luck Wash ing ton held on with a brave heart and would die at his post but would not yield In the first part of the year seventeen eighty we find Wash ing ton in camp at Mor ris town with a lot of half fed and half clad troops No such cold had been known in this zone The Bay of New York froze so hard that the ships of war that lay in it were ice bound Food was scant and there was a lack of fire wood Wash ing ton saw what a chance there was for a bold stroke but he had no funds with which to fit out his troops or to move them to the coast The cost of war was great and gold was scarce He could not strike a big blow for New York to wrest it from the hands of the foe as he might have done at this time had his troops been well fed and well clad but he would do what he could in a small way A bridge of ice had formed twixt New Jer sey and Stat en Isl and so Wash ing ton sent Lord Stir ling with twenty five hundred men to start up and seize a force of twelve hundred red coats His lord ship crossed in the night but was seen and had to fall back to E liz a beth town Some of his men fell in to the hands of the King s troops and some in to the hands of Jack Frost This raid gave a start to the foe and they set out to tease and vex our out posts which they thought could be done at small risk as there was snow on the ground and the troops could be borne on sleighs Not far from White Plains and a score of miles from the out posts of the red coats three hundred of our men had a post in a stone house known as Young s house as that was the name of the man who owned it It faced a road which ran north and south down through a rich plain and so on to New York Our men kept a close watch on this road to stop the red coats who might seek to pass with food or live stock The red coats made up their mind to break up this nest of blue birds and the night of Feb ru a ry two was set for the task The King s troops set out from King s Bridge some in sleighs and some on horse back The snow was deep and it was hard for the sleighs to break their way through The troops at length left them and marched on foot They could not bring their field guns with them Now and then they would come to a place where the snow was more than two feet deep and they had to take by ways and cross roads so as not to get near our out guards The sun rose while they were yet six miles or more from Young s house This spoiled their plan but still they kept on Ere they could reach the house the news flew like wild fire that the red coats were near and men left their farms and homes to aid those in Young s house But though they fought well they had not strength to hold the fort Not a few were killed The house was sacked and set on fire and the red coats made haste to get back to their lines with those of our men whom they had seized and who were sent to New York and put in the vile jails there In the year seventeen eighty France sent ships of war and troops to aid our cause and to drive the red coats from New York The French troops were in charge of Count de Ro cham beau who was told to do just as Wash ing ton said for he was Com mand er in chief Wash ing ton s heart gave a throb of joy at this proof of good will and his grief was that he had not more troops of his own to join with these that he might push for New York at once He must wait till the rest of the French troops then on their way came to port In the mean time his thoughts were turned to the South where the red coats led by Corn wal lis waged a fierce war Our troops there were in charge of general er al Greene who was full of cheer and did his best to keep the foe at bay but with poor luck as his force was small But Wash ing ton had faith in him yet such a large force of the King s troops had been sent by sea to aid Corn wal lis that Wash ing ton feared that Greene would not be safe So he wrote to La fay ette who was on his way to meet the French fleet that had been sent to Ches a peake Bay to push on and join the troops at the South At this time Wash ing ton was at a place near West Point and his whole force on the Hud son in May seventeen eighty one was not more than seven thousand half of whom were not fit to take the field Here word came to him of feuds at the North and that the foe were in force on the north side of Cro ton Riv er colonel o nel De lan cey who led this raid held the place that An dre had filled and bore the same rank and De lan cey s horse men were the dread of all those who dwelt in that part of the land Our troops had an out post not far from Pine s Bridge in charge of colonel o nel Greene of Rhode Isl and who had served all through the war De lan cey set out at night at the head of one hundred men on horse back and two hundred on foot They crossed the Cro ton at day break just as the night guard had been called off and bore down on the out post They first went to the farm house where colonel o nel Greene and Ma jor Flagg slept and put a strong guard round it Ma jor Flagg sprang from his bed threw up the sash and fired at the foe but was shot through the head and then hacked with sword cuts and thrusts They then burst through the door of Greene s room He was a man of great strength and for some time kept the foes at bay with his sword but at last he fell for what could one man do in such a fight By the time the troops sent out by Wash ing ton reached the post De lan cey s men had flown They tried to take Greene with them but he died on the way and they left him at the edge of the woods Wash ing ton felt sad at heart when he heard of the death of his brave and true friend colonel o nel Greene and the next day he had his corpse brought to the west bank of the Hud son Guns were fired to tell that one who had fought well had gone to his rest and strong men shed tears as he was laid in his grave for his loss was a source of great grief to all CHAPTER XIV THE CLOSE OF THE WAR In the month of May Corn wal lis had planned to bring his troops to Pe ters burg and strike a blow at La fay ette who was near Rich mond La fay ette fled as soon as he heard that Corn wal lis had crossed the James Riv er for he had but few troops and did not care to bring on a big fight till the men came up who were then on the way to aid him Corn wal lis thought he could soon catch the boy as he called him but his youth made him spry and the red coats did not get up to him On June ten general er al Wayne came up with nine hundred men to add to La fay ette s strength and this made him change his whole plan With four thousand men and Ba ron Steu ben he might hope to win in a fight with the red coats and he turned his face to the foe Corn wal lis was at that time twixt La fay ette and Al be marle Court House where stores were kept The Mar quis by a night march through a road that had long been out of use got in front of the King s troops and held them in check Corn wal lis turned back and marched first to Rich mond and then to Will iams burg while La fay ette kept close in his rear Here they had a fierce fight in which the loss was great on both sides and the gain but small At this time word came to Corn wal lis that Wash ing ton had borne down on New York and that he must send some of his troops to that town This would leave him too weak to stay where he was so on Ju ly four he set out for Ports mouth La fay ette gave chase the next day and took post nine miles from his camp His plan was to fall on the rear guard when the main force should have crossed the ford at James town But Corn wal lis guessed what he meant to do and laid a trap for him A sharp fight took place in to which Wayne threw him self like a mad man but the foe were as ten to one and our troops were forced back to Green Springs In Ju ly La fay ette wrote to Wash ing ton that Corn wal lis had left Ports mouth by sea and he thought he was on his way to New York It was true the troops had gone on board the boats but though wind and tide were fair they did not sail With the French fleet to help him Wash ing ton saw a chance to fight the foe by land and sea so he turned from New York and marched to Vir gin i a to aid La fay ette who longed to have his chief at the head of his troops but did not know he was so near As our war worn troops went through Phil a del phi a they were hailed with shouts and cheers from the throngs that filled the streets They kept step to the sound of the drum and fife and raised a great cloud of dust for there had been quite a drought The French troops passed through the next day but not in the same style They made a halt a mile from the town where they brushed off the dust from their guns and their gay white and green clothes and then marched with a light step to the sound of a fine band Crowds were on the streets and bright smiles and loud shouts met these who had come from France to lay down their lives if need be for the cause we had at heart When Wash ing ton turned his back on New York Sir Hen ry Clin ton sent word to Corn wal lis that he would not need the troops he had asked for so Corn wal lis went from Ports mouth to York town where he took his stand York town was a small place on the south side of York Riv er The stream at this point was not more than a mile wide but it was so deep that ships of large size and weight could go through Here he threw up works on both sides of the stream which gave him a fine strong hold as the banks were high and set out from the main land He thought there was no foe near but La fay ette and he had no great fear of one so young He felt so safe that he wrote to Clin ton that he could let him have a large force of men to add strength to New York where it was thought our troops would strike the next blow In the mean time La fay ette threw out troops to the rear to work with the French fleets that would soon be in Ches a peake Bay and so a net was drawn round Corn wal lis at a time when he thought he was most safe Wash ing ton was at Phil a del phi a on Sep tem ber five and at Bal ti more three days from that time He left Bal ti more on the ninth at day break with but one of his suite as he was in haste to reach Mount Ver non The rest of his suite rode at their ease and joined him the next day at noon It was six years since Wash ing ton had seen his old home and how full of toil and care those years had been In three days he had to leave the dear old place and with his guests push on to join La fay ette who was at Will iams burg By Sep tem ber twenty five the French and our troops were in camp near that town and at once set to work to get things in train for the next fight Corn wal lis had built forts on the north and south banks of the stream and had done all he could to add strength to York town Ships of war were in front and boats had been sunk at the mouth of the stream Field works were at the rear with big guns on top and there were long rows of trees that had been cut down and left so that their limbs stuck out and made a fence it would not be safe to climb At the right and left of York town were deep dells and creeks and it was not strange that Corn wal lis felt that he was in a sure strong hold Our troops were twelve miles off when they took up their march on Sep tem ber twenty eight and that night they went in camp two miles from York town Wash ing ton and his staff slept on the ground his head on the root of a tree The next morn our troops drew out on each side of Bea ver Dam Creek the A mer i cans on the east side and the French on the west The Count de Grasse with the main fleet staid in Lynn Haven Bay so as to keep off the ships that might come from sea to aid the red coats On the night of the first of Oc to ber our troops threw up two earth works on which the red coats turned their guns at day light and killed three of the men While Wash ing ton stood near the works a shot struck the ground close by him and threw up a great cloud of dust One of his staff who stood near was in a great fright but Wash ing ton was calm and showed no signs of fear On Oc to ber six our troops set out to dig the trench that the first line would use in the siege of York town So dark was the night and so still were the men that the foe did not know of it till day light Then they fired on them from the forts but the men were screened and kept at their work By the ninth the trench was dug and the guns fixed to fire at the town Wash ing ton put the match to the first gun and a storm of balls and bomb shells dared Corn wal lis to come out and fight For three or four days the fire was kept up on both sides and bomb shells crossed in mid air and at night flashed forth like great stars with tails a blaze of light Our shells did much harm in the town and to the earth works of the foe The red hot shot from the French forts north west of the town reached the King s ships of war The Char on a forty four gun ship and three large boats for troops were set on fire by them The flames ran up to the tops of the masts and as the night was dark the scene was a grand one to the eye but a sad one to the heart On the night of the eleventh a new ditch was dug by the troops led by Bar on Steu ben and for two or three days the foe kept up a fire on the men at work At eight o clock on the night of Oc to ber fourteen they set out to storm both York town and the Point on the north bank at the same time The van guard of our troops was led by Al ex an der Ham il ton When at school he wrote to one of his boy friends I wish there was a war and in seventeen seventy six when he was but nineteen years of age he was placed at the head of the men who fired the guns and bomb shells The next year he was aide de camp to Wash ing ton in whom he found a true and wise friend With great joy and pride Ham il ton led the van in a head long dash past the trees which they pushed or pulled down with their own hands where they could not climb them and was the first to mount the wall One of his men knelt so that Ham il ton could use him for steps and the rest of the men got up the best way they could Not a gun was fired and the fort fell in to the hands of our troops with a small loss on both sides The French stormed the fort at the Point in as brave a way but with less speed and lost more men Wash ing ton stood on the ground in the grand fort where he could see all that took place An aide de camp near him spoke up and said that he ran a great risk from a chance shot through one of the port holes If you think so said Wash ing ton you can step back Soon a ball struck the gun in the port hole rolled on and fell at his feet general er al Knox seized him by the arm My dear general er al said he we can t spare you yet It is a spent ball said Wash ing ton in a calm voice no harm is done When each charge was made and both forts were in our hands he drew a long breath turned to Knox and said The work is done and well done Then he said to his black man Bring me my horse and rode off to see where next his lines should move and how the trap could be closed on Corn wal lis Corn wal lis found that he could not hold his forts no troops had come to his aid and he would soon have to yield to the foe This was too much for his pride so he made up his mind to leave those who were sick or had wounds and fly from York town His scheme was to cross the stream at night fall on the French camp ere day break push on with all speed and force his way to the north and join Sir Hen ry Clin ton in New York A large part of his troops had crossed the stream on the night of Oc to ber sixteen and the rest were on their way when a fierce storm of wind and rain drove the boats down the stream They could not be brought back till day light and it was then too late for them to move on or to turn back The hopes of Lord Corn wal lis were at an end and on the seventeenth he sent a flag of truce and a note to Wash ing ton and asked that his guns might cease their fire for one day so that terms of peace could be drawn up Wash ing ton feared that in the mean time troops from New York would reach Corn wal lis so he sent word back that his guns should cease their fire for but two hours Wash ing ton did not like the terms drawn up by Corn wal lis so he made a rough draft of such terms as he would grant These were sent to Corn wal lis on the nineteenth and he was forced to sign them and in two hours his troops were to march out of the forts Illustration THE SURRENDER AT YORKTOWN P one hundred nine At noon our troops were drawn up in two lines more than a mile in length the A mer i cans on the right side of the road the French on the left At two o clock the red coats passed out with slow steps and were led to a field where they were to ground their arms Some of them in their rage threw down their guns with such force as to well nigh break them On the day that Corn wal lis had been forced to lay down his arms at York town the large force that was to aid him set sail from New York They did not reach Ches a peake Bay till Oc to ber twenty nine and when they found they were too late they turned their prows and went back to New York The down fall of Corn wal lis was felt to be a death blow to the war and great joy was felt through out the land Votes of thanks were sent to Wash ing ton to De Ro cham beau and De Grasse and Wash ing ton gave high praise to all the troops for the way in which they had fought at the siege of York town From that time the red coats lost heart and on No vem ber twenty five seventeen eighty three they marched out of New York and Wash ing ton marched in at the head of his brave men who had fought and bled and borne all the ills that flesh could bear that the land they loved might be free In a few days Wash ing ton was called to An na po lis to meet with those who made the laws and his chief men who had been with him through all the sad scenes of the war came to bid him good bye With a heart full of love he said to them I can not come to each of you to take my leave but shall be glad if each of you will come and take me by the hand This they did No one spoke a word Tears were in all their eyes Wash ing ton left the room and went on foot to the boat which lay at the end of what was then and is now White hall Street His friends kept close in the rear When Wash ing ton was in his barge he turned took off his hat and waved good bye and those on shore did the same and watched the barge till it passed out of their sight CHAPTER XV FIRST IN PEACE At the close of the war and of the year seventeen eighty three Wash ing ton went back to Mount Ver non He reached his home to his great joy on the eve of Christ mas day and he was in a good state of mind to keep the feast The scene is at last closed he wrote and I am eased of a load of care I hope to spend the rest of my days in peace Mount Ver non was locked in ice and snow for some time Wash ing ton wrote that he was so used to camp life that he could not help feel when he woke each day that he must hear the drums beat and must go out to plan or to lead his troops He was now at his ease and longed for the spring so that his friends could come to him My way of life is plain he said I do not mean to be put out of it But a glass of wine and a bit of meat can be had at all times He would not give notes of his life to those who wished to write it up at this time lest it should look vain I will leave it to those who are to come to think and say what they please of me he wrote I will not by an act of mine seem to boast of what I have done As spring came on friends flocked to Mount Ver non and Wash ing ton met them in a frank way His wife too was full of good sense and good cheer She loved to knit and had been used all through the war to knit socks for the poor men who were in the ranks But as Wash ing ton took his rides through his place he felt the changes there since he had left Old friends were gone and the scenes of his youth were no more La fay ette spent a few days with him and the love he felt for the brave young man was as strong as at first He wrote a sad note to him when he was gone which showed what a warm place the young French man had in his heart He said As you left me I asked if this were the last sight I should have of you And though I wished to say No my fears said Yes I called to mind the days of my youth and found they had long since fled to come back no more I must now go down the hill I have climbed all these years I am blessed with strength but I some of a short lived race and may soon go to the tomb All these thoughts gave a gloom to the hour in which I parted with you Wash ing ton made a trip through some of the states of the West and saw there was a chance for great trade there and he wrote much of what he had seen But his chief joy was in his home and land where he planted trees and loved to watch them grow He writes down each month of what he sets out now it is a choice slip of grape vine from France or it may be a tree that stays green all the year round Some of the bushes he set out still stand strong in their growth on the place He notes the trees best for shade and which will not hurt the grass He writes of rides to the Mill Swamp in quest of young elms ash trees and white thorn and of the walks he lays out and the trees and shrubs he plants by them A plan of the way in which he laid out his grounds is still kept at Mount Ver non and the pla ces are marked on it for the trees and shrubs He owned five farms and he kept maps of each He read much of soils the way to raise good crops and the best style of ploughs and farm tools to use He rode the first half of the day to see that all went well When he had dined he would write till dark if he had no guests If friends came he did all he could to make them feel at ease and at home He was kind and loved by all He would not talk much of the war nor of what he had done in it He took great care not to talk of his own acts so that if there had been a guest who did not know the facts he would not have found out by a word from Wash ing ton that he was one who had won a great name in the eyes of the world Though grave in his looks and ways he loved to see youth glad and gay He was fond of the dance and it was long the boast of more than one fair dame that she had danced with the chief There had been balls in camp in the dark days of the war Wash ing ton as we have seen had been fond of the hunt in his youth and La fay ette sent him some hounds from France so he took up his old sport But the French hounds did not do well and he found they could not be trusted Ere the war had been long past it was found that there was need of new laws by which the States should be ruled The chief men of the land were called to Phil a del phi a to form them and Wash ing ton went from Mount Ver non to take part in the work It was then that the code of laws was drawn up which bears the name of Con sti tu tion of the U ni ted States These laws said that the States should be ruled by a Pres i dent The choice for this post fell on Wash ing ton and in the spring of seventeen eighty eight he bade good bye to Mount Ver non and made his way to New York where he was to take the oath that he would serve the land and be true to her in peace and in war As he passed through the towns crowds came out to cheer him flags were raised guns roared and at night there was a great show of fire works When he came to Tren ton the place where in the past he had crossed the stream in the storm through clouds of snow and drifts of ice he found a scene of peace and love Crowds were on the bank the stream gleamed in the sun the sky was blue and all hailed him with joy On the bridge that crossed the Del a ware an arch was raised and twined with wreaths of green and gay blooms As Wash ing ton passed neath it a band of young girls drest in white and with wreaths on their heads threw bright blooms at his feet and sang an ode that spoke the love and praise that were in all hearts At E liz a beth town Point he was met by men who had been sent from New York and led to a barge which had been made for his use It was filled with sea men of high rank who made a fine show in their white suits Boats of all sorts gay with flags and some with bands on board fell in the wake of Wash ing ton s barge and as they swept up the bay of New York the sight was a grand one The ships at the wharves or in mid stream dipped their flags and fired their guns bells were rung and on all the piers were great crowds that made the air ring with their shouts On the last day of A pril seventeen eighty nine Wash ing ton took the oath in front of the hall where the wise men of the land had been wont to meet in New York He stood in full view of a great crowd to whom this was a new and strange sight The States were to be as one and this man whose name and fame were dear to them was to pledge him self to keep them so On a ledge that bulged out from the main part of the house was a stand spread with a rich red cloth on which lay the Word of God the Book of Books Wash ing ton was clad in a full suit of dark brown home made cloth white silk hose and dress sword with steel hilt and his hair was drest in the style of the day As he came in sight he was hailed with the shouts of the crowds in the streets and on the roofs He came to the front of the ledge close to the rail so that he could be seen by all laid his hand on his heart bowed three or four times and then went back and took his seat in an arm chair near the stand In a short time he rose and went once more to the front with John Ad ams who was to be next him in rank and the friends who were to stand by him in this new field While the oath was read Wash ing ton stood with his hand on the Word of God and at the close he said I swear so help me God One of the men would have raised the book to Wash ing ton s lips but he bent his head and kissed it Then there was a cry of Long live George Wash ing ton and all the bells in the town rang out a peal of joy and the crowd rent the air with their shouts and cheers Wash ing ton bowed and made a speech that was full of good sense Then all went on foot to saint Paul s Church to pray that God would bless the land Wash ing ton felt most of all as he wrote to his friends a fear lest he should come short of what the land hoped to find in him The eyes of the world were on him He had won fame in the field but how would he rule the State There was still much to be done Great Brit ain held some of the posts at the West on the plea that debts due to some of her men had not been paid the red men were still a source of fear to the homes in the Wild West and there was no hard cash with which the States could pay their debts He found that his time was no more his own From dawn till dark men came to him and he saw that he must be saved from this or he could do no work missus Wash ing ton joined him and soon days were fixed for the calls of friends The house was kept well but there was no waste One who dined there wrote that there was no show The Pres i dent said a short grace as he sat down One glass of wine was passed to each and no toasts were drank He was kind to his guests and strove to put them at their ease He was strict in the way he kept the Lord s day He went to church and would have no calls on that day As to missus Wash ing ton those who knew her at the time speak of her as free from all art She met her guests in a well bred way as one who had ruled in a great house She too was more fond of their home at Mount Ver non than of the new rank and place To stay at home was the first and most dear wish of her heart Wash ing ton was touched to the quick when he heard that I some one had said that there was more pomp at his house than at saint James where King George held his court and that his bows were much too stiff and cold Wash ing ton wrote I grieve that my bows were not to his taste for they were the best I can make I can say with truth that I feel no pride of place and would be more glad to be at Mount Ver non with a few friends at my side than here with men from all the courts of the world He then goes on to tell how they treat their guests At two or three o clock each Tues day they come and go They go in and out of the rooms and chat as they please When they first come in they speak to me and I talk with all I can What pomp there is in all this I do not see The red men who could not be kept in peace roused the land once more to arms Wash ing ton did not wish for war but he had to call out troops They went forth and laid waste In di an towns Wash ing ton thought it would be a good plan to meet the In di an chiefs and talk with them Three chiefs came to him and said they would go to the rest and try to make peace Wash ing ton made a set speech and told them it would be a good work to do or else those tribes if they thieved and killed as they had done would be swept from the face of the earth He had thought much of the state of the red men in the land He had but small faith in schools for the youth save as far as to teach them to read and write The true means to do them good he thought was to teach them to till the ground and raise crops in the same way as the white folks and he said if the tribes were pleased to learn such arts he would find a way to have them taught In the end general er al saint Clair had to be sent out with troops to put the red men down Wash ing ton s last words to him were to be on the watch for the red skins were sly and would wait for a chance to find him off his guard But saint Clair did not pay heed to these wise words and the red skins got in to his camp some of his best men were slain and the whole force was put to rout When the news was brought to Wash ing ton he said in a quick way I knew it would be so Here on this spot I took leave of him and told him to be on his guard I said to him you know how the red skins fight us I warned him and yet he could let them steal in to his camp and hack and slay that ar my He threw up his hands and his frame shook as he cried out O what a crime what a crime Then he grew calm and said that saint Clair should have a chance to speak and he would be just to him saint Clair was tried and was found free from guilt Wash ing ton s mo ther died at Fred er icks burg Vir gin i a Au gust twenty five seventeen eighty nine aged eighty two When her son first went to war she would shake her head and say Ah George should stay at home and take care of his farm As he rose step by step and the news of his fame was brought to her she would say George was a good boy and she had no fear but that he would be a good man and do what was right In the year seventeen eighty nine a great war broke out in France in which Lou is XVI lost his crown and his head and deeds were done that you could scarce read of with out tears Men seemed like fiends in their mad rage and like wild beasts in their thirst for blood In seventeen ninety three France made war on Eng land and in seventeen ninety seven sought to break up the peace of the U ni ted States but of this I will tell you by and by In the mean time the four years which was the full term Wash ing ton was to rule came to an end He had no wish to serve for two terms but the choice fell on him and he once more took the oath on March four seventeen ninety two In seventeen ninety six as France was still at war it was thought best that Wash ing ton should hold his place for a third term But this he would not do He had made up his mind to leave these scenes and to give up that sort of life and those who plead with him could not move him He took leave of his friends in a way that moved them to tears and his fare well speech though in plain style touched all hearts and made them feel what a loss it was to part with so great and good a man On March four seventeen ninety seven John Ad ams took the oath and bound him self to serve as Pres i dent for a term of four years Wash ing ton was there and as he rose to leave the house there was a great rush to the door as all wished to catch the last look of one who had had for so long a time the first place in their hearts So great was the crush that it was feared there would be loss of limbs if not of life As Wash ing ton stood in the street he waved his hat as cheer on cheer rose from the crowd and his gray hairs streamed forth in the wind When he came to his own door he turned to the throng with a grave face and tried to say a word or two But tears rose to his eyes his heart was full and he could not speak but by signs He soon set off for Mount Ver non the dear home of his heart He had been there but a few months when the French by their acts seemed to want to bring on a war with the U ni ted States They took our ships at sea and there was no way left but to stand up for our rights Pres i dent Ad ams wrote to Wash ing ton We must have your name if you will let us have it There will be more in it than in a host of men If the French come here we shall have to march with a quick step Wash ing ton wrote to Pres i dent Ad ams I had no thought that in so short a time I should be called from the shade of Mount Ver non But if a foe should come in our land I would not plead my age or wish to stay at home He saw the dark clouds that showed a storm and he feared his days of peace would be few It was with a sad heart that he felt his rest was at an end but he had so strong a sense of what was right that he did not hold back He said he would do all he could for the troops but he would not take the field till the foe was at hand For months Wash ing ton led a life full of hard work He had much to do for the troops and at the same time work at home He would write for hours and took long rides each day To his great joy there was in the end no war with France He seemed in first rate health up to De cem ber twelve seventeen ninety nine On that day a storm set in first of snow then of hail and then of rain and Wash ing ton was out in it for at least two hours When he reached the house his clerk mister Lear saw that the snow hung from his hair and asked him if he was not wet through No said Wash ing ton my great coat kept me dry But the next day his throat was sore and he was quite hoarse and though much worse at night he made light of it and thought it would soon pass off When he went to bed mister Lear asked him if he did not think it best to take some thing Oh no said Wash ing ton Let it go as it came But he grew worse in the night and it was hard for him to breathe and though his wife wished to call up one of the maids he would not let her rise lest she should take cold At day break when the maid came in to light the fire she was sent to call mister Lear All was done that could be done to ease him of his pain but he felt him self that he had but a short time to live mister Lear was like a son to him and was with him night and day When mister Lear would try to raise and turn him so that he could breathe with more ease Wash ing ton would say I fear I tire you too much When Lear told him that he did not he said Well it is a debt we must all pay and when you want aid of this kind I hope you ll find it His black man had been in the room the whole day and most of the time on his feet and when Wash ing ton took note of it he told him in a kind voice to sit down I tell you these things that you may see what a kind heart he had and how at his last hour he thought not of him self His old friend doctor Craik who stood by his side when he first went forth to war in the year seventeen fifty four was with him in these last hours when Death was the foe that Wash ing ton had to meet He said to doctor Craik I die hard but I am not a fraid to go my breath can not last long He felt his own pulse and breathed his last on the night of De cem ber fourteen seventeen ninety nine His wife who sat at the foot of the bed asked with a firm voice Is he gone Lear who could not speak made a sign that he was no more Tis well said she in the same voice All is now at an end and I shall soon join him Thus lived and died this great and good man first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of those who love the land of the free Praise did not spoil him or make him vain but from first to last he was the same wise calm true friend full of love to God and of good will to man Great and good men have been born in to the world but none whose name and fame rank as high as that of GEORGE WASH ING
