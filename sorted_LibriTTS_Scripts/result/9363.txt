Short Stories Published in Great Britain and Ireland INTRODUCTION When Edward J O Brien asked me to cooperate with him in choosing each year s best English short stories to be published as a companion volume to his annual selection of the best American short stories I had not realized that at the end of my arduous task which has involved the reading of many hundreds of stories in the English magazines of an entire year I should find myself asking the simple question What is a short story I do not suppose that a hundred years ago such a question could have occurred to any one Then all that a story was and could be was implied in the simple phrase Tell me a story We all know what that means How many stories published today would stand this simple if final test of being told by word of mouth I doubt whether fifty per cent would Surely the universality of the printing press and the linotype machine have done something to alter the character of literature just as the train and the telephone have done not a little to abolish polite correspondence Most stories of today are to be read not told Hence great importance must be attached to the manner of writing in some instances the whole effect of a modern tale is dependent on the manner of presentation Henry James is possibly an extreme example Has any one ever attempted to tell a tale in the Henry James manner by word of mouth even when the manner pretends to be conversational I for one have yet to experience this pleasure though I have listened to a good many able and experienced tale tellers in my time Now there is a great connection between the manner or method of a writer and the matter upon which he works his manner or method Henry James was not an accident Life as he found it was full of trivialities and polite surfaces and a great deal of manner style if you like is needful to give life and meaning to trivial things And James was by no means an isolated phenomenon In Russia Chekhov was creating an artistic significance out of the uneventful lives of the petty bourgeoisie whose hitherto small numbers had vastly increased with the advent of machinery and the industrialization of the country as the villages became towns the last vestiges of the romantic and heroic elements seemed to have departed from contemporary Russian literature As widely divergent as the two writers were in their choice of materials and methods of expression they yet met on common ground in their devotion to form their painstaking perfecting of their expressions and this tense effort alone was often enough the very life and soul of their adventure They were like magicians creating marvels with the flimsiest of materials they did not complain of the poverty of life but as often as not created bricks without straw Not for them Herman Melville s dictum to be found in Moby Dick To produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme Roughly then there are two schools of creative literature and round them there have grown up two schools of criticism The one maintains that form is everything that not only is perfect form essential and interesting material non essential but that actually interesting material is a deterrent to perfect expression inasmuch as material from life inherently imaginative fantastic or romantic is likely to make an author lazy and negligent and cause him to throw his whole dependence on objective facts rather than on his ingenuity in creating an individual atmosphere and vibrant patterns of his own making The other school maintains with equal emphasis that form is not enough that it wants a real and exciting story that where a man s materials are rich and big the necessity for perfection is obviated indeed rough edges are a virtue As one English novelist tersely put it to me I don t care for the carving of orange pips All I ask of a writer is that his stuff should be big Undoubtedly some people prefer a cultivated garden others nature in all her wildness Nature it is true may exercise no selection unfortunately it is too often forgotten that she is all art in the wealth and minuteness of her detail It seems to me that both theories are equally fallacious I do not see how either can be wholly satisfying There is no reason at all why a story should not contain both form and matter a form I should say suited to the matter Among the painters Vermeer is admittedly perfect has then Rembrandt no art Among the writers Turgenev is perfect George Moore has compared his perfection to that of the Greeks is it then justifiable to call Dostoevsky journalese as some have called him Indeed it takes a great artist to write about great things though it is true a great artist is often pardoned for lapses in style where a minor artist can afford no such lapses It was in such a light with the true honesty and humility of a fine artist that Flaubert than whom none sought greater perfection regarded himself before the towering Shakespeare This preamble is no digression but is quite pertinent to any consideration of the contemporary short story for I must admit that however fallacious is either of the prevalent theories which I have outlined in practice both work out with an appalling accuracy Of the hundreds of stories which I have had to read the number possessing a sense of form is relatively small and of these only a few are rich in content strictly speaking most of them stick to the facts of everyday life to the intimate realities of urban and suburban existence Other stories and these are more numerous possibly as a reaction and in response to the human craving for the fairy tale are concerned with the most impossible adventure and fantastic unreality Romance with the capital R They are often attractive in plot able in construction happy in invention and their general tendency may be to fall within the definition of life s little ironies yet in spite of these admirable qualifications the majority of these stories are unconvincing lacking in balance in plausibility in that virtue which may be defined as the writer s imagination whose lack is something more than careless writing How often one puts down a story with the feeling that it would take little to make it a rattling good tale but alas that little is everything A story teller s craft depends not only on a sense of style that is form and good writing but also on the creation of an atmosphere shall we say hypnotic in effect and capable of persuading the reader that he is a temporary inhabitant of the world the writer is describing however remote in time or space that world may be from the world of the reader s own experience And the more enlightened and culturally emotional the reader the greater the power of seduction is a writer called upon to exercise For it is obvious that all these hundreds of crude Arabian Nights tales and jungle tales and all sorts of tales of impossible adventure appearing in the pages of our periodicals would not be written if they were not in demand by the large public The question arises Why is it that authors who deal with the intimate realities of our dull everyday life are on the whole so much better as writers than those who attempt to portray the more glamorous existence of the East of the jungle of so to speak other worlds I have a theory of my own to offer in explanation and it is this A let us say is a writer who has stayed at home Let us suppose that his experience has been largely limited to London or still more precisely to the East End of London He has either lived or spent a great deal of time here and without having actively participated in the lives of the natives and denizens of the district has observed them to good purpose and saturated himself with their atmosphere He has in an intimate sense secured not only his scene but also either actually or potentially his characters English of a sort is the language of his community and the temper of this community except in petty externals is after all but little different from his own He has lost no time in either travelling or in learning another s language he has had a great deal of time for developing his technique He has indeed spent the greater part of his time in working out his form He is as you may guess anything but a superlative genius certainly we may venture to assume that he is at all events a fine talent a careful observer a painstaking worker possessed of inventive powers within limitations He knows his genre and his milieu and he knows his job He observes his people with an artistic sympathy He is an etcher loving his line rather than a photographer Vast mural decorations are beyond him Then there is B B is a traveller something of an adventurer too His wanderlust or possibly his occupation as a minor government official journalist or representative for some commercial firm has taken him East He has spent some time in Shanghai or Hong Kong in Calcutta or Rangoon in Tokyo or Nagasaki He has lived chiefly in the foreign quarter and occasionally sallied out to seek adventure in the native habitat He has secured a smattering of the native tongue and has even taken unto himself a temporary native wife A bold man he has in his way lived dangerously and intensely He has besides heard men of his own race living in the quarter tell weird tales of romantic nature perhaps of a white girl who came out East or of a native girl who had won the heart of an Englishman to his undoing At last B has had enough of it and has come home to the old country his England and sits down to his new job the exploitation of his knowledge and experience of the East Possibly a few friends who had listened to his tales urged him to set them down on paper and B who had not thought of it before thinks it is not such a bad idea and getting a supply of paper and a typewriter launches forth on a career as a writer He is intent on turning out a good tale and does remarkably well for a novice but his inexperience as a writer his lack of form and technique and deliberateness will hinder his progress though now and then he will turn out a tolerable tale by sheer accident The really great man will of course break through the double barrier and then you have a Conrad that is to say you have a man who has lived abundantly and has been able to apply an abundance of art to his abundance of material But that is indeed rare nowadays and the whole moral of the little parable of A and B is that in our own time it is given but to few men to do both The one has specialized in writing the other in living And the comparison may be applied of course to the two writers who have stayed at home even in the same district A hasn t much to say but what he says he says well because writing means to him something as a thing in itself he finds compensation in the quality of his writings for his lack of rich material the whole content of his art is in his form and that if not wholly satisfying is surely no mean achievement B on the other hand may have a great deal to say and says it badly He thinks his material will carry him through He does not understand that the function of art is to crystallize synthesize the materials at hand to distil the essences of life to formalize natural shapes There should be no confusing of nature and art A mountain is nature a pyramid is art We have no man in the short story today who has synthesized his age who has thrown a light on the peculiar many sided adventure of modernity who has achieved a sense of universality Maupassant came near to it in his own time Never before have men had such opportunities for knowing the world never before has it been so easy to cover space our means of communication have never been so rapid yet there is an almost maddening contradiction in the fact that every man who writes is content in describing but a single facet of the great adventure of life Our age is an age of specialization and many a man spends a life in trying to visualize for us a fragment of existence in multitudinous variations An Empire may be said to stand for a universalizing tendency yet the extraordinary fact about the mass of English stories today is that far from being expressive of any tendency to unity they are mostly concerned with presenting the specialized atmospheres of so many individual localities and vocations We have writers who do not go beyond Dartmoor or Park Lane or the East End of London we have writers of sea stories jungle stories detective stories lost jewel stories slum stories and we have writers who seldom stray from the cricket field or the prize ring or Freudian complexes Yet in putting on record these individual tendencies of the short story I should be overdrawing the picture if I did not call attention to what general tendencies are in the ascendent The supernatural element is prominent among these Stories of ghosts spiritualism and reincarnation are becoming increasingly popular with authors especially with the type I have described as A This is interesting since it evinces a healthy desire to get away from the banal facts of one s standardized atmosphere the atmosphere of suburbia It may be both a reaction and an escape and may express a desire for a more spiritual life than is vouchsafed us The love of adventure and the love of love will of course remain with us as long as men live and love a tale and nine tenths of the stories still deal with the favored hero and the inevitable girl This book is to be an annual venture and its object is the same as that of mister O Brien s annual selection of American stories It is to gather and save from obscurity every year those tales by English authors which are published in English and American periodicals and are worth preserving in permanent form It is well known that short story writers in Anglo Saxon countries have not the same chance of publishing their wares in book form as their more fortunate colleagues the novelists This prejudice against the publication of short stories in book form is not to be justified and it does not exist on the Continent Most of the fine fiction for example published in Russia since Chekhov made the form popular took precisely the form of the short story It is a good form and should be encouraged It is also the object of this volume to call attention to new writers who show promise and to help to create a demand for their work by publishing their efforts side by side with those already accepted and established It has been the custom to dedicate mister O Brien s annual selection of American stories to some author who has distinguished himself in the particular year by his valuable contribution to the art of the short story We propose to adopt it with regard to our English selections We are glad of the opportunity to associate this year s collection with the name of Stacy Aumonier As for the stories selected for this volume that is to some degree a matter of personal judgement it is quite possible that other editors would in some instances have made a different choice JOHN COURNOS An additional word may be added on the principles which have governed our choice We have set ourselves the task of disengaging the essential human qualities in our contemporary fiction which when chronicled conscientiously by our literary artists may fairly be called a criticism of life We are not at all interested in formulae and organised criticism at its best would be nothing more than dead criticism as all dogmatic interpretation of life is always dead What has interested us to the exclusion of other things is the fresh living current which flows through the best British and Irish work and the psychological and imaginative reality which writers have conferred upon it No substance is of importance in fiction unless it is organic substance that is to say substance in which the pulse of life is beating Inorganic fiction has been our curse in the past and bids fair to remain so unless we exercise much greater artistic discrimination than we display at present The present record covers the period from July nineteen twenty one to June nineteen twenty two inclusive During this period we have sought to select from the stories published in British and American periodicals those stories by British and Irish authors which have rendered life imaginatively in organic substance and artistic form Substance is something achieved by the artist in every act of creation rather than something already present and accordingly a fact or a group of facts in a story only attain substantial embodiment when the artist s power of compelling imaginative persuasion transforms them into a living truth The first test of a short story therefore in any qualitative analysis is to report upon how vitally compelling the writer makes his selected facts or incidents This test may be conveniently called the test of substance But a second test is necessary if the story is to take rank above other stories The true artist will seek to shape this living substance into the most beautiful and satisfying form by skillful selection and arrangement of his materials and by the most direct and appealing presentation of it in portrayal and characterization The short stories which we have examined in this study have fallen naturally into three groups The first consists of those stories which fail in our opinion to survive both the test of substance and the test of form These we have not chronicled The second group includes such narratives as may lay convincing claim to further consideration because each of them has survived in a measure both tests the test of substance and the test of form Stories included in this group are chronicled in the list which immediately follows the Roll of Honour Finally we have recorded the names of a smaller group of stories which possess we believe the distinction of uniting genuine substance and artistic form in a closely woven pattern with such sincerity that they are worthy of being reprinted If all of these stories were republished they would not occupy more space than six or seven novels of average length Our selection of them does not imply the critical belief that they are great stories A year which produced one great story would be an exceptional one It is simply to be taken as meaning that we have found the equivalent of six or seven volumes worthy of republication among all the stories published during the period under consideration These stories are listed in the special Roll of Honour In compiling these lists we have permitted no personal preference or prejudice to consciously influence our judgement The general and particular results of our study will be found explained and carefully detailed in the supplementary part of the volume mister Cournos has read the English periodicals and I have read the American periodicals We have then compared our judgements EDWARD J O BRIEN THE BEST BRITISH SHORT STORIES OF nineteen twenty two NOTE The order in which the stories in this volume are printed is not intended as an indication of their comparative excellence the arrangement is alphabetical by authors WHERE WAS WYCH STREET By STACY AUMONIER From The Strand Magazine and The Saturday Evening Post nineteen twenty one nineteen twenty two In the public bar of the Wagtail in Wapping four men and a woman were drinking beer and discussing diseases It was not a pretty subject and the company was certainly not a handsome one It was a dark November evening and the dingy lighting of the bar seemed but to emphasize the bleak exterior Drifts of fog and damp from without mingled with the smoke of shag The sanded floor was kicked into a muddy morass not unlike the surface of the pavement An old lady down the street had died from pneumonia the previous evening and the event supplied a fruitful topic of conversation The things that one could get Everywhere were germs eager to destroy one At any minute the symptoms might break out And so one foregathered in a cheerful spot amidst friends and drank forgetfulness Prominent in this little group was Baldwin Meadows a sallow faced villain with battered features and prominent cheek bones his face cut and scarred by a hundred fights Ex seaman ex boxer ex fish porter indeed to every one s knowledge ex everything No one knew how he lived By his side lurched an enormous coloured man who went by the name of Harry Jones Grinning above a tankard sat a pimply faced young man who was known as The Agent Silver rings adorned his fingers He had no other name and most emphatically no address but he arranged things for people and appeared to thrive upon it in a scrambling fugitive manner The other two people were mister and missus Dawes mister Dawes was an entirely negative person but missus Dawes shone by virtue of a high whining insistent voice keyed to within half a note of hysteria Then at one point the conversation suddenly took a peculiar turn It came about through missus Dawes mentioning that her aunt who died from eating tinned lobster used to work in a corset shop in Wych Street When she said that The Agent whose right eye appeared to survey the ceiling whilst his left eye looked over the other side of his tankard remarked Where was Wych Street ma Lord exclaimed missus Dawes Don t you know dearie You must be a young un you must Why when I was a gal every one knew Wych Street It was just down there where they built the Kingsway like Baldwin Meadows cleared his throat and said Wych Street used to be a turnin runnin from Long Acre into Wellington Street Oh no old boy chipped in mister Dawes who always treated the ex man with great deference If you ll excuse me Wych Street was a narrow lane at the back of the old Globe Theatre that used to pass by the church I know what I m talkin about growled Meadows missus Dawes s high nasal whine broke in Hi mister Booth you used ter know yer wye abaht Where was Wych Street mister Booth the proprietor was polishing a tap He looked up Wych Street Yus of course I knoo Wych Street Used to go there with some of the boys when I was Covent Garden way It was at right angles to the Strand just east of Wellington Street No it warn t It were alongside the Strand before yer come to Wellington Street The coloured man took no part in the discussion one street and one city being alike to him provided he could obtain the material comforts dear to his heart but the others carried it on with a certain amount of acerbity Before any agreement had been arrived at three other men entered the bar The quick eye of Meadows recognized them at once as three of what was known at that time as The Gallows Ring Every member of The Gallows Ring had done time but they still carried on a lucrative industry devoted to blackmail intimidation shoplifting and some of the clumsier recreations Their leader Ben Orming had served seven years for bashing a Chinaman down at Rotherhithe The Gallows Ring was not popular in Wapping for the reason that many of their depredations had been inflicted upon their own class When Meadows and Harry Jones took it into their heads to do a little wild prancing they took the trouble to go up into the West end They considered The Gallows Ring an ungentlemanly set nevertheless they always treated them with a certain external deference an unpleasant crowd to quarrel with Ben Orming ordered beer for the three of them and they leant against the bar and whispered in sullen accents Something had evidently miscarried with the Ring missus Dawes continued to whine above the general drone of the bar Suddenly she said Ben you re a hot old devil you are We was just aving a discussion like Where was Wych Street Ben scowled at her and she continued Some sez it was one place some sez it was another I know where it was cors my aunt what died from blood p ison after eatin tinned lobster used to work at a corset shop Yus barked Ben emphatically I know where Wych Street was it was just sarth of the river afore yer come to Waterloo Station It was then that the coloured man who up to that point had taken no part in the discussion thought fit to intervene Nope You s all wrong cap n Wych Street were alongside de church way over where the Strand takes a side line up west Ben turned on him fiercely What the blazes does a blanketty nigger know abaht it I ve told yer where Wych Street was Yus and I know where it was interposed Meadows Yer both wrong Wych Street was a turning running from Long Acre into Wellington Street I didn t ask yer what you thought growled Ben Well I suppose I ve a right to an opinion You always think you know everything you do You can just keep yer mouth shut It ud take more n you to shut it mister Booth thought it advisable at this juncture to bawl across the bar Now gentlemen no quarrelling please The affair might have been subsided at that point but for missus Dawes Her emotions over the death of the old lady in the street had been so stirred that she had been almost unconsciously drinking too much gin She suddenly screamed out Don t you take no lip from im mister Medders The dirty thieving devil e always thinks e s goin to come it over every one She stood up threateningly and one of Ben s supporters gave her a gentle push backwards In three minutes the bar was in a complete state of pandemonium The three members of The Gallows Ring fought two men and a woman for mister Dawes merely stood in a corner and screamed out Don t Don t missus Dawes stabbed the man who had pushed her through the wrist with a hatpin Meadows and Ben Orming closed on each other and fought savagely with the naked fists A lucky blow early in the encounter sent Meadows reeling against the wall with blood streaming down his temple Then the coloured man hurled a pewter tankard straight at Ben and it hit him on the knuckles The pain maddened him to a frenzy His other supporter had immediately got to grips with Harry Jones and picked up one of the high stools and seizing an opportunity brought it down crash on to the coloured man s skull The whole affair was a matter of minutes mister Booth was bawling out in the street A whistle sounded People were running in all directions Beat it Beat it for God s sake called the man who had been stabbed through the wrist His face was very white and he was obviously about to faint Ben and the other man whose name was Toller dashed to the door On the pavement there was a confused scramble Blows were struck indiscriminately Two policemen appeared One was laid hors de combat by a kick on the knee cap from Toller The two men fled into the darkness followed by a hue and cry Born and bred in the locality they took every advantage of their knowledge They tacked through alleys and raced down dark mews and clambered over walls Fortunately for them the people they passed who might have tripped them up or aided in the pursuit merely fled indoors The people in Wapping are not always on the side of the pursuer But the police held on At last Ben and Toller slipped through the door of an empty house in Aztec Street barely ten yards ahead of their nearest pursuer Blows rained on the door but they slipped the bolts and then fell panting to the floor When Ben could speak he said If they cop us it means swinging Was the nigger done in I think so But even if e wasn t there was that other affair the night before last The game s up The ground floor rooms were shuttered and bolted but they knew that the police would probably force the front door At the back there was no escape only a narrow stable yard where lanterns were already flashing The roof only extended thirty yards either way and the police would probably take possession of it They made a round of the house which was sketchily furnished There was a loaf a small piece of mutton and a bottle of pickles and the most precious possession three bottles of whisky Each man drank half a glass of neat whisky then Ben said We ll be able to keep em quiet for a bit anyway and he went and fetched an old twelve bore gun and a case of cartridges Toller was opposed to this last desperate resort but Ben continued to murmur It means swinging anyway And thus began the notorious siege of Aztec Street It lasted three days and four nights You may remember that on forcing a panel of the front door Sub Inspector Wraithe of the V Division was shot through the chest The police then tried other methods A hose was brought into play without effect Two policemen were killed and four wounded The military was requisitioned The street was picketed Snipers occupied windows of the houses opposite A distinguished member of the Cabinet drove down in a motor car and directed operations in a top hat It was the introduction of poison gas which was the ultimate cause of the downfall of the citadel The body of Ben Orming was never found but that of Toller was discovered near the front door with a bullet through his heart The medical officer to the Court pronounced that the man had been dead three days but whether killed by a chance bullet from a sniper or whether killed deliberately by his fellow criminal was never revealed For when the end came Orming had apparently planned a final act of venom It was known that in the basement a considerable quantity of petrol had been stored The contents had probably been carefully distributed over the most inflammable materials in the top rooms The fire broke out as one witness described it almost like an explosion Orming must have perished in this The roof blazed up and the sparks carried across the yard and started a stack of light timber in the annexe of Messrs Morrel s piano factory The factory and two blocks of tenement buildings were burnt to the ground The estimated cost of the destruction was one hundred and eighty thousand pounds The casualties amounted to seven killed and fifteen wounded At the inquiry held under Chief Justice Pengammon various odd interesting facts were revealed mister Lowes Parlby the brilliant young K C distinguished himself by his searching cross examination of many witnesses At one point a certain missus Dawes was put in the box Now said mister Lowes Parlby I understand that on the evening in question missus Dawes you and the victims and these other people who have been mentioned were all seated in the public bar of the Wagtail enjoying its no doubt excellent hospitality and indulging in a friendly discussion Is that so Yes sir Now will you tell his lordship what you were discussing Diseases sir Diseases And did the argument become acrimonious Pardon Was there a serious dispute about diseases No sir Well what was the subject of the dispute We was arguin as to where Wych Street was sir What s that said his lordship The witness states my lord that they were arguing as to where Wych Street was Wych Street Do you mean W Y C H Yes sir You mean the narrow old street that used to run across the site of what is now the Gaiety Theatre mister Lowes Parlby smiled in his most charming manner Yes my lord I believe the witness refers to the same street you mention though if I may be allowed to qualify your lordship s description of the locality may I suggest that it was a little further east at the side of the old Globe Theatre which was adjacent to saint Martin s in the Strand That is the street you were all arguing about isn t it missus Dawes Well sir my aunt who died from eating tinned lobster used to work at a corset shop I ought to know His lordship ignored the witness He turned to the counsel rather peevishly mister Lowes Parlby when I was your age I used to pass through Wych Street every day of my life I did so for nearly twelve years I think it hardly necessary for you to contradict me The counsel bowed It was not his place to dispute with a chief justice although that chief justice be a hopeless old fool but another eminent K C an elderly man with a tawny beard rose in the body of the court and said If I may be allowed to interpose your lordship I also spent a great deal of my youth passing through Wych Street I have gone into the matter comparing past and present ordnance survey maps If I am not mistaken the street the witness was referring to began near the hoarding at the entrance to Kingsway and ended at the back of what is now the Aldwych Theatre Oh no mister Backer exclaimed Lowes Parlby His lordship removed his glasses and snapped out The matter is entirely irrelevant to the case It certainly was but the brief passage of arms left an unpleasant tang of bitterness behind It was observed that mister Lowes Parlby never again quite got the prehensile grip upon his cross examination that he had shown in his treatment of the earlier witnesses The coloured man Harry Jones had died in hospital but mister Booth the proprietor of the Wagtail Baldwin Meadows mister Dawes and the man who was stabbed in the wrist all gave evidence of a rather nugatory character Lowes Parlby could do nothing with it The findings of this Special Inquiry do not concern us It is sufficient to say that the witnesses already mentioned all returned to Wapping The man who had received the thrust of a hatpin through his wrist did not think it advisable to take any action against missus Dawes He was pleasantly relieved to find that he was only required as a witness of an abortive discussion In a few weeks time the great Aztec Street siege remained only a romantic memory to the majority of Londoners To Lowes Parlby the little dispute with Chief Justice Pengammon rankled unreasonably It is annoying to be publicly snubbed for making a statement which you know to be absolutely true and which you have even taken pains to verify And Lowes Parlby was a young man accustomed to score He made a point of looking everything up of being prepared for an adversary thoroughly He liked to give the appearance of knowing everything The brilliant career just ahead of him at times dazzled him He was one of the darlings of the gods Everything came to Lowes Parlby His father had distinguished himself at the bar before him and had amassed a modest fortune He was an only son At Oxford he had carried off every possible degree He was already being spoken of for very high political honours But the most sparkling jewel in the crown of his successes was Lady Adela Charters the daughter of Lord Vermeer the Minister for Foreign Affairs She was his fiancee and it was considered the most brilliant match of the season She was young and almost pretty and Lord Vermeer was immensely wealthy and one of the most influential men in Great Britain Such a combination was irresistible There seemed to be nothing missing in the life of Francis Lowes Parlby K C One of the most regular and absorbed spectators at the Aztec Street inquiry was old Stephen Garrit Stephen Garrit held a unique but quite inconspicuous position in the legal world at that time He was a friend of judges a specialist at various abstruse legal rulings a man of remarkable memory and yet an amateur He had never taken sick never eaten the requisite dinners never passed an examination in his life but the law of evidence was meat and drink to him He passed his life in the Temple where he had chambers Some of the most eminent counsel in the world would take his opinion or come to him for advice He was very old very silent and very absorbed He attended every meeting of the Aztec Street inquiry but from beginning to end he never volunteered an opinion After the inquiry was over he went and visited an old friend at the London Survey Office He spent two mornings examining maps After that he spent two mornings pottering about the Strand Kingsway and Aldwych then he worked out some careful calculations on a ruled chart He entered the particulars in a little book which he kept for purposes of that kind and then retired to his chambers to study other matters But before doing so he entered a little apophthegm in another book It was apparently a book in which he intended to compile a summary of his legal experiences The sentence ran The basic trouble is that people make statements without sufficient data Old Stephen need not have appeared in this story at all except for the fact that he was present at the dinner at Lord Vermeer s where a rather deplorable incident occurred And you must acknowledge that in the circumstances it is useful to have such a valuable and efficient witness Lord Vermeer was a competent forceful man a little quick tempered and autocratic He came from Lancashire and before entering politics had made an enormous fortune out of borax artificial manure and starch It was a small dinner party with a motive behind it His principal guest was mister Sandeman the London agent of the Ameer of Bakkan Lord Vermeer was very anxious to impress mister Sandeman and to be very friendly with him the reasons will appear later mister Sandeman was a self confessed cosmopolitan He spoke seven languages and professed to be equally at home in any capital in Europe London had been his headquarters for over twenty years Lord Vermeer also invited mister Arthur Toombs a colleague in the Cabinet his prospective son in law Lowes Parlby K C James Trolley a very tame Socialist M P and Sir Henry and Lady Breyd the two latter being invited not because Sir Henry was of any use but because Lady Breyd was a pretty and brilliant woman who might amuse his principal guest The sixth guest was Stephen Garrit The dinner was a great success When the succession of courses eventually came to a stop and the ladies had retired Lord Vermeer conducted his male guests into another room for a ten minutes smoke before rejoining them It was then that the unfortunate incident occurred There was no love lost between Lowes Parlby and mister Sandeman It is difficult to ascribe the real reason of their mutual animosity but on the several occasions when they had met there had invariably passed a certain sardonic by play They were both clever both comparatively young each a little suspect and jealous of the other moreover it was said in some quarters that mister Sandeman had had intentions himself with regard to Lord Vermeer s daughter that he had been on the point of a proposal when Lowes Parlby had butted in and forestalled him mister Sandeman had dined well and he was in the mood to dazzle with a display of his varied knowledge and experiences The conversation drifted from a discussion of the rival claims of great cities to the slow inevitable removal of old landmarks There had been a slightly acrimonious disagreement between Lowes Parlby and mister Sandeman as to the claims of Budapest and Lisbon and mister Sandeman had scored because he extracted from his rival a confession that though he had spent two months in Budapest he had only spent two days in Lisbon mister Sandeman had lived for four years in either city Lowes Parlby changed the subject abruptly Talking of landmarks he said we had a queer point arise in that Aztec Street inquiry The original dispute arose owing to a discussion between a crowd of people in a pub as to where Wych Street was I remember said Lord Vermeer A perfectly absurd discussion Why I should have thought that any man over forty would remember exactly where it was Where would you say it was sir asked Lowes Parlby Why to be sure it ran from the corner of Chancery Lane and ended at the second turning after the Law Courts going west Lowes Parlby was about to reply when mister Sandeman cleared his throat and said in his supercilious oily voice Excuse me my lord I know my Paris and Vienna and Lisbon every brick and stone but I look upon London as my home I know my London even better I have a perfectly clear recollection of Wych Street When I was a student I used to visit there to buy books It ran parallel to New Oxford Street on the south side just between it and Lincoln s Inn Fields There was something about this assertion that infuriated Lowes Parlby In the first place it was so hopelessly wrong and so insufferably asserted In the second place he was already smarting under the indignity of being shown up about Lisbon And then there suddenly flashed through his mind the wretched incident when he had been publicly snubbed by Justice Pengammon about the very same point and he knew that he was right each time Damn Wych Street He turned on mister Sandeman Oh nonsense You may know something about these eastern cities you certainly know nothing about London if you make a statement like that Wych Street was a little further east of what is now the Gaiety Theatre It used to run by the side of the old Globe Theatre parallel to the Strand The dark moustache of mister Sandeman shot upwards revealing a narrow line of yellow teeth He uttered a sound that was a mingling of contempt and derision then he drawled out Really How wonderful to have such comprehensive knowledge He laughed and his small eyes fixed his rival Lowes Parlby flushed a deep red He gulped down half a glass of port and muttered just above a whisper Damned impudence Then in the rudest manner he could display he turned his back deliberately on Sandeman and walked out of the room In the company of Adela he tried to forget the little contretemps The whole thing was so absurd so utterly undignified As though he didn t know It was the little accumulation of pin pricks all arising out of that one argument The result had suddenly goaded him to well being rude to say the least of it It wasn t that Sandeman mattered To the devil with Sandeman But what would his future father in law think He had never before given way to any show of ill temper before him He forced himself into a mood of rather fatuous jocularity Adela was at her best in those moods They would have lots of fun together in the days to come Her almost pretty not too clever face was dimpled with kittenish glee Life was a tremendous rag to her They were expecting Toccata the famous opera singer She had been engaged at a very high fee to come on from Covent Garden mister Sandeman was very fond of music Adela was laughing and discussing which was the most honourable position for the great Sandeman to occupy There came to Lowes Parlby a sudden abrupt misgiving What sort of wife would this be to him when they were not just fooling He immediately dismissed the curious furtive little stab of doubt The splendid proportions of the room calmed his senses A huge bowl of dark red roses quickened his perceptions His career The door opened But it was not La Toccata It was one of the household flunkies Lowes Parlby turned again to his inamorata Excuse me sir His lordship says will you kindly go and see him in the library Lowes Parlby regarded the messenger and his heart beat quickly An uncontrollable presage of evil racked his nerve centres Something had gone wrong and yet the whole thing was so absurd trivial In a crisis well he could always apologize He smiled confidently at Adela and said Why of course with pleasure Please excuse me dear He followed the impressive servant out of the room His foot had barely touched the carpet of the library when he realized that his worst apprehensions were to be plumbed to the depths For a moment he thought Lord Vermeer was alone then he observed old Stephen Garrit lying in an easy chair in the corner like a piece of crumpled parchment Lord Vermeer did not beat about the bush When the door was closed he bawled out savagely What the devil have you done Excuse me sir I m afraid I don t understand Is it Sandeman Sandeman has gone Oh I m sorry Sorry By God I should think you might be sorry You insulted him My prospective son in law insulted him in my own house I m awfully sorry I didn t realize Realize Sit down and don t assume for one moment that you continue to be my prospective son in law Your insult was a most intolerable piece of effrontery not only to him but to me But I Listen to me Do you know that the government were on the verge of concluding a most far reaching treaty with that man Do you know that the position was just touch and go The concessions we were prepared to make would have cost the State thirty million pounds and it would have been cheap Do you hear that It would have been cheap Bakkan is one of the most vulnerable outposts of the Empire It is a terrible danger zone If certain powers can usurp our authority and mark you the whole blamed place is already riddled with this new pernicious doctrine you know what I mean before we know where we are the whole East will be in a blaze India My God This contract we were negotiating would have countered this outward thrust And you you blockhead you come here and insult the man upon whose word the whole thing depends I really can t see sir how I should know all this You can t see it But you fool you seemed to go out of your way You insulted him about the merest quibble in my house He said he knew where Wych Street was He was quite wrong I corrected him Wych Street Wych Street be damned If he said Wych Street was in the moon you should have agreed with him There was no call to act in the way you did And you you think of going into politics The somewhat cynical inference of this remark went unnoticed Lowes Parlby was too unnerved He mumbled I m very sorry I don t want your sorrow I want something more practical What s that sir You will drive straight to mister Sandeman s find him and apologize Tell him you find that he was right about Wych Street after all If you can t find him to night you must find him to morrow morning I give you till midday to morrow If by that time you have not offered a handsome apology to mister Sandeman you do not enter this house again you do not see my daughter again Moreover all the power I possess will be devoted to hounding you out of that profession you have dishonoured Now you can go Dazed and shaken Lowes Parlby drove back to his flat at Knightsbridge Before acting he must have time to think Lord Vermeer had given him till to morrow midday Any apologizing that was done should be done after a night s reflection The fundamental purposes of his being were to be tested He knew that He was at a great crossing Some deep instinct within him was grossly outraged Is it that a point comes when success demands that a man shall sell his soul It was all so absurdly trivial a mere argument about the position of a street that had ceased to exist As Lord Vermeer said what did it matter about Wych Street Of course he should apologize It would hurt horribly to do so but would a man sacrifice everything on account of some footling argument about a street In his own rooms Lowes Parlby put on a dressing gown and lighting a pipe he sat before the fire He would have given anything for companionship at such a moment the right companionship How lovely it would be to have a woman just the right woman to talk this all over with some one who understood and sympathized A sudden vision came to him of Adela s face grinning about the prospective visit of La Toccata and again the low voice of misgiving whispered in his ears Would Adela be just the right woman In very truth did he really love Adela Or was it all a rag Was life a rag a game played by lawyers politicians and people The fire burned low but still he continued to sit thinking his mind principally occupied with the dazzling visions of the future It was past midnight when he suddenly muttered a low Damn and walked to the bureau He took up a pen and wrote Dear mister Sandeman I must apologize for acting so rudely to you last night It was quite unpardonable of me especially as I since find on going into the matter that you were quite right about the position of Wych Street I can t think how I made the mistake Please forgive me Yours cordially FRANCIS LOWES PARLBY Having written this he sighed and went to bed One might have imagined at that point that the matter was finished But there are certain little greedy demons of conscience that require a lot of stilling and they kept Lowes Parlby awake more than half the night He kept on repeating to himself It s all positively absurd But the little greedy demons pranced around the bed and they began to group things into two definite issues On the one side the great appearances on the other something at the back of it all something deep fundamental something that could only be expressed by one word truth If he had really loved Adela if he weren t so absolutely certain that Sandeman was wrong and he was right why should he have to say that Wych Street was where it wasn t Isn t there after all said one of the little demons something which makes for greater happiness than success Confess this and we ll let you sleep Perhaps that is one of the most potent weapons the little demons possess However full our lives may be we ever long for moments of tranquillity And conscience holds before our eyes some mirror of an ultimate tranquillity Lowes Parlby was certainly not himself The gay debonair and brilliant egoist was tortured and tortured almost beyond control and it had all apparently risen through the ridiculous discussion about a street At a quarter past three in the morning he arose from his bed with a groan and going into the other room he tore the letter to mister Sandeman to pieces Three weeks later old Stephen Garrit was lunching with the Lord Chief Justice They were old friends and they never found it incumbent to be very conversational The lunch was an excellent but frugal meal They both ate slowly and thoughtfully and their drink was water It was not till they reached the dessert stage that his lordship indulged in any very informative comment and then he recounted to Stephen the details of a recent case in which he considered that the presiding judge had by an unprecedented paralogy misinterpreted the law of evidence Stephen listened with absorbed attention He took two cob nuts from the silver dish and turned them over meditatively without cracking them When his lordship had completely stated his opinion and peeled a pear Stephen mumbled I have been impressed very impressed indeed Even in my own field of limited observation the opinion of an outsider you may say so often it happens the trouble caused by an affirmation without sufficiently established data I have seen lives lost ruin brought about endless suffering Only last week a young man a brilliant career almost shattered People make statements without He put the nuts back on the dish and then in an apparently irrelevant manner he said abruptly Do you remember Wych Street my lord The Lord Chief justice grunted Wych Street Of course I do Where would you say it was my lord Why here of course His lordship took a pencil from his pocket and sketched a plan on the tablecloth It used to run from there to here Stephen adjusted his glasses and carefully examined the plan He took a long time to do this and when he had finished his hand instinctively went towards a breast pocket where he kept a note book with little squared pages Then he stopped and sighed After all why argue with the law The law was like that an excellent thing not infallible of course even the plan of the Lord Chief justice was a quarter of a mile out but still an excellent a wonderful thing He examined the bony knuckles of his hands and yawned slightly Do you remember it said the Lord Chief justice Stephen nodded sagely and his voice seemed to come from a long way off Yes I remember it my lord It was a melancholy little street THE LOOKING GLASS By J D BERESFORD From The Cornhill Magazine nineteen twenty one nineteen twenty two This was the first communication that had come from her aunt in Rachel s lifetime I think your aunt has forgiven me at last her father said as he passed the letter across the table Rachel looked first at the signature It seemed strange to see her own name there It was as if her individuality her very identity was impugned by the fact that there should be two Rachel Deanes Moreover there was a likeness between her aunt s autograph and her own a characteristic turn in the looping of the letters a hint of the same decisiveness and precision If Rachel had been educated fifty years earlier she might have written her name in just that manner You re very like her in some ways her father said as she still stared at the signature Rachel s eyelids drooped and her expression indicated a faint suppressed intolerance of her father s remark He said the same things so often and in so precisely the same tone that she had formed a habit of automatically rejecting the truth of certain of his statements He had always appeared to her as senile He had been over fifty when she was born and ever since she could remember she had doubted the correctness of his information She was she had often told herself a born sceptic an ultra modern She had a certain veneration for the more distant past but none for her father s period Victorianism was to her a term of abuse She had long since condemned alike the ethic and the aesthetic of the nineteenth century as represented by her father s opinions so that even now when his familiar comment coincided so queerly with her own thought she instinctively disbelieved him Yet as always she was gentle in her answer She condescended from the heights of her youth and vigour to pity him I should think you must almost have forgotten what Aunt Rachel was like dear she said How many years is it since you ve seen her More than forty more than forty her father said ruminating profoundly We disagreed we invariably disagreed Rachel always prided herself on being so modern She read Huxley and Darwin and things like that Altogether beyond me I admit Still it seems to me that the old truths have endured and will in spite of all in spite of all Rachel straightened her shoulders and lifted her head there was disdain in her face but none in her voice as she replied And so it seems that she wants to see me She was excited at the thought of meeting this traditional this almost mythical aunt whom she had so often heard about Sometimes she had wondered if the personality of this remarkable relative had not been a figment of her father s imagination long pondered and reconstructed out of half forgotten material But this letter of hers that now lay on the breakfast table was admirable in character There was something of condescension and intolerance expressed in the very restraint of its tone She had written a kindly letter but the kindliness had an air of pity It was all consistent enough with what her father had told her mister Deane came out of his reminiscences with a sigh Yes yes she wants to see you my dear he said I think you had better accept this invitation to stay with her She she is rich almost wealthy and I as you know have practically nothing to leave you practically nothing If she took a fancy to you He sighed again and Rachel knew that for the hundredth time he was regretting his own past weakness He had been so foolish in money matters frittering away his once considerable capital in aimless speculations He and his sister had shared equally under their father s will but while he had been at last compelled to sink the greater part of what was left to him in an annuity she had probably increased her original inheritance I ll certainly go if you can spare me for a whole fortnight Rachel said I m all curiosity to see this remarkable aunt By the way how old is she There were only fifteen months between us mister Deane said so she must be dear me yes she must be seventy three Dear dear Fancy Rachel being seventy three I always think of her as being about your age It seems so absurd to think of her as old He continued his reflections but Rachel was not listening He was asking for the understanding of the young quite unaware of his senility reaching out over half a century to try to touch the comprehension and sympathy of his daughter But she was already bent on her own adventure looking forward eagerly to a visit to London that promised delights other than the inspection of the mysterious traditional aunt whom she had so long known by report For this invitation had come very aptly Rachel pondered that later in the morning with a glow of ecstatic resignation to her charming fate She found the guiding hand of a romantic inevitability in the fact that she and Adrian Flemming were to meet so soon It had seemed so unlikely that they would see each other again for many months They had only met three times but they knew although their friendship had been too green for either of them to admit the knowledge before he had gone back to town He had indeed hinted far more in his two letters than he had ever dared to say He was sensitive he lacked self confidence but Rachel adored him for just those failings she criticised so hardly in her father She took out her letters and re read them thrilling with the realisation that in her answer she would have such a perfectly amazing surprise for him She would refer to it quite casually somewhere near the end She would write By the way it s just possible that we may meet again before long as I am going to stay with my aunt Miss Deane in Tavistock Square He would understand all that lay behind such an apparently careless reference for she had told him that she never went to London had only once in her life ever been there She was in her own room and she stood now before the cheval glass and studied herself raising her chin and slightly pursing her lips staring superciliously at her own image under half lowered eyelids Candidly she admired herself but she could not help that assumption of a disdainful criticism It seemed to give her confidence in her own integrity hiding that annoying shadow of doubt which sometimes fell upon her when she caught sight of her reflection by chance and unexpectedly But no thought of doubt flawed her satisfaction this morning A sense of power came to her a tranquil realisation that she could charm Adrian as she would With a graceful habitual gesture she put up her hand and lightly touched her cheek with a soft caressing movement of her finger tips II The elderly parlour maid showed Rachel straight to her bedroom when she arrived at Tavistock Square indicating on the way the extensive looking first floor drawing room in which tea and her first sight of the wonderful aunt would await Rachel in half an hour She had been eager and excited The air and promise of London had thrilled her but she found some influence in the atmosphere of the big house that was vaguely repellent almost sinister Her bedroom was expensively furnished and beautifully kept some of the pieces were she supposed genuine antiques perhaps immensely valuable But how could she ever feel at home there She was hampered by the necessity for moving circumspectly among this aged delicate stuff so wonderfully preserved and yet surely fragile and decrepit at the heart That spindling escritoire for instance and that mincing Louis Quinze settee ought to be taking their well earned leisure in some museum It would be indecent to write at the one or sit on the other They were relics of the past foolishly pretending an ability for service when their life had been sapped by dry rot and their original functions outlived Well if ever I have a house of my own Rachel thought regarding these ancient splendours I ll furnish it with something I shan t be afraid of With a gesture of dismissal she turned and looked out of the window From the square came the sounds of a motor drawing up at a neighbouring house she heard the throbbing of the engine the slam of the door and then the strong sonorous tones of a man s voice That was her proper milieu she reflected among the strong vital things Even after twenty minutes in that bedroom she had begun to feel enervated as if she herself were also beginning to suffer from dry rot She was anxious and uneasy as she went slowly downstairs to the drawing room Her anticipations of this meeting with her intimidating wealthy aunt had changed within the last half hour Her first idea of Miss Deane had been of a robust stout woman frank in her speech and inclined to be very critical of the newly found niece whom she had chosen to inspect Now she was prepared rather to expect a fragile rather querulous old lady older even than her years an aunt to be talked to in a lowered voice and treated with the same delicate care that must be extended to her furniture Rachel paused with her hand on the drawing room door and sighed at the thought of all the repressions and nervous strains that this visit might have in store for her She entered the room almost on tiptoe and then stood stock still suddenly shocked and bewildered with surprise Whatever she had expected it was not this For a moment she was unable to believe that the sprightly painted and bedizened figure before her could possibly be that of her aunt Her head was crowned with an exuberant brown wig her heavy eyebrows were grotesquely blackened her hollow cheeks stiff with powder her lips brightened to a fantastic scarlet And she was posed there standing before the tea table with her head a little back looking at her niece with a tolerant condescension with the air of a superb young beauty self conscious and proud of her charms Hm So you re my semi mythical niece she said putting up her lorgnette I m glad at any rate to find that you re not after all a fabulous creature She spoke in a high rather thin voice that produced an effect of effort as if she were playing on the top octave of a flute Rachel had never in her life felt so gauche and awkward Yes I you know aunt I had begun to wonder if you were not fabulous too she tried desperately anxious to seem at ease She was afraid to look at that to her grotesque figure afraid to show by some unconscious reflex her dislike for its ugliness As she took the bony ring bedecked hand that was held out to her she kept her eyes away from her aunt s face Miss Deane however would not permit that evasion Hold your head up my dear I want to look at you she said and when Rachel reluctantly obeyed continued Yes you re more like my father than your own which means that you re like me for I took after him too so every one said Rachel drew in her breath with a little gasp Was it possible that her aunt could imagine for one instant that there was any likeness between them Our our names are the same she said nervously Miss Deane nodded There s more in it than that she said with a touch of complacence and there s no reason why there shouldn t be It s good Mendelism that you should take after an aunt rather than either of your parents And you really think that we are alike Rachel asked feebly looking in vain for any sign of a quizzical humour in her aunt s face Miss Deane looked down under her half lowered eyelids with a proud air of tolerance Ah well a little without doubt she said as though the advantages of the difference were on her own side Now sit down and have your tea my dear Rachel obeyed with a vague wonder in her mind as to why that look of tolerance should be so familiar It seemed to her as if it was something she had felt rather than seen and as tea progressed she found herself half furtively studying the raddled ugliness of her aunt s face in the search for possible relics of a beautiful youth Ah I think you re beginning to see it too Miss Deane said marking her niece s scrutiny It grows on one doesn t it Rachel shivered slightly Yes it does she said experimentally watching her aunt s face for some indication of a malicious teasing humour It seemed to her so incredible that this hideous parody of her own youth could honestly believe that any physical likeness still existed Miss Deane however was faintly simpering I have been told that I ve changed very little she said and Rachel suppressed a sigh of impatience at the reflection that she was expected to play up to this absurd fantasy Of course I can t judge of that she said as we met for the first time five minutes ago No no you can t judge of that her aunt replied with the half bashful emphasis of one who awaits a compliment Rachel decided to plunge But you do look extraordinarily young for your age still she lied desperately Miss Deane straightened her back and toyed with a teaspoon I have always taken great care of myself she said Unquestionably she believed it Rachel decided This was no pose but a horrible piece of self deception This raddled repulsive creature had actually persuaded herself into the delusion that she still had the appearance of a young girl Heaven help her if that delusion were ever shattered Yet outside this one obsession Miss Deane as Rachel soon discovered had a clear and well balanced mind For now that she had received her desired assurance from this new quarter she began to talk of other things Her boasted modernism it is true had a smack of the stiff broadcloth savour of the eighties but she had a point of view that coincided far more nearly with Rachel s own than did that of her father Her aunt at least had outlived the worst superstitions and inanities of the mid Victorians Indeed by the time tea was finished Rachel s spirits were beginning to revive She would have to be very careful in her treatment of her aunt but on the whole it would not perhaps be so bad and presently she would see Adrian again She would almost certainly get a letter from him by the last post making some appointment to meet her and after that she would introduce him to Miss Deane She had a feeling that Miss Deane would not raise any objection that she might even welcome the visit of a young man to her house The time was passing so easily that Rachel was surprised when she heard the gong sound Does that mean it s time to dress already she asked Miss Deane nodded You ve an hour before dinner she said but I ll go up now I like to be leisurely over my toilet She rose as she spoke but as she crossed the room she paused with what seemed to be a little jerk of surprise as she caught sight of her own reflection in a tall mirror above one of the gilt legged console tables against the wall Then she deliberately stopped turned and surveyed herself half contemptuously under lowered eyelids with a set of her head and back that belied plainly enough the pout of her critical lips And having admired that haggard image she lifted her wasted hand and delicately touched her whitened hollow cheeks with the tips of her heavily jewelled fingers Rachel stared in horror It seemed to her just then as if the reflection of her aunt in the mirror was indeed that of herself grown instantly and mysteriously old For now whether because the reversal of the image by the mirror or because of that perfect duplication of her own characteristic pose and gesture the likeness had flashed out clear and unmistakable She saw that her father had been right Once incalculable ages ago this repulsive old woman might have been very like herself She slipped quickly out of the room and ran upstairs She felt that she must instantly put that question to the test search herself for the signs of coming age as she had so recently searched her aunt s face for the indications of her former youth But when with an effect of challenge she scrutinised her reflection in the tall cheval glass the likeness appeared to have vanished She saw her head thrust a little forward her arms stiff and in her whole pose an air of vigorous defiance She was prepared to admit that she was ugly at that moment if the ugliness was of another kind than that she had seen downstairs No She drew herself up more than a little relieved by the result of her test The likeness was all a fancy the result of suggestions first by her father and then by Miss Deane herself And she need at least have no fear that she was ugly Why She paused suddenly and the light died out of her face Her image was looking back at her stiffly superciliously with so it seemed to her the contemptible simper of one who still fatuously admires the thing that has long since lost its charm She caught her breath and clenched her hands drawing down her rather heavy eyebrows in an expression of angry scorn Oh never never never again will I look at myself like that Rachel vowed fiercely She was to find however before this first evening was over that the mere avoidance of that one pose before the mirror would not suffice to lay the ghost of the suspicion that was beginning to haunt her At the very outset a new version of the likeness was presented to her when during the first course of dinner Miss Deane with a lowering frown of her blackened eyebrows found occasion to reprimand the elderly parlour maid For a moment Rachel was again puzzled by the intriguing sense of the familiar before she remembered her own scowl at the looking glass an hour before Do I really frown like that she thought And on the instant found herself feeling like her aunt That indeed was the horror that despite every effort of resistance deepened steadily as the evening wore on Miss Deane had without question lost every trace of her beauty but her character her spirit was unchanged and it was so Rachel increasingly believed the very spit and replica of her own They had the same characteristic gestures and expressions the look of kindly tolerance with which her aunt regarded Rachel was precisely the same as that with which Rachel regarded her father When her aunt s voice dropped in speaking from the rather shrill strained tone that was obviously not natural to her Rachel heard the inflexions of her own voice And as her knowledge of Miss Deane grew so also did that haunting unpleasant feeling of looking and speaking in precisely the same manner It seemed to her as if she were being invaded by an alien personality as if the character she had known and cherished all her life were no longer her own but merely a casual inheritance from some unknown ancestor Her very integrity was threatened by her consciousness of that likeness her pride of individuality She was not after all a unique personality but merely another version if she were even that of a Miss Rachel Deane born in the middle of the previous century Moreover with that growing recognition of likeness in character there came the thought that she in time might look even as her aunt looked at this present moment She also would lose her beauty until no facial resemblance could be traced between the hag she was and the beauty she had once been For through all her torment Rachel proudly clung to the certainty that physically at least there was no sort of likeness between her aunt and herself Miss Deane s belief in that matter however was soon proved to be otherwise for when they were alone together in the drawing room after dinner and the topic so inevitably present to both their minds came to the surface of conversation she unexpectedly said But we re evidently the poles apart in character and manner my dear Oh do you think so Rachel exclaimed I it s a queer thing to say perhaps but I curiously feel like you aunt when you speak sometimes and and when I watch the way you do things Miss Deane shook her head I admit the physical resemblance she said otherwise my dear we are utterly different Did she too Rachel wondered resent the aspersion of her integrity By the last post Rachel received her expected letter from Adrian Flemming Her aunt separated it from the others brought in by her maid and passed it across to her niece with a slight hint of displeasure in her face Miss Rachel Deane junior she said Really it hadn t occurred to me how difficult it will be to distinguish our letters I hope my friends won t take to addressing me as Miss Deane senior Properly of course I am Miss Deane and you Miss Rachel but I ll admit there s sure to be some confusion Now my dear I expect you re tired You d better run up to bed Rachel was willing enough to go She was glad to have an opportunity to read her letter in solitude she was even more glad to get away from the company of this living echo of herself I believe I should go mad if I had to live with her she reflected I should get into the way of copying her I should begin to grow old before my time When she reached her bedroom she put down her letter unopened on the toilet table and once more stared searchingly at her own reflection in the mirror Was there any least trace of a physical likeness she asked herself and began in imagination to follow the possible stages of the change that time would inevitably work upon her She shrugged her shoulders If there were indeed any sort of facial resemblance between herself and her aunt no one would ever see it except in Miss Deane and she was obsessed with a senile vanity Yet was it after all Rachel began to wonder an unnatural obsession Might she not in time suffer from it herself The change would be so slow so infinitely gradual and always one would be cherishing the old loved image of youth and beauty falling in love with it like a deluded Hyacinth and coming to be deceived by the fantasy of an unchanging appearance of youth Looking always for the desired thing she would suffer from the hallucination that the thing existed in fact and imagine that the only artifice needed to perfect the illusion was a touch of paint and powder No doubt her aunt perhaps searching her own image in the mirror at this moment saw not herself but a picture of her niece She was hypnotised by the suggestion of a pose and the desire of her own mind In time Rachel herself might also become the victim of a similar illusion Oh it was horrible With a shudder she picked up her letter and turned away from the looking glass She would forget that ghastly warning in the thought of the joys proper to her youth She would think of Adrian and of her next meeting with him She opened her letter to find that he had rather timorously suggested that she should meet him the next afternoon at the Marble Arch at three o clock if he heard nothing from her in the meantime For a few minutes she lost herself in delighted anticipation and then slowly insidiously a new speculation crept into her mind What would be the effect upon Adrian if he saw her and her aunt together Would he recognise the likeness and anticipating the movement of more than half a century see her in one amazing moment as she would presently become And in any case what a terrible train of suggestion might not be started in his mind by the impression left upon him by the old woman Once he had seen Miss Deane Rachel s every gesture would serve to remind him of that repulsive image of raddled deluded age It might well be that in time he would come to see Rachel as she would presently be rather than as she was It would be a hideous reversal of the old romance instead of seeing the girl in the old woman he would foresee the harridan in the girl That picture presented itself to Rachel with a quite appalling effect of conviction She suddenly remembered a case she had known that had remarkable points of resemblance the case of a rather pretty girl with an unpleasant younger brother who so she had heard it said put men off his sister because of the facial likeness between them She was pretty and he was ugly but they were unmistakably brother and sister Oh it would be nothing less than folly to let Adrian and her aunt meet Rachel decided In imagination she could follow the process of his growing dismay she could see his puzzled stare as he watched Miss Deane and struggled to fix that tantalising suggestion of likeness to some one he knew his flash of illumination as he solved the puzzle and turned with that gentle winning smile of his to herself and then the progress of his disillusionment as day by day he realised more plainly the intriguing similarities of expression and gesture until he felt that he was making love to the spirit of an aged spinster temporarily disguised behind the appearance of beauty III Rachel had believed on the first night of her arrival in Tavistock Square that so far as her love affair was concerned she would be able to avoid all danger by keeping her lover and her aunt unknown to each other She very soon found however that the spell Miss Deane seemed to have put upon her was not to be laid by any effect of mere distance She and Adrian met rather shyly at their first appointment Both of them were a little conscious of having been overbold one for having suggested and the other for having agreed to so significant an assignation And for the first few minutes their talk was nothing but a quick nervous reminiscence of their earlier meetings They had to recover the lost ground on which they had parted before they could go on to any more intimate knowledge of each other But for some reason she had not yet realised Rachel found it very difficult to recover that lost ground She knew that she was being unnecessarily distant and cold and though she inwardly accused herself of putting on absurd airs her manner as she was uncomfortably aware remained at once stilted and detached I suppose it s because I m self conscious before all these people she thought and indeed Hyde Park was very full that afternoon And it was Adrian who first a little desperately tried to reach across the barrier that was dividing them You re different rather in town he began shyly Is it the effect of your aunt s grandeurs Am I different I feel exactly the same Rachel replied mechanically You didn t think it was rather impudent of me to ask you to meet me here did you he went on anxiously She shook her head emphatically Oh no it wasn t that she said But then you admit that it was something he pleaded The people perhaps she admitted I I feel so exposed to the public view We might walk across the Park if you preferred it he suggested and have tea at that place in Kensington Gardens It would be quieter there She agreed to that willingly She wanted to be alone with him The crowd made her nervous and self conscious this afternoon Always before she had delighted in moving among a crowd appreciating and enjoying the casual glances of admiration she received Today she was afraid of being noticed She had a queer feeling that these smart clever people in the Park might see through her if they stared too closely Just what they would discover she did not know but she suffered a disquieting qualm of uneasiness whenever she saw any one observing her with attention They cut across the grass and leaving the Serpentine on their left found two chairs in a quiet spot under the trees Here at least they were quite unwatched but still Rachel found it impossible to regain the relations that had existed between her and Adrian when they had parted a month earlier And Adrian too it seemed was staring at her with a new inquisitive scrutiny Why do you look at me like that she broke out at last Do you notice any difference in me or what You you ve been staring so Difference he repeated Well I told you just now didn t I that you were different this afternoon Yes but in what way she asked Do I do I look different He paused a little judiciously over his answer N no he hesitated There s something though Don t be offended will you if I say that you don t seem to be quite yourself to day not quite natural I miss a rather characteristic expression of yours You ve never once looked at me with that rather tolerating air you used to put on It was a horrid air she said sharply I ve made up my mind to cure myself of it Oh no don t he protested It wasn t at all horrid It was don t think I m trying to pay you a compliment it was well charming I ve missed it dreadfully She turned and looked at him determined to try an experiment This sort of air do you mean she asked and with a sickening sensation of presenting the very gestures and appearance of her aunt she regarded him under lowered eyelids with an expression of faintly supercilious approval His smile at once thanked and answered her But it s an abominable look she exclaimed The look of an old old painted woman vain ridiculous He stared at her in amazement How absurd he protested Why it s you and you re certainly not old or painted nor unduly vain and no one could say you were ridiculous And you want me to look like that she asked It s it s so you he said shyly But just suppose she cried that I went on looking like that after I d grown old and ugly Think how hateful it would be to see a hideous old woman posturing and pretending and making eyes And you see if one gets a habit it s so hard to get rid of it Think of me at seventy all painted and powdered trying to seem as if I hadn t altered and really believing that I hadn t He laughed that pleasant kind laugh of his which had been one of the first things in him that had so attracted her Oh I ll chance the future he said Besides if if it could ever happen that that your growing old came to me gradually that I should be seeing you every day I mean I shouldn t notice it I should be old too and I should think you hadn t altered either He was afraid as yet to be too plain spoken but his tone made it quite clear that he asked for no greater happiness than that of seeing her grow old beside him She did not pretend to misunderstand him Would you Perhaps you would she said But all the same I don t think you need insist on that particular pose He passed that by too eager at the moment to claim the concession she had offered him Is there any hope that I may be allowed to to watch you growing old he asked Perhaps if you ll let me do it in my own way Rachel said Adrian shyly took her hand You mean that you will that you don t mind He put the question as if he had no doubt of its intelligibility to her She nodded When did you begin to know he asked awed by the wonder of this stupendous thing that had happened to him From the beginning I think Rachel murmured So did I from the very beginning he agreed and from that they dropped into sacred reminiscences and comparisons concerning the innumerable things they had adoringly seen in each other and had had as yet no opportunity to glory in And in the midst of all these new and bewildering embarrassing delightful revelations and discoveries Rachel completely forgot the shadow that was haunting her forgot how she looked or felt or acted forgot that there was or had ever been a terrible old woman who lived in Tavistock Square and whose hold on life was maintained by her horrible mimicry of youth And then in a moment she was lifted out of her dream and cruelly set down on the hard unsympathetic earth by the sound of her lover s voice I suppose I ll have to meet your aunt he was saying Shall we go back there now and tell her Rachel flushed as if he had suggested some startling invasion of her secret life Oh no she ejaculated impulsively Adrian looked his surprise But why not he asked I m I m a perfectly respectable eligible party I wasn t thinking of that Rachel said Is she a terrible dragon he inquired with a smile Rachel shook her head rejecting the excuse offered in favour of a more probable modification She s odd rather She might prefer my giving her some kind of notice she said He accepted that without hesitation Will you warn her then he replied And I ll come and do my duty to morrow I understand she s a lady to be propitiated Not to morrow Rachel said The irk and disgust of it all had returned to her with renewed force at the first mention of her aunt s name The thought of Miss Deane had revived the repulsive sense of acting speaking looking like that aged caricature of herself Yet she wanted strangely enough to get back to Tavistock Square for only there it seemed to her was she safe from the examination of an inquisitive stare that might at any moment penetrate her secret and reveal her as a posturing hag masquerading in the alluring freshness of a young girl I ought to be going back to her now she said But you promised that we should have tea together Adrian remonstrated Yes I know but please don t pester me I ll see you again to morrow Rachel returned with a touch of elderly hauteur And despite all his entreaties she would not be persuaded to change her mind Already he was looking at her with a touch of suspicion she thought and as she checked his remonstrances she was aware of doing it with the air the tone the very look that were her inheritance from endless generations of precisely similar ancestors IV If she could but have lived a double life Rachel thought her present position might have been endurable and then in a few months or even weeks the problem would be solved for ever by her marriage with Adrian and the final obliteration of Miss Deane from her memory But she could not live a double life Day by day as her intimacy with her aunt increased Rachel found it more difficult to forget her when she was away from Tavistock Square In the deepest and most beautiful moments of her intercourse with Adrian she was aware now of practising upon him a subtle deception of pretending that she was other than she was in reality an awareness that was constantly pricked and stimulated by the continually growing consciousness of her likeness to Miss Deane Miss Deane on her part evidently took a great pleasure in her niece s society The fortnight of her original invitation had already been exceeded but she would not hear of Rachel s return to Devonshire Why should you go back she demanded scornfully Your father doesn t want you Richard is one of those slip shod people who prefer to live alone I used to try to stir him up and he ran away from me He ll run away from you my dear in a few years time He hasn t the courage to stand up to women like us Miss Deane unquestionably wanted her niece to stay with her She was even beginning to hint at the desirability of making the present arrangement a permanent one Rachel however was not flattered by this display of pleasure in her society She knew that it was due to no individual charm of her own but to the fact that she had become her aunt s mirror For Miss Deane no longer in Rachel s presence at least gazed at herself in the looking glass she gazed at her niece instead And as Rachel endured the posings and simperings the alternate adoration and fond contempt with which her aunt regarded her she was unable to resist the impulse to reflect them Every day she fell a little lower in that weakness and however slight the likeness had once been she knew that now it must be patent to every observer She copied her aunt mimicked duplicated her It was easier to do that than fight the resemblance against her aunt s determination and so by unnoticed degrees she had permitted herself to become a lay figure upon which was dressed the image of Miss Deane s youth She had even come to desire the look of almost sensual gratification on her aunt s face when she saw her niece so perfectly reflecting her own well remembered airs And Rachel too had come to avoid the looking glass dreading to see there the poses and gesticulations of the old repulsive woman whose every feature and expression had become so sickeningly familiar And in all that time Adrian had not once been to the house in Tavistock Square Rachel had kept him away by what she felt had become all too transparent excuses That terror at least she felt must be kept at bay For she could not conceive it possible that once he had seen her and her aunt together he could retain one spark of his admiration He would he must see her then as she was see that her contemptible vanity was the essential enduring thing all that would remain when time had stripped her of youth s allurement Nevertheless the day came when Rachel could no longer endure to deceive him He had challenged her at last with hiding something from him Inevitably he had become increasingly curious about her strange reticences concerning the Miss Deane whom he in turn had grown to regard as almost mythical and all his suppressed suspicions had suddenly found expression in a question What are you hiding Do you really live with your aunt in Tavistock Square he had asked that day with all the fierce intensity of a jealous lover Rachel had been stirred to a quick response Oh if you don t believe me you d better come and see for yourself she had said Come this afternoon to tea And afterwards even when Adrian had humbly sought to make amends for his unwarrantable jealousy she had stuck to that invitation The moment that she had issued it she had had a sense of relief a sense of having gratefully confessed her weakness Adrian s visit would consummate that confession and thereafter she would have no further secrets from him And if he found that he could no longer love her after he had seen her as she was well it would be better in the end than that he should marry a simulacrum and make the discovery by slow degrees Yes come this afternoon We ll expect you about four had been her last words to him And now she had to tell her aunt who was still unaware that such a person as Adrian Flemming existed Rachel postponed the telling until after lunch Her knowledge of Miss Deane though in some respects it equalled her knowledge of her own mind did not tell her how her aunt would take this particular piece of news She might possibly Rachel thought be annoyed fearful lest her beloved looking glass should be stolen from her But she could wait no longer In half an hour Miss Deane would go upstairs to rest and Adrian himself would be in the house before she appeared again I ve something to tell you aunt Rachel began abruptly Miss Deane put up her lorgnette and surveyed her lovely portrait with an interested air Aunt I ve never told you and I know I ought to have Rachel blurted out But I m I m engaged to a mister Adrian Flemming and he s coming here to call on you to call on us this afternoon at four o clock Miss Deane closed her eyes and gave a little sigh You might have given me rather longer notice dear she said It isn t two yet Rachel replied There are more than two hours to get ready for him Miss Deane bridled slightly I must have my rest before he comes she said and added I suppose you ve told him about us dear About you Rachel asked Miss Deane nodded complacently Well not very much Rachel admitted Miss Dean s look as she playfully threatened Rachel with her long handled lorgnette was distinctly sly Then he doesn t know yet that there are two of us she simpered Won t it be just a little bit of a shock to him my dear Rachel drew a long breath and leaned back in her chair Yes she said curtly I expect it will Never before had the realisation of that strange likeness seemed so intolerable as at that moment Even now her aunt was looking at her with the very air and gesture which had once charmed her in her own reflection and that she knew still charmed and fascinated her lover It was an air and gesture of which she could never break herself It was natural to her a true expression of something ineradicable in her being Indeed one of the worst penalties imposed upon her during the past month had been the omission of those pleasant ceremonies before the mirror She had somehow missed herself lost the sweetest and most adorable of companions Miss Deane got up and holding herself very erect moved with a little mincing step towards the tall mirror over the console table Rachel held her breath She saw that her aunt suddenly aroused by this thought of the coming lover was returning mechanically to her old habit of self admiration Was it possible Rachel wondered that the sight of the image she would see in the looking glass contrasted now with the memories of the living reflection she had so intimately studied for the past four weeks might shock her into a realisation of the starkly hideous truth But it seemed that the aged woman must be blind She gave no start of surprise as she paused before the glass she showed no sign of anxiety concerning the vision she saw there Her left hand in which she held her lorgnette had fallen to her side and with the finger tips of her right she daintily caressed the hollows of her sunken cheeks She stayed there until Rachel unable to endure the sight any longer and with some vague purpose of defiance in her mind jumped to her feet crossed the room and stood shoulder by shoulder with her aunt staring into the glass For a moment Miss Deane did not move then with a queer hesitation she dropped her right hand and slowly lifted her lorgnette Rachel felt a cold chill of horror invading her Something fearful and terrible was happening before her eyes her aunt was shrinking withering growing old in a moment The stiffness had gone out of her pose her head had begun to droop the proud contempt in her face was giving way to the moping resentful reminiscence of the aged She still held up her lorgnette still stared half fearfully at the glaring contrast that was presented to her but her hand and arm had begun to tremble under the strain and instant by instant all life and vigour seemed to be draining away from her Then suddenly with a fierce effort she turned away her head straightened herself and walked over to the door passing out with a high thin cackle of laughter that had in it the suggestion of a vehement petulant derision of a bitterness outmastering control Rachel shivered but held her ground before the mirror She had nothing to fear from that contemplation As for her aunt she had had her day It was time she knew the truth She had to know Rachel repeated addressing the dear likeness that so proudly reflected her V She found consolation in that thought Her aunt had to know and Rachel herself was only the chance instrument of the revelation She had not meant so she persisted to do more than vindicate her own integrity Nevertheless her own passionate problem was not yet solved Her aunt would not so Rachel believed give way without a struggle Had she not made a gallant effort at recovery even as she left the room and would she not make a still greater effort while Adrian was there assert her rivalry if only in revenge She must meet that Rachel decided by presenting a contrast She would be meek and humble in her aunt s presence Adrian might recognise the admired airs and gestures in those of the old woman but he should at least have no opportunity to compare them And it was with this thought and intention in her mind that Rachel received him when he arrived with a lover s promptness a little before four o clock Are you so dreadfully nervous he asked her when they were alone together in the drawing room You re like you were the first day we met in town different from your usual self Oh What a memory you have for my looks and behaviour she replied pettishly Of course I m nervous He tried to argue with her questioning her as to Miss Deane s probable reception of him but she refused to answer You ll see for yourself in a few minutes she said but the minutes passed and still Miss Deane did not come At a quarter to five the elderly parlour maid brought in tea Miss Deane said you were not to wait for her Miss Rachel was the message she delivered She ll be down presently I was to say Rachel could not suppress a scornful twist of her mouth She had no doubt that her aunt was taking very special pains with her toilet trying to obliterate perhaps her recent vision before the console glass Rachel saw her entrance in imagination stiff necked and proud defying the criticisms of youth and the suggestions of age Oh why doesn t she come and let me get it over she passionately demanded and even as she spoke she heard the sounds of some one coming down the stairs not the accustomed sounds of her aunt s finicking high heeled steps but a shuffling and creaking accompanied by the murmurs of a weak protesting voice Rachel jumped to her feet She knew everything then before the door opened and she saw first of all the shocked scared face of the elderly parlour maid who supported the crumpled palsied figure of the old old woman who three hours before had been so miraculously young magically upheld and supported then by the omnipotent strength of an idea She only stayed in the drawing room for five minutes a querulous resentful old lady malignantly jealous so it seemed of their vigour and impatient of their sympathy When the parlour maid had been sent for and Miss Deane had gone Rachel stood up and looked down at Adrian with all her old hauteur Can you realise she asked that once my aunt was supposed to be very very like me He smiled and shook his head as if the possibility was too absurd to contemplate Rachel turned and looked at herself in the glass raising her chin and slightly pursing her lips staring superciliously at her own image under half lowered eyelids Some day I may be as she is now she said with the superb contemptuous arrogance of youth Adrian was watching her with adoration You will never grow old he said So long as one does not get the idea of growing old into one s head Rachel began speculatively But Miss Deane had got the idea so strongly now that she died that night Rachel was with her at the last The old woman was trying to mouth a text from the Bible What did you say dear Rachel murmured bending over her and caught enough of the answer to guess that Miss Deane was mumbling again and again Now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face THE OLIVE By ALGERNON BLACKWOOD From Pearson s Magazine London nineteen twenty two He laughed involuntarily as the olive rolled towards his chair across the shiny parquet floor of the hotel dining room His table in the cavernous salle a manger was apart he sat alone a solitary guest the table from which the olive fell and rolled towards him was some distance away The angle however made him an unlikely objective Yet the lob sided juicy thing after hesitating once or twice en route as it plopped along came to rest finally against his feet It settled with an inviting almost an aggressive air And he stooped and picked it up putting it rather self consciously because of the girl from whose table it had come on the white tablecloth beside his plate Then looking up he caught her eye and saw that she too was laughing though not a bit self consciously As she helped herself to the hors d oeuvres a false move had sent it flying She watched him pick the olive up and set it beside his plate Her eyes then suddenly looked away again at her mother questioningly The incident was closed But the little oblong succulent olive lay beside his plate so that his fingers played with it He fingered it automatically from time to time until his lonely meal was finished When no one was looking he slipped it into his pocket as though having taken the trouble to pick it up this was the very least he could do with it Heaven alone knows why but he then took it upstairs with him setting it on the marble mantelpiece among his field glasses tobacco tins ink bottles pipes and candlestick At any rate he kept it the moist shiny lob sided juicy little oblong olive The hotel lounge wearied him he came to his room after dinner to smoke at his ease his coat off and his feet on a chair to read another chapter of Freud to write a letter or two he didn t in the least want to write and then go to bed at ten o clock But this evening the olive kept rolling between him and the thing he read it rolled between the paragraphs between the lines the olive was more vital than the interest of these eternal complexes and suppressed desires The truth was that he kept seeing the eyes of the laughing girl beyond the bouncing olive She had smiled at him in such a natural spontaneous friendly way before her mother s glance had checked her a smile he felt that might lead to acquaintance on the morrow He wondered A thrill of possible adventure ran through him She was a merry looking sort of girl with a happy half roguish face that seemed on the lookout for somebody to play with Her mother like most of the people in the big hotel was an invalid the girl a dutiful and patient daughter They had arrived that very day apparently A laugh is a revealing thing he thought as he fell asleep to dream of a lob sided olive rolling consciously towards him and of a girl s eyes that watched its awkward movements then looked up into his own and laughed In his dream the olive had been deliberately and cleverly dispatched upon its uncertain journey It was a message He did not know of course that the mother chiding her daughter s awkwardness had muttered There you are again child True to your name you never see an olive without doing something queer and odd with it A youngish man whose knowledge of chemistry including invisible inks and such like mysteries had proved so valuable to the Censor s Department that for five years he had overworked without a holiday the Italian Riviera had attracted him and he had come out for a two months rest It was his first visit Sun mimosa blue seas and brilliant skies had tempted him exchange made a pound worth forty fifty sixty and seventy shillings He found the place lovely but somewhat untenanted Having chosen at random he had come to a spot where the companionship he hoped to find did not exist The place languished after the war slow to recover the colony of resident English was scattered still travellers preferred the coast of France with Mentone and Monte Carlo to enliven them The country moreover was distracted by strikes The electric light failed one week letters the next and as soon as the electricians and postal workers resumed the railways stopped running Few visitors came and the few who came soon left He stayed on however caught by the sunshine and the good exchange also without the physical energy to discover a better livelier place He went for walks among the olive groves he sat beside the sea and palms he visited shops and bought things he did not want because the exchange made them seem cheap he paid immense extras in his weekly bill then chuckled as he reduced them to shillings and found that a few pence covered them he lay with a book for hours among the olive groves The olive groves His daily life could not escape the olive groves to olive groves sooner or later his walks his expeditions his meanderings by the sea his shopping all led him to these ubiquitous olive groves If he bought a picture postcard to send home there was sure to be an olive grove in one corner of it The whole place was smothered with olive groves the people owed their incomes and existence to these irrepressible trees The villages among the hills swam roof deep in them They swarmed even in the hotel gardens The guide books praised them as persistently as the residents brought them sooner or later into every conversation They grew lyrical over them And how do you like our olive trees Ah you think them pretty At first most people are disappointed They grow on one They do he agreed I m glad you appreciate them I find them the embodiment of grace And when the wind lifts the under leaves across a whole mountain slope why it s wonderful isn t it One realises the meaning of olive green One does he sighed But all the same I should like to get one to eat an olive I mean Ah to eat yes That s not so easy You see the crop is Exactly he interrupted impatiently weary of the habitual and evasive explanations But I should like to taste the fruit I should like to enjoy one For after a stay of six weeks he had never once seen an olive on the table in the shops nor even on the street barrows at the market place He had never tasted one No one sold olives though olive trees were a drug in the place no one bought them no one asked for them it seemed that no one wanted them The trees when he looked closely were thick with a dark little berry that seemed more like a sour sloe than the succulent delicious spicy fruit associated with its name Men climbed the trunks everywhere shaking the laden branches and hitting them with long bamboo poles to knock the fruit off while women and children squatting on their haunches spent laborious hours filling baskets underneath then loading mules and donkeys with their daily catch But an olive to eat was unobtainable He had never cared for olives but now he craved with all his soul to feel his teeth in one Ach But it is the Spanish olive that you eat explained the head waiter a German from Basel These are for oil only After which he disliked the olive more than ever until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl who then looked up into his eyes and smiled He was convinced that Eve similarly had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world He slept usually like the dead It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly There was a noise against his door He listened The room was still quite dark It was early morning The noise was not repeated Who s there he asked in a sleepy whisper What is it The noise came again Some one was scratching on the door No it was somebody tapping What do you want he demanded in a louder voice Come in he added wondering sleepily whether he was presentable Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition Nothing happened Wide awake now he turned the switch on but no light flooded the room The electricians he remembered with a curse were out on strike He fumbled for the matches and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible It was just outside his door Aren t you ready he heard You sleep for ever And the voice although never having heard it before he could not have recognised it belonged he knew suddenly to the girl who had let the olive fall In an instant he was out of bed He lit a candle I m coming he called softly as he slipped rapidly into some clothes I m sorry I ve kept you I shan t be a minute Be quick then he heard while the candle flame slowly grew and he found his garments Less than three minutes later he opened the door and candle in hand peered into the dark passage Blow it out came a peremptory whisper He obeyed but not quick enough A pair of red lips emerged from the shadows There was a puff and the candle was extinguished I ve got my reputation to consider We mustn t be seen of course The face vanished in the darkness but he had recognised it the shining skin the bright glancing eyes The sweet breath touched his cheek The candlestick was taken from him by a swift deft movement He heard it knock the wainscoting as it was set down He went out into a pitch black corridor where a soft hand seized his own and led him by a back door it seemed out into the open air of the hill side immediately behind the hotel He saw the stars The morning was cool and fragrant the sharp air waked him and the last vestiges of sleep went flying He had been drowsy and confused had obeyed the summons without thinking He now realised suddenly that he was engaged in an act of madness The girl dressed in some flimsy material thrown loosely about her head and body stood a few feet away looking he thought like some figure called out of dreams and slumber of a forgotten world out of legend almost He saw her evening shoes peep out he divined an evening dress beneath the gauzy covering The light wind blew it close against her figure He thought of a nymph I say but haven t you been to bed he asked stupidly He had meant to expostulate to apologise for his foolish rashness to scold and say they must go back at once Instead this sentence came He guessed she had been sitting up all night He stood still a second staring in mute admiration his eyes full of bewildered question Watching the stars she met his thought with a happy laugh Orion has touched the horizon I came for you at once We ve got just four hours The voice the smile the eyes the reference to Orion swept him off his feet Something in him broke loose and flew wildly recklessly to the stars Let us be off he cried before the Bear tilts down Already Alcyone begins to fade I m ready Come She laughed The wind blew the gauze aside to show two ivory white limbs She caught his hand again and they scampered together up the steep hill side towards the woods Soon the big hotel the villas the white houses of the little town where natives and visitors still lay soundly sleeping were out of sight The farther sky came down to meet them The stars were paling but no sign of actual dawn was yet visible The freshness stung their cheeks Slowly the heavens grew lighter the east turned rose the outline of the trees defined themselves there was a stirring of the silvery green leaves They were among olive groves but the spirits of the trees were dancing Far below them a pool of deep colour they saw the ancient sea They saw the tiny specks of distant fishing boats The sailors were singing to the dawn and birds among the mimosa of the hanging gardens answered them Pausing a moment at length beneath a gaunt old tree whose struggle to leave the clinging earth had tortured its great writhing arms and trunk they took their breath gazing at one another with eyes full of happy dreams You understood so quickly said the girl my little message I knew by your eyes and ears you would And she first tweaked his ears with two slender fingers mischievously then laid her soft palm with a momentary light pressure on both eyes You re half and half at any rate she added looking him up and down for a swift instant of appraisement if you re not altogether The laughter showed her white even little teeth You know how to play and that s something she added Then as if to herself You ll be altogether before I ve done with you Shall I he stammered afraid to look at her Puzzled some spirit of compromise still lingering in him he knew not what she meant he knew only that the current of life flowed increasingly through his veins but that her eyes confused him I m longing for it he added How wonderfully you did it They roll so awkwardly Oh that She peered at him through a wisp of hair You ve kept it I hope Rather It s on my mantelpiece You re sure you haven t eaten it and she made a delicious mimicry with her red lips so that he saw the tip of a small pointed tongue I shall keep it he swore as long as these arms have life in them and he seized her just as she was crouching to escape and covered her with kisses I knew you longed to play she panted when he released her Still it was sweet of you to pick it up before another got it Another he exclaimed The gods decide It s a lob sided thing remember It can t roll straight She looked oddly mischievous elusive He stared at her If it had rolled elsewhere and another had picked it up he began I should be with that other now And this time she was off and away before he could prevent her and the sound of her silvery laughter mocked him among the olive trees beyond He was up and after her in a second following her slim whiteness in and out of the old world grove as she flitted lightly her hair flying in the wind her figure flashing like a ray of sunlight or the race of foaming water till at last he caught her and drew her down upon his knees and kissed her wildly forgetting who and where and what he was Hark she whispered breathlessly one arm close about his neck I hear their footsteps Listen It is the pipe The pipe he repeated conscious of a tiny but delicious shudder For a sudden chill ran through him as she said it He gazed at her The hair fell loose about her cheeks flushed and rosy with his hot kisses Her eyes were bright and wild for all their softness Her face turned sideways to him as she listened wore an extraordinary look that for an instant made his blood run cold He saw the parted lips the small white teeth the slim neck of ivory the young bosom panting from his tempestuous embrace Of an unearthly loveliness and brightness she seemed to him yet with this strange remote expression that touched his soul with sudden terror Her face turned slowly Who are you he whispered He sprang to his feet without waiting for her answer He was young and agile strong too with that quick response of muscle they have who keep their bodies well but he was no match for her Her speed and agility out classed his own with ease She leapt Before he had moved one leg forward towards escape she was clinging with soft supple arms and limbs about him so that he could not free himself and as her weight bore him downwards to the ground her lips found his own and kissed them into silence She lay buried again in his embrace her hair across his eyes her heart against his heart and he forgot his question forgot his little fear forgot the very world he knew They come they come she cried gaily The Dawn is here Are you ready I ve been ready for five thousand years he answered leaping to his feet beside her Altogether came upon a sparkling laugh that was like wind among the olive leaves Shaking her last gauzy covering from her she snatched his hand and they ran forward together to join the dancing throng now crowding up the slope beneath the trees Their happy singing filled the sky Decked with vine and ivy and trailing silvery green branches they poured in a flood of radiant life along the mountain side Slowly they melted away into the blue distance of the breaking dawn and as the last figure disappeared the sun came up slowly out of a purple sea They came to the place he knew the deserted earthquake village and a faint memory stirred in him He did not actually recall that he had visited it already had eaten his sandwiches with hotel friends beneath its crumbling walls but there was a dim troubling sense of familiarity nothing more The houses still stood but pigeons lived in them and weasels stoats and snakes had their uncertain homes in ancient bedrooms Not twenty years ago the peasants thronged its narrow streets through which the dawn now peered and cool wind breathed among dew laden brambles I know the house she cried the house where we would live and raced a flying form of air and sunlight into a tumbled cottage that had no roof no floor or windows Wild bees had hung a nest against the broken wall He followed her There was sunlight in the room and there were flowers Upon a rude simple table lay a bowl of cream with eggs and honey and butter close against a home made loaf They sank into each other s arms upon a couch of fragrant grass and boughs against the window where wild roses bloomed and the bees flew in and out It was Bussana the so called earthquake village because a sudden earthquake had fallen on it one summer morning when all the inhabitants were at church The crashing roof killed sixty the tumbling walls another hundred and the rest had left it where it stood The Church he said vaguely remembering the story They were at prayer The girl laughed carelessly in his ear setting his blood in a rush and quiver of delicious joy He felt himself untamed wild as the wind and animals The true God claimed His own she whispered He came back Ah they were not ready the old priests had seen to that But he came They heard his music Then his tread shook the olive groves the old ground danced the hills leapt for joy And the houses crumbled he laughed as he pressed her closer to his heart And now we ve come back she cried merrily We ve come back to worship and be glad She nestled into him while the sun rose higher I hear them hark she cried and again leapt dancing from his side Again he followed her like wind Through the broken window they saw the naked fauns and nymphs and satyrs rolling dancing shaking their soft hoofs amid the ferns and brambles Towards the appalling ruptured church they sped with feet of light and air A roar of happy song and laughter rose Come he cried We must go too Hand in hand they raced to join the tumbling dancing throng She was in his arms and on his back and flung across his shoulders as he ran They reached the broken building its whole roof gone sliding years ago its walls a tremble still its shattered shrines alive with nesting birds Hush she whispered in a tone of awe yet pleasure He is there She pointed her bare arm outstretched above the bending heads There in the empty space where once stood sacred Host and Cup he sat filling the niche sublimely and with awful power His shaggy form benign yet terrible rose through the broken stone The great eyes shone and smiled The feet were lost in brambles God cried a wild frightened voice yet with deep worship in it and the old familiar panic came with portentous swiftness The great Figure rose The birds flew screaming the animals sought holes the worshippers laughing and glad a moment ago rushed tumbling over one another for the doors He goes again Who called Who called like that His feet shake the ground It is the earthquake screamed a woman s shrill accents in ghastly terror Kiss me one kiss before we forget again sighed a laughing passionate voice against his ear Once more your arms your heart beating on my lips You recognised his power You are now altogether We shall remember But he woke with the heavy bed clothes stuffed against his mouth and the wind of early morning sighing mournfully about the hotel walls Have they left again those ladies he inquired casually of the head waiter pointing to the table They were here last night at dinner Who do you mean replied the man stupidly gazing at the spot indicated with a face quite blank Last night at dinner He tried to think An English lady elderly with her daughter at which moment precisely the girl came in alone Lunch was over the room empty There was a second s difficult pause It seemed ridiculous not to speak Their eyes met The girl blushed furiously He was very quick for an Englishman I was allowing myself to ask after your mother he began I was afraid he glanced at the table laid for one she was not well perhaps Oh but that s very kind of you I m sure She smiled He saw the small white even teeth And before three days had passed he was so deeply in love that he simply couldn t help himself I believe he said lamely this is yours You dropped it you know Er may I keep it It s only an olive They were of course in an olive grove when he asked it and the sun was setting She looked at him looked him up and down looked at his ears his eyes He felt that in another second her little fingers would slip up and tweak the first or close the second with a soft pressure Tell me he begged did you dream anything that first night I saw you She took a quick step backwards No she said as he followed her more quickly still I don t think I did But she went on breathlessly as he caught her up I knew from the way you picked it up Knew what he demanded holding her tightly so that she could not get away again That you were already half and half but would soon be altogether And as he kissed her he felt her soft little fingers tweak his ears ONCE A HERO By HAROLD BRIGHOUSE From Pan nineteen twenty two Standing in a sheltered doorway a tramp with a slouch hat crammed low over a notably unwashed face watched the outside of the new works canteen of the Sir William Rumbold limited Engineering Company Perhaps because they were workers while he was a tramp he had an air of compassionate cynicism as the audience assembled and thronged into the building which as prodigally advertised throughout Calderside was to be opened that night by Sir William in person There being no one to observe him the tramp could be frank with his cynicism but inside the building in the platform ante room mister Edward Fosdike who was Sir William s locally resident secretary had to discipline his private feelings to a suave concurrence in his employer s florid enthusiasm Fosdike served Sir William well but no man is a hero to his male secretary I hope you will find the arrangements satisfactory Fosdike was saying tugging nervously at his maltreated moustache You speak at seven and declare the canteen open Then there s a meal He hesitated Perhaps I should have warned you to dine before you came Sir William was aware of being a very gallant gentleman Not at all he said heroically not at all I have not spared my purse over this War Memorial Why should I spare my feelings Well now you ve seen about the Press Oh yes The reporters are coming There ll be flash light photographs Everything quite as usual when you make a public appearance sir Sir William wondered if this resident secretary of his were quite adequate Busy in London he had left all arrangements in his local factotum s hands and he was doubting whether those hands had grasped the situation competently Only as usual he said sharply This War Memorial has cost me ten thousand pounds The amount Fosdike hastened to assure him has been circulated with appropriate tribute to your generosity Generosity criticised Rumbold I hope you didn t use that word mister Fosdike referred to his notebook We said he read the cost though amounting to ten thousand pounds is entirely beside the point Sir William felt that no expense was excessive that would result in a fitting and permanent expression of our gratitude to the glorious dead Thank you Fosdike That is exactly my feeling said the gratified Sir William paying Fosdike the unspoken compliment of thinking him less of a fool than he looked It is he went on from no egotistic motive that I wish the Press to be strongly represented to night I believe that in deciding that Calderside s War Memorial should take the form of a Works Canteen I am setting an example of enlightenment which other employers would do well to follow I have erected a monument not in stone but in goodwill a club house for both sexes to serve as a centre of social activities for the firm s employees wherein the great spirit of the noble work carried out at the Front by by the Y M C A will be recaptured and adapted to peace conditions in our local organisation in the Martlow Works Canteen What are you taking notes for I thought began Fosdike Oh well perhaps you are right Reporters have been known to miss one s point and a little first aid eh By the way I sent you some notes from town of what I intended to say in my speech I just sent them ahead in case there was any local point I d got wrong He put it as a question but actually it was an assertion and a challenge It asserted that by no possible chance could there be anything injudicious in the proposed speech and it challenged Fosdike to deny that assertion if he dared And Fosdike had to dare he had to accuse himself of assuming too easily that Rumbold s memory of local Calderside detail was as fresh as the memory of the man on the spot I did want to suggest a modification sir he hazarded timidly Really quite below zero Really I felt very contented with the speech Yes sir it s masterly But on the spot here Oh agreed Quite right Fosdike I am speaking to night to the world no let me guard against exaggeration The world includes the Polynesians and Esquimaux I am speaking to the English speaking races of the world but first and foremost to Calderside My own people Yes You have a little something to suggest Some happy local allusion It s about Martlow said Fosdike shortly Sir William took him up Ah now you re talking he approved Yes indeed anything you can add to my notes about Martlow will be most welcome I have noted much but too much is not enough for such an illustrious example of conspicuous gallantry so noble a life so great a deed and so self sacrificing an end Any details you can add about Timothy Martlow will indeed Fosdike coughed Excuse me sir that s just the point If you talk like that about Martlow down here they ll laugh at you Laugh gasped Rumbold his sense of propriety outraged My dear Fosdike what s come to you I celebrate a hero Our hero Why I m calling the Canteen after Martlow when I might have given it my own name That speaks volumes It did But Fosdike knew too well what would be the attitude of a Calderside audience if he allowed his chief to sing in top notes an unreserved eulogy of Tim Martlow Calderside knew Tim the civilian if it had also heard of Tim the soldier Don t you remember Martlow sir Before the war I mean No Ought I to Not on the bench Martlow Yes now I think of the name in connection with the old days there was a drunken fellow To be sure an awful blackguard continually before the bench Dear me Well well but a man is not responsible for his undesirable relations I hope No sir But that was Martlow The same man You really can t speak to Calderside of his as an ennobling life and a great example The war changed him but well in peace Tim was absolutely the local bad man and they all know it I thought you did or Sir William turned a face expressive of awe struck wonder Fosdike he said with deep sincerity this is the most amazing thing I ve heard of the war I never connected Martlow the hero with well well de mortuis He quoted Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As there a careless trifle Appropriate I think I shall use that It was at least a magnificent recovery from an unexpected blow administered by the very man whose duty it was to guard Sir William against just that sort of blow If Fosdike was not the local watch dog he was nothing and here was an occasion when the dog had omitted to bark until the last minute of the eleventh hour Very apt quotation sir though there have never been any exact details of Martlow s death Sir William meditated Do you recall the name of the saint who was a regular rip before he got religion he asked I think that applies to most of them said Fosdike Yes but the one in particular Francis That s it He filled his chest Timothy Martlow he pronounced impressively is the saint Francis of the Great War and this Canteen is his shrine Now I think I will go into the hall It is early but I shall chat with the people Oh one last thought When you mentioned Martlow I thought you were going to tell me of some undesirable connections There are none There is his mother A widow You remember the Board voted her an addition to her pension Oh yes And she Oh most grateful She will be with you on the platform I have seen myself that she is fittingly attired I think I can congratulate you Fosdike said Sir William magnanimously You ve managed very well I look forward to a pleasant evening a widely reported speech and Then Dolly Wainwright came into the ante room If you please sir she said what s going to be done about me Two gentlemen who had all but reached the smug bathos of a mutual admiration society turned astonished eyes at the intruder She wore a tam and a check blanket coat which she unbuttoned as they watched her Beneath it suitable to the occasion was a white dress and Sir William looking at it felt a glow of tenderness for this artless child who had blundered into the privacy of the ante room Something daintily virginal in Dolly s face appealed to him he caught himself thinking that her frock was more than a miracle in bleached cotton it was moonshine shot with alabaster and the improbability of that combination had hardly struck him when Fosdike s voice forced itself harshly on his ears How did you get in here Sir William moved to defend the girl from the anger of his secretary but when she said with a certain challenge Through the door he doubted if she were so defenceless as she seemed But there s a doorkeeper at the bottom said Fosdike I gave him my orders I gave him my smile said Dolly I won Upon my word Fosdike began Well well interrupted Sir William what can I do for you The reply was indirect but caused Sir William still further to readjust his estimate of her I ve got friends in the meeting to night she concluded They ll speak up for me too if I m not righted So I m telling you Don t threaten me my girl said Sir William without severity I am always ready to pay attention to any legitimate grievance but Legitimate she interrupted Well mine s not legitimate So there I beg your pardon She puzzled Sir William Come now he went on in his most patriarchal manner don t assume I m not going to listen to you I am To night there is no thought in my mind except the welfare of Calderside Oh well she said apologetically I m sorry if I riled you but it s a bit awkward to speak it out to a man Only the unconscious cruelty of youth or was it conscious you re both old so perhaps I can get through It s about Tim Martlow Ah said Sir William encouragingly our glorious hero Yes said Dolly I m the mother of his child We are all balloons dancing our lives amongst pins Therefore be compassionate towards Sir William He collapsed speechlessly on a hard chair Fosdike reacted more alertly This is the first I ve heard of Martlow s being married he said aggressively Dolly looked up at him indignantly You ain t heard it now have you she protested I said it wasn t legitimate I don t say we d not have got married if there d been time but you can t do everything on short leave There seemed an obvious retort Rumbold and Fosdike looked at each other and neither made the retort Instead Fosdike asked Are you employed in the works here I was here on munitions she said and then on doles And now you re on the make he sneered Oh I dunno she said All this fuss about Tim Martlow I ought to have my bit out of it Deplorable grieved Sir William The crass materialism of it all This is so sad How old are you Twenty said Dolly Twenty with a child to keep and his father s name up in gold lettering in that hall there I say somebody ought to do something I suppose now Miss Fosdike baulked Wainwright Dolly Wainwright though it ought to be Martlow I suppose you loved Tim very dearly I liked him well enough He was good looking in his khaki Liked him I m sure it was more than that Oh I dunno Why asked the girl who said she was the mother of Martlow s child I am sure said Fosdike gravely you would never do anything to bring a stain upon his memory Dolly proposed a bargain If I m rightly done by she said I ll do right by him Anything that marred the harmony of to night s ceremony Miss Wainwright would be unthinkable said Sir William coming to his lieutenant s support Right said Dolly cheerfully If you ll take steps according I m sure I ve no desire to make a scene A scene gasped Sir William Though she pointed out it s a lot to ask of any one you know Giving up the certain chance of getting my photograph in the papers I make a good picture too Some do and some don t but I take well and when you know you ve got the looks to carry off a scene it s asking something of me to give up the idea But you said you d no desire to make a scene Poor girls have often got to do what they don t wish to I wouldn t make a scene in the usual way Hysterics and all that Hysterics means cold water in your face and your dress messed up and no sympathy But with scenes the greater the occasion the greater the reward and there s no denying this is an occasion is there You re making a big to do about Tim Martlow and the reward would be according I don t know if you ve noticed that if a girl makes a scene and she s got the looks for it she gets offers of marriage like they do in the police court when they ve been wronged and the magistrate passes all the men s letters on to the court missionary and the girl and the missionary go through them and choose the likeliest fellow out of the bunch But my dear young lady Fosdike began She silenced him Oh it s all right I don t know that I want to get married Then you ought to said Sir William virtuously There s better things in life than getting married Dolly said I ve weighed up marriage and I don t see what there is in it for a girl nowadays In your case I should have thought there was everything Dolly sniffed There isn t liberty she said And we won the fight for liberty didn t we No if I made that scene it ud be to get my photograph in the papers where the film people could see it I ve the right face for the pictures and my romantic history will do the rest Good heavens girl cried the scandalised Sir William have you no reverence at all The pictures You d turn all my disinterested efforts to ridicule You d oh but there You re not going to make a scene That s a matter of arrangement of course said the cool lady I m only showing you what a big chance I shall miss if I oblige you Suppose I pipe up my tale of woe just when you re on the platform with the Union Jack behind you and the reporters in front of you and that tablet in there that says Tim is the greatest glory of Calderside Sir William nearly screamed Be quiet girl Fosdike he snarled turning viciously on his secretary what the deuce do you mean by pretending to keep an eye on local affairs when you miss a thing like this Tisn t his fault said Dolly I ve been saving this up for you Oh he groaned and I d felt so happy about to night He took out a fountain pen Well I suppose there s no help for it Fosdike what s the amount of the pension we allow Martlow s mother Double it add a pound a week and what s the answer mister Fosdike asked Dolly quickly Sir William gasped ludicrously I mean to say said Dolly conferring on his gasp the honour of an explanation she s old and didn t go on munitions and didn t get used to wangling income tax on her wages and never had no ambitions to go on the pictures neither What s compensation to her isn t compensation to me I ve got a higher standard The less you say about your standards the better my girl retorted Sir William Do you know that this is blackmail No it isn t Not when I ain t asked you for nothing And if I pass the remark how that three pounds a week is my idea of a minimum wage it isn t blackmail to state the fact Sir William paused in the act of tearing a page out of Fosdike s note book Three pounds a week Well said Dolly reasonably I didn t depreciate the currency Three pounds a week is little enough these times for the girl who fell from grace through the chief glory of Calderside But suppose you marry suggested mister Fosdike Then I marry well she said having means of my own And I ought to seeing I m kind of widow to the chief glory of Sir William looked up sharply from the table If you use that phrase again he said I ll tear this paper up Widow to Tim Martlow she amended it defiantly He handed her the document he had drawn up It was an undertaking in brief unambiguous terms to pay her three pounds a week for life As she read it exulting the door was kicked open The tramp whose name was Timothy Martlow came in and turning spoke through the doorway to the janitor below Call out he said and I ll come back and knock you down again Then he locked the door Fosdike went courageously towards him What do you mean by this intrusion Who are you The tramp assured himself that his hat was well pulled down over his face He put his hands in his pockets and looked quizzically at the advancing mister Fosdike So far he said I m the man that locked the door Fosdike started for the second door which led directly to the platform The tramp reached it first and locked it shouldering Fosdike from him Now he said Sir William was searching the wall are there no bells he asked desperately No No jeered the tramp No bell No telephone No nothing You re scotched without your rifle this time Fosdike consulted Sir William I might shout for the police he suggested It s risky commented the tramp They sometimes come when they re called Then began the secretary It s your risk emphasised the tramp And I don t advise it I ve gone to a lot of trouble this last week to keep out of sight of the Calderside police They d identify me easy and Sir William wouldn t like that I wouldn t like said Rumbold I Who are you Wounded and missing believed dead quoted the tramp Only there s been a lot of beliefs upset in this war and I m one of them One of what I m telling you One of the strayed sheep that got mislaid and come home at the awkwardest times He snatched his hat off Have a good look at that face your worship Timothy Martlow cried Sir William Fosdike staggered to a chair while Dolly who had shown nothing but amusement at the tramp now gave a quick cry and shrank back against the wall exhibiting every symptom of the liveliest terror Of the trio Sir William for whom surely this inopportune return had the most serious implications alone stood his ground and Martlow grimly appreciated his pluck It s very near made a stretcher case of him he said indicating the prostrated Fosdike You re cooler Walking wounded I really Shake hands old cock said Martlow I know you ve got it writ up in there he jerked his head towards the hall that I m the chief glory of Calderside but damme if you re not the second best yourself and I ll condescend to shake your hand if it s only to show you I m not a ghost Sir William decided that it was politic to humour this visitor He shook hands Then if you know he said if you know what this building is it isn t accident that brings you here to night The sort of accident you set with a time fuse said Martlow grimly I told you I d been dodging the police for a week lest any of my old pals should recognise me I was waiting to get you to night and sitting tight and listening The things I heard Nearly made me take my hat off to myself But not quite Not quite I kept my hat on and I kept my hair on It s a mistake to act premature on information received If I d sprung this too soon the wrong thing might have happened to me What wrong thing Martlow asked Sir William with some indignation If the fellow meant anything it was that he would have been spirited away by Sir William Oh anything replied Martlow Anything would be wrong that made me miss this pleasure You and me conversing affable here Not a bit like it was in the old days before I rose to being the chief glory of Calderside Conversation was one sided then and all on your side instead of mine Here again Martlow you d say and then they d gabble the evidence and you d say fourteen days or twenty one days if you d got up peevish and that s all there was to our friendly intercourse This time I make no doubt you ll be asking me to stay at the Towers to night And he went on blandly enjoying every wince that twisted Sir William s face in spite of his efforts to appear unmoved I don t know that I ll refuse It s a levelling thing war I ve read that war makes us all conscious we re members of one brotherhood and I know it s true now Consequently the chief glory of the place ain t got no right to be too high and mighty to accept your humble invitation The best guest room for Sergeant Martlow you ll say See there s a hot water bottle in his bed you ll say and in case he s thirsty in the night you ll tell them to put the whisky by his side After all a man does not rise to become Sir William Rumbold by being flabby Sir William struck the table heavily Somehow he had to put a period to this mocking harangue Martlow he said how many people know you re here Tim gave a good imitation of Sir William s gesture He too could strike a table Rumbold he retorted what s the value of a secret when it s not a secret You three in this room know and not another soul in Calderside Not even your mother queried Rumbold No I been a bad son to her in the past I m a good one now I m dead She s got a bit o pension and I ll not disturb that I ll stay dead to her he added forcibly dashing the hope which leapt in Rumbold Why have you come here Here to night The easy mockery renewed itself in Martlow s voice People s ideas of fun vary he stated The fly s idea ain t the same as the spider s This ere is my idea shaking your hand and sitting cosy with the bloke that s sent me down more times than I can think And the fun ull grow furious when you and I walk arm in arm on to that platform and you tell them all I m resurrected Like this The proper mister Fosdike interjected Eh said Tim Like what You can t go on to the platform in those clothes Martlow Have you looked in a mirror lately Do you know what you look like This is a respectable occasion man Yes said Tim drily It s an occasion for showing respect to me I ll do as I am not having had time to go to the tailor s for my dress suit yet Martlow said Sir William briskly time s short I m due on that platform Right I m with you Tim moved towards the platform door Sir William with a serene air of triumph played his trump card He took out his cheque book No he said You re not coming Instead He shrank back hastily as a huge fist was projected vehemently towards his face But the fist swerved and opened The cheque book not Sir William s person was its objective Instead be damned said Tim Martlow pitching the cheque book to the floor To hell with your money Thought I was after money did you Sir William met his eye Yes I did he said hardily That s the sort of mean idea you would have Sir William Rumbold They say scum rises You grew a handle to your name during the war but you ain t grown manners to go with it War changes them that s changeable T others are too set to change Sir William felt a strange glow of appreciation for this man who with so easy an opportunity to grow rich refused money It s changed you he said with ungrudging admiration that had no tincture of diplomacy in it Has it mused Tim From what Well Sir William was embarrassed From what you were What was I demanded Tim Go on spit it out What sort of character would you have given me then I d have called you said Sir William boldly a disreputable drunken loafer who never did an honest day s work in his life Which had the merit of truth and he thought the demerit of rashness To his surprise he found that Tim was looking at him with undisguised admiration Lummy he said you ve got guts Yes that s right Disreputable drunken loafer And if I came back now he asked You were magnificent in the war Martlow First thing I did when I got civvies on was to get blind and skinned Drink and civvies go together in my mind You ll get over that said Sir William encouragingly but he was puzzled by the curiously wistful note which had replaced Tim s hectoring There s a chance admitted Tim A bare chance Not a chance I d gamble on Not when I ve a bigger chance than that You wouldn t say weighing me up now that I ve got a reformed look would you Sir William couldn t But you ll pull yourself together You ll remember I ll remember the taste of beer said Tim with fierce conviction No I never had a chance before but I ve got one now and by heaven I m taking it Sir William s apprehension grew acute if money was not the question what outrageous demand was about to be made of him Tim went on I m nothing but a dirty drunken tramp to day Yes drunk when I can get it and craving when I can t That s Tim Martlow when he s living Tim Martlow dead s a different thing He s a man with his name wrote up in letters of gold in a dry canteen Dry By God that s funny He s somebody honoured in Calderside for ever and ever amen And we won t spoil a good thing by taking chances on my reformation I m dead I ll stay dead He paused in enjoying the effect he made Sir William stooped to pick his cheque book from the floor Don t do that said Tim sharply It isn t out of your mind yet that money s what I came for Fun s one thing that brought me Just for the treat of showing you myself and watching your quick change faces while I did it And I ve had my fun His voice grew menacing The other thing I came for isn t fun It s this Dolly screamed as he took her arm and jerked her to her feet from the corner where she had sought obscurity He shook her urgently You ve been telling tales about me I ve heard of it You hear all the news when you lie quiet yourself and let other people do the talking You came in here to night to spin a yarn I watched you in Well is it true No said Dolly gasping for breath I mean he insisted what you said about you and me That isn t true She repeated her denial No he said releasing her it ud have a job to be seeing this is the first time I ve had the pleasure of meeting you That ll do He opened the platform door politely I hope I haven t made you late on the platform sir he said Both Sir William and the secretary stared fascinated at Dolly the enterprising young person who had so successfully bluffed them I repeat don t let me make you late said Tim from the now wide open door Rumbold checked Fosdike who was apparently bent on doing Dolly a personal violence That can wait he said What can t wait is this He held out his hand to Martlow In all sincerity I beg the honour Tim shook his hand and Rumbold turned to the door Fosdike ran after him with the notes of his speech Your speech sir Sir William turned on him angrily Man he said haven t you heard That muck won t do now I have to try to do Martlow justice He went out to the platform Fosdike after him Tim Martlow sat at the table and took a bottle from his pocket He drew the cork with his teeth then felt a light touch on his arm I was forgetting you he said replacing the bottle I ain t likely to forget you said Dolly ruefully He gripped her hard But you are going to forget me my girl he said Tim Martlow s dead and his letters of gold ain t going to be blotted by the likes of you You that s been putting it about Calderside I m the father of your child and I ain t never seen you in my life till to night Yes but you re getting this all wrong she blubbered I didn t have a baby I was going to borrow one if they d claimed to see it What No baby And you put it across old Rumbold Laughter and sheer admiration of her audacity were mingled in his voice With a baby it was a good bluff without one the girl s ingenuity seemed to him to touch genius He gave me that paper she said pride subduing tears as she handed him her splendid trophy Three pounds a week for life he read with profound reverence If you ain t a blinkin marvel He complimented her giving her the paper back Then he realised that through him her gains were lost Gawd I done wrong I got no right to mess up a thing like that I didn t know See I ll tell him I made you lie I ll own the baby s mine But there ain t no baby she persisted There s plenty of babies looking for a mother with three pounds a week he said She tore the paper up Then they ll not find me she said Three pounds a week s gone And your letters of gold mister Martlow remain The practised voice of Sir William Rumbold speaking on the platform filled the ante room not with the rhetorician s counterfeit of sincerity but unmistakably with sincerity itself I had prepared a speech he was saying A prepared speech is useless in face of the emotion I feel at the life of Timothy Martlow I say advisedly to you that when I think of Martlow I know myself for a worm He was despised and rejected What had England done for him that he should give his life for her We wronged him We made an outcast of him I personally wronged him from the magistrate s bench and he pays us back like this rising from an undeserved obscurity to a height where he rests secure for ever a reproach to us and a great example of the man who won And against what odds he played it out to a supreme end and You re right said Tim Martlow motioning the girl to close the door He wasn t used to hearing panegyrics on himself nor was he aware that mechanically he had raised the bottle to his lips Dolly meant to close the door discreetly instead she threw it from her and jumped at the bottle Tim was conscious of a double crash putting an emphatic stop to the sound of Sir William s eulogy the crash of the door and the bottle which Dolly snatched from him and pitched against the wall Letters of gold she panted and you shan t tarnish them I ll see to that He gaped for a moment at the liquor flowing from the bottle then raised his eyes to hers You he said I haven t got a baby to look after said Dolly But I ve you Where were you thinking of going now His eyes went to the door behind which Sir William was presumably still praising him and his head jerked resolutely Playing it out he said I ve got to vanish good and sure after that I ll play it out by God I was a hero once I ll be a hero still His foot crunched broken glass as he moved I m going to America my girl It s dry Perhaps she distrusted the absolute dryness of America and perhaps that had nothing to do with Dolly She examined her hand minutely Going to the Isle of Man on a rough day I wasn t a bit ill she said casually I m a good sailor You put it across Sir William he said You re a blinkin marvel No she said but a thing that s worth doing is worth doing well I m not a marvel but I might be the metal polish in those gold letters of yours if you think it worth while His trampish squalor seemed to him suddenly appalling There don t do that he protested her arm had found its way into his My sleeve s dirty Idiot said Dolly Wainwright drawing him to the door THE PENSIONER By WILLIAM CAINE From The Graphic nineteen twenty two Miss Crewe was born in the year eighteen twenty one She received a sort of education and at the age of twenty became the governess of a little girl eight years old called Martha Bond She was Martha s governess for the next ten years Then Martha came out and Miss Crewe went to be the governess of somebody else Martha married mister William Harper A year later she gave birth to a son who was named Edward This brings us to the year eighteen fifty three When Edward was six Miss Crewe came back to be his governess Four years later he went to school and Miss Crewe went away to be the governess of somebody else She was now forty two years old Twelve years passed and missus Harper died recommending Miss Crewe to her husband s care for Miss Crewe had recently been smitten by an incurable disease which made it impossible for her to be a governess any longer mister Harper who had passionately loved his wife gave instructions to his solicitor to pay Miss Crewe the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds annually He had some thoughts of buying her an annuity but she seemed so ill that he didn t Edward was now twenty two In the year eighteen eighty eight mister Harper died after a very short illness He had expected Miss Crewe to die any day during the past thirteen years but since she hadn t he thought it proper now to recommend her to Edward s care This is how he did it That confounded old Crewe Eddie You ll have to see to her Let her have her money as before but for the Lord s sake don t go and buy her an annuity now If you do she ll die on your hands in a week Shortly afterwards the old gentleman passed away Edward was now thirty five Miss Crewe was sixty seven and reported to be in an almost desperate state Edward followed his father s advice He bought no annuity for Miss Crewe Her one hundred and fifty pounds continued to be paid each year into her bank but by Edward not by his late father s solicitors Edward had his own ideas of managing the considerable fortune which he had inherited These ideas were unsound The first of them was that he should assume the entire direction of his own affairs Accordingly he instructed his solicitors to realise all the mortgages and railway stock and other admirable securities in which his money was invested and hand over the cash to him He then went in for the highest rate of interest which anyone would promise him The consequence was that within twelve years he was almost a poor man his annual income having dwindled from about three thousand to about four hundred pounds Though he was a fool he was an honourable man and so he continued to pay Miss Crewe her one hundred and fifty pounds each year This left him about two hundred and fifty for himself The capital which his so reduced income represented was invested in a Mexican brewery in which he had implicit faith Nevertheless he began to think that he might do well were he to try to earn a little extra money The only thing he could do was to paint not at all well in water colours He became the pupil quite seriously of a young artist whom he knew He was now forty seven years old while Miss Crewe was seventy nine The year was nineteen hundred To everybody s amazement Edward soon began to make quite good progress in his painting Yes his pictures were not at all unpleasant little things He sent one of them to the Academy It was accepted It was as I live sold for ten pounds Edward was an artist Soon he was making between thirty and forty pounds a year Then he was making over a hundred Then two hundred Then the Mexican brewery failed General Malefico having burned it to the ground for a lark This happened in the spring of nineteen fourteen when Edward was sixty one and Miss Crewe was ninety three Edward after paying her money to Miss Crewe might flatter himself on the possibility of having some fifty pounds a year for himself that is to say if his picture sales did not decline A single man can however get along more or less on fifty pounds more or less Then the Great War broke out It has been said that in the autumn of nineteen fourteen the Old Men came into their kingdom As the fields of Britain were gradually stripped bare of their valid toilers the Fathers of each village assumed at good wages the burden of agriculture From their offices the juniors departed or were torn the senior clerks carried on desperately until the Girls were introduced No man was any longer too old at forty Octogenarians could command a salary The very cinemas were glad to dress up ancient fellows in uniform and post them on their doorsteps Edward could do nothing but paint rather agreeable water colours and that was all The market for his kind of work was shut A patriotic nation was economising in order to get five per cent on the War Loans People were not giving inexpensive little water colours away to one another as wedding gifts any longer Only the painters of high reputation whose work was regarded as a real investment could dispose of their wares Starvation stared Edward in the face not only his own starvation you understand but Miss Crewe s And Edward was a man of honour He hated Miss Crewe intensely but he had undertaken to provide for her and provide for her he must even if he failed to provide for himself He wrapped some samples of his paintings in brown paper and began to seek for a job among the wholesale stationers He offered himself as one who was prepared to design Christmas cards and calendars and things of the kind Adversity had sharpened his wits Even the wholesale stationers were not turning white headed men from their portals To Edward was accorded the privilege of displaying the rather agreeable contents of his parcel After he had unpacked it and packed it up again some thirty times he was offered work His pictures were really rather agreeable It was piecework and he was to do it off the premises no matter where By toiling day and night he might be able to earn as much as Lfour a week He went away and toiled His employers were pleased with what each Monday he brought them They did not offer to increase his remuneration but they encouraged him to produce and took practically everything he offered Edward was very fortunate During the first year of the war he lived like a beast worked like a slave and earned exactly enough to keep his soul in his body and pay Miss Crewe her one hundred and fifty pounds During the second year of the war he did it again The fourth year of the war found him still alive and still punctual to his obligations towards Miss Crewe Miss Crewe however found one hundred and fifty pounds no longer what it had been Prices were rising in every direction She wrote to Edward pointing this out and asking him if he couldn t see his way to increasing her allowance She invoked the memory of his dear mother and father added something about the happy hours that he and she had spent together in the dear old school room and signed herself his affectionately Edward petitioned for an increase of pay He pointed out to his firm of wholesale stationers that prices were rising in every direction The firm who knew when they had a marketable thing cheap granted his petition Henceforth Edward was able to earn five pounds a week He increased Miss Crewe s allowance by fifty pounds and continued to live more like a beast than ever for the price of paper and paints was soaring He worked practically without ceasing save to sleep which he could not do and to eat which he could not afford He was now sixty four while Miss Crewe was rising ninety seven Edward had been ailing for a long time On Armistice Day he struck work for an hour in order to walk about in the streets and share in the general rejoicing He caught a severe cold and the next day instead of staying between his blankets he had no sheets he went up to the City with some designs which he had just completed That night he was feverish The next night he was delirious The third night he was dead and there was an end of him He had however managed before he died two days before to send to Miss Crewe a money order for her quarter s allowance of fifty pounds This had left him with precisely four shillings and twopence in the Post Office Savings Bank He was consequently buried by the parish Miss Crewe received her money She was delighted to have it and at once wrote to Edward her customary letter of grateful and affectionate thanks She added in a post script that if he could find it in his generous heart to let her have a still little more next quarter it would be most acceptable because every day seemed to make it harder and harder for her to get along Edward was dead when this letter was delivered Miss Crewe sent her money order to her bank asking that it might be placed to her deposit account This she reminded the bank would bring up the amount of her deposit to exactly two thousand pounds BROADSHEET BALLAD By A E COPPARD From The Dial nineteen twenty two At noon the tiler and the mason stepped down from the roof of the village church which they were repairing and crossed over the road to the tavern to eat their dinner It had been a nice little morning but there were clouds massing in the south Sam the tiler remarked that it looked like thunder The two men sat in the dim little tap room eating Bob the mason at the same time reading from a newspaper an account of a trial for murder I dunno what thunder looks like Bob said but I reckon this chap is going to be hung though I can t rightly say for why To my thinking he didn t do it at all but murder s a bloody thing and someone ought to suffer for it I don t think spluttered Sam as he impaled a flat piece of beet root on the point of a pocket knife and prepared to contemplate it with patience until his stuffed mouth was ready to receive it he ought to be hung There can be no other end for him though with a mob of lawyers like that and a judge like that and a jury too why the rope s half round his neck this minute he ll be in glory within a month they only have three Sundays you know between the sentence and the execution Well hark at that rain then A shower that began as a playful sprinkle grew to a powerful steady summer downpour It splashed in the open window and the dim room grew more dim and cool Hanging s a dreadful thing continued Sam and tis often unjust I ve no doubt I ve no doubt at all Unjust I tell you at majority of trials those who give their evidence mostly knows nothing at all about the matter them as knows a lot they stays at home and don t budge not likely No But why Why They has their reasons I know that I knows it for truth hark at that rain it s made the room feel cold They watched the downfall in complete silence for some moments Hanging s a dreadful thing Sam at length repeated with almost a sigh I can tell you a tale about that Sam in a minute said the other He began to fill his pipe from Sam s brass box which was labelled cough lozenges and smelled of paregoric Just about ten years ago I was working over in Cotswold country I remember I d been into Gloucester one Saturday afternoon and it rained I was jogging along home in a carrier s van I never seen it rain like that afore no nor never afterwards not like that B r r r r it came down bashing And we came to a cross roads where there s a public house called The Wheel of Fortune very lonely and onsheltered it is just there I see d a young woman standing in the porch awaiting us but the carrier was wet and tired and angry or something and wouldn t stop No room he bawled out to her full up can t take you and he drove on For the love o God mate I says pull up and take that young creature She s she s can t you see But I m all behind as tis he shouts to me You knows your gospel don t you time and tide wait for no man Ah but dammit all they always call for a feller I says With that he turned round and we drove back for the girl She clumb in and sat on my knees I squat on a tub of vinegar there was nowhere else and I was right and all she was going on for a birth Well the old van rattled away for six or seven miles whenever it stopped you could hear the rain clattering on the tarpaulin or sounding outside on the grass as if it was breathing hard and the old horse steamed and shivered with it I had knowed the girl once in a friendly way a pretty young creature but now she was white and sorrowful and wouldn t say much By and bye we came to another cross roads near a village and she got out there Good day my gal I says affable like and Thank you sir says she and off she popped in the rain with her umbrella up A rare pretty girl quite young I d met her before a girl you could get uncommon fond of you know but I didn t meet her afterwards she was mixed up in a bad business It all happened in the next six months while I was working round those parts Everybody knew of it This girl s name was Edith and she had a younger sister Agnes Their father was old Harry Mallerton kept The British Oak at North Quainy he stuttered Well this Edith had a love affair with a young chap William and having a very loving nature she behaved foolish Then she couldn t bring the chap up to the scratch nohow by herself and of course she was afraid to tell her mother or father you know how girls are after being so pesky natural they fear O they do fear But soon it couldn t be hidden any longer as she was living at home with them all so she wrote a letter to her mother Dear Mother she wrote and told her all about her trouble By all accounts the mother was angry as an old lion but Harry took it calm like and sent for young William who d not come at first He lived close by in the village so they went down at last and fetched him Alright yes he said I ll do what s lawful to be done There you are I can t say no fairer that I can t No they said you can t So he kissed the girl and off he went promising to call in and settle affairs in a day or two The next day Agnes which was the younger girl she also wrote a note to her mother telling her some more strange news God above the mother cried out can it be true both of you girls my own daughters and by the same man Oh whatever were you thinking on both of ye Whatever can be done now What ejaculated Sam both on em both on em As true as God s my mercy both on em same chap Ah missus Mallerton was afraid to tell her husband at first for old Harry was the devil born again when he were roused up so she sent for young William herself who d not come again of course not likely But they made him come O yes when they told the girl s father Well may I go to my d d d damnation at once roared old Harry he stuttered you know at once if that ain t a good one So he took off his coat he took up a stick he walked down street to William and cut him off his legs Then he beat him till he howled for his mercy but you couldn t stop old Harry once he were roused up he was the devil born again They do say as he beat him for a solid hour I can t say as to that but then old Harry picked him up and carried him off to The British Oak on his own back and threw him down in his own kitchen between his own two girls like a dead dog They do say that the little one Agnes flew at her father like a raging cat until he knocked her senseless with a clout over head rough man he was Well a called for it sure commented Sam Her did agreed Bob but she was the quietest known girl for miles round those parts very shy and quiet A shady lane breeds mud said Sam What do you say O ah mud yes But pretty girls both girls you could get very fond of skin like apple bloom and as like as two pinks they were They had to decide which of them William was to marry Of course ah I ll marry Agnes says he You ll not says the old man you ll marry Edie No I won t William says it s Agnes I love and I ll be married to her or I won t be married to e er of em All the time Edith sat quiet dumb as a shovel never a word crying a bit but they do say the young one went on like a a young Jew The jezebel commented Sam You may say it but wait my man just wait Another cup of beer We can t go back to church until this humbugging rain have stopped No that we can t It s my belief the bugging rain won t stop this side of four And if the roof don t hold it off it ull spoil the Lord s Commandments that s just done up on the chancel front Oh they be dry by now spoke Bob reassuringly and then continued his tale I ll marry Agnes or I won t marry nobody William says and they couldn t budge him No old Harry cracked on but he wouldn t have it and at last Harry says It s like this He pulls a half crown out of his pocket and Heads it s Agnes he says or tails it s Edith he says Never Ha ha cried Sam Heads it s Agnes tails it s Edie so help me God And it come down Agnes yes heads it was Agnes and so there they were And they lived happy ever after Happy You don t know your human nature Sam wherever was you brought up Heads it s Agnes said old Harry and at that Agnes flung her arms round William s neck and was for going off with him then and there ha But this is how it happened about that William hadn t any kindred he was a lodger in the village and his landlady wouldn t have him in her house one mortal hour when she heard all of it give him the right about there and then He couldn t get lodgings anywhere else nobody would have anything to do with him so of course for safety s sake old Harry had to take him and there they all lived together at The British Oak all in one happy family But they girls couldn t bide the sight of each other so their father cleaned up an old outhouse in his yard that was used for carts and hens and put William and his Agnes out in it And there they had to bide They had a couple of chairs a sofa and a bed and that kind of thing and the young one made it quite snug Twas a hard thing for that other that Edie Bob It was hard Sam in a way and all this was happening just afore I met her in the carrier s van She was very sad and solemn then a pretty girl one you could like Ah you may choke me but there they lived together Edie never opened her lips to either of them again and her father sided with her too What was worse it came out after the marriage that Agnes was quite free of trouble it was only a trumped up game between her and this William because he fancied her better than the other one And they never had no child them two though when poor Edie s mischance come along I be damned if Agnes weren t fonder of it than its own mother a jolly sight more fonder and William he fair worshipped it You don t say I do Twas a rum go that and Agnes worshipped it a fact can prove it by scores o people to this day scores in them parts William and Agnes worshipped it and Edie she just looked on long of it all in the same house with them though she never opened her lips again to her young sister to the day of her death Ah she died Well it s the only way out of such a tangle poor woman You re sympathizing with the wrong party Bob filled his pipe again from the brass box he ignited it with deliberation going to the open window he spat into a puddle in the road The wrong party Sam twas Agnes that died She was found on the sofa one morning stone dead dead as a adder God bless me murmured Sam Poisoned added Bob puffing serenely Poisoned Bob repeated the word poisoned This was the way of it he continued One morning the mother went out in the yard to collect her eggs and she began calling out Edie Edie here a minute come and look where that hen have laid her egg I would never have believed it she says And when Edie went out her mother led her round the back of the outhouse and there on the top of a wall this hen had laid an egg I would never have believed it Edie she says scooped out a nest there beautiful ain t she I wondered where her was laying T other morning the dog brought an egg round in his mouth and laid it on the doormat There now Aggie Aggie here a minute come and look where the hen have laid that egg And as Aggie didn t answer the mother went in and found her on the sofa in the outhouse stone dead How d they account for it asked Sam after a brief interval That s what brings me to the point about this young feller that s going to be hung said Bob tapping the newspaper that lay upon the bench I don t know what would lie between two young women in a wrangle of that sort some would get over it quick but some would never sleep soundly any more not for a minute of their mortal lives Edie must have been one of that sort There s people living there now as could tell a lot if they d a mind to it Some knowed all about it could tell you the very shop where Edith managed to get hold of the poison and could describe to me or to you just how she administrated it in a glass of barley water Old Harry knew all about it he knew all about everything but he favoured Edith and he never budged a word Clever old chap was Harry and nothing came out against Edie at the inquest nor the trial either Was there a trial then There was a kind of a trial Naturally A beautiful trial The police came and fetched poor William they took him away and in due course he was hanged William But what had he got to do with it Nothing It was rough on him but he hadn t played straight and so nobody struck up for him They made out a case against him there was some onlucky bit of evidence which I ll take my oath old Harry knew something about and William was done for Ah when things take a turn against you it s as certain as twelve o clock when they take a turn you get no more chance than a rabbit from a weasel It s like dropping your matches into a stream you needn t waste the bending of your back to pick them out they re no good on they ll never strike again And Edith she sat in court through it all very white and trembling and sorrowful but when the judge put his black cap on they do say she blushed and looked across at William and gave a bit of a smile Well she had to suffer for his doings so why shouldn t he suffer for hers That s how I look at it But God a mighty Yes God a mighty knows Pretty girls they were both and as like as two pinks There was quiet for some moments while the tiler and the mason emptied their cups of beer I think said Sam then the rain s give over now Ah that it has cried Bob Let s go and do a bit more on this bugging church or she won t be done afore Christmas THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT By RICHMAL CROMPTON From Truth nineteen twenty two Mary Clay looked out of the window of the old farmhouse The view was dreary enough hill and field and woodland bare colourless mist covered with no other house in sight She had never been a woman to crave for company She liked sewing She was passionately fond of reading She was not fond of talking Probably she could have been very happy at Cromb Farm alone Before her marriage she had looked forward to the long evenings with her sewing and reading She knew that she would be busy enough in the day for the farmhouse was old and rambling and she was to have no help in the housework But she looked forward to quiet peaceful lamplit evenings and only lately after ten years of married life had she reluctantly given up the hope of them For peace was far enough from the old farm kitchen in the evening It was driven away by John Clay s loud voice raised always in orders or complaints or in the stumbling incoherent reading aloud of his newspaper Mary was a silent woman herself and a lover of silence But John liked to hear the sound of his voice he liked to shout at her to call for her from one room to another above all he liked to hear his voice reading the paper out loud to her in the evening She dreaded that most of all It had lately seemed to jar on her nerves till she felt she must scream aloud His voice going on and on raucous and sing song became unspeakably irritating His Mary summoning her from her household work to wherever he happened to be his Get my slippers or Bring me my pipe exasperated her almost to the point of rebellion Get your own slippers had trembled on her lips but had never passed them for she was a woman who could not bear anger Noise of any kind appalled her She had borne it for ten years so surely she could go on with it Yet today as she gazed hopelessly at the wintry country side she became acutely conscious that she could not go on with it Something must happen Yet what was there that could happen It was Christmas next week She smiled ironically at the thought Then she noticed the figure of her husband coming up the road He came in at the gate and round to the side door Mary She went slowly in answer to the summons He held a letter in his hand Met the postman he said From your aunt She opened the letter and read it in silence Both of them knew quite well what it contained She wants us to go over for Christmas again said Mary He began to grumble She s as deaf as a post She s most as deaf as her mother was She ought to know better than to ask folks over when she can t hear a word any one says Mary said nothing He always grumbled about the invitation at first but really he wanted to go He liked to talk with her uncle He liked the change of going down to the village for a few days and hearing all its gossip He could quite well leave the farm to the hands for that time The Crewe deafness was proverbial Mary s great grandmother had gone stone deaf at the age of thirty five her daughter had inherited the affliction and her grand daughter the aunt with whom Mary had spent her childhood had inherited it also at exactly the same age All right he said at last grudgingly as though in answer to her silence we d better go Write and say we ll go It was Christmas Eve They were in the kitchen of her uncle s farmhouse The deaf old woman sat in her chair by the fire knitting Upon her sunken face there was a curious sardonic smile that was her habitual expression The two men stood in the doorway Mary sat at the table looking aimlessly out of the window Outside the snow fell in blinding showers Inside the fire gleamed on to the copper pots and pans the crockery on the old oak dresser the hams hanging from the ceiling Suddenly James turned Jane he said The deaf woman never stirred Jane Still there was no response upon the enigmatic old face by the fireside Jane She turned slightly towards the voice Get them photos from upstairs to show John he bawled What about boats she said Photos roared her husband Coats she quavered Mary looked from one to the other The man made a gesture of irritation and went from the room He came back with a pile of picture postcards in his hand It s quicker to do a thing oneself he grumbled They re what my brother sent from Switzerland where he s working now It s a fine land to judge from the views of it John took them from his hand She gets worse he said nodding towards the old woman She was sitting gazing at the fire her lips curved into the curious smile Her husband shrugged his shoulders Aye She s nigh as bad as her mother was And her grandmother Aye It takes longer to tell her to do something than to do it myself And deaf folks get a bit stupid too Can t see what you mean They re best let alone The other man nodded and lit his pipe Then James opened the door The snow s stopped he said Shall we go to the end of the village and back The other nodded and took his cap from behind the door A gust of cold air filled the room as they went out Mary took a paper backed book from the table and came over to the fireplace Mary She started It was not the sharp querulous voice of the deaf old woman it was more like the voice of the young aunt whom Mary remembered in childhood The old woman was leaning forward looking at her intently Mary A happy Christmas to ee And as if in spite of herself Mary answered in her ordinary low tones The same to you auntie Thank ee Thank ee Mary gasped Aunt Can you hear me speaking like this The old woman laughed silently rocking to and fro in her chair as if with pent up merriment of years Yes I can hear ee child I ve allus heard ee Mary clasped her hand eagerly Then you re cured Aunt Ay I m cured as far as there was ever anything to be cured You I was never deaf child nor never will be please God I ve took you all in fine Mary stood up in bewilderment You Never deaf The old woman chuckled again No nor my mother nor her mother neither Mary shrank back from her I I don t know what you mean she said unsteadily Have you been pretending I ll make you a Christmas present of it dearie said the old woman My mother made me a Christmas present of it when I was your age and her mother made her one I haven t a lass of my own to give it to so I give it to you It can come on quite sudden like if you want it and then you can hear what you choose and not hear what you choose Do you see She leant nearer and whispered You re shut out of it all of having to fetch and carry for em answer their daft questions and run their errands like a dog I ve watched you my lass You don t get much peace do you Mary was trembling Oh I don t know what to think she said I I couldn t do it Do what you like said the old woman Take it as a present anyways the Crewe deafness for a Christmas present she chuckled Use it or not as you like You ll find it main amusin anyways And into the old face there came again that curious smile as if she carried in her heart some jest fit for the gods on Olympus The door opened suddenly with another gust of cold air and the two men came in again covered with fine snow I I ll not do it whispered Mary trembling We didn t get far It s coming on again remarked John hanging up his cap The old woman rose and began to lay the supper silently and deftly moving from cupboard to table without looking up Mary sat by the fire motionless and speechless her eyes fixed on the glowing coals Any signs o the deafness in her whispered James looking towards Mary It come on my wife jus when she was that age Aye So I ve heered Then he said loudly Mary A faint pink colour came into her cheeks but she did not show by look or movement that she had heard James looked significantly at her husband The old woman stood still for a minute with a cup in each hand and smiled her slow subtle smile SEATON S AUNT By WALTER DE LA MARE From The London Mercury nineteen twenty two I had heard rumours of Seaton s Aunt long before I actually encountered her Seaton in the hush of confidence or at any little show of toleration on our part would remark My aunt or My old aunt you know as if his relative might be a kind of cement to an entente cordiale He had an unusual quantity of pocket money or at any rate it was bestowed on him in unusually large amounts and he spent it freely though none of us would have described him as an awfully generous chap Hullo Seaton he would say the old Begum At the beginning of term too he used to bring back surprising and exotic dainties in a box with a trick padlock that accompanied him from his first appearance at Gummidge s in a billycock hat to the rather abrupt conclusion of his school days From a boy s point of view he looked distastefully foreign with his yellow skin and slow chocolate coloured eyes and lean weak figure Merely for his looks he was treated by most of us true blue Englishmen with condescension hostility or contempt We used to call him Pongo but without any better excuse for the nickname than his skin He was that is in one sense of the term what he assuredly was not in the other sense a sport Seaton and I were never in any sense intimate at school our orbits only intersected in class I kept instinctively aloof from him I felt vaguely he was a sneak and remained quite unmollified by advances on his side which in a boy s barbarous fashion unless it suited me to be magnanimous I haughtily ignored We were both of us quick footed and at Prisoner s Base used occasionally to hide together And so I best remember Seaton his narrow watchful face in the dusk of summer evening his peculiar crouch and his inarticulate whisperings and mumblings Otherwise he played all games slackly and limply used to stand and feed at his locker with a crony or two until his tuck gave out or waste his money on some outlandish fancy or other He bought for instance a silver bangle which he wore above his left elbow until some of the fellows showed their masterly contempt of the practice by dropping it nearly red hot down his neck It needed therefore a rather peculiar taste a rather rare kind of schoolboy courage and indifference to criticism to be much associated with him And I had neither the taste nor the courage None the less he did make advances and on one memorable occasion went to the length of bestowing on me a whole pot of some outlandish mulberry coloured jelly that had been duplicated in his term s supplies In the exuberance of my gratitude I promised to spend the next half term holiday with him at his aunt s house I had clean forgotten my promise when two or three days before the holiday he came up and triumphantly reminded me of it Well to tell you the honest truth Seaton old chap I began graciously but he cut me short My aunt expects you he said she is very glad you are coming She s sure to be quite decent to you Withers I looked at him in some astonishment the emphasis was unexpected It seemed to suggest an aunt not hitherto hinted at and a friendly feeling on Seaton s side that was more disconcerting than welcome We reached his home partly by train partly by a lift in an empty farm cart and partly by walking It was a whole day holiday and we were to sleep the night he lent me extraordinary night gear I remember The village street was unusually wide and was fed from a green by two converging roads with an inn and a high green sign at the corner About a hundred yards down the street was a chemist s shop mister Tanner s We descended the two steps into his dusky and odorous interior to buy I remember some rat poison A little beyond the chemist s was the forge You then walked along a very narrow path under a fairly high wall nodding here and there with weeds and tufts of grass and so came to the iron garden gates and saw the high flat house behind its huge sycamore A coach house stood on the left of the house and on the right a gate led into a kind of rambling orchard The lawn lay away over to the left again and at the bottom for the whole garden sloped gently to a sluggish and rushy pond like stream was a meadow We arrived at noon and entered the gates out of the hot dust beneath the glitter of the dark curtained windows Seaton led me at once through the little garden gate to show me his tadpole pond swarming with what being myself not the least bit of a naturalist I considered the most horrible creatures of all shapes consistencies and sizes but with whom Seaton seemed to be on the most intimate of terms I can see his absorbed face now as he sat on his heels and fished the slimy things out in his sallow palms Wearying at last of his pets we loitered about awhile in an aimless fashion Seaton seemed to be listening or at any rate waiting for something to happen or for some one to come But nothing did happen and no one came That was just like Seaton Anyhow the first view I got of his aunt was when at the summons of a distant gong we turned from the garden very hungry and thirsty to go into luncheon We were approaching the house when Seaton suddenly came to a standstill Indeed I have always had the impression that he plucked at my sleeve Something at least seemed to catch me back as it were as he cried Look out there she is She was standing in an upper window which opened wide on a hinge and at first sight she looked an excessively tall and overwhelming figure This however was mainly because the window reached all but to the floor of her bedroom She was in reality rather an under sized woman in spite of her long face and big head She must have stood I think unusually still with eyes fixed on us though this impression may be due to Seaton s sudden warning and to my consciousness of the cautious and subdued air that had fallen on him at sight of her I know that without the least reason in the world I felt a kind of guiltiness as if I had been caught There was a silvery star pattern sprinkled on her black silk dress and even from the ground I could see the immense coils of her hair and the rings on her left hand which was held fingering the small jet buttons of her bodice She watched our united advance without stirring until imperceptibly her eyes raised and lost themselves in the distance so that it was out of an assumed reverie that she appeared suddenly to awaken to our presence beneath her when we drew close to the house So this is your friend mister Smithers I suppose she said bobbing to me Withers aunt said Seaton It s much the same she said with eyes fixed on me Come in mister Withers and bring him along with you She continued to gaze at me at least I think she did so I know that the fixity of her scrutiny and her ironical mister made me feel peculiarly uncomfortable But she was extremely kind and attentive to me though perhaps her kindness and attention showed up more vividly against her complete neglect of Seaton Only one remark that I have any recollection of she made to him When I look on my nephew mister Smithers I realise that dust we are and dust shall become You are hot dirty and incorrigible Arthur She sat at the head of the table Seaton at the foot and I before a wide waste of damask tablecloth between them It was an old and rather close dining room with windows thrown wide to the green garden and a wonderful cascade of fading roses Miss Seaton s great chair faced this window so that its rose reflected light shone full on her yellowish face and on just such chocolate eyes as my schoolfellow s except that hers were more than half covered by unusually long and heavy lids There she sat eating with those sluggish eyes fixed for the most part on my face above them stood the deep lined fork between her eyebrows and above that the wide expanse of a remarkable brow beneath its strange steep bank of hair The lunch was copious and consisted I remember of all such dishes as are generally considered mischievous and too good for the schoolboy digestion lobster mayonnaise cold game sausages an immense veal and ham pie farced with eggs and numberless delicious flavours besides sauces kickshaws creams and sweetmeats We even had wine a half glass of old darkish sherry each Miss Seaton enjoyed and indulged an enormous appetite Her example and a natural schoolboy voracity soon overcame my nervousness of her even to the extent of allowing me to enjoy to the best of my bent so rare a spread Seaton was singularly modest the greater part of his meal consisted of almonds and raisins which he nibbled surreptitiously and as if he found difficulty in swallowing them I don t mean that Miss Seaton conversed with me She merely scattered trenchant remarks and now and then twinkled a baited question over my head But her face was like a dense and involved accompaniment to her talk She presently dropped the mister to my intense relief and called me now Withers or Wither now Smithers and even once towards the close of the meal distinctly Johnson though how on earth my name suggested it or whose face mine had reanimated in memory I cannot conceive And is Arthur a good boy at school mister Wither was one of her many questions Does he please his masters Is he first in his class What does the reverend doctor Gummidge think of him eh I knew she was jeering at him but her face was adamant against the least flicker of sarcasm or facetiousness I gazed fixedly at a blushing crescent of lobster I think you re eighth aren t you Seaton Seaton moved his small pupils towards his aunt But she continued to gaze with a kind of concentrated detachment at me Arthur will never make a brilliant scholar I fear she said lifting a dexterously burdened fork to her wide mouth After luncheon she preceded me up to my bedroom It was a jolly little bedroom with a brass fender and rugs and a polished floor on which it was possible I afterwards found to play snow shoes Over the washstand was a little black framed water colour drawing depicting a large eye with an extremely fishlike intensity in the spark of light on the dark pupil and in illuminated lettering beneath was printed very minutely Thou God Seest ME followed by a long looped monogram S S in the corner The other pictures were all of the sea brigs on blue water a schooner overtopping chalk cliffs a rocky island of prodigious steepness with two tiny sailors dragging a monstrous boat up a shelf of beach This is the room Withers my brother William died in when a boy Admire the view I looked out of the window across the tree tops It was a day hot with sunshine over the green fields and the cattle were standing swishing their tails in the shallow water But the view at the moment was only exaggeratedly vivid because I was horribly dreading that she would presently enquire after my luggage and I had not brought even a toothbrush I need have had no fear Hers was not that highly civilised type of mind that is stuffed with sharp material details Nor could her ample presence be described as in the least motherly I would never consent to question a schoolfellow behind my nephew s back she said standing in the middle of the room but tell me Smithers why is Arthur so unpopular You I understand are his only close friend She stood in a dazzle of sun and out of it her eyes regarded me with such leaden penetration beneath their thick lids that I doubt if my face concealed the least thought from her But there there she added very suavely stooping her head a little don t trouble to answer me I never extort an answer Boys are queer fish Brains might perhaps have suggested his washing his hands before luncheon but not my choice Smithers God forbid And now perhaps you would like to go into the garden again I cannot actually see from here but I should not be surprised if Arthur is now skulking behind that hedge He was I saw his head come out and take a rapid glance at the windows Join him mister Smithers we shall meet again I hope at the tea table The afternoon I spend in retirement Whether or not Seaton and I had not been long engaged with the aid of two green switches in riding round and round a lumbering old gray horse we found in the meadow before a rather bunched up figure appeared walking along the field path on the other side of the water with a magenta parasol studiously lowered in our direction throughout her slow progress as if that were the magnetic needle and we the fixed pole Seaton at once lost all nerve in his riding At the next lurch of the old mare s heels he toppled over into the grass and I slid off the sleek broad back to join him where he stood rubbing his shoulder and sourly watching the rather pompous figure till it was out of sight Was that your aunt Seaton I enquired but not till then He nodded Why didn t she take any notice of us then She never does Why not Oh she knows all right without that s the dam awful part of it Seaton was about the only fellow at Gummidge s who ever had the ostentation to use bad language He had suffered for it too But it wasn t I think bravado I believe he really felt certain things more intensely than most of the other fellows and they were generally things that fortunate and average people do not feel at all the peculiar quality for instance of the British schoolboy s imagination I tell you Withers he went on moodily slinking across the meadow with his hands covered up in his pockets she sees everything And what she doesn t see she knows without But how I said not because I was much interested but because the afternoon was so hot and tiresome and purposeless and it seemed more of a bore to remain silent Seaton turned gloomily and spoke in a very low voice Don t appear to be talking of her if you wouldn t mind It s because she s in league with the devil He nodded his head and stooped to pick up a round flat pebble I tell you he said still stooping you fellows don t realise what it is I know I m a bit close and all that But so would you be if you had that old hag listening to every thought you think I looked at him then turned and surveyed one by one the windows of the house Where s your pater I said awkwardly Dead ages and ages ago and my mother too She s not my aunt by rights What is she then I mean she s not my mother s sister because my grandmother married twice and she s one of the first lot I don t know what you call her but anyhow she s not my real aunt She gives you plenty of pocket money Seaton looked steadfastly at me out of his flat eyes She can t give me what s mine When I come of age half of the whole lot will be mine and what s more he turned his back on the house I ll make her hand over every blessed shilling of it I put my hands in my pockets and stared at Seaton Is it much He nodded Who told you He got suddenly very angry a darkish red came into his cheeks his eyes glistened but he made no answer and we loitered listlessly about the garden until it was time for tea Seaton s aunt was wearing an extraordinary kind of lace jacket when we sidled sheepishly into the drawing room together She greeted me with a heavy and protracted smile and bade me bring a chair close to the little table I hope Arthur has made you feel at home she said as she handed me my cup in her crooked hand He don t talk much to me but then I m an old woman You must come again Wither and draw him out of his shell You old snail She wagged her head at Seaton who sat munching cake and watching her intently And we must correspond perhaps She nearly shut her eyes at me You must write and tell me everything behind the creature s back I confess I found her rather disquieting company The evening drew on Lamps were brought by a man with a nondescript face and very quiet footsteps Seaton was told to bring out the chess men And we played a game she and I with her big chin thrust over the board at every move as she gloated over the pieces and occasionally croaked Check after which she would sit back inscrutably staring at me But the game was never finished She simply hemmed me defencelessly in with a cloud of men that held me impotent and yet one and all refused to administer to my poor flustered old king a merciful coup de grace There she said as the clock struck ten a drawn game Withers We are very evenly matched A very creditable defence Withers You know your room There s supper on a tray in the dining room Don t let the creature over eat himself The gong will sound three quarters of an hour before a punctual breakfast She held out her cheek to Seaton and he kissed it with obvious perfunctoriness With me she shook hands An excellent game she said cordially but my memory is poor and she swept the pieces helter skelter into the box the result will never be known She raised her great head far back Eh It was a kind of challenge and I could only murmur Oh I was absolutely in a hole you know when she burst out laughing and waved us both out of the room Seaton and I stood and ate our supper with one candlestick to light us in a corner of the dining room Well and how would you like it he said very softly after cautiously poking his head round the doorway Like what Being spied on every blessed thing you do and think I shouldn t like it at all I said if she does And yet you let her smash you up at chess I didn t let her I said indignantly Well you funked it then And I didn t funk it either I said she s so jolly clever with her knights Seaton stared fixedly at the candle You wait that s all he said slowly And we went upstairs to bed I had not been long in bed I think when I was cautiously awakened by a touch on my shoulder And there was Seaton s face in the candlelight and his eyes looking into mine What s up I said rising quickly to my elbow Don t scurry he whispered or she ll hear I m sorry for waking you but I didn t think you d be asleep so soon Why what s the time then Seaton wore what was then rather unusual a night suit and he hauled his big silver watch out of the pocket in his jacket It s a quarter to twelve I never get to sleep before twelve not here What do you do then Oh I read and listen Listen Seaton stared into his candle flame as if he were listening even then You can t guess what it is All you read in ghost stories that s all rot You can t see much Withers but you know all the same Know what Why that they re there Who s there I asked fretfully glancing at the door Why in the house It swarms with em Just you stand still and listen outside my bedroom door in the middle of the night I have dozens of times they re all over the place Look here Seaton I said you asked me to come here and I didn t mind chucking up a leave just to oblige you and because I d promised but don t get talking a lot of rot that s all or you ll know the difference when we get back Don t fret he said coldly turning away I shan t be at school long And what s more you re here now and there isn t anybody else to talk to I ll chance the other Look here Seaton I said you may think you re going to scare me with a lot of stuff about voices and all that But I ll just thank you to clear out and you may please yourself about pottering about all night He made no answer he was standing by the dressing table looking across his candle into the looking glass he turned and stared slowly round the walls Even this room s nothing more than a coffin I suppose she told you It s all exactly the same as when my brother William died trust her for that And good luck to him say I Look at that He raised his candle close to the little water colour I have mentioned There s hundreds of eyes like that in the house and even if God does see you he takes precious good care you don t see Him And it s just the same with them I tell you what Withers I m getting sick of all this I shan t stand it much longer The house was silent within and without and even in the yellowish radiance of the candle a faint silver showed through the open window on my blind I slipped off the bedclothes wide awake and sat irresolute on the bedside I know you re only guying me I said angrily but why is the house full of what you say Why do you hear what you do hear Tell me that you silly foal Seaton sat down on a chair and rested his candlestick on his knee He blinked at me calmly She brings them he said with lifted eyebrows Who Your aunt He nodded How I told you he answered pettishly She s in league You don t know She as good as killed my mother I know that But it s not only her by a long chalk She just sucks you dry I know And that s what she ll do for me because I m like her like my mother I mean She simply hates to see me alive I wouldn t be like that old she wolf for a million pounds And so he broke off with a comprehensive wave of his candlestick they re always here Ah my boy wait till she s dead She ll hear something then I can tell you It s all very well now but wait till then I wouldn t be in her shoes when she has to clear out for something Don t you go and believe I care for ghosts or whatever you like to call them We re all in the same box We re all under her thumb He was looking almost nonchalantly at the ceiling at the moment when I saw his face change saw his eyes suddenly drop like shot birds and fix themselves on the cranny of the door he had just left ajar Even from where I sat I could see his colour change he went greenish He crouched without stirring simply fixed And I scarcely daring to breathe sat with creeping skin simply watching him His hands relaxed and he gave a kind of sigh Was that one I whispered with a timid show of jauntiness He looked round opened his mouth and nodded What I said He jerked his thumb with meaningful eyes and I knew that he meant that his aunt had been there listening at our door cranny Look here Seaton I said once more wriggling to my feet You may think I m a jolly noodle just as you please But your aunt has been civil to me and all that and I don t believe a word you say about her that s all and never did Every fellow s a bit off his pluck at night and you may think it a fine sport to try your rubbish on me I heard your aunt come upstairs before I fell asleep And I ll bet you a level tanner she s in bed now What s more you can keep your blessed ghosts to yourself It s a guilty conscience I should think Seaton looked at me curiously without answering for a moment I m not a liar Withers but I m not going to quarrel either You re the only chap I care a button for or at any rate you re the only chap that s ever come here and it s something to tell a fellow what you feel I don t care a fig for fifty thousand ghosts although I swear on my solemn oath that I know they re here But she he turned deliberately you laid a tanner she s in bed Withers well I know different She s never in bed much of the night and I ll prove it too just to show you I m not such a nolly as you think I am Come on Come on where Why to see I hesitated He opened a large cupboard and took out a small dark dressing gown and a kind of shawl jacket He threw the jacket on the bed and put on the gown His dusky face was colourless and I could see by the way he fumbled at the sleeves he was shivering But it was no good showing the white feather now So I threw the tasselled shawl over my shoulders and leaving our candle brightly burning on the chair we went out together and stood in the corridor Now then listen Seaton whispered We stood leaning over the staircase It was like leaning over a well so still and chill the air was all around us But presently as I suppose happens in most old houses began to echo and answer in my ears a medley of infinite small stirrings and whisperings Now out of the distance an old timber would relax its fibers or a scurry die away behind the perishing wainscot But amid and behind such sounds as these I seemed to begin to be conscious as it were of the lightest of footfalls sounds as faint as the vanishing remembrance of voices in a dream Seaton was all in obscurity except his face out of that his eyes gleamed darkly watching me You d hear too in time my fine soldier he muttered Come on He descended the stairs slipping his lean fingers lightly along the balusters He turned to the right at the loop and I followed him barefooted along a thickly carpeted corridor At the end stood a door ajar And from here we very stealthily and in complete blackness ascended five narrow stairs Seaton with immense caution slowly pushed open a door and we stood together looking into a great pool of duskiness out of which lit by the feeble clearness of a night light rose a vast bed A heap of clothes lay on the floor beside them two slippers dozed with noses each to each two yards apart Somewhere a little clock ticked huskily There was a rather close smell of lavender and eau de Cologne mingled with the fragrance of ancient sachets soap and drugs Yet it was a scent even more peculiarly commingled than that And the bed I stared warily in it was mounded gigantically and it was empty Seaton turned a vague pale face all shadows What did I say he muttered Who s who s the fool now I say How are we going to get back without meeting her I say Answer me that Oh I wish to goodness you hadn t come here Withers He stood visibly shivering in his skimpy gown and could hardly speak for his teeth chattering And very distinctly in the hush that followed his whisper I heard approaching a faint unhurried voluminous rustle Seaton clutched my arm dragged me to the right across the room to a large cupboard and drew the door close to on us And presently as with bursting lungs I peeped out into the long low curtained bedroom waddled in that wonderful great head and body I can see her now all patched and lined with shadow her tied up hair she must have had enormous quantities of it for so old a woman her heavy lids above those flat slow vigilant eyes She just passed across my ken in the vague dusk but the bed was out of sight We waited on and on listening to the clock s muffled ticking Not the ghost of a sound rose up from the great bed Either she lay archly listening or slept a sleep serener than an infant s And when it seemed we had been hours in hiding and were cramped chilled and half suffocated we crept out on all fours with terror knocking at our ribs and so down the five narrow stairs and back to the little candle lit blue and gold bedroom Once there Seaton gave in He sat livid on a chair with closed eyes Here I said shaking his arm I m going to bed I ve had enough of this foolery I m going to bed His lids quivered but he made no answer I poured out some water into my basin and with that cold pictured azure eye fixed on us bespattered Seaton s sallow face and forehead and dabbled his hair He presently sighed and opened fish like eyes Come on I said Don t get shamming there s a good chap Get on my back if you like and I ll carry you into your bedroom He waved me away and stood up So with my candle in one hand I took him under the arm and walked him along according to his direction down the corridor His was a much dingier room than mine and littered with boxes paper cages and clothes I huddled him into bed and turned to go And suddenly I can hardly explain it now a kind of cold and deadly terror swept over me I almost ran out of the room with eyes fixed rigidly in front of me blew out my candle and buried my head under the bedclothes When I awoke roused by a long continued tapping at my door sunlight was raying in on cornice and bedpost and birds were singing in the garden I got up ashamed of the night s folly dressed quickly and went downstairs The breakfast room was sweet with flowers and fruit and honey Seaton s aunt was standing in the garden beside the open French window feeding a great flutter of birds I watched her for a moment unseen Her face was set in a deep reverie beneath the shadow of a big loose sunhat It was deeply lined crooked and in a way I can t describe fixedly vacant and strange I coughed and she turned at once with a prodigious smile to inquire how I had slept And in that mysterious way by which we learn each other s secret thoughts without a sentence spoken I knew that she had followed every word and movement of the night before and was triumphing over my affected innocence and ridiculing my friendly and too easy advances We returned to school Seaton and I lavishly laden and by rail all the way I made no reference to the obscure talk we had had and resolutely refused to meet his eyes or to take up the hints he let fall I was relieved and yet I was sorry to be going back and strode on as fast as I could from the station with Seaton almost trotting at my heels But he insisted on buying more fruit and sweets my share of which I accepted with a very bad grace It was uncomfortably like a bribe and after all I had no quarrel with his rum old aunt and hadn t really believed half the stuff he had told me I saw as little of him as I could after that He never referred to our visit or resumed his confidences though in class I would sometimes catch his eye fixed on mine full of a mute understanding which I easily affected not to understand He left Gummidge s as I have said rather abruptly though I never heard of anything to his discredit And I did not see him or have any news of him again till by chance we met one summer s afternoon in the Strand He was dressed rather oddly in a coat too large for him and a bright silky tie But we instantly recognised one another under the awning of a cheap jeweler s shop He immediately attached himself to me and dragged me off not too cheerfully to lunch with him at an Italian restaurant near by He chattered about our old school which he remembered only with dislike and disgust told me cold bloodedly of the disastrous fate of one or two of the old fellows who had been among his chief tormentors insisted on an expensive wine and the whole gamut of the rich menu and finally informed me with a good deal of niggling that he had come up to town to buy an engagement ring And of course How is your aunt I enquired at last He seemed to have been awaiting the question It fell like a stone into a deep pool so many expressions flitted across his long un English face She s aged a good deal he said softly and broke off She s been very decent he continued presently after and paused again In a way He eyed me fleetingly I dare say you heard that she that is that we had lost a good deal of money No I said Oh yes said Seaton and paused again And somehow poor fellow I knew in the clink and clatter of glass and voices that he had lied to me that he did not possess and never had possessed a penny beyond what his aunt had squandered on his too ample allowance of pocket money And the ghosts I enquired quizzically He grew instantly solemn and though it may have been my fancy slightly yellowed But You are making game of me Withers was all he said He asked for my address and I rather reluctantly gave him my card Look here Withers he said as we stood in the sunlight on the thronging kerb saying good bye here I am and it s all very well I m not perhaps as fanciful as I was But you are practically the only friend I have on earth except Alice And there to make a clean breast of it I m not sure that my aunt cares much about my getting married She doesn t say so of course You know her well enough for that He looked sidelong at the rattling gaudy traffic What I was going to say is this Would you mind coming down You needn t stay the night unless you please though of course you know you would be awfully welcome But I should like you to meet my to meet Alice and then perhaps you might tell me your honest opinion of of the other too I vaguely demurred He pressed me And we parted with a half promise that I would come He waved his ball topped cane at me and ran off in his long jacket after a bus A letter arrived soon after in his small weak handwriting giving me full particulars regarding route and trains And without the least curiosity even perhaps with some little annoyance that chance should have thrown us together again I accepted his invitation and arrived one hazy midday at his out of the way station to find him sitting on a low seat under a clump of double hollyhocks awaiting me His face looked absent and singularly listless but he seemed none the less pleased to see me We walked up the village street past the little dingy apothecary s and the empty forge and as on my first visit skirted the house together and instead of entering by the front door made our way down the green path into the garden at the back A pale haze of cloud muffled the sun the garden lay in a grey shimmer its old trees its snap dragoned faintly glittering walls But there seemed now an air of neglect where before all had been neat and methodical There was a patch of shallowly dug soil and a worn down spade leaning against a tree There was an old broken wheelbarrow The goddess of neglect was there You ain t much of a gardener Seaton I said with a sigh of ease I think do you know I like it best like this said Seaton We haven t any gardener now of course Can t afford it He stood staring at his little dark square of freshly turned earth And it always seems to me he went on ruminatingly that after all we are nothing better than interlopers on the earth disfiguring and staining wherever we go I know it s shocking blasphemy to say so but then it s different here you see We are farther away To tell you the truth Seaton I don t quite see I said but it isn t a new philosophy is it Anyhow it s a precious beastly one It s only what I think he replied with all his odd old stubborn meekness We wandered on together talking little and still with that expression of uneasy vigilance on Seaton s face He pulled out his watch as we stood gazing idly over the green meadow and the dark motionless bulrushes I think perhaps it s nearly time for lunch he said Would you like to come in We turned and walked slowly towards the house across whose windows I confess my own eyes too went restlessly wandering in search of its rather disconcerting inmate There was a pathetic look of draggledness of want of means and care rust and overgrowth and faded paint Seaton s aunt a little to my relief did not share our meal Seaton carved the cold meat and dispatched a heaped up plate by the elderly servant for his aunt s private consumption We talked little and in half suppressed tones and sipped a bottle of Madeira which Seaton had rather heedfully fetched out of the great mahogany sideboard I played him a dull and effortless game of chess yawning between the moves he generally made almost at haphazard and with attention elsewhere engaged About five o clock came the sound of a distant ring and Seaton jumped up overturning the board and so ending a game that else might have fatuously continued to this day He effusively excused himself and after some little while returned with a slim dark rather sallow girl of about nineteen in a white gown and hat to whom I was presented with some little nervousness as his dear old friend and schoolfellow We talked on in the pale afternoon light still as it seemed to me and even in spite of real effort to be clear and gay in a half suppressed lack lustre fashion We all seemed if it were not my fancy to be expectant to be rather anxiously awaiting an arrival the appearance of someone who all but filled our collective consciousness Seaton talked least of all and in a restless interjectory way as he continually fidgeted from chair to chair At last he proposed a stroll in the garden before the sun should have quite gone down Alice walked between us Her hair and eyes were conspicuously dark against the whiteness of her gown She carried herself not ungracefully and yet without the least movement of her arms or body and answered us both without turning her head There was a curious provocative reserve in that impassive and rather long face a half unconscious strength of character And yet somehow I knew I believe we all knew that this walk this discussion of their future plans was a futility I had nothing to base such a cynicism on except only a vague sense of oppression the foreboding remembrance of the inert invincible power in the background to whom optimistic plans and love making and youth are as chaff and thistledown We came back silent in the last light Seaton s aunt was there under an old brass lamp Her hair was as barbarously massed and curled as ever Her eye lids I think hung even a little heavier in age over their slow moving inscrutable pupils We filed in softly out of the evening and I made my bow In this short interval mister Withers she remarked amiably you have put off youth put on the man Dear me how sad it is to see the young days vanishing Sit down My nephew tells me you met by chance or act of Providence shall we call it and in my beloved Strand You I understand are to be best man yes best man or am I divulging secrets She surveyed Arthur and Alice with overwhelming graciousness They sat apart on two low chairs and smiled in return And Arthur how do you think Arthur is looking I think he looks very much in need of a change I said deliberately A change Indeed She all but shut her eyes at me and with an exaggerated sentimentality shook her head My dear mister Withers Are we not all in need of a change in this fleeting fleeting world She mused over the remark like a connoisseur And you she continued turning abruptly to Alice I hope you pointed out to mister Withers all my pretty bits We walked round the garden said Alice looking out of the window It s a very beautiful evening Is it said the old lady starting up violently Then on this very beautiful evening we will go in to supper mister Withers your arm Arthur bring your bride I can scarcely describe with what curious ruminations I led the way into the faded heavy aired dining room with this indefinable old creature leaning weightily on my arm the large flat bracelet on the yellow laced wrist She fumed a little breathed rather heavily as if with an effort of mind rather than of body for she had grown much stouter and yet little more proportionate And to talk into that great white face so close to mine was a queer experience in the dim light of the corridor and even in the twinkling crystal of the candles She was naive appallingly naive she was sudden and superficial she was even arch and all these in the brief rather puffy passage from one room to the other with these two tongue tied children bringing up the rear The meal was tremendous I have never seen such a monstrous salad But the dishes were greasy and over spiced and were indifferently cooked One thing only was quite unchanged my hostess s appetite was as Gargantuan as ever The old solid candelabra that lighted us stood before her high backed chair Seaton sat a little removed with his plate almost in darkness And throughout this prodigious meal his aunt talked mainly to me mainly at Seaton with an occasional satirical courtesy to Alice and muttered explosions of directions to the servant She had aged and yet if it be not nonsense to say so seemed no older I suppose to the Pyramids a decade is but as the rustling down of a handful of dust And she reminded me of some such unshakable prehistoricism She certainly was an amazing talker racy extravagant with a delivery that was perfectly overwhelming As for Seaton her flashes of silence were for him On her enormous volubility would suddenly fall a hush acid sarcasm would be left implied and she would sit softly moving her great head with eyes fixed full in a dreamy smile but with her whole attention one could see slowly joyously absorbing his mute discomfiture She confided in us her views on a theme vaguely occupying at the moment I suppose all our minds We have barbarous institutions and so must put up I suppose with a never ending procession of fools of fools ad infinitum Marriage mister Withers was instituted in the privacy of a garden sub rosa as it were Civilization flaunts it in the glare of day The dull marry the poor the rich the effete and so our New Jerusalem is peopled with naturals plain and coloured at either end I detest folly I detest still more if I must be frank dear Arthur mere cleverness Mankind has simply become a tailless host of uninstinctive animals We should never have taken to Evolution mister Withers Natural Selection little gods and fishes the deaf for the dumb We should have used our brains intellectual pride the ecclesiastics call it And by brains I mean what do I mean Alice I mean my dear child and she laid two gross fingers on Alice s narrow sleeve I mean courage Consider it Arthur I read that the scientific world is once more beginning to be afraid of spiritual agencies Spiritual agencies that tap and actually float bless their hearts I think just one more of those mulberries thank you They talk about blind Love she ran inconsequently on as she helped herself with eyes fixed on the dish but why blind I think do you know from weeping over its rickets After all it is we plain women that triumph mister Withers beyond the mockery of time Alice now Fleeting fleeting is youth my child What s that you were confiding to your plate Arthur Satirical boy He laughs at his old aunt nay but thou didst laugh He detests all sentiment He whispers the most acid asides Come my love we will leave these cynics we will go and commiserate with each other on our sex The choice of two evils mister Smithers I opened the door and she swept out as if borne on a torrent of unintelligible indignation and Arthur and I were left in the clear four flamed light alone For a while we sat in silence He shook his head at my cigarette case and I lit a cigarette Presently he fidgeted in his chair and poked his head forward into the light He paused to rise and shut again the shut door How long will you be he said standing by the table I laughed Oh it s not that he said in some confusion Of course I like to be with her But it s not that only The truth is Withers I don t care about leaving her too long with my aunt I hesitated He looked at me questioningly Look here Seaton I said you know well enough that I don t want to interfere in your affairs or to offer advice where it is not wanted But don t you think perhaps you may not treat your aunt quite in the right way As one gets old you know a little give and take I have an old godmother or something She talks too A little allowance it does no harm But hang it all I m no talker He sat down with his hands in his pockets and still with his eyes fixed almost incredulously on mine How he said Well my dear fellow if I m any judge mind I don t say that I am but I can t help thinking she thinks you don t care for her and perhaps takes your silence for for bad temper She has been very decent to you hasn t she Decent My God said Seaton I smoked on in silence but he still continued to look at me with that peculiar concentration I remembered of old I don t think perhaps Withers he began presently I don t think you quite understand Perhaps you are not quite our kind You always did just like the other fellows guy me at school You laughed at me that night you came to stay here about the voices and all that But I don t mind being laughed at because I know Know what It was the same old system of dull question and evasive answer I mean I know that what we see and hear is only the smallest fraction of what is I know she lives quite out of this She talks to you but it s all make believe It s all a parlour game She s not really with you only pitting her outside wits against yours and enjoying the fooling She s living on inside on what you re rotten without That s what it is a cannibal feast She s a spider It does t much matter what you call it It means the same kind of thing I tell you Withers she hates me and you can scarcely dream what that hatred means I used to think I had an inkling of the reason It s oceans deeper than that It just lies behind herself against myself Why after all how much do we really understand of anything We don t even know our own histories and not a tenth not a tenth of the reasons What has life been to me nothing but a trap And when one is set free it only begins again I thought you might understand but you are on a different level that s all What on earth are you talking about I said half contemptuously in spite of myself I mean what I say he said gutturally All this outside s only make believe but there what s the good of talking So far as this is concerned I m as good as done You wait Seaton blew out three of the candles and leaving the vacant room in semi darkness we groped our way along the corridor to the drawing room There a full moon stood shining in at the long garden windows Alice sat stooping at the door with her hands clasped looking out alone Where is she Seaton asked in a low tone Alice looked up their eyes met in a kind of instantaneous understanding and the door immediately afterwards opened behind us Such a moon said a voice that once heard remained unforgettably on the ear A night for lovers mister Withers if ever there was one Get a shawl my dear Arthur and take Alice for a little promenade I dare say we old cronies will manage to keep awake Hasten hasten Romeo My poor poor Alice how laggard a lover Seaton returned with a shawl They drifted out into the moonlight My companion gazed after them till they were out of hearing turned to me gravely and suddenly twisted her white face into such a convulsion of contemptuous amusement that I could only stare blankly in reply Dear innocent children she said with inimitable unctuousness Well well mister Withers we poor seasoned old creatures must move with the times Do you sing I scouted the idea Then you must listen to my playing Chess she clasped her forehead with both cramped hands chess is now completely beyond my poor wits She sat down at the piano and ran her fingers in a flourish over the keys What shall it be How shall we capture them those passionate hearts That first fine careless rapture Poetry itself She gazed softly into the garden a moment and presently with a shake of her body began to play the opening bars of Beethoven s Moonlight Sonata The piano was old and woolly She played without music The lamplight was rather dim The moonbeams from the window lay across the keys Her head was in shadow And whether it was simply due to her personality or to some really occult skill in her playing I cannot say I only know that she gravely and deliberately set herself to satirise the beautiful music It brooded on the air disillusioned charged with mockery and bitterness I stood at the window far down the path I could see the white figure glimmering in that pool of colourless light A few faint stars shone and still that amazing woman behind me dragged out of the unwilling keys her wonderful grotesquerie of youth and love and beauty It came to an end I knew the player was watching me Please please go on I murmured without turning Please go on playing Miss Seaton No answer was returned to my rather fluttering sarcasm but I knew in some indefinite way that I was being acutely scrutinised when suddenly there followed a procession of quiet plaintive chords which broke at last softly into the hymn A Few More Years Shall Roll I confess it held me spellbound There is a wistful strained plangent pathos in the tune but beneath those masterly old hands it cried softly and bitterly the solitude and desperate estrangement of the world Arthur and his lady love vanished from my thoughts No one could put into a rather hackneyed old hymn tune such an appeal who had never known the meaning of the words Their meaning anyhow isn t commonplace I turned very cautiously and glanced at the musician She was leaning forward a little over the keys so that at the approach of my cautious glance she had but to turn her face into the thin flood of moonlight for every feature to become distinctly visible And so with the tune abruptly terminated we steadfastly regarded one another and she broke into a chuckle of laughter Not quite so seasoned as I supposed mister Withers I see you are a real lover of music To me it is too painful It evokes too much thought I could scarcely see her little glittering eyes under their penthouse lids And now she broke off crisply tell me as a man of the world what do you think of my new niece I was not a man of the world nor was I much flattered in my stiff and dullish way of looking at things by being called one and I could answer her without the least hesitation I don t think Miss Seaton I m much of a judge of character She s very charming A brunette I think I prefer dark women And why Consider mister Withers dark hair dark eyes dark cloud dark night dark vision dark death dark grave dark DARK Perhaps the climax would have rather thrilled Seaton but I was too thick skinned I don t know much about all that I answered rather pompously Broad daylight s difficult enough for most of us Ah she said with a sly inward burst of satirical laughter And I suppose I went on perhaps a little nettled it isn t the actual darkness one admires its the contrast of the skin and the colour of the eyes and and their shining Just as I went blundering on too late to turn back just as you only see the stars in the dark It would be a long day without any evening As for death and the grave I don t suppose we shall much notice that Arthur and his sweetheart were slowly returning along the dewy path I believe in making the best of things How very interesting came the smooth answer I see you are a philosopher mister Withers H m As for death and the grave I don t suppose we shall much notice that Very interesting And I m sure she added in a particularly suave voice I profoundly hope so She rose slowly from her stool You will take pity on me again I hope You and I would get on famously kindred spirits elective affinities And of course now that my nephew s going to leave me now that his affections are centred on another I shall be a very lonely old woman Shall I not Arthur Seaton blinked stupidly I didn t hear what you said Aunt I was telling our old friend Arthur that when you are gone I shall be a very lonely old woman Oh I don t think so he said in a strange voice He means mister Withers he means my dear child she said sweeping her eyes over Alice he means that I shall have memory for company heavenly memory the ghosts of other days Sentimental boy And did you enjoy our music Alice Did I really stir that youthful heart O O O continued the horrible old creature you billers and cooers I have been listening to such flatteries such confessions Beware beware Arthur there s many a slip She rolled her little eyes at me she shrugged her shoulders at Alice and gazed an instant stonily into her nephew s face I held out my hand Good night good night she cried He that fights and runs away Ah good night mister Withers come again soon She thrust out her cheek at Alice and we all three filed slowly out of the room Black shadow darkened the porch and half the spreading sycamore We walked without speaking up the dusty village street Here and there a crimson window glowed At the fork of the high road I said good bye But I had taken hardly more than a dozen paces when a sudden impulse seized me Seaton I called He turned in the moonlight You have my address if by any chance you know you should care to spend a week or two in town between this and the the Day we should be delighted to see you Thank you Withers thank you he said in a low voice I dare say I waved my stick gallantly to Alice I dare say you will be doing some shopping we could all meet I added laughing Thank you thank you Withers immensely he repeated And so we parted But they were out of the jog trot of my prosaic life And being of a stolid and incurious nature I left Seaton and his marriage and even his aunt to themselves in my memory and scarcely gave a thought to them until one day I was walking up the Strand again and passed the flashing gloaming of the covered in jeweller s shop where I had accidentally encountered my old schoolfellow in the summer It was one of those still close autumnal days after a rainy night I cannot say why but a vivid recollection returned to my mind of our meeting and of how suppressed Seaton had seemed and of how vainly he had endeavoured to appear assured and eager He must be married by now and had doubtless returned from his honeymoon And I had clean forgotten my manners had sent not a word of congratulation nor as I might very well have done and as I knew he would have been immensely pleased at my doing the ghost of a wedding present On the other hand I pleaded with myself I had had no invitation I paused at the corner of Trafalgar Square and at the bidding of one of those caprices that seize occasionally on even an unimaginative mind I suddenly ran after a green bus that was passing and found myself bound on a visit I had not in the least foreseen All the colours of autumn were over the village when I arrived A beautiful late afternoon sunlight bathed thatch and meadow But it was close and hot A child two dogs a very old woman with a heavy basket I encountered One or two incurious tradesmen looked idly up as I passed by It was all so rural and so still my whimsical impulse had so much flagged that for a while I hesitated to venture under the shadow of the sycamore tree to enquire after the happy pair I deliberately passed by the faint blue gates and continued my walk under the high green and tufted wall Hollyhocks had attained their topmost bud and seeded in the little cottage gardens beyond the Michaelmas daisies were in flower a sweet warm aromatic smell of fading leaves was in the air Beyond the cottages lay a field where cattle were grazing and beyond that I came to a little churchyard Then the road wound on pathless and houseless among gorse and bracken I turned impatiently and walked quickly back to the house and rang the bell The rather colourless elderly woman who answered my enquiry informed me that Miss Seaton was at home as if only taciturnity forbade her adding But she doesn t want to see you Might I do you think have mister Arthur s address I said She looked at me with quiet astonishment as if waiting for an explanation Not the faintest of smiles came into her thin face I will tell Miss Seaton she said after a pause Please walk in She showed me into the dingy undusted drawing room filled with evening sunshine and the green dyed light that penetrated the leaves overhanging the long French windows I sat down and waited on and on occasionally aware of a creaking footfall overhead At last the door opened a little and the great face I had once known peered round at me For it was enormously changed mainly I think because the old eyes had rather suddenly failed and so a kind of stillness and darkness lay over its calm and wrinkled pallor Who is it she asked I explained myself and told her the occasion of my visit She came in and shut the door carefully after her and though the fumbling was scarcely perceptible groped her way to a chair She had on an old dressing gown like a cassock of a patterned cinnamon colour What is it you want she said seating herself and lifting her blank face to mine Might I just have Arthur s address I said deferentially I am so sorry to have disturbed you H m You have come to see my nephew Not necessarily to see him only to hear how he is and of course missus Seaton too I am afraid my silence must have appeared He hasn t noticed your silence croaked the old voice out of the great mask besides there isn t any missus Seaton Ah then I answered after a momentary pause I have not seemed so black as I painted myself And how is Miss Outram She s gone into Yorkshire answered Seaton s aunt And Arthur too She did not reply but simply sat blinking at me with lifted chin as if listening but certainly not for what I might have to say I began to feel rather at a loss You were no close friend of my nephew s mister Smithers she said presently No I answered welcoming the cue and yet do you know Miss Seaton he is one of the very few of my old schoolfellows I have come across in the last few years and I suppose as one gets older one begins to value old associations My voice seemed to trail off into a vacuum I thought Miss Outram I hastily began again a particularly charming girl I hope they are both quite well Still the old face solemnly blinked at me in silence You must find it very lonely Miss Seaton with Arthur away I was never lonely in my life she said sourly I don t look to flesh and blood for my company When you ve got to be my age mister Smithers which God forbid you ll find life a very different affair from what you seem to think it is now You won t seek company then I ll be bound It s thrust on you Her face edged round into the clear green light and her eyes as it were groped over my vacant disconcerted face I dare say now she said composing her mouth I dare say my nephew told you a good many tarradiddles in his time Oh yes a good many eh He was always a liar What now did he say of me Tell me now She leant forward as far as she could trembling with an ingratiating smile I think he is rather superstitious I said coldly but honestly I have a very poor memory Miss Seaton Why she said I haven t The engagement hasn t been broken off I hope Well between you and me she said shrinking up and with an immensely confidential grimace it has I m sure I m very sorry to hear it And where is Arthur Eh Where is Arthur We faced each other mutely among the dead old bygone furniture Past all my scrutiny was that large flat grey cryptic countenance And then suddenly our eyes for the first time really met In some indescribable way out of that thick lidded obscurity a far small something stooped and looked out at me for a mere instant of time that seemed of almost intolerable protraction Involuntarily I blinked and shook my head She muttered something with great rapidity but quite inarticulately rose and hobbled to the door I thought I heard mingled in broken mutterings something about tea Please please don t trouble I began but could say no more for the door was already shut between us I stood and looked out on the long neglected garden I could just see the bright greenness of Seaton s old tadpole pond I wandered about the room Dusk began to gather the last birds in that dense shadowiness of trees had ceased to sing And not a sound was to be heard in the house I waited on and on vainly speculating I even attempted to ring the bell but the wire was broken and only jangled loosely at my efforts I hesitated unwilling to call or to venture out and yet more unwilling to linger on waiting for a tea that promised to be an exceedingly comfortless supper And as darkness drew down a feeling of the utmost unease and disquietude came over me All my talks with Seaton returned on me with a suddenly enriched meaning I recalled again his face as we had stood hanging over the staircase listening in the small hours to the inexplicable stirrings of the night There were no candles in the room every minute the autumnal darkness deepened I cautiously opened the door and listened and with some little dismay withdrew for I was uncertain of my way out I even tried the garden but was confronted under a veritable thicket of foliage by a padlocked gate It would be a little too ignominious to be caught scaling a friend s garden fence Cautiously returning into the still and musty drawing room I took out my watch and gave the incredible old woman ten minutes in which to reappear And when that tedious ten minutes had ticked by I could scarcely distinguish its hands I determined to wait no longer drew open the door and trusting to my sense of direction groped my way through the corridor that I vaguely remembered led to the front of the house I mounted three or four stairs and lifting a heavy curtain found myself facing the starry fanlight of the porch Hence I glanced into the gloom of the dining room My fingers were on the latch of the outer door when I heard a faint stirring in the darkness above the hall I looked up and became conscious of rather than saw the huddled old figure looking down on me There was an immense hushed pause Then Arthur Arthur whispered an inexpressively peevish rasping voice is that you Is that you Arthur I can scarcely say why but the question horribly startled me No conceivable answer occurred to me With head craned back hand clenched on my umbrella I continued to stare up into the gloom in this fatuous confrontation Oh oh the voice croaked It is you is it That disgusting man Go away out Go away out Hesitating no longer I caught open the door and slamming it behind me ran out into the garden under the gigantic old sycamore and so out at the open gate I found myself half up the village street before I stopped running The local butcher was sitting in his shop reading a piece of newspaper by the light of a small oil lamp I crossed the road and enquired the way to the station And after he had with minute and needless care directed me I asked casually if mister Arthur Seaton still lived with his aunt at the big house just beyond the village He poked his head in at the little parlour door Here s a gentleman enquiring after young mister Seaton Millie he said He s dead ain t he Why yes bless you replied a cheerful voice from within Dead and buried these three months or more young mister Seaton And just before he was to be married don t you remember Bob I saw a fair young woman s face peer over the muslin of the little door at me Thank you I replied then I go straight on That s it sir past the pond bear up the hill a bit to the left and then there s the station lights before your eyes We looked intelligently into each other s faces in the beam of the smoky lamp But not one of the many questions in my mind could I put into words And again I paused irresolutely a few paces further on It was not I fancy merely a foolish apprehension of what the raw boned butcher might think that prevented my going back to see if I could find Seaton s grave in the benighted churchyard There was precious little use in pottering about in the muddy dark merely to find where he was buried And yet I felt a little uneasy My rather horrible thought was that so far as I was concerned one of his esteemed few friends he had never been much better than buried in my mind THE REAPER By DOROTHY EASTON From The English Review nineteen twenty two Milgate is a rich farmer owning his own machines not like those poorer smaller men who hire an engine from a neighbour He has his reaping machine a red and yellow Walter Wood Cleveland brand Every morning now as soon as it s dry enough about nine o clock the engine starts and from the farmer s Manor House its heavy drowsy sounds are heard For those on the machine the noise is harder The only human sound that penetrates it is the old conductor s Ohoy to the driver if the canvas sticks or if weeds are making a block Then the young man in front slows his engine down and wipes his forehead with his hand Reaping goes on until nine at night No strange workman sits on the reaper but one of Milgate s best men the most trustworthy most faithful the waggoner a man well over sixty with side whiskers grey eyes a long nose and forehead and chin carved out of granite On his head a flat wide awake hat on his bent back a white jacket When he speaks his mouth moves sideways first there s always a spot of dried blood on his lip when he smiles a tooth stump appears like an ancient fossil He talks slowly stopping to spit now and then every day of his life he gets up at half past three Now mounted on the high iron seat a crumpled sack for saddle he rides like some old charioteer a Hercules with great bowed back head jutting out chin straight a hard weathered look about his face and in his heart disgust this year for the first time they are using a motor engine to pull the reaper round instead of horses He lives for his horses he s the Waggoner they are his job if one falls ill he sleeps with it He believes in horses but speaking of the motor he says She s arlraight when she s arlraight with a look which ends the sentence for him In his youth he had reaped with a scythe This Walter Wood is a neat arrangement you can t deny that one bit of mechanism works as a divider while a big light kind of wooden windmill arrangement continually revolving beats the corn down into a flat pan from which it s carried on a canvas slide up an incline then shot over and down the other side in one continual long flat stream like yellow matting And then the needle the threadle as he calls it nips in somewhere binding the flat mass into separate neat round sheaves pitched out every few moments with perfect precision by a three pronged iron fork Above the one big heavy central wheel the charioteer is shaken and jolted from nine till nine In front on another iron seat by the boxlike engine the driver works Behind runs a red faced labourer clearing corners The motor has to run out the full length of its cogged iron wheel bands before it can turn and sheaves dropped on the last round get in the way so at each corner they have to be lifted and set back The labourer clears then runs after the machine now half way up the field stops at the next corner stoops once more to lift and shift three sheaves then runs again This labourer was a man of forty with a face as naive as a boy of fifteen Though getting bald his eyes were young his mouth loose untrained as a child s He s touched as we say and had never really grown up He slept in an attic ate in a kitchen and worked but was not responsible he was always given light jobs walking with the clappers weeding cleaning sties clearing His greatest friend was a boy of twelve on Sundays they d laugh for an hour at nothing Going to the coast for the first time last year he was so taken by a Punch and Judy show that he never saw the sea His smile was the most ridiculous thing in the world He blushed continually panted grinned like some boy caught kissing and was always apologetic Lightning made him hide his head and he was afraid of engines their regularity upset him Running behind the reaper this quick moving noisy thing smelling of oil made up of sliding chains appalled him there were five wheels at an angle and all the time an oil wet black flat chain band ran round over them Underneath the heavy central wheel ran round and round To the imbecile the waggoner s courage appeared supernatural There should have been another man to take two corners but all hands were wanted so the labourer had to run all day It was hot no wind no shade If he looked up for a moment the hills and distant elms appeared bright blue The big field itself was ablaze with colour wheat like brown burnt amber poppies small white daisies thistles When the engine stopped the only sounds were plaintive anxious bird calls from the centre of the field sometimes a rabbit or a hare looked out then bolted back Once five graceful sleek brown pheasants ran out towards the hedge then lost their nerve turned and went running back The sun shone steadily sheaves picked up by the labourer made his hands smell oily their string band raised a blister on his forefinger Very often he grabbed hold of nettles and sharp thistles and the backs of his hands were swollen and covered with stings Blue butterflies twirled in front of his face pale moths flew out When his hat fell off he had no time to get it The sweat ran down his egg shaped forehead to his long square hairy chin though he could shave himself on Sundays he looked a little like a monkey When the engine stuck the waggoner asked in his slow flat voice Woan t she speak She s not comin out was the youth s reply Once the driver was thrown up a foot when the motor went over a hole He yelled Men are often killed by the reaper The imbecile got the startled look of a child seeing snakes at the Zoo Each time the engine snorted or the waggoner called out Ohoy a spurt of sweat ran down his spine the blood was beating in his head the sun shone mercilessly on his pale bald patch the field began to bounce before his eyes bloodshot from stooping When yards of bindweed shackled the machinery the waggoner just turned his head a sign for the labourer who had to run had to catch and tear away the long green chains full of small pink flowers By four o clock they were overtaking him before he got round the driver had to turn more sharply the canvas stuck Doan you do that agen the old waggoner scolded with stern eye you ll tourn us oover The engine stuck when they tried to start again for half an hour the young driver tinkered with tools from the box unscrewing small oily nuts testing wires feeling levers and in desperation wiping his black dripping hands on his hair Twenty times he turned the starting handle but she wouldn t speak Then suddenly with a sound like a pistol shot the engine fired the machine ran backwards upsetting the labourer and before he could move the central wheel ran over his ankles When the imbecile came to himself they were still at the corner his feet were tied up in a jacket he was suffering horribly yet seemed unable to focus it but seeing the red and yellow reaper standing close beside his head some memory soaked his face with sweat he fainted Brandy was fetched they had lifted him on to a hurdle when he recovered again The whole group were still at the corner His employer stood there stout well dressed and anxious in his grey felt hat dark coat and trousers the driver stood there too and the old waggoner Corn was still up in the middle of the field The labourer looked surprised at seeing sky before him as a rule when he stared he saw fields He turned his face the men watching saw his round boyish eyes project at sight of something red and wet and sticky like the mess they made out sheep killing splashed on the stubble while two broken boots lay oozing the same stuff in a large pool of it Following this look the old waggoner said slowly Eh me boy they m youers Tears were running down his stiff dried cheeks How d you feel asked the farmer His labourer blushed then whispered to the waggoner What s appened Mister Collard Why you ve a loarst your feet For yet another minute the imbecile lay panting shy self conscious under his master s eye until an idea struck him once more whispering to the waggoner he said Elp me oop I ll get ome Willy You carn t walk said the old man simply You carn t walk no moar Black hairs stiffened suddenly on the idiot s chin he had understood that in those bleeding mangled boots his feet were lying he began to cry But then catching sight of his master smiled as though to apologise THE SONG By MAY EDGINTON From Lloyd s Story Magazine nineteen twenty two Charlie had no true vice in him All the same a man may be overtaxed over harassed over routined over driven over pricked over preached and over starved right up to the edge and then the fascination of the big space below may easily pull him over But his wife s uncle s assertion that he must always inwardly have been naturally wild and bad was as wrong as such assertions usually are for he was no more truly vicious than his youngest baby was On the warm evening when he came home on that fateful autumn day Charlie had been pushed in the course of years right up to the edge and was looking into the abyss though he was hardly aware of it so well had he been disciplined He emerged from a third class carriage of the usual train without an evening paper because his wife had shown him the decency of cutting down small personal expenses and next morning s papers would have the same news in anyway he walked home up the suburban road for the four thousandth five hundredth and fiftieth time entered quietly not to disturb the baby rubbed his boots on the mat answered his wife brightly and manfully washed his hands in cold water the hot water being saved for the baby s bath and the washing up in the evenings and sat down to about the four thousandth five hundredth and fiftieth cold supper His wife said she was tired and seemed proud of it But never mind she said one must expect to be tired He went on eating without verbally questioning her it was an assertion to which she always held firmly But in his soul something stirred vaguely as if mutinous currents fretted there I have been thinking she said that you really ought not to buy that new suit you were considering if Maud is to go to a better school next term I have been looking over your pepper and salt and there are those people who turn suits like new You can have that done But he murmured We ought not to think of ourselves she added I never have said Charlie in rather a low voice We ought to give a little subscription to the Parish Magazine she continued The Vicar is calling round for extra subscriptions Charlie nodded He was wishing he knew the football results in the evening paper His wife served a rice shape She doled out jam with a careful hand and a measuring eye We ought to see about the garden gate she said I ll mend it on Saturday Charlie replied I was thinking she said presently that we ought to ask Uncle Henry and Aunt round soon They will be expecting it Charlie put his spoon and fork together hesitated and then replied slowly Life is nothing but ought Ought to do this Ought to do that His wife looked at him astonished He could see that she was grieved or rather aggrieved at his glimmer of anarchy Of course she explained at last People can t have what they like There s one s duty to do Life isn t for enjoyment Charlie It s given to us it is given to us As she paused to crystallise an idea Charlie cut in Yes he said it is given to us What for He leaned his head on his hand He was not looking at her He was looking at the cloth weaving patterns upon it And with this question something of boyhood came upon him again and he weaved visions upon the cloth To do one s duty in she replied gently but rebukingly Charlie did not know the classic phrase Cui bono He merely repeated What for After supper he helped her to wash up for the daily help left early in the afternoon and then he asked her idle as he knew the question to be if she would like to come for a walk just a short walk up the road She shook her head I ought not to leave the children They re in bed he argued and Maud s big enough to look after the others for half an hour Maud s twelve She shook her head I ought not to leave the house But he began slowly I am not the kind of woman who leaves her house and children in the evenings she said gently but finally Charlie took his hat He turned it round and round in his hands pinching the crown in and punching it out He had a curious almost uncontrollable wish to cry For a moment it was terrible Before it was over she was speaking again You ought not to mess your hats about like that they don t last half as long Charlie went out He knew other men who were as puzzled about life as himself but mostly they were of cruder stuff and if things at home went beyond their bearing they flung out of their houses swearing and went to play a hundred up at the local club Then they were philosophers again But for Charlie this evening there was no philosophy big enough for he was looking though he did not know it over the edge of that awful but enchanting abyss Its depths were obscured by rolling clouds of mist and it was only this mist which he now saw terrifying and confusing him He was a little man and knew it He was a poor man and knew it He was a weary man and knew it He hated his wife and knew it He hated his children whom she had made like herself prim peeking and childishly censorious and knew it He had not meant it to be like this at all When he got married she was the starched daughter of starched parents from a starched small house like the one he came from but she was young and her figure was pliant and her hair curled rather sweetly He had dreamed of happy days cosy days with laughter little treats together Soho restaurants Richmond Park something colourful something for which he had vaguely and secretly longed all the dingy narrow church parading humbugging days of his good little boyhood But he soon woke up to find he had married another hard holy woman like his mother He walked along thinking mistily and hotly Supposing he had a baby who roared with joy and stole the sugar but she wouldn t have babies like that The first coherent thing her babies learned to say was a text Babies He hadn t wanted three because they couldn t afford them He tried to talk to her about it She made him ashamed of himself though he didn t know why and showed him how wicked he was though he didn t know why and how good she was though he didn t know why then But he knew now that there are still many women who are gluttons for martyrdom who long to exalt themselves by a parrot righteousness and who are only happy when destroying natural joy in others And he knew there were many men like himself married and done for tied up to these pettifogging saints goaded under their stupid yoke belittled through their narrow eyes He thought all this mistily and hotly He had come to the end of the road and the end of another road more populous and the end of another road more populous At a corner of this road stood Kitty She was soft and colourful painted to a perfect peachiness young twenty four and looking less old as the world and wise She was gay She did not much care if it snowed she knew enough to wriggle in somewhere somehow out of it The years had not yet scared her She was joy Charlie paused before he knew why She looked at him Then the mists rolled away from the abyss below the tottering edge on which he had been balanced for longer time than he guessed and he saw the garden far below lotus flowers dreaming in the sun He launched himself simply into space towards them Kitty helped him She knew how Charlie had as it happened his next week s personal allowance of seven and sixpence in his pocket for to day had been pay day and his season ticket The rest he had handed over to his wife at supper time He had also however the moral support of knowing that he had in the savings bank the exact amount of his sickness and life insurance premiums due that very week So it did not embarrass him to take Kitty straight away up to town she making a shrewd summary of him did not object to third class travelling and to stand her coffee and a sandwich at the Monico I don t happen to have much change on me and my bank s closed was the explanation he offered and she tactfully accepted of this modest entertainment It was ten thirty when she took him to see her tiny flat a stone s throw away She was looking for another supporter for that flat and explained her reason for being in Charlie s suburb that evening She d been trying to find the house of a man friend a rich friend who lived there and might have helped her over a temporary difficulty but when she found the house the servants told her he was away She confided these things leaning in Charlie s arms on a little striped divan by a gas fire She made him a drink and showed him the cunning and luxurious little contrivances for comfort about the flat He loved it She didn t try to conceal from him her real vocation for that would have been too silly Even Charlie might not have been such a fool as to believe her But she invested it with glamour she made of it romance Once more as in boyhood he saw the world full of allurement So he went home having promised her that to morrow he would come again And going in quietly so as not to disturb the baby he undressed quietly so as not to disturb his wife and he crept cautiously into the double bed that she decreed they must share for ever and ever whatever their feelings towards one another because they were married and he hoped to fall asleep with enchantment unbroken But she was awake and waiting patiently to speak Where have you been Charlie At the club he whispered back Watching two fellows play a billiard match She sighed Charlie she said you ought to have more consideration for me Maudie said to me when I went in to look at them before I came to bed Is daddy still out she said I do think he ought not to go out and leave you alone mamma She s such a sweet child Charlie and I do think you ought to think more of her Children often say little things in the innocence of their hearts that do even us grown up people good sometimes So the next morning Charlie left home with a suit case alleged to contain the one suit for turning but really crammed to bursting His wife being busy with the baby Maud saw him off with her usual air of smug reproof and that evening he did not come back He had written a letter to his wife on the journey to town telling her his decision which she would receive by the afternoon post But he gave her no address He drew out the whole amount in the savings bank surrendered his life insurance realising Lone hundred sixty and he went home after the day s work to Kitty Little Kitty was looking for any kind of mug pending better developments and she certainly had found one but what a happy mug he was Life was warm and light gay and uncritical He spent even less on his own lunches he retained his seven and sixpence weekly personal allowance though of course he posted the rest of his salary home so that he might have an extra half crown or so to buy chocolates for Kitty It was nice to buy chocolates instead of subscribing to the Vicar s Fund And little Kitty who was wise guessed he hadn t much and couldn t afford her long so pending better things like a sensible person she eked him out She made him so happy They laughed She sang I m for ever blowing bubbles Pretty bubbles in the air They fly so high nearly reach the sky She had a gramophone and she taught him to dance and then he had to take her to the best dancing place he could afford and they danced a long evening through He bought her a wonderful little woollen frock at one of the small French shops in Shaftesbury Avenue and she looked exactly what she was in it and he knew she was the most wonderful thing in the world When he propounded the frock question to her one morning when they woke up saying I would like to see you in a dress I d bought Kitty she did not tell him it was wrong to consider themselves and she would have her old black turned She put a dear fat little arm round his neck laid a soft selfish cheek to his and muttered cosily It shall buy her a frock then It shall She was sporting enough not to protest when she knew where his weekly pay went Three kids must be fed she said In fact according to her own codes she was not ungenerous towards the other woman All the while he knew Lone hundred sixty can t last What will happen when Charlie s wife thought she was sure of what must happen pretty soon So did her Uncle Henry and Aunt for whom she had sent a day or two after the blow had fallen They found her cutting down Maud s oldest dress for the second child in her tidy house Charlie has left me for an immoral woman she said after preparing them with preliminaries What said Uncle Henry He was a churchwarden at the church to which Charlie in a bowler hat had had to take the critical Maud on Sundays Fancy leaving that said Aunt when they had digested and credited the news She pointed at her niece sewing diligently even through this painful conversation Look at her scraping and economising and contriving And he leaves her He must be naturally wild and bad said Uncle Henry Shall I speak to the Vicar for you Have you written to his firm asked Aunt Charlie s wife spoke wisely gently and with perfection as ever No she said I have thought it over and I think the best thing for the children s sake is to say nothing We ought not to consider ourselves Besides I dare say it s my duty to forgive him Always thinking of your duty murmured Aunt admiringly If I wrote to his firm about it said Charlie s wife they would dismiss him Ah and he sends you his pay you say said Uncle Henry seizing the point like a business man What a position for a conscientious woman like you mourned Aunt You are quite right my dear said Uncle Henry You have three children and no other means of sustenance and you cannot afford to do as I should otherwise advise you Besides he will come back said Charlie s wife gently Men are soon sickened of these women Of course agreed Aunt Well Well said Uncle Henry you are very magnanimous my dear and one day Charles will fully appreciate it And I hope he will be duly thankful to you for your great goodness Yes You will soon have Master Charles creeping back very ashamed of himself and when he comes I for one intend to give him the biggest talking to he has ever had in his life But I really think the Vicar too should be told in confidence so that he may decide upon the right course of action for himself Because he could not allow your husband to communicate my love said Aunt without being sure of his genuine repentance I have been thinking of that too said Charlie s wife It would not be right I wonder what he feels about himself when he remembers his dear little children said Aunt Maud nearly old enough to understand and all So they lay for Charlie while he basked and thrived in the abyss of the lotus flower and the Lone hundred sixty dwindled It was towards the end of the second month that Charlie sensed a new element in his precarious dream All day when he was out thinking of Kitty through the routine of his work he had no idea of what she was doing Sometimes he was afraid to think of what she might be doing and for fear of shattering the dream he never dared to ask Always she was sweet and joyful towards him save for petulant quarrels she raised as if to make the ensuing sweetness and joyfulness the dearer until towards the close of the second month Then one evening she was distrait one evening critical one night cold then she had a dinner and dance engagement at the Savoy Then he knew that his time had come He waited up for her He had the gas fire lighted in the tiny sitting room and little sugary cakes and wine on the table and the gas fire lighted in the bedroom to warm it for her and the bed turned down and her nightgown and slippers so frail warming before the fire But he knew In the early dawn her key clicked in the lock and she came in followed by a man He was pale sensual moneyed fashionable Charlie got up stoutly but he was already beaten The Jew looked at him and turned to Kitty I told you she said stammering a little I told you how it was By to morrow I told you I ll come again to morrow then said the man very meaningly fetch you out At eight she nodded firmly He kissed her on the mouth while Charlie stood looking at them with eyes that seemed to stare themselves out of his head turned and went out Nighty night Kitty called after him After the front door clicked again there was a moment s silence Kitty advanced shook off her cloak took up one of the sugary cakes and began to munch it She looked beautiful and careless and sorry and hard all at once What are you sitting up for Charlie she asked I didn t expect to see you I brought that fellow in to talk What about said Charlie in a hoarse desolate voice Charlie said Kitty hurriedly you know this arrangement of ours can t last now can it dear You haven t the cash for one thing dear Now have you And I ve got to think of myself a little a girl s got to provide You ve been awf ly good to me Let s part friends Part he repeated His eyes seemed to start from his head Let s part friends wheedled Kitty Shall us The night passed in a kind of evil vision of desolation and Kitty was asleep long before he had stopped his futile whisperings into her ear Before he went to the office in the morning he asked her from a breaking heart You mean it I ve got to she explained She cried easily Dearie you ll leave peaceably You won t make a row Now for my sake To oblige me While you re out to day I ll pack your suit case and give it to the hall porter for you to call for Shall I Charlie Kiss me dear Don t take your latch key Good bye You ve been awfully decent to me We ll part friends shall us He kissed her and went out to work speaking no more He had said all the things in his heart during the hours of that sleepless dawn She knew how he loved her though possibly she didn t quite believe He realised her position acutely perhaps more acutely than his own She had to live And yet He had taken his latch key the same as usual and he found himself at the end of the day going the same as usual to the tiny flat that was home if ever there was any place called home He let himself in noiselessly The little hall was dark He stood in a corner against the coat cupboard The flat was silent He stood there a long while without moving and a clock chimed seven He heard her singing I m for ever blowing bubbles Lal la la la la la la She would be in her bedroom sitting before the mirror in her diaphanous underwear touching up her face The pauses in the song made him see her Now she was using the eyebrow pencil The song went on and broke again now she would be half turning from the mirror curved on the gilt chair as he had so often seen her hand glass in hand looking at the back of her head and her eyelashes and her profile fining away all hard edges of rouge and lipstick He felt quite peaceful as he imaged her Peace was shattered at a blast by the ringing of the front door bell Then light streamed from the opened bedroom door was switched off and Kitty ran into the darkish hall She clicked on the light by the front door opened the door and the big man came in He kissed her on the mouth Then Charlie stepped from beside the coat cupboard suddenly as though some strong spring which held him there had been released and the strong spring was in his tense body alone For the first time in his life he felt all steel and wire and whipcord and many fires He threw himself on the intruder and fought for his woman Kitty did not scream She knew better Oh Charlie she panted For sake go Go I can t have a row here Oh Charlie be a good boy do He shall go said the other man He was a big man and still young and lithe Kitty opened the front door whispering Oh Charlie Oh Charlie and the man pushed Charlie out The lift was not working at the moment the landing was quiet there was not a soul on the stairway beside the liftshaft when the man flung Charlie headlong down the first flight and broke him on the unyielding stone Charlie heard his own spine crack but as the other scared and pale reached him he heard something else also the voice of Kitty who stood above them looking down sobbing I c c can t have a row here It d break me Oh Charlie Oh Charlie If you love me go away Charlie loved Kitty very much My back s broken he whispered to the enemy bending over him But if you get me under the armpits lift me down the stairs and put me into the street and if the hall porter sees us go out tell him I m dead drunk The man lifted him as instructed an arm round him just under the shoulder blades and armpits Below he could feel the crumpled weight sway and sag He tried to be merciful in his handling D d do you no g g good he faltered as he lifted Charlie downstairs t to get me into a mess I m sorry D d didn t mean But I ve got a wife and don t want hell raised You asked for it I m sorry I m sorry When they reached the ground floor the single handed porter was just carrying a passenger in the lift to the floor above so they got unobserved into the street a quietish street a cul de sac Take me a f f few d d doors off and put me down said Charlie and the sweat of pain ran down his face but when the man had put him down against some area railings and laid him straight he was comfortable The other man simply vanished A taxi driver found Charlie by and by and the police fetched an ambulance and took him to the hospital and in a white bed he lay sleepily revealing nothing all that night But they found searching for an address in his pockets the address of his family and they sent a message to his wife His wife received it early the next morning and first she sent Maud for Uncle Henry and Aunt who found that all was turning out as they prophesied save for the slight deviation of Charlie s accident They don t say exactly how bad he is said Uncle Henry Ah but he was well enough to send for you He knows which side his bread s buttered Yes we shall have Master Charles creeping back again very thankful to be in his home with every comfort nursed by you and I will give him the worse talking to be has ever had in his life And if he s ill he can t prevent the Vicar visiting him too said Aunt So Charlie s wife set out to do her duty But still earlier that morning instructed by the tremendous peace which was stealing over him that time was short Charlie was making his first request Would they please ring up Shaftesbury eighty four to ask for Kitty and tell her Charlie just wanted to see her very urgently for a few minutes at once but not to be frightened for everything would be perfectly all right Pending her arrival which in a faltering voice over the phone she promised as soon as possible Charlie asked the kindly Sister who was hovering near to help him die Sister when a friend of mine comes in a young lady who isn t used to to seeing things if I go off suddenly as it were what I m afraid of is she may be afraid if there s any kind of struggle I saw a fellow die once and he gave a sort of rattle well will you just pull the bed clothes up over me so that she doesn t see Kitty came in wearing perhaps incidentally perhaps by some grace of kindness the woollen frock and she crept shaking round the screen and stood beside Charlie and said Oh Charlie Oh Charlie opening his closing eyes Kitty he smiled sing Bubbles The look Sister who had taken her right in gave her pried Kitty s trembling mouth open like a crowbar and leaning against Charlie s cot she sang When shadows creep When I m asleep To lands of hope I stray Then at daybreak when I awake The Sister drew the bed clothes shadily round Charlie s face My blue bird flutters away I m forever blowing bubbles Pretty bubbles in the air Just then the good woman was brought into the ward bearing with her messages from Maud worthy of Little Eva herself and full of holy forgiveness and at edge of the screen Sister met her His wife said Sister A moment too late I am sorry The good woman was looking at the bad woman by the bed so Sister made a vague explanation He just wanted a song she said A HEDONIST By JOHN GALSWORTHY From Pears Annual and The Century Magazine nineteen twenty one Rupert K Vaness remains freshly in my mind because he was so fine and large and because he summed up in his person and behavior a philosophy which budding before the war hibernated during that distressing epoch and is now again in bloom He was a New Yorker addicted to Italy One often puzzled over the composition of his blood From his appearance it was rich and his name fortified the conclusion What the K stood for however I never learned the three possibilities were equally intriguing Had he a strain of Highlander with Kenneth or Keith a drop of German or Scandinavian with Kurt or Knut a blend of Syrian or Armenian with Kahalil or Kassim The blue in his fine eyes seemed to preclude the last but there was an encouraging curve in his nostrils and a raven gleam in his auburn hair which by the way was beginning to grizzle and recede when I knew him The flesh of his face too had sometimes a tired and pouchy appearance and his tall body looked a trifle rebellious within his extremely well cut clothes but after all he was fifty five You felt that Vaness was a philosopher yet he never bored you with his views and was content to let you grasp his moving principle gradually through watching what he ate drank smoked wore and how he encircled himself with the beautiful things and people of this life One presumed him rich for one was never aware of money in his presence Life moved round him with a certain noiseless ease or stood still at a perfect temperature like the air in a conservatory round a choice blossom which a draught might shrivel This image of a flower in relation to Rupert K Vaness pleases me because of that little incident in Magnolia Gardens near Charleston South Carolina Vaness was the sort of a man of whom one could never say with safety whether he was revolving round a beautiful young woman or whether the beautiful young woman was revolving round him His looks his wealth his taste his reputation invested him with a certain sun like quality but his age the recession of his locks and the advancement of his waist were beginning to dim his lustre so that whether he was moth or candle was becoming a moot point It was moot to me watching him and Miss Sabine Monroy at Charleston throughout the month of March The casual observer would have said that she was playing him up as a young poet of my acquaintance puts it but I was not casual For me Vaness had the attraction of a theorem and I was looking rather deeply into him and Miss Monroy That girl had charm She came I think from Baltimore with a strain in her they said of old Southern French blood Tall and what is known as willowy with dark chestnut hair very broad dark eyebrows very soft quick eyes and a pretty mouth when she did not accentuate it with lip salve she had more sheer quiet vitality than any girl I ever saw It was delightful to watch her dance ride play tennis She laughed with her eyes she talked with a savouring vivacity She never seemed tired or bored She was in one hackneyed word attractive And Vaness the connoisseur was quite obviously attracted Of men who professionally admire beauty one can never tell offhand whether they definitely design to add a pretty woman to their collection or whether their dalliance is just matter of habit But he stood and sat about her he drove and rode listened to music and played cards with her he did all but dance with her and even at times trembled on the brink of that And his eyes those fine lustrous eyes of his followed her about How she had remained unmarried to the age of twenty six was a mystery till one reflected that with her power of enjoying life she could not yet have had the time Her perfect physique was at full stretch for eighteen hours out of the twenty four every day Her sleep must have been like that of a baby One figured her sinking into dreamless rest the moment her head touched the pillow and never stirring till she sprang up into her bath As I say for me Vaness or rather his philosophy erat demonstrandum I was philosophically in some distress just then The microbe of fatalism already present in the brains of artists before the war had been considerably enlarged by that depressing occurrence Could a civilization basing itself on the production of material advantages do anything but insure the desire for more and more material advantages Could it promote progress even of a material character except in countries whose resources were still much in excess of their population The war had seemed to me to show that mankind was too combative an animal ever to recognize that the good of all was the good of one The coarse fibred pugnacious and self seeking would I had become sure always carry too many guns for the refined and kindly The march of science appeared on the whole to be carrying us backward I deeply suspected that there had been ages when the populations of this earth though less numerous and comfortable had been proportionately healthier than they were at present As for religion I had never had the least faith in Providence rewarding the pitiable by giving them a future life of bliss The theory seemed to me illogical for the more pitiable in this life appeared to me the thick skinned and successful and these as we know in the saying about the camel and the needle s eye our religion consigns wholesale to hell Success power wealth those aims of profiteers and premiers pedagogues and pandemoniacs of all in fact who could not see God in a dewdrop hear Him in distant goat bells and scent Him in a pepper tree had always appeared to me akin to dry rot And yet every day one saw more distinctly that they were the pea in the thimblerig of life the hub of a universe which to the approbation of the majority they represented they were fast making uninhabitable It did not even seem of any use to help one s neighbors all efforts at relief just gilded the pill and encouraged our stubbornly contentious leaders to plunge us all into fresh miseries So I was searching right and left for something to believe in willing to accept even Rupert K Vaness and his basking philosophy But could a man bask his life right out Could just looking at fine pictures tasting rare fruits and wines the mere listening to good music the scent of azaleas and the best tobacco above all the society of pretty women keep salt in my bread an ideal in my brain Could they That s what I wanted to know Every one who goes to Charleston in the spring soon or late visits Magnolia Gardens A painter of flowers and trees I specialize in gardens and freely assert that none in the world is so beautiful as this Even before the magnolias come out it consigns the Boboli at Florence the Cinnamon Gardens of Colombo Concepcion at Malaga Versailles Hampton Court the Generaliffe at Granada and La Mortola to the category of also ran Nothing so free and gracious so lovely and wistful nothing so richly coloured yet so ghostlike exists planted by the sons of men It is a kind of paradise which has wandered down a miraculously enchanted wilderness Brilliant with azaleas or magnolias it centres round a pool of dreamy water overhung by tall trunks wanly festooned with the grey Florida moss Beyond anything I have ever seen it is otherworldly And I went there day after day drawn as one is drawn in youth by visions of the Ionian Sea of the East or the Pacific Isles I used to sit paralysed by the absurdity of putting brush to canvas in front of that dream pool I wanted to paint of it a picture like that of the fountain by Helleu which hangs in the Luxembourg But I knew I never should I was sitting there one sunny afternoon with my back to a clump of azaleas watching an old coloured gardener so old that he had started life as an owned negro they said and certainly still retained the familiar suavity of the old time darky I was watching him prune the shrubs when I heard the voice of Rupert K Vaness say quite close There s nothing for me but beauty Miss Monroy The two were evidently just behind my azalea clump perhaps four yards away yet as invisible as if in China Beauty is a wide wide word Define it mister Vaness An ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory it stands before me Come now that s just a get out Is beauty of the flesh or of the spirit What is the spirit as you call it I m a pagan Oh so am I But the Greeks were pagans Well spirit is only the refined side of sensuous appreciations I wonder I have spent my life in finding that out Then the feeling this garden rouses in me is purely sensuous Of course If you were standing there blind and deaf without the powers of scent and touch where would your feeling be You are very discouraging mister Vaness No madam I face facts When I was a youngster I had plenty of fluffy aspiration towards I didn t know what I even used to write poetry Oh mister Vaness was it good It was not I very soon learned that a genuine sensation was worth all the uplift in the world What is going to happen when your senses strike work I shall sit in the sun and fade out I certainly do like your frankness You think me a cynic of course I am nothing so futile Miss Sabine A cynic is just a posing ass proud of his attitude I see nothing to be proud of in my attitude just as I see nothing to be proud of in the truths of existence Suppose you had been poor My senses would be lasting better than they are and when at last they failed I should die quicker from want of food and warmth that s all Have you ever been in love mister Vaness I am in love now And your love has no element of devotion no finer side None It wants I have never been in love But if I were I think I should want to lose myself rather than to gain the other Would you Sabine I am in love with you Oh Shall we walk on I heard their footsteps and was alone again with the old gardener lopping at his shrubs But what a perfect declaration of hedonism How simple and how solid was the Vaness theory of existence Almost Assyrian worthy of Louis Quinze And just then the old negro came up It s pleasant settin he said in his polite and hoarse half whisper dar ain t no flies yet It s perfect Richard This is the most beautiful spot in the world Such he answered softly drawling In deh war time de Yanks nearly burn deh house heah Sherman s Yanks Such dey did po ful angry wi ol massa dey was cause he hid up deh silver plate afore he went away My ol fader was de factotalum den De Yanks took m suh dey took m and deh major he tell my fader to show m whar deh plate

goin t tell So dey begin to shoot and shot all roun m to skeer m up I was a li l boy den an I see my ol fader wid my own eyes suh standin thar s bold s Peter No suh dey didn t neber git no word from him He loved deh folk heah such he did suh The old man smiled and in that beatific smile I saw not only his perennial pleasure in the well known story but the fact that he too would have stood there with the bullets raining round him sooner than betray the folk he loved Fine story Richard but very silly obstinate old man your father wasn t he He looked at me with a sort of startled anger which slowly broadened into a grin then broke into soft hoarse laughter Oh yes suh sueh berry silly obstinacious ol man Yes suh indeed And he went off cackling to himself He had only just gone when I heard footsteps again behind my azalea clump and Miss Monroy s voice Your philosophy is that of faun and nymph Can you play the part Only let me try Those words had such a fevered ring that in imagination I could see Vaness all flushed his fine eyes shining his well kept hands trembling his lips a little protruded There came a laugh high gay sweet Very well then catch me I heard a swish of skirts against the shrubs the sound of flight an astonished gasp from Vaness and the heavy thud thud of his feet following on the path through the azalea maze I hoped fervently that they would not suddenly come running past and see me sitting there My straining ears caught another laugh far off a panting sound a muttered oath a far away Cooee And then staggering winded pale with heat and vexation Vaness appeared caught sight of me and stood a moment Sweat was running down his face his hand was clutching at his side his stomach heaved a hunter beaten and undignified He muttered turned abruptly on his heel and left me staring at where his fastidious dandyism and all that it stood for had so abruptly come undone I know not how he and Miss Monroy got home to Charleston not in the same car I fancy As for me I travelled deep in thought aware of having witnessed something rather tragic not looking forward to my next encounter with Vaness He was not at dinner but the girl was there as radiant as ever and though I was glad she had not been caught I was almost angry at the signal triumph of her youth She wore a black dress with a red flower in her hair and another at her breast and had never looked so vital and so pretty Instead of dallying with my cigar beside cool waters in the lounge of the hotel I strolled out afterward on the Battery and sat down beside the statue of a tutelary personage A lovely evening from some tree or shrub close by emerged an adorable faint fragrance and in the white electric light the acacia foliage was patterned out against a thrilling blue sky If there were no fireflies abroad there should have been A night for hedonists indeed And suddenly in fancy there came before me Vaness s well dressed person panting pale perplexed and beside him by a freak of vision stood the old darky s father bound to the live oak with the bullets whistling past and his face transfigured There they stood alongside the creed of pleasure which depended for fulfilment on its waist measurement and the creed of love devoted unto death Aha I thought which of the two laughs last And just then I saw Vaness himself beneath a lamp cigar in mouth and cape flung back so that its silk lining shone Pale and heavy in the cruel white light his face had a bitter look And I was sorry very sorry at that moment for Rupert K Vaness THE BAT AND BELFRY INN By ALAN GRAHAM From The Story Teller nineteen twenty two It was the maddest and most picturesque hotel at which we have ever stopped Tony and I were touring North Wales We had left Llandudno that morning in the twoseater lunched at Festiniog and late in the afternoon were trundling down a charming valley with the reluctant assistance of a road whose surface if it ever had possessed such an asset had long since vanished On rounding one of the innumerable hairpin bends on our road there burst upon us the most gorgeous miniature scene that we had ever encountered I stopped the car almost automatically Oh George what a charming hotel exclaimed Tony Let s stop and have tea Tony I should mention is my wife She is intensely practical I had not noticed the hotel for before us the valley opened out into a perfect stage setting From the road the land fell sharply a hundred feet to a rocky mountain stream the rustle of whose water came up to us faintly like the music heard in a sea shell Beyond rose hills hill upon hill lit patchily by the sun so that their contours were a mingling of brilliant purple heather red brown bracken and indigo shadow Far down the valley the stream glinted mirror like through a veil of trees And Tony spoke of tea I dragged my eyes from the magnet of the view and found that I had stopped the car within a few yards of a little hotel that must have been planted there originally by someone with a soul It lay by the open roadside five miles from anywhere It was built of the rough grey green stone of the district but it was rescued from the commonplace by its leaded windows the big old beams that angled across its white plastered gables and by the clematis and late tea roses that clung about its porch I could hardly blame Tony for her materialism The hotel blended admirably with its surroundings There was nothing about it of the beerhouse on the mountain top so dear to the German mind It looked quiet refined and restful and one felt instinctively that it would be managed in a fashion in keeping with all about it By Jove Tony I said as I drew up to the clematis covered porch we might do worse than stop here for a day or two We ll have tea anyhow and see what we think of it I clattered over the red tiled floor and when my eyes had grown accustomed to the dim light that contrasted so well with the sunshine without found myself in a small sunshiny room with a low ceiling oak rafted some comfortable chairs an old eight day clock stopped at ten thirty five and a man He was a long thin man clean shaven wearing an old shooting coat and a pair of shabby grey flannel trousers He smoked a pipe and read in a book At my entrance he did not look up and I set him down as a guest in the hotel One side of the room was built of obscured glass panes with an open square in the middle and a ledge upon which rested several suggestive empty glasses so I crossed to this hospitable looking gap and tapped upon the ledge Several repetitions bringing no response I turned to the only living creature who appeared to be available Can you tell me sir if we can have tea in the hotel I asked The long man started looked up closed his book and jumped to his feet as if galvanized to life Of course of course of course he cried hastily and added as by an afterthought of course I may have shown a natural surprise at this almost choral response for he pulled himself together and became something more explicit I ll see to it at once he said hurriedly I m I m the proprietor you know You won t mind if we re if we re a little upset You see I I ve just moved in Left me by an uncle you know an uncle in Australia I ll see to it at once Anything you would like specially fancy Bread and butter now or cake perhaps Will you take a seat two seats Tony had followed me in And look at yesterday s paper Oh yes you can have tea of course of course of course Of His words petered out as he clattered off down a like flagged passage I looked at Tony and raised my eyebrows Seems a trifle mad I said How delightfully cool said she looking round the old fashioned room appraisingly and so clean I think we ll stop Let s have tea before we decide I suggested The proprietor is distinctly eccentric to say the least of it He looked quite a superior man I thought said Tony Not the least like a Welshman Tony herself comes from far north of the Tweed The hotel was small and the kitchen apparently not far away for we could not avoid hearing sounds of what appeared to be a heated argument coming from the direction in which mine host had vanished We were used to heated arguments in the hotels at which we had put up but they had invariably taken place in Welsh whereas this one was undoubtedly in English Snatches of it reached our ears haven t the pluck of a rabbit Bill all very well but I m not afraid I ll Then our host returned It s coming it s coming it s coming he said his hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets jingling loose change in a manner that suggested agitation He stood looking down at us as though we were something he didn t quite know what to do with and then an idea seemed to strike him and be vanished for a moment to reappear almost immediately in the square gap of the bar window Have a drink while you re waiting he asked much more naturally I looked at my watch It was half past four Very free and easy with the licensing laws I thought I thought six o clock was opening time I said The thin man was overcome with confusion His face flushed red he shut the window down with a bang and a moment after came round to us again Awfully sorry he stammered apologetically Might get the house a bad name Deuced inconsiderate of of my uncle not to leave me a book of the rules Very bad break that what Evidently Tony was not so much impressed by the eccentricities of our host as was I She approved of the hotel and its situation and had made up her mind to stop I could tell it by her face as she addressed the proprietor Have you accommodation if we should make up our minds to stay here for a few days she asked Stay here You want to stay he repeated consternation written large all over his face Good G I mean certainly of course of course He bolted down the passage like a rabbit and we heard hoarse whispering from the direction in which he had gone Dotty I suggested Not a bit of it retorted Tony Nervous because he is new to his job but very anxious to be obliging We shall do splendidly here I shrugged my shoulders and said no more because I know Tony I have been married to her for years and years Light steps upon the tiles heralded something new different but equally surprising Tea is served madam if you will step this way She was the apotheosis of all waitresses Her frock was black but it was of silk and finely cut Her apron of coarse white cotton was grotesque against it She had neat little feet encased in high heeled shoes and her stockings were of silk Her common cap that she wore sat coquettishly on her dark curls and her face was charming though petrified in that unnatural expression of distance which as a rule only the very best menials can attain There were no other guests in the coffee room and this marvel of maids devoted the whole of her attention to us standing over us like a column of ice which thawed only to attend upon our wants There was no getting past her veil of reticence Tony tried her with questions but Yes madam No madam and Certainly madam appeared the sum of her vocabulary Yet when we sent her to the kitchen for more hot water we were conscious of a whispering and giggling which assured us that off the stage she could thaw We must stay a day or two said Tony I m dying to paidle in that burn My dear how often have you promised me that you would never subject me to Scotch after we were married I protested When I see a burn I e en must juist paidle in it retorted Tony deliberately forswearing herself So we ll book that room At that moment the celestial waitress returned with the hot water and Tony made known her determination I drive the car but Tony supplies the driving power Certainly madam I shall speak to mister Gunthorpe Quickly she returned Number ten is vacant The boots and chambermaid are both away at a sheep trial but we expect them back any moment I shall show you the room madam and if you will leave the car sir until the boots returns That will be all right No hurry no hurry While we were examining our bedroom and finding it all that could be desired I heard a car draw up before the hotel and the sound of voices in conversation A few minutes later on going downstairs I made the acquaintance of the boots He was obviously awaiting me by my car and touched his forelock in a manner rarely seen off the stage He wore khaki cord breeches with leather leggings a striped shirt open at the neck and chewed a straw desperately In no other respect did he resemble the boots of an out of the way hotel Garage round this way sir he said guiding me to my destination which I found already contained a two seater of the same make as my own Ripping little car eh said the boots chewing vigorously at his straw as he stood his hands deep in what are graphically known as go to hell pockets and his legs well straddled Hop over anything what Topping weather we re having been like this for weeks If you don t mind old chap you might wiggle her over this way a bit Something else might blow in eh I looked at this latest manifestation with undisguised astonishment but he was imperturbable and merely chewed his straw with renewed energy That s the stuff old lad he said as I laid the car in position What now Shall I give you a hand up with the trunk or will you hump it yourself Don t mind me a bit I m ready for anything He looked genial but I found him familiar so with a curt Take it to number ten I strode off to overtake Tony whom I saw half way down a rough path that led to her beloved burn I ve seen the chambermaid she said when I overtook her Such a pretty girl but very shy and unsophisticated Quite a girl but wears a wedding ring I watched Tony paidling for some time but as the amusement consisted mainly of getting her under apparel wet I grew tired of it and climbed back to the hotel The bar window was open once more in the little lounge and mister Gunthorpe was behind his arms resting upon the ledge Have a drink he said as I entered It s all right now The balloon s gone up I looked at my watch It was after six o clock I ll have a small Scotch and soda I decided This is on the house said the eccentric landlord He produced two glasses and filled them and I noticed that he took money from his pocket and placed it in the till Well success to the new management I said raising my glass to his Cheerio and thank you said he smiling genially upon me He seemed to me more self possessed and less eccentric than he had appeared upon our arrival I determined to draw him out It s funny that an Australian should have owned an hotel away up in the Welsh hills I hazarded Did he die recently Australia You must have misunderstood me said mister Gunthorpe with a hunted look in his eyes Very likely very likely I said Ostend Ostend Well possibly I did I agreed feeling certain that I had made no mistake Had he a hotel there as well Yes yes Of course of course of course agreed the landlord largely redundant And are you running that as well Heaven forbid he exclaimed with a shudder You see this this is just a small legacy It ll be all right by and by All right all right Let s have another drink With me I insisted Not at all not at all On the house All for the good of the house Come along Bob have a drink It was the boots who had now entered and he strolled up to the bar with all the self possession of a welcome guest Just a spot of Scotch old thing he said brightly It s a hard life Shaking down good and comfy laddie this last to me Ask for anything you fancy It doesn t follow you ll get it but if we have it it s yours Tinkle tinkle crash crash With this unusual toast he raised his glass and drained it Have another he said Three Scotches Boniface I protested This was too hot and fast for me altogether Besides I did not fancy being indebted to this somewhat overwhelming boots My protest was of no avail The glasses were filled while yet the words were upon my lips I thought of Tony and trembled Common decency would force me to stand still another round before I could cry a halt All well in the buttery asked the boots in a confidential tone of the landlord The banquet is in preparation replied the latter Everything is in train Heaven grant that it comes out of train reasonably laddie said boots fervently But you know Molly I wouldn t trust an ostrich to her cooking Here s hoping for the best He drained his glass again and this time I managed to get a show Three more whiskies please landlord and Tony in clear view cut up into nice squares by the little leaded panes I got mine absorbed just in time and was on the doorstep to meet her draggle skirted and untidy but enthusiastic about her burn She broke her vows three times on the way up to number ten and excused her lapses on the ground that the burn was the perfect image of one near a place she called Pairth When she rang for hot water to wash away the traces of her ablutions in the burn I had my first view of the chambermaid I found her even more ravishing than the waitress downstairs and with the additional advantage that she was not stand offish indeed she was a giggler She giggled at my slightest word and Tony altered her first impression and dubbed her a forward hussy Personally I liked the girl though she broke all precedent by attending upon us in a silk blouse and a tailor made tweed skirt When I wandered downstairs before dinner I came upon her again this time unmistakably in the arms of the ubiquitous boots I had walked innocently into a small sitting room where a lamp already shone and I came upon the romantic picture unexpectedly With a murmured word of inarticulate apology I made to retire It s all right old fruit don t hurry away said boots affably Awfully sorry and all that Quite forgot it was a public room don t you know The chambermaid giggled once more and bolted straightening her cap as she went You don t mind do you continued boots making a clumsy show of trimming the lamp Warm is the greeting when seas have rolled between us Perhaps not quite that but you see the idea eh He would doubtless have said more being evidently of a cheery nature had not the waitress of the afternoon appeared in the doorway her face as frozen as a mask of ice Bob kennel she said sharply and held the door wide The cheeriness vanished and the boots followed it through the open doorway I trust you will excuse him sir said the waitress deferentially He is just a little deranged but quite harmless We employ him out of charity sir I may have been mistaken but a sound uncommonly like the chambermaid s giggle came to me from the passage without The sound of a car stopping outside the hotel drew me to the window as the waitress left me and I was in time to see an old gentleman with a long white beard step from the interior of a Daimler landaulette the door of which was held open by a dignified chauffeur whose attire seemed to consist mainly of brass buttons A consultation evidently took place in the smoking room or bar between this patriarch and the proprietor and then I heard agitated voices in the passage without It s a blinking invasion said mister Gunthorpe I tell you we can t do it Good heavens they threaten to stop a month if they are comfortable Don t worry then old bean They won t stop long This in the voice of boots And they want special diet Old girl can t eat meat Suffers from a duodenal ulcer I tell you we got quick intimate We can t do it Molly Fathead of course we can I ll concoct her something the like of which her what you may call it has never before tackled Run along Bill and be affable Shall I stand them a drink mister Gunthorpe again Do old bean I ll come and have one too said boots You won t Bob You ll see to the chauffeur and the car and the luggage Hang the luggage I ll stand the chauffeur a drink Then the female voice spoke warningly You ve had enough drinks already both of you it said You ought to bear in mind that you re not running the hotel just for your two selves It s all right old girl There s plenty for everybody Cellar s full of it The voices died away and I strolled out into the bar once more mister Gunthorpe was being affable according to instructions to the old gentleman while an old lady in a bonnet looked on piercingly Quite all right about the diet the landlord was saying as I entered We make a specialty of special diets In fact our ordinary diet is a special diet Certainly of course We ve got mulligatawny soup sardines roast beef trifle and gorgonzola cheese Perhaps you ll have a drink while you wait Certainly not sir replied the old gentleman testily You seem to be unable to comprehend My wife has a duodenal ulcer sir Had it for fourteen years in September and you talk to me of mulligatawny soup I quite understand of course of course replied mister Gunthorpe urbanely Everything of a an irritating character will be left out of the Then it won t be mulligatawny soup you fool exploded the old lady whose pressure I had seen rising for some time Certainly not madam Of course indubitably We ll call it beef tea and it will never know What will never know asked the old gentleman with an air of puzzlement Madam s duodenal ulcer sir replied the landlord with a deferential bow dedicated doubtless to that organ Each separate hair in the old gentleman s beard began to curl and coil with the electricity of exasperation and at every moment I expected to see sparks fly out from it The old lady folded her hands across her treasure and looked daggers at the landlord How far is it to the nearest hotel John she demanded acidly Too far to go to night Mary I m afraid we must put up with this this sanatorium replied her husband As a diversion I demanded an appetizer a gin and bitters mister Gunthorpe s face lit up and he bolted behind the bar Certainly of course Have it with me he exclaimed eagerly his eyes full of gratitude for the diversion I had the greatest difficulty in paying for our two drinks for of course mister Gunthorpe would not let me drink alone and I was equally insistent that the house had done enough for me Then we must have another he declared as the only way out of the difficulty Fortunately for me Tony appeared on the scene clothed and in her right mind speaking once more the English language and I contrived to avoid further stimulation mister Gunthorpe looked at me reproachfully as I moved off with my wife I could see that he dreaded further interrogation on the subject of diets Nothing further of moment occurred before dinner Tony and I went out and admired the wonderful view in the dim half light and just as the midges got the better of us even my foul old pipe did not give us the victory the gong sounded for dinner and covered our retreat It was the maddest dinner in which I have ever participated Three tables were laid in the little coffee room and as Tony and I were the first to put in an appearance I had the curiosity to look at the bill of fare at the first table I came to This way sir if you please said the chilling voice of our exemplary waitress Already I had deciphered beef tea and steamed sole on the card and concluded that the table was reserved for the duodenal ulcer At the table to which we were conducted I found mulligatawny soup figuring on the menu and I wondered The old lady and gentleman were ushered to their seats by the boots now smartly dressed in striped trousers and black coat and waistcoat I say smartly because the clothes were of good material and the wearer looked easily the best clad man in the hotel The two places laid at the third table were taken by a boy and girl of such youthful appearance that both Tony and I were astonished to find them living alone in an hotel The boy might have been fifteen and the girl twelve at the most but that they were overwhelmingly at home in their surroundings was quickly manifest as was the fact that they were brother and sister This latter fact was evidenced by the manner in which the boy bullied the girl and contradicted her at every opportunity There was something of a strained wait when all of us had taken our places I saw the old gentleman eye glasses on the tip of his nose studying the bill of fare intently Then he turned to his wife Minced chicken and rice peptonized he said suspiciously Did you ever hear of such a dish Mary Never But nothing would surprise me in this place replied his wife looking round the room with a censorious eye that even included the innocent Tony and myself The two children chuckled They wore an air of expectancy such as I have noticed in my nephews and nieces when I have been inveigled into taking them to Maskelyne s show They seemed on very intimate terms with the waitress and the mere sight of the boots sent them into fits of suppressed chuckling He standing by the sideboard napkin over arm added to their hilarity by winking violently at regular intervals Catching my eye upon him he crossed to our table Everything all right eh he said glancing over the lay out of our table Everything except that so far we have had no food I replied It s the soup he said leaning confidentially to my ear The cat fell into it and they re combing it out of her fur Have a drink while you wait No All right old thing I dare say you know best when you ve had enough Shut up you kids Don t you see you re irritating the old boy This in a hoarse aside to the children at the next table It made them giggle the more Surely they are very young to be stopping here alone said Tony with a touch of her national inquisitiveness Very sad case madam replied the boots We found them here when we came You know wrapped in a blanket on the doorstep Not quite perhaps but you see the idea Sort of wards of the hotel He was interrupted by the entrance of the waitress with soup She gave him a frozen glance and a jerk of the head and he vanished to the kitchen to return with more soup and at last we got a start on our meal The soup was good notwithstanding the story of the cat It really was mulligatawny There was no doubt about that The old couple were not so well satisfied They sipped a little had a whispered consultation and beckoned the boots Waiter why do you call this beef tea demanded the old gentleman You can t have me there my lad retorted boots cheerily From the Latin beef beef and tea tea beef tea Take a spoonful of tea and a lump of beef shake well together simmer gently till ready and serve with a ham frill The old gentleman s face showed deep purple against his white whiskers and the waitress left our table hurriedly hustled the boots from the room and crossed to the old couple I could not hear all she said but I understood that the boots was liable to slight delusions but quite harmless The beef tea was the best that could be prepared on such short notice and so on It was the main course of the meal that brought the climax It was roast beef and Yorkshire pudding excellently cooked and so far as we were concerned efficiently served The irrepressible boots had however by this time drifted back to duty I saw him bear plates to the old people s table containing a pale mess which I rightly concluded was the minced chicken and rice peptonized already referred to by the old gentleman The couple eyed it suspiciously while their attendant hovered near apparently awaiting the congratulations which were bound to follow the consumption of the dish John it s beef screamed the old lady starting to her feet and spluttering Damme so it is confirmed her husband after a bare mouthful Hi you scoundrel poisoner assassin send the manager here at once He waved his napkin in fury and boots cocked an eye at him curiously Won t you have another try he urged Be sporty about it Hang it it looks like chopped chicken and it is chopped I chopped it myself Have another try You ll believe it in time if you persevere It s the first step that counts you know I used to be able to say that in French but He only got so far because the old gentleman had been inarticulate with rage Fetch the manager and don t dare utter another word confound you he shouted A few moments later our friend mister Gunthorpe entered His eyes were bright and a satisfied smile rested on his lips Good evening sir he began affably I believe you sent for me I hope everything is to your taste Everything is nothing of the sort sir retorted the old gentleman You have attempted a gross fraud upon us sir I find on the menu chicken and it is nothing more nor less than chopped beef And peptonized peptonized be hanged sir It s no more peptonized than my hat Well sir as for your hat I can say nothing but None of your insolence sir I insist on having this filth taken away and something suitable put before us My wife has possessed a duodenal ulcer for fourteen years come September and Be hanged to your duodenal ulcer As this isn t its birthday why should it have a blinking banquet Let it take pot luck with the rest of us A sudden burst of uncontrollable laughter made me turn sharply to find that the reserve had fallen from our chilly waitress who was vainly endeavouring to smother her laughter in her professional napkin Oh Bill she cried you ve done it now The game s up The old lady and gentleman arose in outraged dignity and started to leave the room when a diversion was caused by the entrance of a pleasant faced lady in hat and cloak I had been semi conscious for some moments of a motor engine running at the hotel door Oh mister Gunthorpe what luck cried the newcomer I ve collected a full staff and brought them all up from Dolgelly with me look you Thank heaven exclaimed the proprietor As soon as your barmaid is on her job we ll drink all their healths I hope you won t be annoyed Miss Jones but I fear I very greatly fear you will lose a couple of likely customers at dawn or soon after Here they are Perhaps you can still pacify them I can t Miss Jones turned to the old couple who were waiting for the doorway to clear with a disarming and conciliatory smile I hope you will make allowances she said with a musical Welsh intonation I am the manageress and everything is at sixes and sevens look you This morning I had trouble with the staff and just to annoy me they all cleared off together I had to leave the hotel to see what I could find in Dolgelly mister Gunthorpe and the other guests in the hotel very kindly offered to see to things while I was away and I m sure they have done their best indeed Done their best to poison us certainly growled the old gentleman My wife has a duo That s all right old chap interrupted mister Gunthorpe Miss Jones is an expert in those things She ll feed it the proper tack believe me Give her a chance and don t blame her for our shortcomings By this time the whole mock staff had taken the stage waitress boots chambermaid and a pleasant faced lady of matronly appearance who I learnt was missus Gunthorpe and the mother of the two children of whom we had been told such a harrowing history And just think dear said Tony smiling at me across the table The boots and the chambermaid are on their honeymoon He is a journalist How do you know all this I demanded suspiciously I wormed the whole thing out of the chambermaid at the very beginning said Tony I didn t tell you because I thought it would be more fun Miss Jones succeeded in pacifying the old couple somehow mainly I think by promises of a new regime and we left them in the coffee room looking almost cheerful Tony and I went out to talk in the moonlight while I smoked an after dinner cigar We were gone for some time and on our return decided to go straight upstairs to bed I noticed that lights still burned in the coffee room and heard the sound of voices from that direction Thinking that some late guests had arrived during our absence I had the curiosity to glance round the door The whole of our late staff sat round a table on which were arrayed much food and several gilt topped bottles Come along Do join us cried mister Gunthorpe sighting us at once Come and celebrate the end of this bat in the belfry sort of management added boots holding high a sparkling glass It ended in Tony and I being dragged into the celebration and that ended in quite a late sitting Tony and I lingered on for over a week at the Bat and Belfry Inn as we all called it and so strange to say did the duodenal couple whom indeed we left there special dieting to their hearts content THE LIE By HOLLOWAY HORN From The Blue Magazine and Harper s Bazar nineteen twenty two The hours had passed with the miraculous rapidity which tinctures time when one is on the river and now overhead the moon was a gorgeous yellow lantern in a greyish purple sky The punt was moored at the lower end of Glover s Island on the Middlesex side and rose and fell gently on the ebbing tide A girl was lying back amidst the cushions her hands behind her head looking up through the vague tracery of leaves to the soft moonlight Even in the garish day she was pretty but in that enchanting dimness she was wildly beautiful The hint of strength around her mouth was not quite so evident perhaps Her hair was the colour of oaten straw in autumn and her deep blue eyes were dark in the gathering night But despite her beauty the man s face was averted from her He was gazing out across the smoothly flowing water troubled and thoughtful A good looking face but not so strong as the girl s in spite of her prettiness and enormously less vital Ten minutes before he had proposed to her and had been rejected It was not the first time but he had been very much more hopeful than on the other occasions The air was softly embracingly warm that evening Together they had watched the lengthening shadows creep out across the old river And it was spring still which makes a difference There is something in the year s youth the sap is rising in the plants something there is anyway beyond the sentimentality of the poets And overhead was the great yellow lantern gleaming at them through the branches with ironic approval But in spite of everything she had shaken her head and all he received was the maddening assurance that she liked him I shall never marry she had concluded Never You know why Yes I know the man said miserably Carruthers And so he was looking out moodily almost savagely across the water when the temptation came to him He would not have minded quite so much if Carruthers had been alive but he was dead and slept in the now silent Salient where a little cross marked his bed Alive one could have striven against him striven desperately although Carruthers had always been rather a proposition But now it seemed hopeless a man cannot strive with a memory It was not fair so the man s thoughts were running He had shared Carruthers risks although he had come back This persistent and exclusive devotion to a man who would never return to her was morbid Suddenly his mind was made up Olive he said Yes she replied quietly What I am going to tell you I do for both our sakes You will probably think I m a cad but I m taking the risk He was sitting up but did not meet her eyes What on earth are you talking about she demanded You know that apart from you Carruthers and I were pals Yes she said wondering And suddenly she burst out petulantly What is it you want to say He was no better than other men he replied bluntly It is wrong that you should sacrifice your life to a memory wrong that you should worship an idol with feet of clay I loath parables she said coldly Will you tell me exactly what you mean about feet of clay The note in her voice was not lost on the man by her side I don t like telling you under other conditions I wouldn t But I do it for both our sakes Then for goodness sake do it I came across it accidentally at the Gordon Hotel at Brighton He stayed there whilst he was engaged to you with a lady whom he described as missus Carruthers It was on his last leave Why do you tell me this she asked after a silence her voice was low and a little husky Surely my dear you must see He was no better than other men The ideal you have conjured up is no ideal He was a brave soldier a darned brave soldier and until we both fell in love with you my pal But it is not fair that his memory should absorb you It s it s unnatural I suppose you think I should be indignant There was no emotion of any kind in her voice I simply want you to see that your idol has feet of clay he said with the stubbornness of a man who feels he is losing What has that to do with it You know I loved him Other girls have loved he said bitterly And forgotten Yes I know she interrupted him But I do not forget that is all But after what I have told you Surely You see I knew she said even more quietly than before You knew Yes It was I who was with him It was his last leave she added thoughtfully And only the faint noise of the water and the wistful wind in the trees overhead broke the silence A GIRL IN IT By ROWLAND KENNEY From The New Age nineteen twenty two I was just cooking a couple of two eyed steaks when Black Mick walked in and noting the look in his eyes and being for some reason in an expansive mood I offered him a sit down After comparing notes on the various possibilities of the district with regard to job getting we turned on to a discussion of the relative moralities of begging and stealing But in this I found Mick was not vitally interested both were too deeply immoral for him to touch For Mick was a worker He liked work Vagrancy to him made no appeal To settle down was his one definite desire But jobs refused to hold him and the road gripped him in spite of himself So the problem presented itself to him in an abstract way only to me there was a real but let that go Mick s respectability was uncanny He could speculate on these things as if they were matters affecting none of us there In that fourpenny doss house he remained as aloof as a god and in some vague way the calmness of the man in face of this infringing realism for a time repelled me We cleaned up my packet to the last shred and crumb and I found a couple of fag ends in my pocket We smoked silently Mick s manner gradually affected me We became somehow mentally detached from the place in which we sat We were in a corner of the room at the end of the longest table and so incurious about the rest of the company that neither of us knew whether there were two or twenty men there For a while Mick was absorbed in his smoke and then I saw him slowly turn his head to the door It was a languid movement His dark eyes were half veiled as he watched for the entrance of someone who fumbled at the latch Then in an instant as the face of the newcomer thrust forward Black Mick s whole personality seemed to change His eyelids lifted showing great glowing eyes staring from a cold set face His back squared and the table clamped to the floor creaked protestingly as his sprawled legs were drawn up and the knees pressed against the under part A second only he stared then slung himself full forward The newcomer was a live man quicker than Mick The recognition between the two was apparently mutual for as Mick vaulted the table the other rushed forward grabbed the poker from the grate and got home on Mick s head with it Before I could get near enough to grip the door again banged and our visitor had disappeared There was a girl in it said Mick to me when we took the road together a fortnight later and that was as far as he got in explanation It was enough I could read men a little To Mick women all women were sacred creatures In the scheme of nature woman was good and man was evil Passion was a male attribute an evil fire that scorched and burned and rendered impotent the protesting innocence of hapless femininity So we tramped One public works after the other we made always with the same result no chance of a take on Often we got a lift in food ale or even cash from some gang where one of us was known but that was all Everywhere the reply to our request for a job was the same Full Up And then we made Liverpool My favourite kip in Liverpool was Bevington House in the Scotland Road district but on this occasion I had news that Twinetoes an old mate of mine had taken in that night at a private doss house and the probability was that he would not only give us a lift but would be able to tell us pretty accurately what was the state of the labour market It was a rotten kip Four men were squabbling over the frying pan when we entered and over against the far wall sat an old crone crooning an Irish song The men were of the ordinary dock rat type scraggily built unshaven with cunning shifty eyes The woman had an old browned green kerchief round her head and a ragged shawl drawn tightly round her breasts One side of her face had evidently been burned some time and the eye on that side ran continually Got any money dearie she said to Mick No mother Mick replied gently taking her hand Is there a fellow here called Twinetoes No blurry use t me if no money and she went on with her damnable singing like a lost soul wailing for its natural hell The Boss came in from the kitchen Twinetoes Damned funny moniker Never eerd it he said But there s a bloke asleep upstairs as calls isself Brum Mebbe it s im It was Twinetoes lay in his navvy clobber on a dirty bed drunk dead to the world We could not rouse him What a kennel said Mick There s a smell about it I don t like There was a smell not the common musty smell of cheap doss houses something much worse than that You pay your fourpence and takes your choice I said with an intended grandiloquent sweep of my hand towards the dozen derelict beds We selected two that lay in an alcove at the end of the room farthest from the door and turned in In a few minutes we were both asleep Suddenly I awoke A clock outside struck one There was no sound in the room but the now subdued snoring of Twinetoes I was at once wide awake but I lay quite still breathing as naturally as possible keeping my eyes more than half closed for I felt some sinister presence in the room A new pollution affected the atmosphere Bending over me was the old crone Downstairs she had seemed aimless shapeless almost helpless an object of disgusting pitifulness Now dark as it was and unexpected as was the visit I could at once see that she was as active and alert as a monkey On going to bed I had put my boots under my pillow and thrown my coat over me keeping the cuff of one sleeve in my hand A practised claw slipped under my head and deftly fingered the insides of my boots Blank The coat pockets were next examined Blank Still I dog slept The wrinkled lips were now working angrily churning up two specks of foam that shone white in the corners of the mouth The running eye rained tears of rage down her left cheek and the other one glowed and dulled a winking red spark in the gloom as she looked quickly up and down the bed Her left hand hung down by her side the arm tense Then as she slipped her right hand under the clothes in an effort to go over the rest of me I gave a half turn and a low sleep moan to warn her off At once the left hand shot up over my head the lean fingers clutching a foot of lead pipe Again I tried to appear sound asleep With eyes tight shut I lay still I dared not move One glimpse of that tortured face had shown me that I could hope for nothing the utter folly of mercy or half measures was fully understood Yet effort was impossible I was simply and completely afraid The lead pipe did not however meet my skull Hearing a slight scuffle I peeped out to find that there were now two figures in the gloom The Boss had crept up seized the hag s left arm and was pointing to the door She held back and in silent pantomime showed that Mick had not been gone over yet With her free hand she gathered her one skirt over her dirty skinny knees and danced with rage by the side of my bed She looked like the parody of some carrion creature seen in the nightmare of a starving man The most terrible thing about her was her amazing silence the mad dance of her stockinged feet on the bare boards made no sound The Boss loosened his hold on her wrist but took away the lead pipe from her and she slipped over to Mick Again those skinny claws went through their evolutions with uncanny silence and effect whilst I lay every muscle taut ready to spring up if occasion required My nerve had returned and now that the piece of lead pipe was in the hands of the less fiendish partner of this strange concern I was ready to wade in But she found nothing and Mick slept on We were too poor to rob but this only enraged her the more Her fingers twisted themselves into the shawl at her breast and she silently but vehemently spat at Mick s head as she moved away For half an hour I tried in vain to sleep and then the Boss again appeared This time he bore a huge bulk of patched and soiled canvas part of an old sail which he hung from the ceiling across the middle of the room thus shutting off Twinetoes Mick and myself from that part where was the door on to the stairs He was not noisy but he made no attempt to keep the previous death stillness of the house As the Boss descended the stairs a surprising thing happened and Mick awoke Girlish laughter rippled up the stairs God Almighty said Mick what s that Again it came and with it the gurgling of the old woman It was impossible and incredible that mingling in the fetid air of those two sounds as if the babble of clear spring water had suddenly broken into and merged with the turgid roll of a city sewer Mick sat up But this is bloody he said Wait was all I replied We waited Mick slipped out of bed carefully opened his knife and made a few judicious slits in the veiling canvas My senses had become abnormally acute I seemed to hear every shade of sound within and without the house I could sense I imagined the very positions in which sat the persons in the kitchen below Even Twinetoes was affected by the tense atmosphere He murmured in his sleep and seemed somewhat sobered for his limbs took more natural positions on the bed The darkness was no longer a bar to vision By now I could see quite clearly and so I believe could Mick The old woman was mumbling to the girl S aw ri mi dear Av a drink o this W ll fix y up aw ri She had again dropped into the low uncertain voice of aimless senility The girl remained silent Glasses clinked The Boss I could hear walked up and down the kitchen busy with some final work of the night A confused murmur came from another corner but I could not distinguish the words The dock rats were apparently discussing something Again that ripple of sound ascended the stairs but this time there was an added note of apprehension It broke very faintly but pitifully before dying away to the sound of light footsteps Half a dozen stairs were pressed then came a stumble and a girlish A ah She recovered herself as the hateful voice from behind said Aw ri m dear and older surer feet felt the stairs and pushed on behind the girl Through the veiling canvas and the old walls I seemed to see the pair ascending A few seconds more and a slight farm rounded the jamb of the door The girl s eyes blinked in the walled twilight of the room She hesitated on the threshold but only for a second The touch of a following frame impelled her forward Her uncertain foot caught against a bed leg and a white hand gripped the steadying rail Long nailed claws laced themselves in the fingers of her other hand and the old woman half drew half twisted her into sitting down on the edge of the bed They began to talk quietly I examined them more closely The old crone still played the part of ancient childhood mumbling words of little import and obscenely fingering the girl s arms head and waist Some instinct led her to veil her eyes from the girl for from those differing orbs gleamed all the wickedness of her mangled and distorted soul Fountains rained from her left eye whilst the right again held that sinister glow The girl was half drunk and I fancied drugged She swayed slightly where she sat She wore a small hat of a dark velvety material a white loose blouse and what seemed a dark blue skirt Round her neck hung an old fashioned link of coral beads Her brow was low but broad and her hair brushed back from the forehead was bunched large behind but not below the head Her roving eyes gradually overcoming the clinging gloom of the place were dark brown and unnaturally bright Half open in an empty smile her lips disclosed white but somewhat irregular teeth Seen plainly in such surroundings she was to me a pitiable and undesirable creature I did not like the looks of her now The mental image formed on the sound of her laughter was infinitely preferable to the sight of her She was I fancied some servant girl of a romantic nature I was right I don t care she was saying I ll never go back Trust me Had enough Slavey for four bob a week Taint good enough They said if I couldn t be in by arf past nine I d find the door locked And I did They c n keep it locked S aw ri You go t sleep ere wi me W ll put yo t ri s Y ll av a luvly dress t morro an a go time Wait t l y see the young man we ll find y t morro Now go t bed Those twining fingers ceased toying with the girl s hair and deftly slipped a protecting hook from an all too easy eye in the back of the girl s blouse Three years I ve been a slavey for those stuck up pigs said the girl in a subdued mutter and then she went on to recount quaintly and in a half incoherent jumble the salient facts of her life I glanced at Mick He was leaning forward peering through another slit His face had its old set look stern condemnatory Twice I had had to reach out and grip his wrist He wanted to interfere I was waiting I knew not for what As the muttering proceeded the busy fingers of the old woman loosened the clothes of the indifferent girl who soon stood swaying by the side of the bed in her chemise Deftly the dirty quilt was slipped back and the girlish form rolled into the creaking bed The muttering went on for a few minutes whilst the old woman sat watching the flushed face and the tumbled hair on the pillow The girl s right arm was thrown carelessly abroad over the quilt the shoulder gleaming white in the deeper shadow thrown by the old woman who sat with her back to us looking down intently at this waiting morsel of humanity If we had not seen her before we could have imagined her to be praying Mick for the first time since their entry into the room suddenly looked over at me The same thoughts must have flashed through both our brains What was wrong Was anything wrong Surely the affair was quite simple and the canvas screen violated by Mick s knife had expressed the needed attempt at decency The muttering died down and the room was hushed to strained silence to be broken soon by a furtive pad on the stairs Mick and I were again alert staring through the canvas slits The Boss now appeared followed by one of the dock rats They glanced at the bed and then looked enquiringly at the old woman Ol Soloman sh d fork out a termer for this she said in low but clear tones But it s got to be a proper job Then to the Boss and pointing to the screen indicating the position of our beds You lamming idiot Didn t I tell yo Yo sh d a took their bits an outed m The dock rat was tip toeing about the bed like a starved rodent outside a wire screened piece of food His glance shifted from that gleaming shoulder hunched up over the slim neck to the heavy face of the Boss and then to the old woman returning quickly to the form on the bed Oo s goin t do it asked the old crone of the Boss You or Bill and she drew down the clothes exposing the limp sprawled limbs of the sleeping girl The Boss did not reply He simply took a half stride back away from the bed The dock rat s eyes gleamed he had noted the movement He ceased his tip toeing about and looked at the Boss What s my share Blimy Your share returned the Boss in a hoarse whisper Then pointing to the waiting half naked form That In their contemplation of their victim they were so absorbed that they apparently forgot entirely the three of us bedded on the other side of the hanging sail Mick and I were staggered We looked at each other realising at the self same instant the whole purpose of this curious conference By some subtle and secret processes of the mind again there seemed to be a change in the atmosphere of the room Its sordid dinginess was no longer present to our consciousness There was new life heart and vigour and in some curious way our mentalities seemed merged together No longer puzzled we were vibrant with a common purpose I was angry and disgusted Mick was moved to the inmost sanctuary of his Celtic being He manifested the last degree of outrage and insult of agonised anger For the moment we were cleansed of all the pettiness and grossness common to manhood inspired only with a new born worship of the inviolable right of the individual to the disposal of its own tokens of affection and life And this new spirit of ours pervaded the room The girl moaned in her drunken sleep Twinetoes turned restlessly in bed and the lines of his face sharpened and deepened Something was killing the poison in both Even the trio about the girl were momentarily moved by some new sensation Mick s accustomed recklessness of action was gone he was cool and prepared to be calculating We slipped on our boots and I moved over to Twinetoes bed I touched his arm Mumbling curses he opened his eyes It s Mac I whispered leaning over and looking steadyingly into his face Wot the ell he began but I managed to silence him Once accustomed to the gloom his eyes took in the strangeness of the situation and painfully swallowing the foul nausea of his drunk he calmly and quietly pulled on his boots The old woman had again covered up the still sleeping girl and engaged the Boss in a wrangle about money You ll bloody well swing yet said the Boss irrelevantly Mebbe but that don t alter it I wants my full share n I means to av it Dispassionately the dock rat eyed them both and hoped for the best for himself We had ceased to exist for them Goin asked the dock rat as the others moved towards the stairs They looked at him but did not reply So far as we were aware though we had forgotten the entire world outside that room there had been complete silence downstairs but now we could hear movement The other dock rats were evidently awake and waiting As the foot of the Boss fell on the top stair the spell seemed to fall from Mick He glared fixedly at the dock rat who stood by the girl s bed I ll tear his guts out said Mick with appalling certainty of tone The old woman heard it The lead pipe again in her fist like a cornered rat she whipped round Mick did not wait full at the canvas he sprang His Irish impulsiveness overcame caution and in a moment he was wrapped in the hanging sail the old woman battering the bellying folds The dock rat s head was knocking at the wall Twinetoes cursing rhythmically and shutting off his breath with fingers of steel My left eye was half closed and the Boss s knuckles were bleeding The girl awake and utterly confounded blinked foolishly and silently weakly trying to fix her eyes on some definite point in the tangled thread of palpitating life that surged about her Look out Drop him I shouted to Twinetoes as I swung in furious but with some care to the face of the Boss Twinetoes did not heed he staggered across the room under a blow from one of the new arrivals but he did not loose his hold He was a hefty man entirely reliable indeed almost happy in such an affair As number two dock rat tried to follow up his blow Twinetoes swung number one round in his way then changing his hold taking both the man s shoulders in his hands he drew back his head as a snake does and butted his man clean over one of the beds His face a pitiful pulp number one was definitely out of it Ordinarily the Boss would have been much too much for me but now fate favoured me He was considerably perturbed about the possible outcome of the row and its effect on his business I was intent only on the fight With a clean left hand cut I drove him over tore a quilt from a bed and flung it over his dazed head then swung round to where the lead pipe was still flailing I was concerned for Mick Seizing the old woman s shoulders I flung her back from Mick and the sail He would have cleared himself but his legs were somehow mixed up with the foot of the bed and she occupied his attention too much The hag raised the lead and rushed and for the only time in my life I hit a woman Without hesitancy or compunction only revolted at the thought of such contact with such matter I smashed her down The Boss and Mick freed themselves together and embraced each other willingly Twinetoes was playing skittles with the remaining dock rats There was surprisingly little noise No one shouted There was no howling hounding on of each other All but the girl were absorbed in the immediate business of giving or warding off of blows Dress quick I said to the girl The fight had shifted to the centre and her bed had remained unmoved herself unmolested In wondering silence she obeyed Quicker Quicker I enjoined with a new brutal note in my voice The reaction had set in I could cheerfully have shoved her down the stairs and flung her garments after her The kip was hidden away in a dark alley the history and reputation of which were shudderingly doubtful but there were police within dangerous hailing distance The girl s lips began to quiver Supposing she broke down and raised the court by hysterical howling Don t breathe a sound or we ll leave you to it I threatened She shrank back gave a low moan and clutched my coat I tore her hand loose and turned away in time to floor the Boss by an easy blow on his left ear The fight was finished We wasted no time but descended the stairs and passed out through the court into the street There were signs of life in the gloomy court though no one spoke or molested us the street was dead silent Mick s arms and shoulders were a mass of bruises from the lead pipe but his face was clear Twinetoes was all right he said but craving for a wet I alone showed evidence of the struggle my eye was unsightly and painful and my left wrist was slightly sprained The girl sobbed quietly Oh Oh she cried repeatedly whatever s to become of me She irritated me Shut up I said at last You ll be all right She snuffled unceasingly I looked across at Mick she walked between us Twinetoes on my right and at once I saw the outcome of it all Stop it blast you I shook her shoulder My pal is the best biggest fool that ever raised a fist He s silly enough for anything decent and then with the voice of conviction born of absolute certainty of mind He ll never chuck you over He ll marry you sometime you fool And he did THE BACKSTAIRS OF THE MIND By ROSAMOND LANGBRIDGE From The Manchester Guardian nineteen twenty two 
6454_107462_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Patrick Deasey described himself as a philosopher psychologist and humorist 
6454_107462_000005_000001	train-clean-100	It was partly because Patrick delighted in long words and partly to excuse himself for being full of the sour cream of an inhuman curiosity 
none	none	His curiosity however did not extend itself to science and belles lettres it concerned itself wholly with the affairs of other people 
6454_107462_000005_000003	train-clean-100	At first when Deasey retired from the police force with a pension and an heiress with three hundred pounds and time hung heavy on his hands he would try to satisfy this craving through the medium of a host of small flirtations with everybody s maid 
6454_107462_000005_000004	train-clean-100	In this way he could inform himself exactly how many loaves were taken by the Sweeneys for a week s consumption as compared with those which were devoured by all the Cassidys for whom the bottles at the Presbytery went in by the back door and what was the real cause of the quarrel between the twin Miss McInerneys 
6454_107462_000006_000000	train-clean-100	But these were but blackbird scratchings as it were upon the deep soil of the human heart 
6454_107462_000006_000001	train-clean-100	What Deasey cared about was what he called the secrets of the soul 
6454_107462_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Never met a man he was wont to say with no backstairs to his mind And the quieter decenter respectabler innocenter a man looked like enough the darker those backstairs 
6454_107462_000008_000000	train-clean-100	It was up these stairs he craved to go 
6454_107462_000008_000001	train-clean-100	To ring at the front door of ordinary intercourse was not enough for him 
none	none	When Deasey invested his wife s money in a public house he developed a better plan 
6454_107462_000008_000003	train-clean-100	It was the plan which made him ultimately describe himself as a humorist 
6454_107462_000008_000004	train-clean-100	He would wait until the bar was deserted by all but the one lingering victim whom his trained eye had picked out 
none	none	Then rolling that same eye about him as though to make quite sure no other living creature was in sight he would gently close the door of the bar parlour pick up a tumbler breathe on it polish the breath lean one elbow on the bar look round him once again and setting the whisky bottle betwixt his customer and himself with a nod which said Help yourself he would lean forward with the soft indulgent grin of the human man of the world and begin Now don t distress yourself me dear man but as between frien s certain delicate little facts in your past life have come inadvertently to me hearing 
6454_107462_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Sometimes he would allude to a certain document or incriminating facts or certain letters he would ring the changes on these three according to the sex and temperament with which he had to deal 
6454_107462_000010_000001	train-clean-100	But always whatever the words whatever the nature or sex the shot would tell 
6454_107462_000010_000002	train-clean-100	First came the little start the straightened figure the pallor or flush the shamed and suddenly lit eyes and then 
6454_107462_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Who told you mister Deasey sir Or Where did you get the letter 
6454_107462_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah now that would be telling Deasey would make reply 
none	none	But twas from a certain person whom perhaps we need not name Then the whiskey bottle would move forward like a pawn in chess and the next soothing words would be Help yourself now don t be shy me dear man And your secret is safe with me Forthwith the little skeleton in that man s cupboard would lean forward and press upon the door until at last the door flew open and a bone or two and sometimes the whole skeleton would rattle out upon the floor He had played this game so often that almost at first sight he could classify his dupes under the three heads into which he had divided them Those who demanded with violent threats which melted like snow before the sunshine of John Jamieson the letter or the name of the informant those who asked after a gentle sip or two how the letter had come into his hands and those who asked immediately if the letter hadn t been destroyed 
6454_107462_000014_000001	train-clean-100	As a rule from the type that demanded the letter back he only caught sight of the tip of the secret s ears 
6454_107462_000014_000002	train-clean-100	From those they were nearly always the women who swiftly asked if he hadn t destroyed the letters he caught shame faced gleams of the truth 
none	none	But those who asked between pensive sips how the facts or the letter had come his way these were the ones who yielded Deasey the richest harvest of rattling skeleton bones 
6454_107462_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Indeed it was curiously instructive how John Jamieson laid down a causeway of gleaming stepping stones so that Deasey might cross lightly over the turgid waters of his victims souls 
6454_107462_000016_000001	train-clean-100	At the words accompanied by John Jamieson A certain dark page of your past history help yourself me boy has been inadvertently revealed to me but is for ever sacred in me breast it was strange to see how from the underworld of the man s mind there would trip out the company of misshapen hobgoblins and gnomes which had been locked away in darkness maybe this many a year 
6454_107462_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Well how would I get the time to clane the childer and to wash their heads and I working all the day at curing stinkin hides 
6454_107462_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 Twas Herself should have got it and Herself alone 
none	none	Or No I never done it for all me own mother sworn I did 
6454_107462_000019_000001	train-clean-100	I only give the man a little push that way and he fell over on the side and busted all his veins 
none	none	Or Well an wouldn t you draw two pinsions yourself mister Deasey if you d a wife with two han s like a sieve for yellow gold 
6454_107462_000022_000000	train-clean-100	But there were some confessions haltingly patchy and inadequate but hauntingly suggestive which Deasey could neither piece out on the spot nor yet unravel in the small hours of the night 
none	none	There was one of this nature which troubled his rest long
6454_107462_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Well the way of it was you see he put it up the chimbley but when the chimbley sweepers come he transferred it in his weskit to my place and I dropped it down the well 
6454_107462_000023_000001	train-clean-100	They found it when they let the bucket down but I wasn t his accomplice at all twas only connivance with me 
6454_107462_000024_000000	train-clean-100	When he had spoken of the chimney and the well Deasey concluded at once it was a foully murdered corpse 
6454_107462_000024_000001	train-clean-100	But then again you could not well conceal a corpse in someone s waistcoat and gold coins would melt or be mislaid amongst the loose bricks of a sooty chimney 
6454_107462_000024_000002	train-clean-100	Deasey had craved for corpses but nothing so grim as that had risen to his whisky bait until he tried the same old game on missus Geraghty 
6454_107462_000024_000003	train-clean-100	What subtle instinct was it that had prompted him to add to the first unvarying words But all that is now past and over and safe beneath the mouldering clay 
none	none	At these last words the Widow Geraghty knew well the barrier was down that fences off one human soul from another all the same she shook her trembling head when Deasey drew the cork 
6454_107462_000025_000001	train-clean-100	At her refusal Deasey was struck with the most respectful compassion until that hour he had never known one single lacerated soul decline this consolation 
none	none	And to look at me she wept forthwith would you think I could shed a drop of ruddy gore No ma am returned Deasey
6454_107462_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 To look at you ye d think ma am ye could never kill a fly 
6454_107462_000028_000000	train-clean-100	And respectfully he passed the peppermints 
none	none	Sometimes the widow muttered I hears it and it bawling in me dreams o night And the two bright eyes of it and the little clay cold feet Deasey knew what was coming now and he twitched in every vein And she so white haired and so regular at church and the black bonnet on the head of her an all It was the only little one she had went on the widow bowed almost to the bar by shame and it always perched up on her knee and taking food from her mouth and she nursing it agin her face But I had bad teeth in me head and I couldn t get my rest with the jaws aching and all the whiles it screeching with the croup
6454_107462_000029_000005	train-clean-100	 Twould madden you 
none	none	All the same Deasey whispered maybe it wasn t your fault twas maybe your man egged you on to do the shameful deed
6454_107462_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 It was so said the widow 
none	none	Let you get up and cut its throat says he and then we will be shut of the domned screechin thing Then you got the knife ma am prompted Deasey It was the bread knife she answered with the ugly notches in the blade and I stole in the back way to her place in the dead hours of the night and I had me apron handy for to quench the cries and when I c ot it be the throat didn t it look up at me with the two bright innocent eyes And what d you do with the body he asked I dug a grave in the shine of the moon she answered And I put it in by the two little cold grey feet 
6454_107462_000034_000000	train-clean-100	This touch of the grey feet laid a spell on Deasey s hankering morbidity 
none	none	What turned the feet grey he whispered
6454_107462_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Nature I s pose replied the white haired widow 
none	none	She drew her shawl about her shrinking form before she turned away
6454_107462_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Twas never found out from that hour to this who done it muttered the Widow Geraghty but may the Divvle skelp me if I touch one drop of chucken tea again 
none	none	THE BIRTH OF A MASTERPIECE By LUCAS MALET From The Story Teller nineteen twenty two Looking back on it from this distance of time it began in the early and ended in the middle eighties I see the charm of ingenuous youth stamped on the episode the touching glamour of limitless faith and expectation We were the whole little band of us so deliciously self sufficient so magnificently critical of established reputations in contemporary letters and art We sniffed and snorted noses in air at popular idols while ourselves weighted down with a cargo of guileless enthusiasm only asking opportunity to dump itself at an idol s feet We ached to burn incense before the altar of some divinity but it must be a divinity of our own discovering our own choosing We scorned to acclaim ready made second hand goods Then we encountered Pogson Heber Pogson Our fate and even more perhaps his fate was henceforth sealed He was a large sleek pink creature slow and rare of movement from much sitting bulky not to say squashy in figure mild eyed slyly jovial and for no other word to my mind so closely fits his attitude resigned A positive glutton of books he read as instinctively almost as unconsciously as other men breathe But he not only absorbed He gave forth and that copiously with taste with discrimination now and again with startlingly eloquent flights and witty sallies His memory was prodigious The variety and vivacity of his conversation the immense range of subjects he brilliantly laboured when in the vein remain with me as simply marvellous With us he mostly was in the vein And vanity apart we must have composed a delightful audience generously censer swinging No man of even average feeling but would be moved by such fresh such spontaneous admiration Thus if our divinity melodiously piped we did very radiantly dance to his piping Oh Heber Pogson enjoyed it Never tell me he didn t revel in those highly articulate evenings of monologue gasconade heated yet brotherly argument lasting on to midnight and after every bit as much as we did Anyhow at first Later he may have had twinges been sensible of strain though never I still believe a very severe one In any case Nature showed herself his friend his saviour if also in some sort his executioner When the strain tended to become distressing for him personally very simply and cleverly she found a way out A background of dark legend only brought the steady glow of his and our present felicity into richer relief We gathered hints of caught in passing smiling allusion to straitened and impecunious early years He had endured a harsh enough apprenticeship to the profession of letters in its least satisfactory because most ephemeral form namely journalism and provincial journalism at that This must have painfully cribbed and confined his free ranging spirit We were filled by reverent sympathy for the trials and deprivations of his past But at the period when the members numbering a dozen more or less of our devoted band trooped up from Chelsea and down from the Hampstead heights to worship in the studio library of the Church Street Kensington house Pogson was lapped in a material well being altogether sufficient He treated us his youthful friends and disciples to very excellent food and drink partaking of these himself moreover with evident readiness and relish Those little help yourselves stand up suppers in the big quiet comfortably warmed and shaded room revealed in him no ascetic tendency though I hasten to add no tendency to unbecoming excess Such hospitality testified to the soundness of Pogson s existing financial position as did his repeated assertions that now at last praise heaven he had leisure to do worthy and abiding work work through which he could freely express his personality express in terms of art his judgments upon and appreciations of the human scene We listened breathless nodding exuberant approval For weren t we ourselves each and all of us mightily in love with art and with the human scene And hadn t we listening thus breathlessly to our amazing master the enchanting assurance that we were on the track of a masterpiece Not impossibly a whole gallery of masterpieces since Heber Pogson had barely touched middle age as yet For him there still was time Fiction we gathered to be the selected medium He not only meant to write but was actually now engaged in writing a novel during those withdrawn and sacred morning hours when we were denied admittance to his presence We previsaged something tremendous poetic yet fearlessly modern fixed on the bedrock of realism a drama and a vision wide high deep spectacular yet subtle as life itself Let his confreres French and Russian not to mention those merely British born look to their laurels when Heber Pogson blossomed into print And preciously inspiring thought he was our Pogson He inalienably belonged to us since hadn t we detected the quality of his genius when the veil was still upon its face Oh we knew bless you we knew We d the right to sniff and snort noses in air at contemporary reputations because we were snugly awaiting the disclosure of a talent which would prick them into nothingness like so many bubbles pop them like so many inflated paper bags knock them one and all into the proverbial cocked hat Unfortunately youth with a fine illogic though having all the time there is before it easily waxes impatient In our eagerness for his public recognition his apotheosis we did I am afraid hustle our great man a little Instead of being satisfied with his nocturnal coruscations they brilliant as ever let it be noted we just a fraction resented the slowness of his progress began ever so gently to shove that honoured bulky form behind and pull at it in front We wanted the tangible result of those many sacred and secret morning hours during which his novel was in process of being formed and fashioned gloriously built up Wouldn t he tell us the title enlighten us as to the theme the scheme thus allaying the hunger pangs of our pious curiosity by crumbs ever so small and few dropped from his richly furnished table With exquisite good humour he fenced and feinted Almost roguishly he would laugh us off and launch the conversation into other channels holding us after the first few vexatiously outwitted seconds at once enthralled and delicately rebuked But at last in the late spring as far as I remember of the second year of our devotion there came a meeting at which things got pressed somehow to a head Contrary to custom feminine influence made itself felt And here I pause and blush For it strikes me as so intimately characteristic of our whole relation in that earlier stage at least that I should have written all this on the subject of Heber Pogson without making one solitary mention of his wife She existed Was permanently in evidences or wasn t it rather in eclipse as a shadowy parasitic entity perambulating the hinterland of his domestic life She must have been by some years his junior a tall thin flat chested woman having heavy yellowish brown hair a complexion to match and pale nervous eyes Her clothes hung on her as on a clothes peg She affected vivid greens as was the mistaken habit of Victorian ladies possessing the colouring falsely called auburn but clouded their excessive verdure to neutrality by semi transparent over draperies of black Harry Lessingham in a crudely unchivalrous mood once described her as without form and void adding that she had a mouth like a fish These statements I considered unduly harsh yet admitted her almost miraculously negative She mattered less when one was in the room with her than anything human and feminine which I so far had ever run across And I was at least normally susceptible I m very sure of that As a matter of course on our arrival at the blest house in Church Street we one and all respectfully greeted her passed to put it vulgarly the time of day with her But there intercourse ceased At some subsequent instant she faded out whether into space or into some adjacent connubial chamber I had no notion I only realized when the act was accomplished that we now were without her that she had vanished leaving behind her no faintest moral or emotional trace But on the occasion in question she did not vanish We fed her at supper And still she remained in the interests of social propriety as we imagined since for once the Pogson symposium included a stranger an eminently attractive lady guest Harry Lessingham had begged to bring his sister with him He told me of this beforehand and I rejoiced Lessingham had long been dear to me as a brother while that Arabella should only be dear to me as a sister was just then I own among the things I wished least I craved therefore to have her share our happy worship She had a pretty turn for literature herself I coveted to see her dazzled exalted impressed it would be a fascinating spectacle Before I slept that night or rather next morning I recognized her coming as a disastrous mistake For she had received insufficient instruction in ritual in the suitable forms of approach to so august a presence as that of our host She played round him flickering darting like lightning round a cathedral tower metal tipped Where we in our young male modesty had but gently drawn or furtively shoved she tickled the soft sedentary creature s ribs as with a rapier point And to us agitated watchers the amazing thing was that Pogson didn t seem to mind He neither rebuked her nor laughed her off but purred veritably purred under her alternate teasing and petting like some big sleek cat At last with a cajoling but really alarming audacity she went for him straight Of course dear mister Pogson Harry has told me all about your wonderful novel she said I am so interested so thrilled and so grateful to you for letting me join your audience to night But I want quite frightfully to know more Speaking not only for myself but for all who are present may I implore a further revelation Pray don t send us empty away in respect of the wonderful book It would be so lovely while we sit here at your feet She in fact sat by his side her chair placed decidedly close to his If you would read us a chapter A chapter is impossible Her charming pliant mouth her charming dancing eyes her caressing voice I won t swear even her caressing hands didn t for a brief space take part all wooed him to surrender Well a page then a paragraph Ah don t be obdurate The merest sentence Surely we may claim as much as that Picture our pride our happiness She enclosed us all in a circular and sympathetic glance which ended as it had started by meeting his mild eyes lingering appealingly upon his large pink countenance Pogson succumbed No he wouldn t read but since she so amiably desired it More than anything in all my life with the most convincing and virginal sincerity He thought he might rehearse a passage which wasn t as he gladly believed altogether devoid of merit He did rehearse it And we broke into applause the more tempestuous because suspicion of a chill queerly lay upon us A chill insidious as it was vague disturbing as it was wasn t it we silently quite violently hoped so ridiculously uncalled for After all that passage is thundering good you know Harry Lessingham announced as though arguing with himself arguing himself out of that same invidious chill an hour later Arabella had refused a hansom declaring herself excited still under the spell and so wanting to walk Leaving the Church Street house the three of us crossed into Campden Grove with a view to turning down Campden House Road thus reaching Kensington High Street It was out of sight of the average packed with epigram worthy of all we ve ever believed or asked of him It takes a master of technique of style to write like that Beloved brother which of us ever said it didn t Arabella took him up sweetly Slender light footed the train of her evening gown switched over her arm beneath her flowing orange and white flowered satin cloak she walked between us Why it was good to the point of being inevitable One seemed I certainly did to know every phrase every word which was coming None could have been other or been placed otherwise than it was and that s the highest praise one can give to anybody s prose isn t it One jumped to the perfect rightness of the whole a rightness so perfect as to make the sentences sound quite extraordinarily familiar This last assertion dropped as a bomb between Lessingham and myself By the way the girl presently said as our awkward silence continued has either of you happened to read or re read Meredith s Egoist just lately Lessingham stopped short and in the light of a neighbouring gas lamp I saw his handsome boyish face look troubled to the point of physical pain What on earth are you driving at What do you mean Arabella that Pogson is a plagiarist Don t eat me Harry dearest if I incline to use a shorter commoner expression A thief An unconscious one no doubt she threw off quickly fearful of explosions possibly in her turn He may have been betrayed by his own extraordinary memory But this is horrible horrible Lessingham cried All the names though were different Arabella appeared to have overcome her fear of explosions Her charming eyes again danced Exactly she said That was the peculiar part of it the thing which riveted my attention He had I mean the names of the characters and places were different were altered changed Lessingham stood bare headed in the light of a gas lamp He ran the fingers of his left hand through his crisp fair hair rumpling it up into a distracted crest I could see could almost hear the travail of his honest soul Loyalty faith and honour worked at high pressure to hit on a satisfactory explanation Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed Why of course he cried it s as clear as mud Pogson wasn t betrayed by anything He did it on purpose Don t you understand you dear goose you very much too clever by half dear goose It was simply his kindly joke his good natured little game And we like the pack of idiots which compared with him we are never scented it You pestered yes Arabella most unconscionably pestered him to read an excerpt from his novel and to pacify you he quoted a page from Meredith instead Harry Lessingham tucked his hand under the folds of the orange and white flowered cloak and taking the girl affectionately by the elbow trotted her down the sloping pavement towards Kensington High Street All the honours of war rest with Pogson he joyfully assured her You made an importunate impertinent demand for bread He didn t mean to be drawn but was too civil too tender hearted to put you off with a stone so slyly cut you a slice from another man s loaf Does it occur to you my sweet sister you ve been had very neatly had If it comes to that Miss Lessingham by no means stands alone I interrupted We ve all been had as you so gracefully put it very neatly and very extensively had For though I trusted Lessingham s view was the correct one trusted so most devoutly I could not but regret the discomfiture of Arabella Her approach to our chosen idol may have slightly lacked in reverence she may indeed in plain English have cheeked him But she had done so in the prettiest airiest manner Pogson s punishment of her indiscretion if highly ingenious still struck me as not in the best taste For was it not at once rather mean and rather cheap to make so charming a person the subject and that before witnesses of a practical joke If after all it really was a joke That insidious odious chill which earlier prompted my tempestuous applause as I woefully registered hung about me yet Unquestionably Arabella Lessingham s visit to Church Street showed more and more when I considered it as a radical mistake From it I date the waning of the moon of my delight in respect of both Pogson and herself I had bowed in worship equally sincere though diverse in sentiment before each and to each had pledged my allegiance To have them thus discredit one another represented the most trying turn of events For a full month I cold shouldered the band abjured the shrine and avoided the lady Then while still morose and brooding my trouble at its height a cousin in the third degree rich middle aged and conveniently restless invited me to be his travelling companion We had taken trips together before This one promised fields of wider adventure nothing less than the quartering of southern Europe along with nibblings at African and Asiatic Mediterranean coasts It was the chance of a life time I embraced it I also called at the house in Church Street to make my farewells I could do no less I have used the word resigned in describing Pogson To day that word notably covered him Our friend appeared depressed yet bland in his depression anxious to mollify and placate rather than reproach His attitude touched me I hardly deserved it after my neglect to which by the way he made no smallest reference But as I unfolded my plans he increasingly threw off his depression and generously entered into them Would have me fetch an atlas and trace out my proposed itinerary upon the map It included names to conjure with These set wide the flood gates of his speech He at once enchanted and confounded me by his knowledge of the literature art history of Syria Egypt Italy Greece and the Levant For the next three quarters of an hour I had Pogson at his best And oh how vastly good that same best was Under the flashing multi coloured light of it he routed my suspicions put my annoyance and distrust to flight As he leaned back in the roomy library chair filled to veritable overflowing by his big squashy brown velvet jacketted person Pogson had put on flesh of late put it on sensibly as I remarked even during the few weeks of my absence he reconquered all my admiration and belief As I rose to depart Ah you fortunate youth he thus genially addressed me thrice fortunate youth in your freedom your enterprise your happy elasticity of flesh and spirit What won t you have to tell me of things actually seen of lands cities civilizations past and present and the storied wonder of them when you come back And what won t you have to read to me in return dear Master I echoed eager to testify to my recovered faith By then the book will be finished on which all our hopes and affections are set Ten times more precious more illuminating than anything I have seen will be what I hear from you when I come back But as I spoke surely I wasn t mistaken in thinking that for an agitating minute the pinkness of Pogson s large countenance sickly ebbed and blanched And while my attention was still engaged by this disquieting phenomenon I became aware that missus Pogson had joined us Silently mysteriously she faded the term holds good into evidence as on so many former occasions she had silently mysteriously faded out Dressed in one of those verdant gowns so dolorously veiled in semi transparent black she stood behind her husband s chair Her eyes met mine They were no longer nervous or in expression vague but oddly aggressive challenging defiantly alight Oh yes she declared by then Heber will have completed his great novel without doubt When uttering his name she laid a thin long fingered hand upon his rounded shoulder and to my little short of stupefaction I saw Pogson s fat pink hand move up to seek and clasp it On me this action hers soothing protective his appealing welcoming produced the most bewildering effect I felt embarrassed and abashed an indecently impertinent intruder upon the secret places of two human hearts That any such intimate and tender correspondence existed between this so strangely ill assorted couple I never dreamed I uttered what must have sounded wildly incoherent farewells and fled Of the ensuing eighteen months of foreign travel it is irrelevant here to speak Suffice it that on my return to England and to Chelsea the earliest news which greeted me was that Arabella Lessingham had been now five weeks married and Heber Pogson a fortnight dead Lessingham dear good fellow was my informant and minded acquainting me so I fancied only a degree less with the first item than with the second For some considerable time he told me Pogson had been ailing He grew inordinately stout unwieldy to the extent of all exertion all movement causing him distress Suffocation threatened if he attempted to lie down so that latterly he spent not only all day but all night sitting in the big library chair we knew so well If not actually in pain he must still have suffered intolerable discomfort But he never complained and to the last his passion for books never failed We took him any new ones we happened to run across as you d take a sick woman flowers To the end he read And wrote I asked That I can t say Lessingham replied There were things I could not make out And I couldn t question him It didn t seem to be my place though I had an idea he d something on his mind to speak of which would be a relief It worried me badly I felt sure he wanted to tell us but couldn t bring himself to the point He talked of you He cared for you more than for any of us yet I may be all wrong it seemed to me he was glad you weren t here Once or twice I thought he felt almost afraid you might come back before before it was all over you know It sounds rather horrible but I had a feeling he longed to slink off quietly out of sight for he did not dread death I m certain of that What he dreaded was that life had some trick up her sleeve which if he delayed too long might give him away put him to shame somehow at the last And missus Pogson Lessingham looked at me absently Oh missus Pogson She s never interested me She s too invertebrate but I believe she took care of Pogson all right Next day I called at the house in Church Street After some parley I was admitted into the studio library Neither in missus Pogson nor in the familiar room did I find any alteration save that the green had disappeared from her dress She wore hanging trailing unrelieved black And that a piece of red woollen cord was tied across from arm to arm of Pogson s large library chair forbidding occupation of it This pleased me It struck the positive the in a way aggressive note which missus Pogson had once before so strangely unexpectedly sounded in my presence I said the things common to such occasions as that of our present meeting said them with more than merely conventional feeling and emphasis I praised her husband s great gifts his amazing learning his eloquence the magnetic charm by which he captivated and held us Finally I dared the question I had come here to ask which had burned upon my tongue indeed from the moment I heard of Pogson s death What about the novel Might we hope for speedy though posthumous publication We were greedy the world should know how great a literary genius it had lost Was it ready for press as did she remember she d assured me it would certainly be by the time I came back missus Pogson did not betray any sign of emotion Her thin hands remained perfectly still in her crape covered lap There is no novel she calmly told me There never has been any novel Heber did not finish it because he never began it He did not possess the creative faculty You were not content with what he gave You asked of him that which he could not give At first he played with you it amused him You were so gullible so absurdly ignorant Then he hesitated to undeceive you in that I admit he was weak But he suffered for his weakness It made him unhappy Oh I how I have hated how I still hate you for I saved him from poverty from hard work I secured him a peaceful beautiful life till you came and spoilt it All the money was mine she said GENIUS By ELINOR MORDAUNT From Hutchinson s Magazine and The Century Magazine nineteen twenty one nineteen twenty two I have written before of Ben Cohen with his eternal poring and humming over the scores of great masters of the timber yard at Canning Town for ever changing and for ever the same devouring forests with the eternal wind like rush of saws slide of gigantic planes practical and chill wrapped in river fogs and yet exotic with the dust of cedar camphor paregoric In those days Ben Cohen was wont to read music as other boys read their penny dreadfuls avidly with the imagined sounds like great waves for ever a rush through his soul In the very beginning it was any music just music Then for a while Wagner held him Any Wagnerian concert any mixed entertainment which included Wagner it seemed as though he sniffed them upon the breeze and he would tramp for miles wait for hours biting cold sleet snow mud rain all alike disregarded by that persistence which the very poor must bring to the pursuit of pleasure the capture of cheap seats Once ensconced regardless of hard narrow seats heights crowds his passion of adoration and excitement took him shook him tore him so that it was wonder his frail body did not split in two render up the soul coming forth as Lazarus from the sepulchre It was indeed if you knew little Ben Cohen him himself difficult to realise that his body had anything more to do with him than the yellow drab water proof which is a sort of uniform a species of charity covering a multitude of sins of poverty shabbiness thread bareness had to do with the real Jenny Bligh And yet Ben Cohen s body was more completely his than one might have imagined Jenny could and indeed did slough off her disguise on Sundays or rare summer days but Ben and that self which was apart from music that wildly beating heart pulsing blood flooding warmth grateful as the watchman s fire in the fog sodden yard that little fire over which he used to hang warming his stiffened hands were after all amazingly one The thing surprised him even more than it surprised any one else above all when it refused to be separated from his holy of holies crept danced smiled its way through the most portentous scores a thrilling sense of Jenny Bligh all crotchets and quavers smiles and thrills quaint homeliness sudden dignity By the time he first met Jenny he was clear of Wagner had glanced a little patronisingly at Beethoven turned aside and enwrapped himself in the sombre splendour of Bach right away from the world then harking back with a fresh vision a sudden sense of the inevitable had anchored himself in the solemn wide stretching harbourage of Beethoven It was like a return from a long voyage tearing round a world full of beauty and interest and yet at the same time full of pettiness fuss annoyance a home coming beyond words There was a sense of eternity a harmony which drew everything to itself smoothing out the pattern of life the present life and the life to come so crumpled that up to this time he had had no real idea of the meaning of it All at once everything was immensely right with Jenny as an essential and inevitable part of the rightness He felt this so strongly that he never stopped to wonder if other people felt it as plainly as he did Apart from all this he was bound by the inarticulateness of his class His Jewish blood lent him a wider and more picturesque vocabulary than most and yet it stopped at any discussion of his feelings We have an idea that what we call the common people are more communicative on such subjects than we are but this is not so They talk of their physical ailments and sensations but they are deeply shy upon the subject of their feelings Ben s mother would discuss the state of her inside the deaths of her relations and friends his own birth down to the smallest detail But she would never have dreamt of telling her son that she loved him desired his love hungered for his coming grieved at his going Ben himself put none of his feeling for Beethoven into words above all to his mother she would not have understood him if he had He said nothing of Jenny either save as a girl he d met a girl he was going to bring home to tea but she understood that without any words that was courting part of the business of human nature much like the preparation of meals It was odd coming to think of it might have been ridiculous save that ridicule was the sort of thing which could find no possible lodgment with Ben that his determination to devote his whole musical life to Beethoven to interpret him as no Englishman had ever done before should have been synonymous with his sacred heady and yet absolute determination to marry Jenny Bligh Jenny worked in the jam factory and there was something of the aroma of ripe fruit about her ripe strawberries raspberries plums damsons She was plumpish and fresh very red lips and very bright eyes reddish brown the colour of blackberry leaves in autumn with hair to match Her little figure was neat her small hands with their square tipped fingers deft and quick in their movements there was something at once rounded and clear cut about everything she did A sea faring admirer used to say that she was a bit short in the beam but a daisy fur carryin sail and that was the idea she gave so well balanced so trim going off to work in her wide white apron on those rare mornings when she shook off the yellow mackintosh Ben saw her like that for the first time crossing the Lee just below the timber yard with its cranes like black notes zigzagging out over the river which had for once discarded its fog It was a day of bright blue sky immense rounded silvery clouds fresh and clean with a wind which caught up the white apron and billowed it out for the sheer fun of the thing showing trim ankles the turn of a plump calf such as Ben Cohen had never even thought of before the realisation of which was like wine freshly tasted red fruity running through his veins mounting to his head He had known that women had legs his mother the laundress suffered from hers complainingly devoted woman as she was swollen with much standing and them there dratted veins stocky legs with loose folds of stocking As to thinking any more of a woman s legs than of the legs of a table the idea had never even occurred to him But there you are It is the unexpected that happens the sort of thing which we could never have imagined ourselves as doing thinking feeling The temptations we have recognised struggled against are nothing but there comes a sort of wild whistling wind from nowhere much the same as that wind about jenny s skirts white apron and our life is like a kaleidoscope suddenly shaken up and showing a completely fresh pattern Who could have thought it who that Ben Cohen dreamer idealist passionate pure the devotee of art would have fallen in love with Jenny Bligh s legs or rather a pair of ankles and a little more at that side where the wind caught her skirt before he had so much as a glimpse of her face Just over the bridge she stopped to speak with another girl who worked in his own counting house As Ben hurried up to pass them before they separated really see her this other girl recognised him flung him a friendly Hullo and was answered in the same fashion As he moved on he heard her was meant to hear knew that he was meant to hear from the pitch of the voice Clever ain t no word fur it There ain t no tune as The end of the sentence was lost but he knew the sort of thing knew it by heart had spent his time running away from it Now however he was grateful more grateful still when he met Miss Ankles again and she herself regarding Florry Hines eulogy as a sort of introduction smiled moved on a step and herself tossed a Hullo over one shoulder Ben s thin olive tinted face was flushed as he drew forward to her side with his odd stoop his way of ducking his head and raising his eyes dark and glowing He took jenny s dinner basket and she noticed his hands large and well shaped with long fingers widened at the tips Florry had said that he was a Sheeny but there was nothing of the Jew about him apart from his colouring his brilliant dark eyes unless it were a sort of inner glow an ardour curbed by his almost childlike shyness lack of self confidence in everything apart from his music that something at once finer and more cruelly persistent vital than is to be found in the purely Anglo Saxon race Though Jenny liked what she called a pretty tune she knew nothing whatever of music understood less And yet almost from that first moment she understood Ben Cohen realising him as lover and child understood him better maybe then than she did later on losing her sureness for a while shaken and bewildered everything blurred by her own immensity of love longing of fearing that she did not understand feeling out of it But that was not for sometime to come in the meanwhile she was like a dear little bantam hen with one chick while Ben himself was content to shelter under her wing until it grew upon him that loving her as he did loving his mother realising what it meant to be a mother in thinking of jenny herself with a child his child in her arms it was up to him to prove himself for their sakes to make them proud of him and his music without the faintest idea of how proud they were already lift the whole weight of care from their shoulders The worst of it was he told them nothing whatever about it The better sort of men are given to these crablike ways of appearing to move away from what they intend to move towards It simply seemed as though he were forgetting them a little then more and more elbowing them aside to clear the way for his beloved music He was no longer deprecating appealing leaning upon them each woman thought of him as her child and when his love made a man of him they realised the hurt nothing more He overdid it too as genius does overdo things was brusque entirely immersed in his great scheme Sometimes he even laughed to himself over this They don t know what I m up to he would declare to himself with a sense of triumph He had never even thought of his music in the money sense before but as his love and ambition for the two women grew upon him he was like a child with a new toy He would not only make a great name he would make an immense fortune his mind blinked dazzled at the very thought He moved with a new pride and also alas a new remoteness His health had broken when he was about seventeen his bent shoulders still showed that old drag upon the chest and he was away in a sanatorium for a year When he came back he was cured It was young Saere the junior partner in the timber business who had sent him away and it was he who when Ben returned paid for lessons for him so that he learnt to play as well as read music From that time onward he had always stuck to the firm working in the tally sheds paid out of his earnings for the use of a room and a piano for practising upon so many hours each week completely happy and contented He had never even thought of leaving the business until he realised his immense love for Jenny and through her for his mother the necessity for doing something big What did sacrifice matter What did it matter being poor hungry shabby What did anything matter just for a while There was so little he wanted meals were a nuisance his eyes were so dazzled by the brilliance of the future set upon a far horizon that he forgot the path of the present still beneath his feet If his mother had not set food before him he would scarcely have thought of it But all the same he ate it and money had to be earned by some one or other His mother had never let him know the actual pinch of poverty she wore that shoe upon her own foot He had no more idea than a child of the cost of mere daily necessities and during the last few years between his work and hers they had been comfortable enough We can hang on for a bit he said when he spoke of leaving the wood yard and she answered almost with triumph that she had hung on well enough before he d earned aught but a licking At first she was proud of reshouldering the entire burden it made him more entirely hers He could not do without her even with Jenny he could not do without her But she had not been a young woman when Ben was born she was old now and tired with that sort of tiredness which accumulates heaps up and which no single night s rest can ever cure the tiredness which is ready more than ready for a narrower bed eternal sleep Hold on until after the concert Sorry fur meself if I couldn t The concert That was the goal There was a public hall at Clapton where Ben had chanced on some really good music just one night of it and quite by chance and this to his mind ennobled the Claptonites there was the place in which to start the revolutionising of the musical world Besides and here he thought himself very canny by no means a Jew for nothing there were fine old houses at Clapton and where there were such houses there must be rich people When the date was actually arranged he practised for the best part of the day While he was at home he read music he lived in a maze of music He never thought of advertising collecting his public he even avoided his old friends his patrons at the timber yard overcome by agonies of shyness at the very thought of so much as mentioning his concert Quite simply in a way he did not even attempt to explain to himself he felt that the world of London would scent it from afar off As to paid claques presentation tickets patrons advance agents all the booming and flattery the jam of the powder for an English audience he had no idea of the existence of such things Beethoven was wonderful and he had found out wonderful things about him that was enough When the Angel Gabriel blew the last trump there would be no need to invite the dead to rise Neither was there any need to invite the really elect to his concert Not to hear him Ben Cohen but to hear Beethoven as he ought to be heard that s how he felt During those weeks of preparation for the concert his mother worked desperately hard to keep their home together without his earnings while Jenny helped At first that had been enough for her too to help But later Throughout those long evenings when already tired from her work in the factory she had stood sorting sprinkling folding ironing the two women got to a state where they scarcely dared to look at each other just a passing glance a hardish stare but no looking into If he had but once said I can t bear you to work so hard for me everything would have been different the fatigue wiped out But he didn t he didn t even know they were working for him working beyond the limit of an ordinary working woman s working day hard enough in all conscience Men can t not be expected to notice things the way we do That s what they told themselves they did not say even this much to each other But far far away out of sight out of all actual knowledge was the fear which neither of them would have dared to realise a vague horror a sort of ghost He don t care he s changed And indeed this is how it appeared All through that time he wore an odd look of excitement triumph pleasure which lifted him away from himself There was a sort of lilt in his very step his eyes shone his cheeks were flushed When he cleared a pile of freshly ironed starched things from the end of a table so as to spread out a score upon it laid them on the floor where the cat padded them over with dirty feet and his mother railed at him as she still did rail on any subject apart from this of not caring he glanced up at her with bright amused eyes his finger still following the black and white tangle of notes looked at Jenny and laughed actually laughed You great oaf cried missus Cohen and could have killed him Up at four o clock next morning rewashing starching ironing she retched with sick fatigue and something more that sense of giddiness of being hit on the head which had oppressed her of late It was as though that laugh of Ben s had stuck like a bone in her chest so sharp that she could scarcely draw breath driven all the blood to her head And yet it had been full of nothing but triumph a sort of tender triumph almost childish delight He was going to do wonders wonders open a new world to them He was so dazzled by his own work dreams by all he had in store for them that he did not even see them themselves worn with toil realise the meaning of it the reason for it In any case he would have laughed because they had no idea how near it was to an end That concert It would be like nothing so much as opening a door into a new world where they need never so much as soil a finger floating around dressed in silk feeding from off the finest china sleeping upon down Man like his eyes were fixed upon the future No two women had ever been loved as they were loved All this work this washing and ironing it resembled nothing more than the opening scene in an opera a sort of prelude for the sake of contrast They would see O o oh yes they would see It was like that old childish Shut your eyes and open your mouth But they they were bound in the close meshed strait waistcoat of endless toil petty anxiety The days and hours heaped in front of them obliterated all possible view of the future In the beginning they had been as excited as he was over the thought of the concert He must wear a rosette no a flower in his button hole and white kid gloves as he moved forward upon the platform he must bow right and left and draw them off as he bowed This was Jenny s idea It was Jenny who made him practise his bows and it was Jenny who borrowed a dress suit from a waiter friend while it was his mother who got up the borrowed shirt to go with it stiff and shining who polished his best boots until they looked near as near like patent All this had been done close upon a fortnight before Jenny was a good girl but if she was not there to see to things Jenny might fail with a bubble on the shirt front No amount of meaning well was of any use in getting up a stiff shirt as it ought to be got up Better ave it all ready a case o anything happening That was what missus Cohen said to herself with a dull dread at the back of her mind a feeling as though every next day were a Friday Her face had been oddly flushed of late with a rather fixed and glassy look about the eyes Jenny thought of this on her way to the concert alone for by some ill fate his nearer vision blurred in that golden maze of the future Ben had fixed his concert for a Friday This Friday Always a bad day bad in itself bad for every one like an east wind worst of all for a laundress not so depressing as a Monday but so hurried so overcrowded with all the ironing and folding the packing of the lots all small into their separate newspaper parcels the accumulated fatigue of a whole week Some demon seemed to possess her clients that week they had come in with a collar here a shirt there an odd pillow slip tablecloth right over Thursday She was working until after twelve o clock that night so was Jenny up before dawn next morning though no one save herself knew of this Whatever they do they shan t not keep me from my Ben s concert That was what she said with a vision of motors blocking the road in front of the little hall But she had been a laundress best part of a lifetime before she discovered herself as the mother of a genius and it had bit into her bone she could not get finished and she could not leave the work undone Some one s got to earn a living that was what she said embittered by fatigue the sweat pouring down her face beaten to every sensibility apart from her swollen feet by the time that Jenny called in for her soon after six She had longed to go had never even thought of not going but by now apart from her physical pain and weariness she was alive to but one point her whole being drawn out to a sort of cone with an eye at the end of it and far far away at the back of her brain struggling with impenetrable mists but one thought if she scorched anything she would have to replace it When Jenny found that it was impossible to move her she made her own way up to Clapton alone For Ben had to be at the hall early there were certain matters to arrange and he would try over the piano Her efforts with missus Cohen had delayed her she was driven desperate by that cruel malice of inanimate things every bus and tram was against her whisking out of sight just as she wanted them or blocked by slow crawling carts and lorries There was a tight hard pain in her heart like toothache round which her whole body gathered pressing impaled upon it a sense of desperation and yet at the heart of this like a nerve the wonder if anything really mattered Ben had promised to reserve seats for his mother and herself but had he Had he Would she find the place blocked by swells with their hard stare duchesses and such like glistening in diamonds In her mind s eye she saw billows of silk slabs of black cloth and shining white shirt fronts hundreds and hundreds of them And Ben bowing bowing to them as she had taught him to do For some time past he had been so far away so detached that she was haunted by the fear that if she put out a finger to touch him it might go through him as though he were a ghost At times she had caught him held him to her in a passion of love and longing But even then with his head against her heart his lips or some pulse or nerve had moved in a wordless tune the beat of time If only he had still seemed to need her nothing nothing would have mattered But he didn t he needed no one no one He seemed so frail she had made sure that he wanted looking after but he didn t A drunkard might have fallen down in the street needed fetching supporting exhorting a bully come home with a broken head But it seemed as though Ben were in reality for all his air of appeal sufficient to himself moving like a steady light through the darkness unstirred by so much as a breath of wind Overcome by anxiety she got out of the tram too soon It had begun to rain a dull dark night and there was a blur of misty light flooding the pavement a little way ahead That must be the hall She was afraid of over shooting the mark Those trams had such a way of getting going just as one wanted to be out of them But the light was nothing more than a cinema and she she had a good quarter of a mile to walk in the wet The cruel wet just like it to be wet on this night of all nights Even her optimism was gone She kept on thinking of missus Cohen her flushed face and oddly glazed eyes the queer stiff way in which she moved held her head For once she was angry with Ben Im and his crowds Im an is fine lydies Im an is motor cars After all she did overshoot her mark on inquiry for the hall she was told that she had passed it and was obliged to retrace her steps No wonder she had passed it with all she had expected at the back of her mind The strip of pavement outside was dark with not so much as a single taxi in sight the door half shut the dreary vestibule badly lighted empty smelling of damp The sodden looking sketch of a man in the pay box seemed half asleep stretched yawned when she spoke pushing a strip of pink paper towards her as she gave her name For two He poked out a long neck and peered round the edge of the box like a tortoise from its shell The other lydy wasn t not able ter come ter night answered Jenny with dignity and the beast grinned displaying a wreckage of broken teeth Ain t not what you might call a crowd anyway he remarked She could have killed him for that She realised the white face of a clock but she would not look at it She was early that was it Look how she had hurried No wonder that she was early And great ladies were always late she had learnt that from the Daily Mail stories Two an two make four them too late an me too early she said to herself with a gallant effort after her own brisk way of taking things a surer tap of heels on the stone floor as she turned towards a swing door to her left pushed it open and was hit in the face by what seemed like a thick black curtain A dim white gloved hand was thrust through it and took her ticket Mind you don t fall no good wasting the lights until they come if ever they does come exhorted and explained a voice out of the darkness for after all it was not a curtain but just darkness At first Jenny could see nothing Then little by little it seemed as though different objects crept forward one by one like wild animals from their lair Those white patches the hands of two white gloved men holding sheaves of programmes she realised one between her own fingers whispering together There was the platform the great piano sprawling over it and in front of this rows and rows and rows and rows upon rows of empty seats She looked behind her they had argued long over the question of places for herself and his mother The very best that s what Ben had said but they fought against this fought and conquered for the best seats meant money What s a seat more or less I d like to know Money all money Old missus Cohen had been firm upon this point Still there were a great many seats yet further back and all empty a little raised seeming to push themselves forward with the staring vacuity of an idiot more seats overhead in a curving balcony rising above each other as though proud of their emptiness It would have been impossible to believe that mere vacant places could wear so sinister as well as foolish an aspect An idiot but a cruel idiot too the whole thing one cruel idiot of the sort that likes to pull legs from flies There was a clock there also For a long while Jenny would not allow herself to look at it But something drew her until it became an unbearable effort to keep her eyes away from it to look anywhere else and at last she turned her head stared sharply defiantly as though daring it It was five and twenty minutes to nine Five and twenty minutes to nine and the concert was to have begun at eight Five and twenty minutes to nine and there was no one there no one whatever The clock hands dragged themselves on for another five minutes then one of the men disappeared behind the scene came back speaking excitedly gesticulating with white hands We re to turn on the light E swears as e won t give it up e s goin ter play Goin ter play Well I ll be blowed Goin ter play An with nothing ere but That Jenny saw how he jerked his head in her direction So she was That she Jenny Bligh and so far gone that she did not even care As the lights went up the hall seemed to swim in a sort of mist the terra cotta walls the heavy curtains at either side of the platform those awful empty seats Jenny spread her skirt wide catching at the chair to either side of her stretching out her arms along the backs of them She had a wild feeling as though it were up to her to spread herself sufficiently to cover them all She half rose Perhaps she could hide more of that emptiness if she moved nearer to the front that was her thought But no she mustn t do that this was the place Ben had chosen for her she must stay where she was He might look there miss her and imagine that there was nobody nobody at all that even she had failed him If only she could spread herself spread herself indefinitely multiply herself anything anything to cover those beastly chairs sticking out there grinning shaming her man Then she had a sudden idea of running into the street entreating the people to come in was upon her feet for the second time when Ben walked on to the platform For once he was not ducking or moving sideways he came straight forward bowed to the front of him right and left drew off his gloves and bowed again Mingling with her agony of pity a thrill ran through Jenny Bligh at this He remembered her teaching he was hers hers hers after all hers more than ever hers The borrowed coat far too big for him rose in a sort of hood at the back of his neck as he bowed something happened to the centre stud of his shirt and it disappeared into an aperture shaped like a dark gourd in the whiteness But for all that Jenny felt herself overawed by his dignity as any one would have been there was something in the man so much greater than his clothes greater than his conscious half childish self Jenny s hands were raised to clap but they dropped into her lap lay there as with a face set like marble Ben turned and seated himself at the piano There was a moment s pause while he stared straight in front of him such a pause that a feeling of goose flesh ran down the back of her arms then he began to play Jenny had not even glanced at her programme she would have understood nothing of it if she had but it gave the Sonata Op III as the opening piece Ben however took no notice of this but for some reason he could not have explained flung himself straight way into the third item the tremendous Hammerclavier The sounds flooded the hall swept through it as if it were not there obliterating time and space It was as though the Heavenly Host had descended upon the earth sweet wonderful and yet terrible with a sweep of pinions deep drawn breath Tubal Cain and his kind deified and yet human in their immense masculinity and strength Jenny Bligh was neither imaginative nor susceptible to sound but it drew her out of herself It was like bathing in a sea whose waves overpower one so that try as one may to cling to the earth it slips off from beneath one s feet shamed beaten She had a feeling that if it did not stop soon she would die and would yet die when it did stop Her heart beat thickly and heavily her eyes were dim she was bewildered lost and yet exhilarated It was worse than an air raid she thought more exciting more wonderful The end left her almost as much exhausted as Ben himself The sweat was running down his face as he got up from his seat came forward to the front of the platform and bowed right and left Jenny had not clapped she would as soon have thought of clapping God with His last trump but Ben bowed as though a whole multitude had applauded him By some chance the only direction in which he did not turn his eyes was the gallery even then he might not have seen a single figure seated a little to one side a man with a dark overcoat buttoned up to his chin who clapped his two thumbs noiselessly together drawing in his breath with a sort of whistle That s the stuff he said That s the stuff to give em After a moment s pause Ben turned again to the piano This time he played the Sonata Pathetique in C Minor Op XIII then the Sonata Walstein in C Major Between each he got up moved forward to the edge of the platform and bowed At the end of the Sonata Op III by rights the first on the programme during the short interval which followed it he straightened his shoulders with a sort of swagger utterly unlike himself swung round to the piano again and slammed out God Save the King He played it through to the very end then rose bowed from where he stood stared round at the empty hall a dreadful strained defiant smile stiffening upon his face and sinking back upon his stool laid his arms across the keyboard with a crash of notes burying his head upon them In a moment Jenny was out of her seat There were chairs in her way and she kicked them aside raked one forward with her foot and scrambled on to the platform then catching a sideways glimpse of the empty seats bent forward and shook her fist at them Beasts Pigs A a a ah You The attendants had disappeared the stranger was lost in shadows There was nobody there but themselves it would not have mattered if there had been all the lords and ladies all the swells in the world would not have mattered The great empty hall suddenly friendly closed curving around them Jenny dropped upon her knees at Ben s side and flung her arms about him with little moans of love and pity slid one hand beneath his cheek with a muffled roll of notes raised his head and pressed it against her heart There my dear There my love there there there She laid her lips to his thick dark hair in a passion of adoration loving every lock of it and then woman like picked a white thread from off his black coat clasped him afresh with joy and sorrow like runnels of living water pouring through and through her There there there there He was too much of a child to fight against her all his pride was gone Oh Jenny Jenny Jenny he cried then in an extremity of innocent anguish amazement They didn t come They don t care they don t want it Jenny they don t want it Don t you worry about them there blighters my darling Selfish pigs they ain t not worth a thought Don t you worry about them But Beethoven Don t you worry about Beethoven neifer ain t no better nor he oughter be taeke my word fur it Lettin you in like this ere There there there my dear They clung together weeping rocking to and fro Well said the man in the gallery I m jiggered and crept out very softly stumbling a little because of the damp air which seemed to have got into his eyes and made them smart As the lovers came out into the little vestibule clinging to each other they did not so much as see the stranger who stood talking to the man in the box office but went straight on out into the rain with their umbrellas unopened in their hands A good thing as the all people insists upon payment in advance remarked the man in the box office The other gave him a curious half contemptuous glance I d like to hear you say that in a year s time Why Because that chap will be able to buy and sell a place like this a hundred times over by then Queen s Hall Albert Hall I know It s my business to know There s something about his playing That something different they re all out for It took a long time to get back to Canning Town Even Jenny had lost her certainty her grasp of the ways of buses and such things She felt oddly clear and empty like a room swept and garnished with the sense of a ghost in some dim corner of it physically sapped out Ben clung to her He said very little but he clung to her with an odd lost air the look of a child who has been slapped in the face and cannot understand why She was so much smaller than he like a diminutive sturdy steam tug and yet if she could have carried him she would have done so As it was she threw her whole heart and soul into guiding comforting thinking of a hundred things at once her soft mouth folded tight with anxiety How to prevent him from feeling shamed before his mother how to keep the trouble away from her though at the back of her own mind was a feeling and she had an idea that it would be at the back of old missus Cohen s also of immense relief of some load gone almost as though her child had been through a bad attack of scarlet fever or something which one does not take twice With all this there was the thought of what she would step out and buy for their supper if the fried fish shop were still open all she would do and say to cheer them As for Ben the Hammerclavier was surging through his brain carrying the empty hall with it those rows upon rows of empty seats swinging them to and fro so that he felt physically sick as though he were at sea Quite suddenly as they got out of the last tram the rain ceased At the worst it had been a mild night of velvety darkness and soft airs the reflection from the lamps swimming in a haze of gold across the wet pavement but now just as they reached the end of his own street the black sky opened upon a wide sea of pinkish amber and a full moon sailed into sight At the same moment Ben s sense of anguished bewilderment cleared away leaving in its place a feeling of incalculable weariness To be back in his own home again that was all he asked You ll stay the night at our place Jenny Yes I promised your mother Her brow knitted and then cleared again Ah well that was all over Ben would go back to his regular job again they would get married then there would be her money too no need for old missus Cohen to do another hand s turn Plenty of time for her to rest now all her life for resting in Your mother As she spoke Ben remembered for the first time actively remembered for of course it was his mother that he meant when he thought of home She wasn t there Jenny She wasn t there She was very busy adn t not finished er work Something beyond Jenny s will stiffened within her So he had only just realised it She tried not to remember but she could not help it the flushed face the glassy eyes the whole look of a woman beaten with her back against a wall condemning Ben by her very silence desperate courage Work Yes work Jenny snapped it hating herself for it drawing him closer and yet unable to help it Why began Ben and then stopped horrified At last he realised it perhaps it ran to him through Jenny s arm perhaps it was just that he was down on earth again humble ductile seeing other people s lives as they were not as he meant to make them Ter night workin All night one the saeme as another But why he began again stopped dead loosed his own arm and caught hers All this while workin like that She works too hard Jenny look here she works too hard And I this damned music Look here Jenny it s got to stop I ll never play a note again she shall never do a hard stroke of work again never never not so long as I m here to work for her All my life ever since I can remember washing and ironing like like the very devil He pulled the girl along with him That was what I was thinking all the time to make a fortune so that you d both have everything you wanted a big house servants motors silk dresses And all the time letting you both work yourselves to death But this is the end no more of that To be happy that s all that matters sort of everyday happiness No more of that beastly washing ironing it s the end of that anyhow When I m back at the timber yard He was like a child again planning they almost ran down the street No more o that damned washin and ironin no more work True How true The street door opened straight into the little kitchen She was not in bed for the light was still burning they could see it at either side of the blind shrunk crooked with steam There was one step down into the kitchen but for all that the door would not open when they raised the latch and pushed it stuck against something Some of those beastly old clothes Ben shoved it hailing his mother Mother Mother you ve got something stuck against the door Odd that she did not come to his help quick as she always was After all it gave way too suddenly for him to altogether realise the oddness and he stumbled forward right across the kitchen seeing nothing until he turned and faced Jenny still standing upon the step staring downward with an ashy white face wide eyes fixed upon old missus Cohen who lay there at her feet resting incomprehensibly resting They need not have been so emphatic about it all No more beastly washing no more work for the whole thing was out of their hands once and for all She had fallen across the doorway a flat iron still in her hand the weapon with which she had fought the world kept the wolf from that same door all the strain gone out of her face a little twisted to the left side and oddly smiling One child s pinafore was still unironed the rest were folded finished They raised her between them laid her upon her bed It was Jenny who washed her wrapped her in clean linen no one else should touch her Ben who sat by her with hardly a break until the day that she was buried wiped out with self reproach grief desolate as any child sodden with tears He collected all his music into a pile the day before the funeral gave it to Jenny to put under the copper a burnt offering If it hadn t been for that she might be here now I don t want ever to see it again ever to hear a note of it That was what he said Jenny went back to the house with him after the funeral she was going to give him his tea and then return to her own room In a week they were to be married and she would be with him for good looking after him That evening before she left she would set his breakfast cut his lunch ready for the morrow By Saturday week they would be settled down to their regular life together She would not think about his music pushed it away at the back of her mind over and done with would not even allow herself the disloyalty of being glad And yet was glad deeply glad relieved despite her pride in it in him as though it were something unknown alien dangerous like things forbidden Two men were waiting at the door of the narrow slip of a house the tall thin one with his overcoat still buttoned up to his chin and another fat and shining with a top hat black frock coat and white spats About that concert said the first man We were thinking that if we could persuade you to play put in the other There was no one there interrupted Ben roughly His shoulders were bent his head dropped forward on his chest poking sideways his eyes sullen as a child s I was there put in the first man and I must say impressed Very deeply impressed added the other but once again Ben brushed him aside You were there at my concert Jenny standing a little back for they were all three crowded upon the tiny door step saw him glance up at the speaker with something luminous shining through the darkness of his face At my concert And you liked it You liked it Like is scarcely the word We feel that if you could be persuaded to give another concert put in the stout man blandly and would allow I shall never play again never never cried Ben harshly but this time the other went on imperturbably allow us to make all arrangements take all responsibility boom you see to the advertising and all that we thought if we were to let practically all the seats for the first concert go in complimentary tickets get a few good names on the committee perhaps a princess or something of that sort as a patroness a strong claque Of course playing Beethoven playing him as you played him the other night Grand magnificent put in the first man realising the weariness the drop to blank indifference in the musician s face The Hammerclavier for instance It was magical Oh yes yes that that Ben s eyes widened his face glowed He hummed a bar or so Was there ever anything like it My God was there ever anything like it Jenny who had the key squeezed past them at this and ran through the kitchen to the scullery where she filled the kettle and put it upon the gas ring to boil looked round her for a moment with quick darting eyes like a small wild animal at bay in a strange place then drew a bucketful of water turned up her sleeves the skirt of her new black frock tied on an old hessian apron of missus Cohen s with a savage jerk of the strings and dropping upon her knees started to scrub the floor the rough stone floor Men trapsin in an out muckin up a place She could hear the murmur of men s voices in the kitchen and through it that trapsin of other men struggling with a long coffin on the steep narrow stairs On and on it went the agonised remembrance of all that banging trampling the swish of her own scrubbing brush the voices round the table where old missus Cohen had stood ironing for hours and hours upon end Then the door into the scullery was opened For a moment or so she kept her head obstinately lowered determined that she would not look up Then feeling her own unkindness she raised it and smiled upon Ben who stood there flushed glowing and yet too shame faced to speak smiled involuntarily as one must smile at a child Well That that music stuff I suppose it s burnt he began fidgeting from one foot to another his head bent ducking sideways his shoulder to his ear Her glance enwrapped him smiling loving bitter sweet Things were not going to be as she had thought none of that going out regularly to work coming home to tea like other men none of that safe sameness of life At the back of her calm was a fierce battle then she rose to her feet wiped her hands upon her apron stooped to the lowest shelf of the cupboard and drew out a pile of music There you are my dear I didn t not burn it a cause Well I suppose as I sorter knowed all the time as you d be wantin it Children Well one knew where one was with children real children But men that was a different pair of shoes altogether something you could never be sure of unless you remembered always remembered to treat them as though they were grown up think of them as children Now you taeke that an get along back to yer friends an yer playin and let me get on with my work It ll be dark an tea time on us afore ever I ve time ter so much as turn round That woman said the fat shining man as they moved away down the street greasy with river mist Hang it all where in the world are we to get a taxi Common place little thing a bit of a drag on him I should think Don t you believe it my friend that s the sort to give em some un who will sort of dry nurse em feed em mind em That s the wife for a genius The only sort of wife mark my word for it THE DEVIL TO PAY By MAX PEMBERTON From The Story Teller nineteen twenty two To say that the usually amiable Ambrose Cleaver was in the devil of a temper would be merely to echo the words of his confidential clerk John who looking through the glass partition between their offices confessed to James the office boy that he had not seen such goings on since old Ambrose the founder of the firm was gathered to his fathers There won t be a bit of furniture in the place presently said he and I wouldn t give twopence for the cat when he s finished kicking her This comes of the women my boy Never have nothing to say to a woman until you ve finished your dinner and lighted your cigar Many a good business have I seen go into the Bankruptcy Court because of a petticoat before lunch You keep away from em if you want to be Lord Mayor of London same as Dick Whittington was James did not desire particularly to become Lord Mayor of London but he was greatly amused by his employer s temper Never heard such language said he and him about to marry her Why he almost threw them jewels at her ead and when she told him he must have let the devil in by accident he says as he was always glad to see her friends They ll make a happy couple surely John shook his old dense head and would express no opinion upon the point Misfortunes never come singly said he Here s that Count Florian waiting for him in the ante room Now that s a man I can t abide If anybody told me he was the devil I d believe him soon enough A bad un James or I don t know the breed An evil man who seems to pollute the very air you breathe James was not so sure of it He give me half a crown for fetching of a cab yesterday and told me to go to the music hall with it He must have a lot of money for he never smokes his cigars more than half way through and he wears a different scarf pin every day That s wot comes of observation mister John I could tell you all the different pairs of trousers he s worn for the last three weeks and so I m going to make my fortune as the advertisements say mister John would not argue about that The bell of the inner office now tinkled and that was an intimation that the Count Nicholas Florian was to be admitted to the Holy of Holies So the old man hurried away and opening the sacred door with circumspection narrowly escaped being knocked down by an enraged and hasty cat glad to escape that inferno at any cost You rang sir Ambrose Cleaver thirty three years of age square jawed fair haired a florid complexion and with a wonderful pair of clear blue eyes admitted that he did ring And don t be so d d slow next time he snapped I ll see the Count Florian at once The old man withdrew timidly while his master mopped up the ink from the pot he had broken in his anger Enough to try the devil himself was the sop that argument offered to his heated imagination She knows I hate Deauville like poison and of course it s to Deauville she must go for the honeymoon And she looks so confoundedly pretty when she s in a temper what wonderful eyes she s got And when she s angry the curls get all round her ears and it s as much as a man can do not to kiss her on the spot Of course I didn t really want her to have opals if she thinks they re unlucky but she needn t have insisted that I knew about it and bought them on purpose to annoy her Good God I wish there were no women in the world sometimes What a splendid place it would be to live in and what a fine time the men would have for of course they are all the daughters of the devil really and that s why they make life too hot for us mister John entered at this moment showing in the Count and so a very cheerful argument was thus cut short Ambrose pulled himself together and suppressing as best he could any appearance of aversion from the caller who now presented himself he sat back in his chair and prepared to hear the tale Count Florian was at that time some fifty nine years of age dark as an Italian and not without trace of an Eastern origin Though it was early in the month of May he still wore a light Inverness cape of an ancient fashion while his patent leather boots and his silk hat shone with the polish of a well kept mirror When he laughed however he showed ferocious teeth some capped with gold and in his eyes was a fiery light not always pleasant to behold A chilly morning he began You have no fire I see You find it so queried Ambrose Well I thought it quite warm Ah said the count you were born of course in this detestable country Do not forget that where I live there are people who call the climate hell and he laughed sardonically with a laugh quite unpleasant to hear Ambrose did not like such talk and showed his displeasure plainly The climate is good enough for me he said Personally I don t want to live in the particular locality you name Have a cigar and tell me why you called the old business I suppose Well you know my opinion about that I want none of it I don t believe it is honest business and I think that if we did it we might all end in the dock So you know my mind before we begin The Count heard him patiently but did not seem in any way disturbed There is very little business that is honest he said practically none at all Look at politics the Church art the sciences those who flourish are the imposters while your honest men are foolish enough to starve in garrets If a man will undertake nothing that is open to the suspicion of self interest he should abandon all his affairs at once and retire to a monastery where possibly he will discover that the prior is cheating the abbot and the cellarer cheating them both You have a great business opportunity and if anybody suffers it is only the Government which you must admit is a pure abstraction suggesting chiefly a company of undiscovered rascals The deal which I have to propose to you concerns a sum of half a million sterling and that is not to be passed by lightly I suggest therefore that at least you read the documents I have brought with me and that we leave the matter of honesty to be discussed by the lawyers He laid upon the table a bundle of papers as he spoke and lighted a cigarette by lightly rubbing a match against the tip of the fourth finger of his left hand Ambrose felt strangely uneasy A most uncanny suspicion had come upon him while the man was speaking He felt that no ordinary human being faced him and that he might in very truth be talking with the devil Nor would this idea quit him despite its apparent absurdity You must have great influence Count he remarked presently great influence to get such a valuable commission as this The Count was flattered I have servants in every country he said the rich are always my friends the poor often come to me because they are not rich Few who know me can do without me indeed I may say that but for such men as I am the world would not go on I am the mainspring of its endeavour And yet when I met you it was on the links above La Turbie The count laughed showing his glittering teeth as any carnivorous animal might have done Ah I remember You met me when I was playing golf with a very saintly lady Latterly I hear she has ceased to go to church and taken to bobbed hair Women are strange creatures mister Cleaver but difficult very difficult sometimes I have had many disappointments with women You find men easier Indeed there are few men who are not willing to go to the devil if the consideration be large enough A woman on the other hand is too often the victim of her emotions She will suffer eternal torment for the man she loves and she will cheat for him But for the rest of us nothing positively nothing at all she is neither honest nor dishonest she merely passes us by Ah exclaimed Ambrose a little wearily I wish I could think that about my fiancee She s just been up that s why you find me upset I bought her opals and of course she wants diamonds You see I forgot she wasn t born in October The Count nodded his head in sympathy I must have a little talk to her I am sure we shall be good friends Miss Kitty Palmer is it not Forgive me I read it in the newspapers a charming face but a little temper I think Well well there is no harm in that What a dull place the world would be but for a little temper You have much to be thankful for mister Cleaver very very much And now this concession by which you will make two hundred thousand pounds at a very moderate estimate There will be very little temper when you take home that news No woman is angry with a man who makes money but she has a great contempt for him who does not Even if he made it dishonestly She does not care a snap of the fingers how he makes it believe me And afterwards when he goes to prison Pshaw only fools go to prison If your foolish principles were made the test there would hardly be a free man in Mincing Lane We should have to lock up the whole City Come let me have your signature and I will do the rest To refuse is madness You are offered the chance of a lifetime Ambrose did not reply to him immediately It had come to him suddenly that this was the hour of a great temptation and he sat very still conscious that his heart beat fast because of the evil that was near him The Count watched him meanwhile as a wild beast may watch its prey The man s eyes appeared to have turned to coals of fire his fingers twitched his teeth were on edge he had even ceased to smoke Well he said at last unable to suffer the silence any longer Ambrose rose from his chair and went over slowly to the great safe which stood in the corner of his office he unlocked it and took some documents from a shelf upon the right hand side The Count stood at his elbow while he did so and he could feel the man s breath warm upon his shoulder Suddenly a violent impulse overcame him He swung round and seized the fellow by the collar and in an instant endowed as it were with superhuman strength he hurled the man into the safe and turned the key upon him By heaven he cried but I have locked up the devil II Ambrose dismissed John the man and James the boy and told them he would have no need of their services for some days I am going away for a little holiday he said The letters can await my return You may both go down to Brighton for a week and I will pay your expenses It is right that you should have a little change of air more than once a year so away with you both and don t let me hear of you until Monday next James looked at John and John looked at James Was their excellent employer demented then or had they understood him incorrectly Not said John when they were alone together that I particularly wished to go to Brighton just now but there you are Half the pleasure in life my boy is wanting to do things and when you have to do them without wanting it even though they are pleasant things somehow all the savour has gone out of the salt so to speak But of course we shall have to go seeing that we couldn t tell mister Cleaver a lie James was a little astonished at that for he had told thousands of lies in his brief life though now he really had no desire to tell one at all I shall be glad to get away from here for a few days any ow he said it s so ot and close and when you go near the safe in the other horfice it s just as though you stood by a roaring fire Good thing mister John that the thing is fire proof or we might have the whole show burned down as mister Ambrose hisself was saying Very ot for the time of year James says he and burnin ot says I We ll find it cooler at Brighton mister John and perhaps we can go to the pictures though I m fed up with all them rotten stories about crooks and such like and so are you I m sure mister John said that he was though he was surprised at such an opinion emanating from James When they locked up the inner office their master being gone home they discovered in the fire grate the ashes of what had been a formidable looking document and it really did seem as though the concrete upon which the great safe stood had become quite hot but there was no visible sign of fire and so they went off wondering and contented but by no means in a mood of exhilaration as properly they should have been Ambrose had taken a cab at his own door and his first visit was to the Bond Street jeweller who had sold him the opals He was quite sure that he had shut up the devil in his office safe and as he drove it seemed to him that he became conscious of a new world round about him though just how it was new he could not have told you Everybody wore a look of great content there was subdued laughter but no real merriment nor did any hasten as though he had real business to do while the very taxi cabs drove with circumspection and actually waited for old ladies to cross the street before them When his own cab stopped he gave the man half a crown as usual but the driver called him back and pointed out his error Excuse me sir eighteenpence is the fare with threepence for my gratuity that makes one and ninepence So I have to give you ninepence back although I thank you all the same Ambrose pocketed the money quite insensible of anything but the man s civility and entered immediately into the sanctum of the great jeweller He found that worthy a little distrait and far from any desire to do big business In fact his first words told of his coming retirement from an occupation which had enriched him during a good forty years of profit and rarely of loss The fact is mister Cleaver that I foresee the day coming when women will wear no jewellery Already the spirit of competition has passed and it is by competition and the pride of competition that this trade has flourished A woman buys a rope of pearls because another woman wears one Lady A cannot allow Lady B to have more valuable diamonds than she possesses Very few really admire the gems for their own sake and when you think of the crimes that have been committed because of them the envious passions they arouse and the swindles to which they give birth then indeed we may wish that every precious stone lay deep at the bottom of the sea But my dear sir are you not thus banishing much beauty from the world did not the Almighty create precious stones for pretty women to wear The jeweller shrugged his shoulders sweeping aside carelessly some priceless pearls that lay on the table before him The Almighty created them to lie securely in their shells or deep in the caverns of the earth for the rivers to wash them with sweet waters or the lurid fire to shape them in the bowls of the mountains The beauties given us to enjoy are those upon which our eyes may light in the woodlands or from the heights the glory of the sunset the stillness of the sea the thousand hues of a garden of flowers or the cascade as it falls from the mountain top These things are common to all but the precious stone is too often for the neck or the fingers of the harlot and the adventuress No sir I shall retire from this business and seek out some quiet spot where I can await with composure the solemn moment of dissolution we all must face Ambrose was almost too astonished to speak I admire your philosophy he said at length but the fact is that I want a diamond ring and a rope of pearls and if Ah said the old man interrupting him it is odd that you should speak of pearls for I have just been telling my partner here that whatever he may do in the future he will find pearls of little profit to him What with imitations and the cultured article women are coming already to despise them But even if you take your fiancee a diamond ring will she not merely say to herself an excellent beginning now what is the next thing I can get out of him Be wise and cultivate no such spirit of cupidity foreign to a good woman s nature but encouraged by the men who for vanity s sake heap presents upon her Take rather this little cross set with pure amethysts the emblem of faith and so discover my dear sir whether she loves the man or the jewel for indeed but few women love both as all their story teaches us Ambrose took the cross and thanked the old man for his words of wisdom Another cab carried him on his way to Upper Gloucester Place where Kitty Palmer then lived with her saintly mother and as he went he reflected upon the jeweller s words I ll put her to the proof he said to himself if she likes this twopenny halfpenny cross she is a miracle among women But of course she won t like it and there ll be another scene What a devil of a temper she was in this morning and how she made the fur fly If she s like that now I shall just take her into my arms and kiss her until she s done fighting After all I wouldn t give sixpence for a woman who had no spirit It s their moods that make them so fascinating little devils that they are at their best The arrival at the house cut short his ruminations and he hastened into the well known drawing room and there waited impatiently while the maid summoned Kitty from her bedroom She came down immediately to his great surprise for usually she kept him waiting at least half an hour and her mood was strangely changed he thought A pretty flaxen haired blue eyed cream and white English type she was but her chin spoke also of determination and the eyes which could look love to eyes that looked again upon occasion could also speak of anger which resented all control This afternoon however Kitty was as meek as a lamb She had become so utterly changed in an hour that Ambrose hardly knew her My dear girl he began I am so sorry that I lost my temper this morning Oh no not you Ambrose dear It was I of course it was awfully silly and we won t go to Deauville if you don t want to Let it be Fontainebleau by all means though really it does not seem important whether we do get married or don t while you love me Love after all is what matters isn t it Ambrose dearest He had to say that it was though he did not like her argument When with some hesitation and not a little fear he showed her the little gold cross she admitted to his astonishment that it was one of the prettiest things she had ever seen Somehow she said I do not seem to care much for jewellery now It has become so vulgar the commoner the people the more diamonds they wear I shall treasure this darling I ll wear it now at lunch Of course you are going to take me to lunch aren t you Suppose we go to the Ritz grill room the restaurants are so noisy and I know that you like grill rooms don t you dear Ambrose said yes and they started off Somehow he felt rather depressed and he had to confess that Kitty usually so smart looked quite shabby She wore one of her oldest dresses and obviously had neither powder on her face nor the lightest touch of the rouge which became her so well Moreover she was listless beyond experience and when he asked her if she would go to the Savoy and dance that night she answered that she thought she would give up dancing altogether It quite took his breath away Give up dancing but Kitty you re mad about it No dear I was mad to be mad about it but what good does it do to anybody just going up and down and round and round with a man you may never see again Surely we were not sent into the world to do that Ask the vicar of the parish what he thinks or Doctor Lanfry who is doing such splendid work at the hospitals I think we have to make good in life and dancing surely will not help us So I mean to give it up and smoking and all horrid things I m sure you ll like me better for that dear you know how jealous my dancing used to make you but now you ll never have any cause to be jealous again Ambrose did not know what to say This seemed to him quite the flattest lunch he had ever sat out with her while as for the people round about he thought he had never seen a duller lot Perhaps after all he had been a little hasty in shutting up the devil so unceremoniously but it made him laugh to think that the fellow would get no lunch anyway and that his stock of cigars would hardly last him through the day And at any rate he argued the rascal will do no mischief to day He drove Kitty to the King s New Hospital when the stupid meal was over she was visiting some old people there and while he waited for her he met doctor Lanfry himself and had a little chat with that benevolent old gentleman Naturally their talk concerned the hospital and he was not a little surprised to find the worthy doctor altogether in an optimistic mood Yes he said we shall have no need of these costly places Disease is disappearing rapidly from our midst I see the day coming when men and women will go untroubled by any ailment from the cradle to the grave In some ways I confess the world will be poorer Think of all the human sympathy which human suffering awakens the profound love of the mother for the ailing child the sacrifice of those who wait and watch by the beds of the sick the agony of parting leading to the eternal hope in the justice of God All these things the world will miss when we conquer disease and the spirit will be the poorer for them Indeed I foresee the day when men will forget the existence of God just because they have no need to pray for those who suffer the devil will have no work to do in that day but who knows humanity may be worse and not better because of his idleness Ambrose agreed with him though he would never have expressed such sentiments to Kitty He found her a little sad when she came out of the ward and it seemed that all the patients were so very much better that they cared but little for her kindly attentions and when she tried to read to them most of them fell asleep So she went back to Ambrose and asked him to drive to the vicarage where she hoped to see Canon Kenny her good pastor and find out if he could tell her of some work of mercy to be done I feel she said that I must find out the sorrow in the world I must help it But suppose my dear that there isn t any sorrow Oh then the world would not be worth living in I should go out to the islands of the Pacific and become a missionary Do you know Ambrose dear I ve often thought of putting on boys clothes and going to live in the wilderness A boy seems so much more active than a girl and what does it matter since sex no longer counts He looked at her aghast Sex no longer counts No she said in the simplest way people will become too spiritual for that You will have to love me as though I were your sister Ambrose Ambrose gulped down a d n and was quite relieved to find himself presently in the study of the venerable canon who was just leaving England for a Continental holiday He said that he was not tired but really there was very little work to do and he added with a laugh It would almost appear my children as though some one had locked up the devil and there was no more work left for us parsons But that surely would be a great good thing exclaimed Ambrose astonished In a way yes the canon rejoined but consider all life depends upon that impulse which comes of strife strife of the body strife of the soul I worship God believing He has called upon me to take my share in fighting the evil which is in the world Remove that evil and what is my inspiration Beyond the grave yes there may be that sphere of holiness to which the human condition contributes nothing a sphere in which all happiness all goodness centres about the presence of the Eternal but here we know that man must strive or perish must fight or be conquered must school his immortal soul in the fire of temptation and of suffering So I say it may even be a bad day for the world could the devil be chained in bonds which even he could not burst It might even be the loss of the knowledge of the God by whom evil is permitted to live that good may come This and much more he said always in the tone of one who bared his head to destiny and had a faith unconquerable When they left him Kitty appeared to have made up her mind and she spoke so earnestly that even her lover could not argue with her Ambrose dear she said I must see you no more I shall devote my life to good works To night I shall enter the Convent of the Little Sisters at Kensington It is a long long good bye my dearest He did not answer her but calling a taxi he ordered the man to drive to Throgmorton Street like the deuce III He had told James and John to go home but to his annoyance he found them still in the office and busy as though nothing extraordinary had happened Brushing by them he dashed into the inner room and turned the key in the lock of his safe Come out he cried but nobody answered him It was odd but when he looked inside that massive room of steel nobody was to be discerned there At the same instant however he heard the Count s voice immediately behind him and turning he discovered the man at his elbow Well asked the fellow So there he stood exactly in the same attitude as Ambrose had left him when he crossed the room to find the document Indeed the very same cigarette was held by his evil looking fingers and it was clear that he waited for the word which would signify acceptance of his contract Good heavens thought Ambrose I must have imagined it all He returned to his chair and tossed the paper across the table I refuse to sign it he said curtly you had better call on Alderman Karlbard he s a church warden a justice of the peace and a philanthropist He s your man and he s pretty sure to end in prison anyway Thank you for your introduction said the Count quietly and bowing he withdrew with the same nonchalant air as he had entered Trust the devil to know when he is beaten Ambrose watched him go and then calling John he asked what time it was A quarter to one sir said that worthy Just in time to lunch with Kitty Ambrose thought And then jumping up as a man who comes by a joyous idea he cried By Gad what a row I mean to have with her the darling EMPTY ARMS By ROLAND PERTWEE From The Ladies Home Journal nineteen twenty two There was a maroon wall paper in the dining room abundantly decorated with sweeping curves unlike any known kind of vegetation There were amber silk sashes to the Nottingham lace curtains at the huge bow window and an amber winding sheet was wrapped about the terra cotta pot in which a tired aspidistra bore forth a yearly leaf Upon the Brussels carpet was a massive mahogany dining table and facing the window a Georgian chiffonier brass railed and surmounted by a convex mirror The mantlepiece was draped in red serge ball fringed There were bronzes upon it and a marble clock while above was an overmantel columned and bemirrored upon the shelves of which reposed sorrowful examples of Doulton ware and a pair of wrought iron candlesticks It was a room divorced from all sense of youth and live beings sunless grave unlovely an arid room that bore to the nostrils the taint and humour of the tomb From somewhere near the Edgware Road came the clot clot of a late four wheeler and the shake and rumble of an underground train The curtains had been discreetly drawn the gas turned off at the metre and an hour had passed since the creaking of the old lady s shoes and the jingle of the plate basket ascending the stairs had died away A dim light from the street lamp outside percolated through the blinds and faintly illuminated the frame and canvas of a large picture hanging opposite the mantlepiece It was a beautiful picture a piece of perfect painting three figures in a simple curve of rocks lit as it were by an afterglow of sunset In the centre was a little Madonna draped in blue and gold Her elbows were tight to her sides and her upturned palms with their tender curving fingers were empty It seemed almost as though they cradled some one who was not there Her mouth was pulled down at the corners as is a child s at the edge of tears and in her eyes was a questing and bewildered look To her right leaning upon a slender staff was the figure of saint John the Baptist and upon his face also perplexity was written A trick brushwork had given to his eyes a changing direction whereby at a certain angle you would say he was looking at the Madonna and again that he was following the direction of her gaze out into unknown places His lips were shaped to the utterance of such a word as why or where It seemed as though the two were in a partnership of sorrow or of search The third figure was of Saint Anne standing a little behind and looking upward A strange composition oddly incomplete giving an impression of sadness of unrest and of loss irredeemable A clock was chiming the parts of an hour when the little Madonna stepped from the frame and tiptoed across the room To her own reflection in the mirror opposite she shook her head in a sorrowful negative She peeped into a cupboard and behind the draperies of the mantlepiece but there was nothing there She paused before an engraving of Raphael s Holy Family murmured Happy Lady and passed on On a small davenport table next to one of the two inexorable armchairs she found the old lady s workbasket That was a great piece of good fortune since nightly it was locked away with the tea the stamps and other temptations that might persuade a soul to steal should opportunity allow In the many years of her dwelling in the house but three times only had she found it unguarded There are glorious possibilities in a workbasket Once she had found wool there not carded but a hank of it soft white and most delicate to touch To handle it had given her the queerest sensation She had shut her eyes and it had seemed to weave itself into the daintiest garments very small you understand and with sleeves no longer than a middle finger But it was a silly imagining for not many days afterward looking down from the canvas she had seen the old lady with her clicking ivory needles knit the wool into an ugly pair of bed socks Quite a while she played in the basket that night She liked the little pearl buttons in the pill box and the safety pins were nice too Kind and trustworthy pins they were to hide their points beneath smooth round shields She felt it would be good to take some of them back in one of her empty hands and hide them in that little crevice of rock under the juniper tree It was the banging of a front door opposite and the sound of running footsteps that moved her to the window She drew back the curtain and peeped out across the way There were lights in an upstairs window and a shadow kept crossing and recrossing the blind It was a nice shadow and wore a head dress like her own except that it was more sticky out The hall too showed a light and looking up the street she saw a maidservant running very fast disappear round the corner After that there was silence for a long time In the street no one moved it was deserted empty as the little Madonna s arms and dark A fine rain was falling and there were no stars The sound of distant traffic had died away The last underground train had drilled its way through sulphurous tunnels to the sheds where engines sleep She could not tell what kept her waiting at the window perhaps it was the moving shadow on the blind perhaps a prescience a sense of happenings near at hand wonderful yet frightening A thousand other times she had looked across the street in the dead of night only to shake her head and steal back sorrowfully to her canvas But to night it was different there was a feeling of promise as though the question that she ever asked with her eyes might at last be given an answer The front door opened a second time and a man came out and though he was quite young he looked older than the world He was shaking and very white his hair was disordered and straggled across his brow He wore no collar but held the lapels of his coat across his throat with trembling fingers Fearfully he looked up the street where the maid had gone then stamped his foot on the paving stones and with his free hand rubbed his forehead and beat it with his knuckles Oh will he never come she heard him cry and the words echoed through her as though they had been her own If it was a prayer he had uttered it was swiftly answered for at the moment the maid and a bearded man came round the corner at a fast walk The bearded man had a kind face and broad shoulders She did not hear what passed between them but the bearded man seemed confident and comfortable and compelling and presently he and the maid went into the house while the other man leaned against the railings and stared out before him at a tiny star which had appeared in a crack between the driven clouds Lonely and afraid he looked and strangely like herself The misery of him drew her irresistibly Always before she had shunned the people of every day having no understanding of their pleasures or sorrows seeing little meaning in their lives or deaths But here was a mortal who was different who was magnetic and almost without realising she passed out of the house crossed the road and stood before him the corners of her cloak draped across her arms He did not seem aware of her at once and even when she spoke to him in Italian of the Renaissance he did not hear So she spoke again and this time in English What is it He started rubbed his eyes blinked at her and answered Hullo who are you What is it she repeated Have you lost something Don t don t he pleaded Don t even suggest such a thing little lady I won t I only thought and you looked so sad Be all right directly It s the waiting Kind of you to stop and speak to me His eyes strayed over the gold and blue of her cloak Been to a theatre he asked She shook her head and looked up at him with a child s perplexity A play he amended I ve no one to play with she answered simply See And she held out her empty arms What s wrong then I don t know She seemed to dwell on the last word I only thought perhaps you could tell me Tell you what Help me to find it perhaps It seemed as if you were looking too that s why I came Looking he repeated I m waiting that s all Me too But it s such a long time and I get no nearer Nearer to what Finding Something you lost I think so Must be I ll go back now He put out a hand to stop her Listen he said It ll be hours before I shall know I m frightened to spend them alone Be a friend little lady and bear me company Tisn t fair to ask but if you could stay a little I ll stay she said And will you talk to me Yes Tell me a story then just as if I were a kid a child A man isn t much more these times At the word child her arms went out to him but dropped to her sides again as he said a man Come under the porch where the rain won t spoil your pretty silk That s better Now tell away They sat side by side and she began to talk He must have been listening for other sounds or surely he would have been bewildered at the very beginning of what she told It s hard to remember when one was alive but I used to be yes hundreds of years ago I lived can t remember very well there was a high wall all around and a tower and a bell that rang for prayers and long long passages where we walked up and down to tell our beads Outside were mountains with snow caps like the heads of the sisters and it was cold as snow within cold and pure as snow I was sixteen years old and very unhappy We did not know how to smile that I learnt later and have forgotten since There was the skull of a dead man upon the table where we sat to eat that we might never forget to what favour we must come There were no pretty rooms in that house What would you call a pretty room he asked for the last sentence was the first of which he was aware I don t know she answered I think a room with little beds and wooden bars across the window and a high fender would be a pretty room We have been busy making such a room as that he said There s a wall paper with pigs and chickens and huntsmen on it But go on There were iron bars to the window of my cell He was very strong and tore them out with his hands as he stood up on the saddle of his horse We rode into Florence as dawn broke and the sun was an angry red while we rode his arm was around me and my head upon his shoulder He spoke in my ear and his voice trembled for love of me We had thrown away the raiment of the sisterhood to which I had belonged and as I lay across the saddle I was wrapped in a cloak as crimson as the sun Been reading Tennyson little lady asked the man She did not understand and went on It was a palace to which he brought me bright with gold mosaic and fine hangings that dazzled my eyes after the grey they had been used to look upon There were many servants and richly clad friends who frightened me with their laughter and the boldness of their looks On his shoulder he bore me into the great dining hall where they sat awaiting us and one and all they rose to their feet leaping upon stools and tables with uplifted goblets and shouting toasts The noise was greater than any I had heard before and set my heart a beating like the clapper of the convent bell But one only stayed in his chair and his looks were heavy with anger At him the rest pointed fingers and called on him derisively to pay the wager and be glad Whereat he tugged from his belt a bag of gold which he flung at us as though with the will to injure But he who held me caught the bag in his free hand broke the sealed cord at the neck of it and scattered the coins in a golden rain among the servants After this he set me by his side at the board gave me drink from a brimming goblet and quails cooked in honey from wild bees and silver dishes of nectarines and passion fruit And presently by twos and threes the guests departed singing and reeling as they went and he and I were left alone Alone she repeated shuddering Did you hear anything said the young man raising his head A cry a little cry No I can hear footsteps moving up and down Doctors boots always creak There Listen It was nothing What were you saying Twice in the months that followed I tried to run away to return to the convent but the servants whom I had counted my friends deceived me and I was brought back to a beating brought back strapped to his stirrup iron as I might have been a Nubian slave Long since he had ceased loving me that lasted such a little while He called me Madonna as though it were a term of shame and cursed me for coldness and my nunnery ways He was only happy when he read in my face the fear I held him in And I was always afraid Afraid echoed the man Until to night I was never afraid And then my baby came and I was not afraid any more but contented all through I carried him always in my arms by day and night So pink and little and with a smile that warmed like sunshine She paused and added plaintively It s hard to remember when one was alive My hands my arms have forgotten the feel of him I wish said the man I d had a second opinion It might have frightened her though Oh heaven how much longer Don t mind me little lady You re helping no end You were speaking of baby Yes He killed my baby said the little Madonna because he had killed my fear of him Then being done with me he threw me out in the streets alone I thought to end it that night because my arms were empty and nothing could be good again But I could not believe the baby was indeed gone I thought if I searched I would find him in the course of time Therefore I searched the city from end to end and spoke with mothers and peeped into nurseries and knocked at many doors And one day a door was opened by a man with great eyes and bronze hair swept back from his brow a good man He wore a loose smock over his doublet smeared with many colours and in his left hand he held a palette and brushes When he saw me he fell back a pace and his mouth opened Mother of mercy he breathed A real Madonna at last His name was Andrea del Sarto and he was a painter I am a painter too said the young man forgetting his absorption at the mention of a great name He brought me into his room which was bright with windows and a fire He bade me tell my story and while I spoke never once did his eyes desert me When I had ended he rose and walked up and down Then he took from a chest a cloak of blue and gold and draped it round me Stand upon that throne Madonna said he and I will put an infant in your arms that shall live down all the ages And he painted me So with the child at my breast I myself had passed into the picture and found contentment there When it was finished the great ones of many cities came to look upon it and the story of how I came to be painted went from mouth to mouth Among those who were there was he who had taken me from the nunnery and seeing me in perfect happiness a fury was born in him I was hidden behind a hanging and watched the black anger rising up and knotting his brow into ugly lines He bought the canvas and his servants carried it away But since the child was in my arms for all time it mattered little to me Then one night two men came to my lodging and without question took me across the city and led me into the palace where I had lived with him And he came forward to meet me in the great hall There was a mocking smile on his lips and he pointed to a wall upon which a curtain was hanging I took away that child he said because you valued it higher than the love of man Look now At a gesture a servant threw back the hanging and revealed the picture The babe was gone and my arms crooked to cradle him were empty with the palms upturned I died then to the sound of his laughter I died and looking down from the canvas I watched them carry me away And long into the night the man who twice had robbed me of my child sat at the long table staring out before him drinking great draughts and sometimes beating the boards with his bare fists As dawn broke he clapped his hands and a servant entered He pointed at me with a shaking hand Take it away he cried To a cellar and let masons brick up the door He was weeping as they carried me down to the dark beneath the house What a strange being you are said the young man You speak as though these were real memories What happened to the picture then I lay in the dark for so long hundreds of years I think and there was nowhere I might look Afterward I was found and packed in a box and presently put upon the wall in the sad room where everything is so old that I shall not find him there This is the furthest I have dared to look Help me find him please Won t you help me find him Why little lady he answered soothingly how shall I help That s a woman s burden that heaven isn t merciful enough to let a man share He stopped abruptly and threw up his head Did you hear that there Through the still early morning air came a faint reedy cry The young man was upon his feet fiercely fitting a key into the lock The little Madonna had risen too and her eyes were luminous like glowworms in the dark He s calling me she cried He s calling Mine said the young man She turned to follow but the door closed between them To the firm of Messrs Ridgewell Ridgewell Hitchcock and Plum was given the task of disposing of the furniture and effects of the late Sabina Prestwich spinster of twenty twoa Cambridge Avenue Hyde Park W As mister Ridgewell junior remarked to mister Plum while engaged in compiling the sale list and supplying appropriate encomiums to describe an upright grand by Rubenthal Berlin Victorian muck Lucky if we clean up two fifty on the lot mister Plum was disposed to agree Though I must say he added it wouldn t surprise me if that picture was worth a bit Half a mind to let old Kineagie have a squint at it Please yourself responded mister Ridgewell junior but to my mind it s ten guineas for nix It was the chance discovery of an old document amongst a litter of receipts and papers that persuaded them to engage an expert opinion The document stated that the picture had been discovered bricked up in a Florentine cellar some fifty years before and had been successfully smuggled out of Italy But the man who found it died and it passed with a few other unvalued possessions to Sabina Prestwich now deceased The result of Eden Kineagie s visit to the house in Cambridge Avenue was the immediate transference of the canvas to Sotheby s Sale Rooms a concerted rush on the part of every European and American connoisseur a threatening letter from the Italian Foreign Office some extravagant bidding and the ultimate purchase of the picture for the nation after a heated debate on the part of twenty two Royal Academicians and five painters of the new school who would have accepted death rather than the letters R A after their names Extensive correspondence appeared in the leading papers persons wrote expressing the opinion that the picture had never been painted by Del Sarto that it was the finest example of his work that the price paid was a further example of government waste and that the money would have been better employed repairing the main road between Croydon Town Hall and Sydenham High Street the condition of which constituted a menace to motor cyclists For nearly ten days scarcely a single publication appeared that failed to reproduce a comment or criticism upon the subject but strangely enough no single leader writer or casual contributor remarked upon the oddness of the composition or the absence of the Infant from the Madonna s arms In the course of time that is to say on the eleventh day the matter passed from the public mind a circumstance explainable perhaps by the decent interment of the canvas in the National Gallery where it affected no one save those mysterious folk who look at pictures for their pleasure and the umbrellaless refugee who is driven to take shelter from the fierceness of storms The little Madonna was placed upon a south wall whence she could look out upon a brave company And sometimes people would pause to gaze at her and then shake their heads And once a girl said How sad she looks I wonder why And once a little old lady with industrious hands set up an easel before her and squeezed little twists of colour upon a palette then thought a long time and pursed her lips and puzzled her brow and finally murmured I could never copy it It s so so changing And she too went away The little Madonna did not dare to step from her frame at night for other mothers were at hand cradling their babes and the sound of her footfalls might have wakened them But it was hard to stay still and alone in that happy nursery She could see through an archway to the right a picture Rubens had painted and it was all aglow with babies like roses clustered at a porch fat dimpled babies who rolled and laughed in aerial garlands It would have been nice to pick one and carry it back with her Yet perhaps they were not really mothers children but sprites and joys that had not learned the way to nestle Had it been otherwise surely the very call of her spirit must have brought one leaping to her arms And then one day came a man and girl who stopped before her The girl was half child half woman and the man grey and bearded but with brave blue eyes It was seventeen years since the night she had stolen across the way and talked with this man in his hour of terror but time did not cloud the little Madonna s memory with the dust of forgetfulness That s the new Del Sarto said the girl who was reading from a small blue book See daddy Then the man turned and looked at her fell back a step came forward again passed a hand across his mouth and gasped What is it asked the girl He did not answer at once then The night you were born he said I m certain It s it s Del Sarto too And the poor empty arms Just how she looked and I closed the door on her Daddy what are you saying There was a frightened tone in the girl s voice It s all right dear don t mind me I must find the keeper of the gallery Poor little lady Run back home tell your mother I may be late But daddy There are more things in heaven and earth he began but did not finish It seemed as though the Madonna s eyes were pleading to him and it seemed as if he could still hear her say Help me find him please He told his story to the Committee of the National Gallery and to do them credit it was received with the utmost courtesy They did not require him to leave them while their decision was made This was arrived at by a mere exchange of glances a nod answered by a tilt of the head a wave of the hand a kindly smile and the thing was done As the chairman remarked We must not forget that this gentleman was living at the time opposite to the house in which the picture was hanging and it is possible that a light had been left burning in the room that contained it Those of us who are fathers and I regret for my own part that I cannot claim the distinction will bear me out that the condition of a man s mind during the painful period of waiting for news as to his wife s progress is apt to depart from the normal and make room for imaginings that in saner moments he must dismiss as absurd There has been a great deal of discussion and not a little criticism on the part of the public as to the committee s wisdom in purchasing this picture and I am confident you will all agree with me that we could be responsible for no greater folly than to work upon the canvas with various removers on the bare hypothesis unsupported by surface suggestion that the Madonna s arms actually contain a child painted in the first intention For my own part I am well assured that at no period of its being has the picture been tampered with and it is a matter of no small surprise to me sir that an artist of your undoubted quality and achievement should hold a contrary opinion We are greatly obliged for the courtesy of your visit and trust that you will feel after this liberal discussion that your conscience is free from further responsibility in the matter Good day That was the end of the interview Once again the door was slammed in the little Madonna s face That night the man told his wife all about it So you see he concluded there is nothing more I can do But she lay awake and puzzled and yearned long after he had fallen asleep And once she rose and peeped into the room that used to be the nursery It was a changed room now for the child had grown up and where once pigs and chickens and huntsmen had jostled in happy farmyard disorder upon the walls now there were likenesses of Owen Nares and Henry Ainley obligingly autographed But for her the spirit prevailed the kindly bars still ribbed the windows and the sense of sleeping children still haunted the air And she it was who told the man what he must do and although it scared him a great deal he agreed for in the end all good husbands obey their wives It felt very eerie to be alone in the National Gallery in the dead of the night with a tiny electric lamp in one s buttonhole and a sponge of alcohol and turpentine in one s hand While he worked the little Madonna s eyes rested upon him and it could hardly have been mere fancy that made him believe they were full of gratitude and trust At the end of an hour the outline of a child faint and misty appeared in her arms its head circled by a tiny white halo snuggling against the curve of her little breast Then the man stepped back and gave a shout of joy and remembering the words the painter had used he cried out I will put an infant in your arms that shall live down all the ages He had thought perhaps there would come an answering gladness from the Madonna herself and looked into her face to find it And truly enough it was there Her eyes which for centuries had looked questingly forth from the canvas now drooped and rested upon the baby Her mouth so sadly downturned at the corners had sweetened to a smile of perfect and serene content But the men will not believe he washed away the sadness of her looks with alcohol and turpentine I did not touch the head I am certain I did not he repeated Then how can you explain Oh heaven he answered Put a child in any woman s arms LENA WRACE By MAY SINCLAIR From The Dial nineteen twenty one nineteen twenty two She arranged herself there on that divan and I knew she d come to tell me all about it It was wonderful how at forty seven she could still give that effect of triumph and excess of something rich and ruinous and beautiful spread out on the brocades The attitude showed me that her affair with Norman Hippisley was prospering otherwise she couldn t have afforded the extravagance of it I know what you want I said You want me to congratulate you Yes I do I congratulate you on your courage Oh you don t like him she said placably No I don t like him at all He likes you she said He thinks no end of your painting I m not denying he s a judge of painting I m not even denying he can paint a little himself Better than you Roly If you allow for the singular obscene ugliness of his imagination yes It s beautiful enough when he gets it into paint she said He makes beauty His own beauty Oh very much his own Well you just go on imitating other people s God s or somebody s She continued with her air of perfect reasonableness I know he isn t good looking Not half so good looking as you are But I like him I like his slender little body and his clever faded face There s a quality about him a distinction And look at his eyes Your mind doesn t come rushing and blazing out of your eyes my dear No No I m afraid it doesn t rush And for all the blaze Well that s what I m in love with the rush Roly and the blaze And I m in love for the first time she underlined it with a man Come I said come Oh I know I know you re thinking of Lawson Young and Dickey Harper I was Well but they don t count I wasn t in love with Lawson It was his career If he hadn t been a Cabinet Minister if he hadn t been so desperately gone on me if he hadn t said it all depended on me Yes I said I can see how it would go to your head It didn t It went to my heart She was quite serious and solemn I held him in my hands Roly And he held England I couldn t let him drop could I I had to think of England It was wonderful Lena Wrace thinking that she thought of England I said Of course But for your political foresight and your virtuous action we should never have had Tariff Reform We should never have had anything she said And look at him now Look how he s crumpled up since he left me It s pitiful It is I m afraid missus Withers doesn t care about Tariff Reform Poor thing No Don t imagine I m jealous of her Roly She hasn t got him I mean she hasn t got what I had All the same he left you And you weren t ecstatically happy with him the last year or two I daresay I d have done better to have married you if that s what you mean It wasn t what I meant But she d always entertained the illusion that she could marry me any minute if she wanted to and I hadn t the heart to take it from her since it seemed to console her for the way the really very infamous way he had left her So I said Much better It would have been so nice so safe she said But I never played for safety Then she made one of her quick turns Frances Archdale ought to marry you Why doesn t she How should I know Frances s reasons would be exquisite I suppose I didn t appeal to her sense of fitness Sense of fiddlesticks She just hasn t got any temperament that girl Any temperament for me you mean I mean pure cussedness said Lena Perhaps But you see if I were unfortunate enough she probably would marry me If I lost my eyesight or a leg or an arm if I couldn t sell any more pictures If you can understand Frances you can understand me That s how I felt about Dickey I wasn t in love with him I was sorry for him I knew he d go to pieces if I wasn t there to keep him together Perhaps it s the maternal instinct Perhaps I said Lena s reasons for her behaviour amused me they were never exquisite like Frances s but she was anxious that you should think they were So you see she said they don t count and Norry really is the first I reflected that he would be also probably the last She had no doubt to make the most of him But it was preposterous that she should waste so much good passion preposterous that she should imagine for one moment she could keep the fellow I had to warn her Of course if you care to take the risk of him I said He won t stick to you Lena Why shouldn t he I couldn t tell her I couldn t say Because you re thirteen ears older than he is That would have been cruel And it would have been absurd too when she could so easily look not a year older than his desiccated thirty four It only took a little success like this her actual triumph in securing him So I said Because it isn t in him He s a bounder and a rotter Which was true Not a bounder Roly dear His father s Sir Gilbert Hippisley Hippisleys of Leicestershire A moral bounder Lena A slimy eel Slips and wriggles out of things You ll never hold him You re not his first affair you know I don t care she said as long as I m his last I could only stand and stare at that her monstrous assumption of his fidelity Why he couldn t even be faithful to one art He wrote as well as he painted and he acted as well as he wrote and he was never really happy with a talent till he had debauched it The others she said don t bother me a bit He s slipped and wriggled out of their clutches if you like Yet there was something about all of them Distinguished That s it He s so awfully fine and fastidious about the women he takes up with It flatters you makes you feel so sure of yourself You know he wouldn t take up with you if you weren t fine and fastidious too one of his great ladies You think I m a snob Roly I think you don t mind coming after Lady Willersey Well she said if you have to come after somebody True I asked her if she was giving me her reasons Yes if you want them I don t I m content to love out of all reason And she did She loved extravagantly unintelligibly out of all reason yet irrefutably To the end There s a sort of reason in that isn t there She had the sad logic of her passions She got up and gathered herself together in her sombre violent beauty and in its glittering sheath her red fox skins all her savage splendour leaving a scent of crushed orris root in the warmth of her lair Well she managed to hold him tight for a year fairly intact I can t for the life of me imagine how she could have cared for the fellow with his face all dried and frayed with make up There was something lithe and sinuous about him that may of course have appealed to her And I can understand his infatuation He was decadent exhausted and there would be moments when he found her primitive violence stimulating before it wore him out They kept up the menage for two astounding years Well not so very astounding if you come to think of it There was Lena s money left her by old Weinberger her maternal uncle You ve got to reckon with Lena s money Not that she poor soul ever reckoned with it she was absolutely free from that taint and she couldn t conceive other people reckoning Only instinctively she knew She knew how to hold Hippisley She knew there were things he couldn t resist things like wines and motor cars he could be faithful to From the very beginning she built for permanence for eternity She took a house in Avenue Road with a studio for Hippisley in the garden she bought a motor car and engaged an inestimable cook Lena s dinners in those years were exquisite affairs and she took care to ask the right people people who would be useful to Hippisley dealers whom old Weinberger had known and journalists and editors and publishers And all his friends and her own even friends friends Her hospitality was boundless and eccentric and Hippisley liked that sort of thing He thrived in a liberal air an air of gorgeous spending though he sported a supercilious smile at the fioritura the luscious excess of it He had never had too much poor devil of his own I ve seen the little fellow swaggering about at her parties with his sharp frayed face looking fine and fastidious safeguarding himself with twinklings and gestures that gave the dear woman away I ve seen him in goggles and a magnificent fur lined coat shouting to her chauffeur giving counter orders to her own while she sat snuggling up in the corner of the car smiling at his mastery It went on till poor Lena was forty nine Then as she said she began to shake in her shoes I told her it didn t matter so long as she didn t let him see her shaking That depressed her because she knew she couldn t hide it there was nothing secret in her nature she had always let them see And they were bothering her the others more than a bit She was jealous of every one of them of any woman he said more than five words to Jealous of the models first of all before she found out that they didn t matter he was so used to them She would stick there in his studio while they sat until one day he got furious and turned her out of it But she d seen enough to set her mind at rest He was fine and fastidious and the models were all common And their figures Roly you should have seen them when they were undressed Of course you have seen them Well there isn t is there And there wasn t Hippisley had grown out of models just as he had grown out of cheap Burgundy And he d left the stage because he was tired of it so there was mercifully no danger from that quarter What she dreaded was the moment when he d take to writing again for then he d have to have a secretary Also she was jealous of his writing because it absorbed more of his attention than his painting and exhausted him more left her less of him And that year their third year he flung up his painting and was as she expressed it at it again Worse than ever And he wanted a secretary She took care to find him one One who wouldn t be dangerous You should just see her Roly She brought her in to tea one day for me to look at and say whether she would do I wasn t sure what can you be sure of but I could see why Lena thought she would She was a little unhealthy thing dark and sallow and sulky with thin lips that showed a lack of temperament and she had a stiffness and preciseness like a Board School teacher just that touch of commonness which Lena relied on to put him off She wore a shabby brown skirt and a yellowish blouse Her name was Ethel Reeves Lena had secured safety she said in the house But what was the good of that when outside it he was going about everywhere with Sybil Fermor She came and told me all about it with a sort of hope that I d say something either consoling or revealing something that she could go on You know him Roly she said I reminded her that she hadn t always given me that credit I know how he spends his time she said How do you know Well for one thing Ethel tells me How does she know She she posts the letters Does she read them She needn t He s too transparent Lena do you use her to spy on him I said Well she retorted if he uses her I asked her if it hadn t struck her that Sybil Fermor might be using him Do you mean as a paravent Or she revised it a parachute For Bertie Granville I elucidated A parachute by all means She considered it It won t work she said If it s her reputation she s thinking of wouldn t Norry be worse I said that was the beauty of him if Letty Granville s attention was to be diverted Oh Roly she said do you really think it s that I said I did and she powdered her nose and said I was a dear and I d bucked her up no end and went away quite happy Letty Granville s divorce suit proved to her that I was right The next time I saw her she told me she d been mistaken about Sybil Fermor It was Lady Hermione Nevin Norry had been using Sybil as a paravent for her I said she was wrong again Didn t she know that Hermione was engaged to Billy Craven They were head over ears in love with each other I asked her what on earth had made her think of her And she said Lady Hermione had paid him thirty guineas for a picture That looked she said as if she was pretty far gone on him She tended to disparage Hippisley s talents Jealousy again I said it looked as if he had the iciest reasons for cultivating Lady Hermione And again she told me I was a dear You don t know Roly what a comfort you are to me Then Barbara Vining turned up out of nowhere and from the first minute Lena gave herself up for lost I m done for she said I d fight her if it was any good fighting But what chance have I At forty nine against nineteen and that face The face was adorable if you adore a child s face on a woman s body Small and pink a soft innocent forehead fawn skin hair a fawn s nose a fawn s mouth a fawn s eyes You saw her at Lena s garden parties staring at Hippisley over the rim of her plate while she browsed on Lena s cakes and ices or bounding about Lena s tennis court with the sash ribbons flying from her little butt end Oh yes she had her there As much as he wanted And there would be Ethel Reeves in a new blouse looking on from a back seat subtle and sullen or handing round cups and plates without speaking to anybody like a servant I used to think she spied on them for Lena They were always mouthing about the garden together or sitting secretly in corners Lena even had her to stay with them let him take her for long drives in her car She knew when she was beaten I said Why do you let him do it Lena Why don t you turn them both neck and crop out of the house Because I want him in it I want him at any cost And I want him to have what he wants too even if it s Barbara I want him to be happy I m making a virtue of necessity It can be done Roly if you give up beautifully I put it to her it wasn t giving up beautifully to fret herself into an unbecoming illness to carry her disaster on her face She would come to me looking more ruined than ruinous haggard and ashy her eyes all shrunk and hot with crying and stand before the glass looking at herself and dabbing on powder in an utter abandonment to misery I know she moaned As if losing him wasn t enough I must go and lose my looks I know crying s simply suicidal at my age yet I keep on at it I m doing for myself I m digging my own grave Roly A little deeper every day Then she said suddenly Do you know you re the only man in London I could come to looking like this I said Isn t that a bit unkind of you It sounds as though you thought I didn t matter She broke down on that Can t you see it s because I know I don t any more Nobody cares whether my nose is red or not But you re not a brute You don t let me feel I don t matter I know I never did matter to you Roly but the effect s soothing all the same Ethel says if she were me she wouldn t stand it To have it going on under my nose Ethel is so high minded I suppose it s easy to be high minded if you ve always looked like that And if you ve never had anybody She doesn t know what it is I tell you I d rather have Norry there with Barbara than not have him at all I thought and said that would just about suit Hippisley s book He d rather be there than anywhere else since he had to be somewhere To be sure she irritated him with her perpetual clinging and wore him out I ve seen him wince at the sound of her voice in the room He d say things to her not often but just enough to see how far he could go He was afraid of going too far He wasn t prepared to give up the comfort of Lena s house the opulence and peace There wasn t one of Lena s wines he could have turned his back on After all when she worried him he could keep himself locked up in the studio away from her There was Ethel Reeves but Lena didn t worry about his being locked up with her She was very kind to Hippisley s secretary Since she wasn t dangerous she liked to see her there well housed eating rich food and getting stronger and stronger every day I must say my heart bled for Lena when I thought of young Barbara It was still bleeding when one afternoon she walked in with her old triumphant look she wore her hat with an air crane and the powder on her face was even and intact like the first pure fall of snow She looked ten years younger and I judged that Hippisley s affair with Barbara was at an end Well it had never had a beginning nor the ghost of a beginning It had never happened at all She had come to tell me that that there was nothing in it nothing but her jealousy the miserable damnable jealousy that made her think things She said it would be a lesson to her to trust him in the future not to go falling in love For she argued if he hadn t done it this time with Barbara he d never do it I asked her how she knew he hadn t this time when appearances all pointed that way And she said that Barbara had come and told her Somebody it seemed had been telling Barbara it was known that she d taken Hippisley from Lena and that Lena was crying herself into a nervous break down And the child had gone straight to Lena and told her it was a beastly lie She hadn t taken Hippisley She liked ragging with him and all that and being seen about with him at parties because he was a celebrity and it made the other women the women he wouldn t talk to furious But as for taking him why she wouldn t take him from anybody as a gift She didn t want him a scrubby old thing like that She didn t like that dragged look about his mouth and the way the skin wrinkled on his eyelids There was a sincerity about Barbara that would have blasted Hippisley if he d known Besides she wouldn t have hurt Lena for the world She wouldn t have spoken to Norry if she d dreamed that Lena minded But Lena had seemed so remarkably not to mind When she came to that part of it she cried Lena said that was all very well and it didn t matter whether Barbara was in love with Norry or not but how did she know Norry wasn t in love with her And Barbara replied amazingly that of course she knew They d been alone together When I remarked that it was precisely that Lena said No That was nothing in itself but it would prove one way or another and it seemed that when Norry found himself alone with Barbara he used to yawn After that Lena settled down to a period of felicity She d come to me excited and exulting bringing her poor little happiness with her like a new toy She d sit there looking at it turning it over and over and holding it up to me to show how beautiful it was She pointed out to me that I had been wrong and she right about him from the beginning She knew him And to think what a fool what a damned silly fool I was with my jealousy When all those years there was never anybody but me Do you remember Sybil Fermor and Lady Hermione and Barbara To think I should have so clean forgotten what he was like Don t you think Roly there must be something in me after all to have kept him all those years I said there must indeed have been to have inspired so remarkable a passion For Hippisley was making love to her all over again Their happy relations were proclaimed not only by her own engaging frankness but still more by the marvellous renaissance of her beauty She had given up her habit of jealousy as she had given up eating sweets because both were murderous to her complexion Not that Hippisley gave her any cause He had ceased to cultivate the society of young and pretty ladies and devoted himself with almost ostentatious fidelity to Lena Their affair had become irreproachable with time it had the permanence of a successful marriage without the unflattering element of legal obligation And he had kept his secretary Lena had left off being afraid either that Ethel would leave or that Hippisley would put some dangerous woman in her place There was no change in Ethel except that she looked rather more subtle and less sullen Lena ignored her subtlety as she had ignored her sulks She had no more use for her as a confidant and spy and Ethel lived in a back den off Hippisley s study with her Remington and displayed a convenient apathy in allowing herself to be ignored Really Lena would say in the unusual moments when she thought of her if it wasn t for the clicking you wouldn t know she was there And as a secretary she maintained up to the last an admirable efficiency Up to the last It was Hippisley s death that ended it You know how it happened suddenly of heart failure in Paris He d gone there with Furnival to get material for that book they were doing together Lena was literally prostrated with the shock and Ethel Reeves had to go over to Paris to bring back his papers and his body It was the day after the funeral that it all came out Lena and Ethel were sitting up together over the papers and the letters turning out his bureau I suppose that in the grand immunity his death conferred on her poor Lena had become provokingly possessive I can hear her saying to Ethel that there had never been anybody but her all those years Praising his faithfulness holding out her dead happiness and apologizing to Ethel for talking about it when Ethel didn t understand never having had any She must have said something like that to bring it on herself just then of all moments And I can see Ethel Reeves sitting at his table stolidly sorting out his papers wishing that Lena d go away and leave her to her work And her sullen eyes firing out questions asking her what she wanted what she had to do with Norman Hippisley s papers what she was there for fussing about when it was all over What she wanted what she had come for was her letters They were locked up in his bureau in the secret drawer She told me what had happened then Ethel lifted her sullen subtle eyes and said You think he kept them She said she knew he d kept them They were in that drawer And Ethel said Well then he didn t They aren t He burnt them We burnt them We could at least get rid of them Then she threw it at her She had been Hippisley s mistress for three years When Lena asked for proofs of the incredible assertion she had her letters to show Oh it was her moment She must have been looking out for it saving up for it all those years gloating over her exquisite secret her return for all the slighting and ignoring That was what had made her poisonous the fact that Lena hadn t reckoned with her hadn t thought her dangerous hadn t been afraid to leave Hippisley with her the rich arrogant contempt in her assumption that Ethel would do and her comfortable confidences It made her amorous and malignant It stimulated her to the attempt I think she must have hated Lena more vehemently than she loved Hippisley She couldn t then have had much reliance on her power to capture but her hatred was a perpetual suggestion Supposing supposing she were to try and take him Then she had tried I daresay she hadn t much difficulty Hippisley wasn t quite so fine and fastidious as Lena thought him I ve no doubt he liked Ethel s unwholesomeness just as he had liked the touch of morbidity in Lena And the spying That had been all part of the game his and Ethel s They played for safety if you like They had had to throw Lena off the scent They used Sybil Fermor and Lady Hermione and Barbara Vining one after the other as their paravents Finally they had used Lena That was their cleverest stroke It brought them a permanent security For you see Hippisley wasn t going to give up his free quarters his studio the dinners and the motor car if he could help it Not for Ethel And Ethel knew it They insured her too Can t you see her letting herself go in an ecstasy of revenge winding up with a hysterical youp You You thought it was you It was me me ME You thought what we meant you to think Lena still comes and talks to me To hear her you would suppose that Lawson Young and Dickey Harper never existed that her passion for Norman Hippisley was the unique solitary manifestation of her soul It certainly burnt with the intensest flame It certainly consumed her What s left of her s all shrivelled warped as she writhed in her fire Yesterday she said to me Roly I m glad he s dead Safe from her clutches She ll cling for a little while to this last illusion that he had been reluctant but I doubt if she really believes it now For you see Ethel flourishes In passion you know nothing succeeds like success and her affair with Norman Hippisley advertised her so that very soon it ranked as the first of a series of successes She goes about dressed in stained glass futurist muslins and contrives provocative effects out of a tilted nose and sulky eyes and sallowness set off by a black velvet band on the forehead and a black scarf of hair dragged tight from a raking backward peak I saw her the other night sketching a frivolous gesture THE DICE THROWER By SIDNEY SOUTHGATE Thomas Moult From Colour nineteen twenty two Hunger is the most poignant when it has forced physical suffering to the highest point without impairing the mental functions Thus it was with Silas Carringer a young man of uncommonly high spirit when he found himself a total stranger in a ramshackle Mexican city one rainy night in November In his possession remained not a single article that he might have pawned for a morsel of food And he had already stripped his body of every shred of clothing except the few garments he was compelled by an inborn sense of the fitness of things to retain Bodily starvation as a consequence was added to hunger and his misery was complete It chanced that an extraordinary happening awaited Silas Carringer that night in Mexico otherwise he would either have drowned himself in the river within twenty four hours or died of pneumonia within three days He had been without food for seventy hours and his mental desperation had driven him far in its race with his physical needs to consume the remaining strength of his emaciated body Pale weak and tottering he took what comfort he could find in the savoury odours which came streaming up from the basement kitchens of the restaurants in the main streets He lacked the courage to beg or steal For he had been reared as a gentleman and was accordingly out of place in the world His teeth chattered his eyes had dark ugly lines under them he shambled stooped and gasped He was too desperate to curse his fate he could only long for food He could not reason He could not reflect He could not understand that there were pitying hands somewhere that might gladly have succoured him He could think only of the hunger which consumed him of the food that could give him warmth and comparative happiness Staggering along the streets he came at last to a restaurant a little way from the main thoroughfares Stopping before the window he stared greedily at the steaks within thick and juicy and lined with big fat oysters lying on ice at the slices of ham as large as his hat at the roasted chickens brown and ready for the table and he ground his teeth groaned and staggered on A few steps onward was a drinking saloon At one side of it was a private door with the words Family entrance painted thereon And in the recess of the door which was closed there stood the dark figure of a man In spite of his own agony Carringer saw something which appalled him in the stranger s face as the street light fell upon it and yet at the same time he was fascinated Perhaps it was the unspeakable anguish of those features that appealed to the starving man s sympathy and he came to an uncertain halt at the doorway and stared rudely upon the stranger At first the man did not notice him seeming to look straight out into the street with a curious fixity of expression and the death like pallor of his face sent a chill through Carringer s limbs chilled nigh to stone though they were already The stranger caught sight of him at last Ah he said slowly and with peculiar clearness the rain has caught you too without overcoat or umbrella Stand in this doorway there is room for two The voice was not unkind though it sounded strangely harsh It was the first word that had been addressed to Carringer since hunger possessed him and to be spoken to at all gave him cheer So he took his place in the doorway beside the mysterious stranger who at once relapsed into his fixed gaze at nothingness across the street It may rain for a long time he said presently stirring himself I am cold and I can feel you trembling and shivering Let us step inside and drink He turned and opened the door Carringer followed hope slowly warming his chilled heart The pale stranger led the way into one of the little private compartments with which the place was fitted Before sitting down he drew from his pocket a roll of bank bills You are younger than I he said to Carringer Will you go to the bar and buy a bottle of absinthe and bring also a pitcher of water and some glasses I don t like the waiters hanging round Here is a twenty dollar bill Carringer took the money and started down the corridor towards the bar He clutched the sudden wealth in his hand tightly It felt warm and comfortable sending a delicious tingling sensation through his arm How many glorious meals did not the money represent He could smell an imaginary steak broiled with fat mushrooms and melted butter in the steaming dish Then he paused and looked stealthily backward to where he had left the stranger Why not slip away while he had the opportunity away from the drinking saloon with the money to the restaurant he had passed half an hour ago and buy something to eat It was risky but He hesitated and the coward in him there are other names than this triumphed He went straight to the bar as the stranger had requested and ordered the liquor His step was weaker as he returned to the compartment The stranger was sitting at the little table staring at the opposite wall just as he had stared across the street He wore a wide brimmed slouch hat pulled well over his eyes Carringer could only vaguely take the measure of the man s face It was only after Carringer had set the bottle and the glasses on the table and seated himself opposite that the stranger noticed his return Oh you have brought it he exclaimed without raising his voice How kind of you Now please close the door Carringer was counting out the change from his pocket when the stranger interrupted him Keep that he said You will need it for I am going to win it back in a way that may interest you Let us drink first though and I will explain He mixed two drinks of absinthe and water and the two men lifted their glasses Carringer had never tasted the liquor before and it offended his palate at first but no sooner had it passed down his throat than he began to feel warm again and the most delicious thrills He had heard of the absinthe drinkers of Paris and he wondered no longer at the deadly fascination of the liquor not realising that his extreme weakness and the emptiness of his stomach made him peculiarly susceptible to its effects This will do us good murmured the stranger setting down his glass Presently we shall have more Meanwhile tell me if you know how to play with the dice Carringer replied that he did not I was afraid that you might not said the stranger All the same please go to the bar and bring a dice box I would ring for it he explained seeing Carringer glance towards the bell but I don t want the waiters coming in and out Carringer brought the dice box closed the door carefully again and the play began It was not one of the simpler games but had complications in which judgment as well as chance played a part After a game or two without stakes the stranger said You have picked it up very quickly All the same I will show you that you don t understand it We will throw for a dollar a game and in that way I shall win the money that you received in change Otherwise I would be robbing you and I imagine that you cannot afford to lose I mean no offence I am a plain spoken man but I believe in honesty before politeness Here his face relaxed into a most fearful grin I merely want a little recreation and you are so good natured that I am sure you will not object On the contrary replied Carringer politely I shall enjoy it Very well but let us drink again before we start I believe I am growing colder They drank again Carringer took the liquor now with relish for it was something in his stomach at least and it warmed and soothed him Then the play commenced He won The pale stranger smiled quietly and opened another game Again Carringer won Then the stranger pushed back his hat and fixed his quiet gaze upon his opponent smiling yet Carringer obtained a full view of the man s face for the first time and it appalled him He had begun to acquire a certain self possession and ease and the novelty of the adventure was beginning to pall before the new advances of his terrible hunger when this revelation of the man s face threw him back into confusion It was the extraordinary expression of the face that alarmed him Never upon the face of a living being had he beheld a pallor so chilling so death like The features were more than pale They were ghastly as sunless frost Carringer s powers of observation had been sharpened by the absinthe and after having detected the stranger in an absent minded effort on several occasions to stroke a beard which had no existence he reflected that some of the whiteness of the face might be due to the recent shaving and removal of a full beard The eyes were black and his lower lip was purple The hands were fine white and thin and black veins bulged out upon them After gazing for a few moments at Carringer the stranger pulled his hat down over his eyes again You are lucky he said referring to the success of his opponent Suppose we try another drink There is nothing to sharpen a man s wits like absinthe and I see that you and I are going to have a delightful game After the drink the play proceeded Carringer won from the first rarely losing a game He became greatly excited Colour flooded his cheeks and he forgot his hunger The stranger exhausted the little roll of bills which he had first produced and drew forth another much larger in amount There were several thousand dollars in the roll At Carringer s right hand were his winnings something like two hundred dollars The stakes were raised and the game went on Another drink was taken and then fortune turned to the stranger He began to win easily Carringer was stung by these reverses and began to play with all the skill and judgment at his command He took the lead again Only once did it occur to him to wonder what he should do with the money if he continued to win But a sense of honour decided for him that it belonged to the stranger As the play went on Carringer s physical suffering returned with increased aggressiveness Sharp pains darted through him viciously and he writhed within him and ground his teeth in agony Could he not order a supper with his winnings he wondered No it was of course out of the question The stranger did not observe his suffering for he was now completely absorbed in the game He seemed puzzled and disconcerted He played with great care studying each throw minutely Not a word escaped him The two men drank occasionally and the dice continued to rattle And the money kept piling up at Carringer s hand The pale stranger suddenly began to behave strangely At moments he would start and throw back his head listening intently His eyes would sharpen and flash as he did so then they sank back into heaviness once more Carringer saw a strange expression sweep over the man s face on several occasions an expression of ghastly frightfulness and the features would become fixed in a peculiar grimace He noticed also that his companion was steadily sinking deeper and deeper into a condition of apathy Occasionally none the less he would raise his eyes to Carringer s face after some lucky throw and he would fix them upon him with a steadiness that made the starving man grow chiller than ever he had been before Then came the time when the stranger produced another roll of bills and braced himself for a bigger effort With speech somewhat thick but still deliberate and very quiet he addressed his young opponent You have won seventy four thousand dollars and that is the exact amount I have remaining We have been playing for several hours and I am very tired and so are you Let us hasten the finish You have seventy four thousand dollars I have seventy four thousand dollars Nether of us has a cent beside Each will now stake his all and throw a final game for it Without hesitation Carringer agreed The bills made a considerable pile upon the table Carringer threw and his starving heart beat violently as the pale stranger took up the dice box with exasperating deliberation Hours seemed to pass before he threw but at last the dice rattled on to the table and the pale stranger had won The winner sat staring at the dice and then he leaned slowly back in his chair settled himself with seeming comfort raised his eyes to Carringer s and fixed that unearthly stare upon him He did not speak His face showed not a trace of emotion or even of intelligence He simply stared One cannot keep one s eyes open very long without winking but the stranger never winked at all He sat so motionless that Carringer became filled with a vague dread I will go now he said standing back from the table As he spoke he recollected his position and found himself swaying like a drunken man The stranger made no reply nor did he relax his gaze Under that gaze the younger man shrank back into his chair terrified and faint A deathly silence filled the compartment Suddenly he became aware that two men were talking in the next room and he listened curiously The walls were of wood and he heard every word distinctly Yes said a voice he was seen to turn into this street about three hours ago And he must have shaved He must have shaved To remove a full beard would naturally make a great change in the man His extreme pallor attracted attention As you know he has been seriously troubled with heart disease lately and it has greatly altered him Yes but his old skill remains Why this is the most daring bank robbery we have ever had A hundred and forty eight thousand dollars think of it How long is it since he came out of prison after that New York affair Eight years In that time he has grown a beard and lived by throwing dice No human being can come out winner in a game with him The two men clinked glasses and a silence fell between them Then Carringer heard the shuffling of their feet as they passed out and he sat on suffering terrible mental and bodily pain The silence remained unbroken save for the sounds of voices far off and the clink of glasses The dice players the pale man and the starving one sat gazing at each other with a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars piled upon the table between them The winner made no attempt to gather up the money He merely sat and stared at Carringer wholly unmoved by the conversation in the adjoining compartment Carringer began to shake with an ague The cold unwavering gaze of the stranger sent ice into his veins Unable to bear it longer he moved to one side and was amazed to discover that the eyes of the pale man instead of following him remained fixed upon the spot where he had sat A great fear came over him He poured out absinthe for himself with shaking fingers staring back at his companion all the while watching him watching him as he drank alone and unnoticed He drained the glass and the poison had a peculiar effect upon him he felt his heart bounding with alarming force and rapidity and his breathing came in great pumping spasms His hunger was now become a deadly thing for the absinthe was destroying his vitals In terror he leaned forward to beg the hospitality of the stranger but his whisper had no effect One of the man s hands lay on the table Carringer placed his own upon it and drew back quickly for the hand was as cold as stone Then there came into the starving man s face a crafty expression and he turned eagerly to the money Silently he grasped the pile of bills with his skeleton fingers looking stealthily every moment at the stark figure of his companion mortally dreading lest he should stir And yet instead of hastening from the room with the stolen fortune he sank back into his chair again A deadly fascination forced him there and he sat rigid staring back into the wide stare of the other man He felt his breath coming heavier and his heart beats growing weaker but he was comforted because his hunger was no longer causing him that acute pain He felt easier and actually yawned If he had dared he would have gone to sleep The pale stranger still stared at him without ceasing And Carringer had no inclination for anything but simply to stare back The two detectives who had traced the notorious bank robber to the drink saloon moved slowly through the compartments searching in every nook and cranny of the building At last they reached a compartment from which no answer came when they knocked They pushed the door open with a stereotyped apology on their lips They beheld two men before them one of middle age and the other very young sitting perfectly still and in the queerest manner imaginable staring at each other across the table Between the two was a pile of money and near at hand an empty absinthe bottle a water pitcher two glasses and a dice box The dice lay before the elder man as though he had just thrown them With a quick movement one of the detectives covered the older man with a revolver and commanded him to put up his hands But the dice thrower paid not the slightest heed The detectives exchanged startled glances They stepped nearer looked closely into the gamesters faces and knew in the same instant that they were dead THE STRANGER WOMAN By G B STERN From John o London s Weekly nineteen twenty two After Hal Burnham had banged himself with his usual vigour out of the house Dickie sat quite inconsolably staring in front of him at a favourite picture on his wall a dim sombre effect of quays and masts and intent hurrying men his neat little brows were pulled down in a worried frown his childish mouth was puckered Was it accurate and just what Hal had said Or simpler still was it true What you damn well need Dickie old son is life in the raw You re living in a lady s work box here It was a bludgeoning return for the courteous attention with which Dickie had that evening listened to his friend s experiences of travel for Hal was not even a good raconteur he started an anecdote by its point and roughly slapped in the scenery afterwards he had likewise a habit of disconnecting his impressions from any sequence of time also he exaggerated and forgot names and dates and even occasionally lapsed into odd silence just when Dickie was offering himself receptively for a climax And then the inevitable Well and what have you been doing meanwhile Dickie was not in the least at a loss he had refurnished his rooms to begin with and that involved a diligent search in antique shops and at sale rooms and one or two trips across country in order not to miss a real gem And they had to be ready for comfortable habitation before the arrival of M and Mlle saint Andre for their annual stay with him a delightful old pair brother and sister with peppery manners and hypercritical appreciation of a good cuisine but so poor so really painfully poor that as Dickie delicately put it I could not help knowing that it might make a difference to them if I postponed their visit of less trivial annoyance but more vital in quality than with other of my friends for whom I should therefore have hurried my preparations rather less this is in confidence of course my dear Hal He had set himself to complete his collection of Watts s Literary Souvenirs I have the whole eleven volumes now And he had been a guest at two charming house parties in the country and at one of them had been given the full responsibility of rehearsing a comic opera in the late eighteenth century style Amateurs of course But I was so bent on realizing the flavour of the period that I m indeed afraid that I did not draw a clear enough line between the deliciously robust and the obnoxiously coarse Coarse you Hal guffawed And then out came the accusation which was so disturbing little Dickie Life in the raw Why did the phrase make him want to clear his throat Raw yes that was the association when you opened your mouth and the fog swirled in Newsboys scampering along a foggy street that was neither elegant nor squalid but just a street of mixed shops and mixed traffic and barrows lit with a row of flapping lights and men and women with faces that showed they worked hard to earn a little less than they needed Public houses Butchers shops with great slabs of red meat Yes and a queue outside the picture palace and a station people bought the evening papers as they hurried in and out of the station Ere yer are sir and on the sheets were headlines that blared out all the most sordid crimes of the past twenty four hours ignored during a sober morning of politics and commerce but dragged into bold view for the people s more leisured reading Newsboys in a foggy street on a Saturday night thus was Dickie s first instinct to define life in the raw Then he discovered that this was only the archway and that the crimes themselves were life in the raw and the criminals But one must get nearer by slow degrees If at all Hal had said that he was living in a lady s work box Dickie was sensitive and not at all stupid His penetration was quite aware that Burnham s remark was not applied to the harmonizing shades of the walls between which he dwelt nor to the soft mellow pattern of his silky Persian rugs nor to his collections heavens how he collected of glowing Sevres china of Second Empire miniatures of quaint old musical instruments with names that in themselves were a tender tinkle of song and of the shoes that had been worn by queens All these things were merely accessories his soul making neat tiny gestures shrugging its shoulders pointing a toe What Hal meant was that Dickie dared not live dangerously What am I to do He raised wistful light brown eyes to the picture which was the one incongruous touch to the dainty perfection of his octagonal sitting room He had bought it at a rummage sale it was unsigned and the canvas overcrowded with figures had grown sombre and blurred yet queerly Dickie liked the suggestion of powerful half naked men the foreign quay side street with a slatternly woman silent against a doorway and the clumsy ship straining to swing out to a menacing sea beyond All these things that he would never do strip and carry bales on his back linger in strange doorways and love hotly an animal woman who was unaccomplished and without grace and breeding and then embark on an evil smelling hulk that would have no human sympathy with his human ills He had done a little yachting of course with the Ansteys the year before last His lips bent to a small ironical smile as he reflected on the difference between a little yachting and the sinister fascination of that ugly uninspired painting Slowly he got up and went out that is to say he very precisely selected the hat gloves coat and silk muffler suitable to wear and as precisely put them on Then he blew up the fire with an old fashioned pair of worked brass bellows turned out the lamp told missus Derrick who would have died in his service every day from eight to eight o clock but would not crook a finger for him a minute before she entered the house nor five seconds after she left it that he was going for a walk and would certainly be back at a quarter to seven but probably before and then went out For this was the natural way for Dickie Maybury to behave At twenty to seven he returned with a sheaf of news papers raucous badly printed papers with smudged lines and a sort of speckled film over the illustrations and startlingly intimate headlines to every item of news Dickie was trying to get into touch with life in the raw At first he was merely bewildered He had read his daily newspaper of course though not with the stolid regularity with which the average man does so And besides it was pre eminently a journal of dignity and good form with an art column and a curio column and a literary page and a chess problem and rather a delicately witty causerie by Rapier it is to be feared that Dickie absorbed himself in these items first and altogether left out most of the topical and sensational news Now however he read it And out of it the horror of the underworld swayed up at him A twilit world where cisterns dripped and where homely familiar things like gas brackets and braces and coal shovels were turned to dreadful weapons of death The coroner and the broker s man and the undertaker sidled in and out of this world dispassionately playing their frequent parts Stunted boys and girls died for love like Romeo and Juliet leaving behind them badly punctuated cries of passion and despair that made Dickie wince as he read them Pale but fascinated Dickie turned over a page and came to the great sensation of the moment Is Ruth Oliver Guilty Dramatic Developments I Wish You Were Dead Lucas The account of the first day of the trial filled the entire page and dribbled excitedly over on to the next There was a photograph of Ruth Oliver accused of murdering her husband You could see that she had gay eyes in a small oval face and a child s wistful mouth This must have been taken while she was very happy Dickie had never read through a murder trial before But he did so now every line of it and the next day and the next Until the woman who had pleaded Not guilty was acquitted And then he wrote to her and asked her to marry him And who would dare say of him now that he had feared to meet life in the raw He did not know of course that his offer was one among fifty did not know that the curious state of mind he was in between trance and hysteria was a very common one to the public after a trial in which the elements are dramatic or the central figure in any way picturesque He did not even know how Ruth Oliver was being noisily besieged by Pressmen and Editors anxious for her biography by music hall and theatrical managers willing to star her by old friends curiously proud of association with her notoriety by religious fanatics with their proofs of a strictly localized Deity whose Hand has clearly been outstretched to save you by unhealthy flappers who had Believed in her all along autograph please But not knowing yet his letter chivalrous without ardour promised her a cool quiet retreat from the plague of insects which was buzzing and stinging in the hot air all about her My house is in a little square with trees all around it it is shady and you cannot hear the traffic I wonder if you are interested in old china and Japanese water colours Finally I shall be very proud and happy if you can trust me to understand how deeply you must be longing for sanctuary after the sorrowful time you have been through Sanctuary She saw it open for her like a cloistered aisle between cold pillars He offered her not the emotional variations intolerable to her weariness just then of a new devotion but green shaded rooms and the beauty of old things and a little old fashioned gentleman s courtesy So ignoring the fifty other offers of marriage which had assailed her she wrote to Dickie Maybury and asked him to come and see her He went still in a strangely exultant mood in which his will acted as easily and yet as fantastically as though it were on a slippery surface And if he had met Hal Burnham on his way back from his visit to Ruth Oliver he would undoubtedly have swaggered a little Nevertheless he was thinking of Ruth too as well as of his own dare devilry in thus seizing reality with both hands Ruth s face much older and more tormented than it had been in the photograph had still that elusive quality which had from the beginning and through all the period of her trial haunted him It outraged his refinement that any woman with the high looks and the breeding of his own class should have been for any space of time the property of a coarse public As his wife the insult should be tenderly rectified The poor child the poor sweet child He felt almost godlike with this new power upon him of acting on impulse As for the peril of death which for a short while had threatened her that was a fact too stark and hideous for contemplation even with Dickie s altered appetite for primitive adventure They did not leave town after their quiet matter of fact wedding at the registrar s A journey in Dickie s eyes would have seemed too blatant an interruption to his everyday existence as though he were tactlessly emphasising to his wife the necessity of a break and a complete change she might even think and again poor child that events should have rubbed into such super sensitiveness that he was slightly ashamed of his act and was therefore hustling her and himself out of sight So they went straight home And missus Derrick said Indeed sir when informed that her new mistress was the Ruth Oliver who had recently been acquitted of the charge of murdering her husband she neither proffered a motherly bosom to Ruth nor did she tender a haughty resignation from mister Maybury s service but said she hoped it wouldn t be expected of her under the new circumstances to arrive earlier nor to leave later because she couldn t do it As for Dickie s friends most of them were of the country house variety whom he visited once a year next autumn would show whether Ruth would be included in those week and week end invitations Meanwhile those few dwelling in London marvelled in a detached sort of way at Dickie s feat liked Ruth and pronounced it a shame that she should have been accused Hal Burnham the indirect promoter of the match had returned to China Nobody was unkind no word jarred life was padded in dim brocade Ruth drew a long breath and was at peace She was perfectly happy watching Dickie And Dickie was at play again enjoying his collection and his objets d art and even his daily habits with the added appreciation of a gambler who had staked but miraculously not lost them Because after all anything might have resulted from his tempestuous decision at all costs to get into contact with naked actuality all that had resulted was the presence in his house of a slim grave woman who dressed her hair like a very skilful and not at all unconscious Madonna whose taste was as fastidious as his own and whose radiantly human smile had survived in vivid contrast to something quenched from her voice and shadowed in her eyes A woman who with a May I of half laughing reverence discovered that she could slip on to her exquisite feet one pair after another from his collection of the shoes of dead queens It sounds like a ballade Austin Dobson I think except that they re not all powder and patch queens For she had an excellent feel of period the texture of it the fine shades of language the outlook Dickie hated people who had a blunt sense of period and in a jumbled fashion referred to old Venetian lace and the Early Spanish School and Louise de la Valliere and a play by Wycherley indiscriminately as historical Yes Dickie had certainly been lucky and like a wise man he did not strain his star to another effort The big thing well he had squared up to it and truth to say he had been fearfully shaky and uncertain about his capacity to do so when Hal had first roused his pride in the matter Now the little things again the little beautiful things he had earned them Anyway he could not have a newspaper in the house nowadays for Ruth s sake he owed it to Ruth to shut out for ever those cries of horror and fear and violence from the battering underworld What I love about the way we live Dickie is that the just rightness of it all flows on evenly the whole time one can be certain of it Most people get it set aside for them in stray lumps picture galleries and churches and a holiday on the Continent And all the rest of their time is just wrongness Dickie wondered how much of her existence with Lucas Oliver had been just wrongness or indeed all wrongness But he never disturbed her surface of creamy serenity by referring to the husband who had been murdered by some person or persons unknown He and Ruth were the most harmonious of comrades but never so far confidential Perhaps Dickie overdid tact and non intrusiveness or perhaps Ruth in her very passion of gratitude to him was yet checked for ever from passionate expression by the memory that her innermost love and her innermost hate wrung into words had once and not so long ago been read aloud and commented upon in public court and in half the homes of England One evening sitting together in front of the fire they drifted into talk of their separate childhoods There was a garden in mine said Ruth And in mine a Casino garden His eyes twinkled Palm trees like giant pineapples and flower beds in a pattern and a fountain Oh you poor little Continental kiddie He shrugged his shoulders The ways of the Lord are thoughtful and orderly Why should He have wasted a heavenly wilderness of gnarled old apple trees on a small boy who hated climbing You can t have hated climbing if you hang that on your wall She nodded towards the quayside picture Surely you must have played pirates and South Seas with your brothers I had none A sister that s all who carried a sunshade I had no sisters but there was a girl next door and her brother I note in jealous anguish of spirit remarked Dickie that you do not simply say a girl and boy next door Ruth s mischievous laugh affirmed his accusation The wall was not very high I kicked a foothold into it half way up and Tommy gave me a pull from the top Tommy was ungallant enough to leave the wall to you There were cherries in his garden sweet black cherries And only crab apples in ours He might have filled his pockets with cherries and then climbed No I reject Tommy he was unworthy of you I may have been a horrid little Casino brat I may even have worn a white satin sailor suit with trousers down to my ankles Oh Ruth winced I may have danced too well and I understood too early the art of complimenting ladies whose hats were too big and whose eyes were too bright But once after Annunciata Maddalena s nose had bled over this same sailor suit I said it was my own nose because I knew how bitterly she was ashamed of her one bourgeois lapse Tommy would have disowned her instead of owning the nose Oh I grant you the nobler nature but it breaks my heart that you didn t have the wild English garden and the cherries and the grubby old dark blue jersey If we have a kiddie Dickie began softly his mouth puckered to its special elvish little smile Then he met her eyes lapping him round with such velvet tenderness that Dickie suddenly knew he was loved knew that impulsively she was going to tell him so and breathlessly happier than he had ever been before waited for it I did kill my husband They acquitted me but I was guilty It was an accident I was so afraid They would never have believed it could be an accident But I had to in self defence And now she had told him she loved him Only Dickie was too numb to recognise the form her confession of love had taken love as always was clamouring to be clearly seen naked if need be blood guilty if need be but seen and then swept up sin and all by another love big enough to accept this truth also as essentially part of her Ruth waited several seconds for Dickie to speak Then she got up and strolled over to the picture and said examining intently as though for the first time the woman in the doorway I m not sorry Dickie That is to say I m sorry of course if I ve shattered an illusion of yours but I can t be melodramatic you know not even to the extent of using the word murderess on myself If I hadn t killed Lucas He would have killed you So he was able to utter quite natural and coherent sounds Dickie was surprised Yes But Ruth found that after all she could not tell Dickie much about Lucas Lucas had not been a pleasant gentleman to live with and there were things that Dickie was too fine himself and too innocent to realise The only comprehension in this thoroughly well groomed atmosphere of soft carpets and dim silken panels and miniatures and rare frail china might have come from the woman in the doorway of that incongruous picture a woman sullenly patient brutalised but yes her man might quite easily have been another Lucas For that which Dickie had always thought of as mysterious elusive was to Ruth s eyes only sorrowful wisdom Come here Ruth She dragged her eyes away from the picture crossed the room broke down completely her head on his knees her shuddering body crouched closely to the floor When you ve been frightened and have to live with it and it doesn t even stop at night for weeks and months and years one s nerves aren t quite reliable They ve no right to call that murder have they have they Dickie When you ve been afraid for a long time and there s no one you can tell about it except the person who makes the fear But Dickie was all that she had perilously dared to hope he would be at this crisis He soothed her and healed her by his loyalty promised without her extorting it that he would never tell a soul what she had just told him pixie shy yet he spoke of his personal need of her and more than anything else she had desired to hear this He mentioned some trivial intimate plans for their unbroken unchanged future together so as to reassure her of its continuance He even made her laugh In fact for a last appearance in the role of a gallant little gentleman Dickie did not do so badly He woke in the night from a bad dream with terror clinging thickly about his senses But it did not slowly dissolve and release him as nightmare is wont to do It remained so that he lay still as a man in his winding sheet afraid to move remembering I did kill my husband Yes that was it In the room with him was a strange woman who had killed her husband Not Ruth but a strange woman How had she got into the room with him She had killed her husband And now he was her husband He lay motionless but his imagination began to crawl What might happen to a man shut up alone in a house with a woman who murdered His imagination began to race and he lost control of it Murder with dry sandy throat and a kicking heart Dickie had to pay for his audacity in imagining he was big enough to claim life in the raw Not big enough Not big enough the goblins of the underworld croaked at him in triumphant chorus They capered they snapped their fingers at him they spun him down to where fear was he had delivered himself to them by not being big enough missus Bigger had a baby which was bigger missus Bigger or the baby The silly conundrum sprang at him from goodness knows what void and over and over again he repeated it to himself trying to remember the answer trying to forget fear missus Bigger had a baby He dared not fall asleep with the woman who had killed her husband alone in the room with him alone in the house with him A stir from the other bed and one arm flung out in sleep Dickie s knees jerked violently his skin went cold and sticky with sweat You fool it s only Ruth But she did it she did it once There are people who can t kill and a few just a very few who can And because they can they are different and have to be shut away from the herd But but this woman They ve made a ghastly mistake they ve let her go free and I can t tell anyone nobody knows except me and Ruth Ah yes a quivering sigh of relief here Ruth knows too Ruth my wife ruth means pity There is no Ruth there never was quite alone except for a strange strange woman the kind that gets shut away and kept by herself To this bondage had Dickie s nerves delivered him The custom of punctilious courtesy so deeply ingrained as to mean in his case the impossibility of wounding another decreed that some pretence must be kept up before Ruth But with one shock she divined the next morning the significant change in him and bowed her head to it What could she do She loved him but she had overrated the capacity of his spirit There had never been any courage only kindness and sweetness and chivalry all no good to him now that courage was wanted She had made a mistake in telling him the truth Suffering she thought she had suffered fiercely with Lucas she thought she had suffered while she was being ignominiously tried for her life but what were either of these phases compared with the helpless bitterness of seeing Dickie whom she loved afraid of her Even her periodic fits of wild arrogant passion which usually when they surged past restraint wrecked and altered whatever situation was hemming her in and left gaps for a passage through to something else even these had now to be curbed Useful in hate they were impotent in love So Ruth recognised in her new humility But when one day seized by panic at having spoken irritably to her Dickie hastily tried to propitiate her to ingratiate himself so that she might spare him might let him live a little longer then Ruth felt she must cry aloud under the strain of this subtle torture Why he was her lover her man her child In thought her arm shaped itself into a crook for his head to lie there her fingers smoothed out the drawn perplexity of his brows her kisses were cool as snow on his hot twitching little mouth her voice hushed to a lullaby croon promised him that nobody should hurt him nobody while she was there to heal and protect Sleep baby sleep The hills are white with sheep Over and over again she lulled herself with the old rhyme for comfort s sake But Dickie she could not comfort since irony of ironies she was the cause of his pitiful breakdown Why if she spoke he started if she moved towards him he shrank Yet still Ruth dreamt that if he would only let her touch him she could bring him reassurance But meanwhile his appetite was meagre the rare half hours he slept were broken with evil dreams from which he awoke whimpering He did not care any more about the little beautiful things he had collected and grouped about him but sat for hours listless and blank his appearance a grotesque parody of the trim and dapper Dickie Maybury of the past what could it matter how he looked with death slicing so close to him The master seems poorly of late don t he ma am His digestion ain t strong P r aps something as disagreed with im Thus missus Derrick taking her part in the drama as the simple character who makes speeches of more significant portent than she is aware of Something had indeed disagreed with Dickie In the slang phrase He had bitten off more than he could chew And the goblins were hunting him whispering how she would creep up to him stealthily from behind this woman who killed and put her arms round him and put her fingers to his throat that was one way Other ways there were of course He must learn about them all so as to be watchful and prepared Self defence accident Of course they always said it was accident He knew that now for the evening crime sheets began to appear in the flat again and Dickie studied them in place of the villanelles the graceful essays the belles lettres of his former choice Ruth saw him with his delicate shaking hands clutching the newspapers his mild eyes bright with sordid fascination He was ill certainly and brain sick and oppressed and she yearned for his illness to show itself a tangible serious matter a matter of bed and doctor and complete prostration and unwearied effort on the part of his nurse My darling my darling He did everything for me when I most needed it And now I can do nothing It isn t fair She stood by one of the open windows of the pretty Watteau sitting room The lamps had just sprung to fiery stars in the blue glamorous twilight of the square the fragrance of wet lilac blew up to her and a blackbird among the bushes began to sing like mad the fist which was cruelly squeezing Ruth s spirit seemed slowly to unclench and suddenly it struck her that things might be made worth while again for her and Dickie After all how insane it was for him to be huddling miserably as she knew he would be in the arm chair of his study gazing with forlorn eyes at the squalid columns which it had grown too dark for him to decipher She had a vision of what this very evening might yet hold of recovered magic if only she had the courage to carry out her simple cure of his head drawn down on to her left breast just where her heart was beating Dickie it s all right you know it s only Ruth I You ve been sitting with your bogies all the time the white lilac has been coming out A faint smile lay at last on Ruth s mouth and in the curve of her tired eyelids She went softly into the study The door was open Dickie sprang to his feet with a yell of terror as her hands came round his neck from behind He clutched at the revolver in his pocket and fired at random backwards In the wall behind them was the round dark mark of a merciful bullet And Dickie oh Dickie when you ve been frightened and have to live with it and it doesn t even stop at nights do you understand now how it happens They ve no right to call that murder have they Dickie And now indeed understanding that the awful act of killing could be in a rare once or twice a human accident for the frightened little human to commit understanding Dickie was shocked back to sanity Dear dear Ruth Why this stranger woman was no stranger after all but Ruth his own sweet wife Dickie was tired and he knew he need not explain things to her He laid his head down on her left breast just where the heart was beating THE WOMAN WHO SAT STILL By PARRY TRUSCOTT From Colour nineteen twenty two When he went when he had to go he took with him the memory of her that had become crystallised set for him in his own frequent words to her standing at her side looking down at her with his keen restless eyes such words as It puzzles me how on earth you manage to sit so still Then enlarging It is wonderful to me how you can keep so happy doing nothing make of enforced idleness a positive pleasure I suppose it is a gift and I haven t got it not a bit It doesn t matter how tired I am I have to keep going people call it industry but its real name is nervous energy run riot I can t even take a holiday peacefully I must be actively playing if I cannot work I m just the direct descendant of the girl in the red shoes they were red weren t they who had to dance on and on until she dropped I shall go on and on until I drop and then I shall attempt a few more useless yards on all fours Come now in answer to the way she shook her head at him smiled at him from her sofa you know very well how I envy you your gift your power of sitting still happily still your power of contemplation And one day more intimately still with a sigh and a look Oh a look she understood To me you are the most restful person in the world Why he went except that he had to go why he stayed away so long so very long are not really relevant to this story the facts stripped of conjecture were simply these she was married and he was not and there came the time as it always comes in such relationships as theirs when he had to choose between staying without honour and going quickly He went But even the bare facts concerning his protracted absence are less easily stated because his absence dragged on long after the period when he might with impeccable honour have returned The likeliest solution was that setting her aside when he had to served so to cut in two his life so wrenched at his heartstrings so burnt and bruised his spirit that when in his active fashion he had lived some of the hurt down he could not bring himself easily to reopen the old subject fresh wounds for him might still lurk in it how could he tell Although it had been at the call the insistence of honour still hadn t he left her deserted her Does any woman even his own appointed woman forgive a man who goes speechless away Useless useless speculation For some reason some man s reason when another s death made her a free woman yet he lingered and did not come He knew afterwards that it was from the first his intention to claim her He wanted her deep down he wanted her as he had always wanted her meant to come some time Knew all the time that he could not always keep away And then responding to a sudden whim some turn of his quickly moving mind a mind that could forcibly bury a subject and as forcibly resurrect it hot foot and eager he came He had left her recovering slowly and surely from a long illness an illness that must have proved fatal but for her gift of tranquillity her great gift of keeping absolutely restfully still in body while retaining a happily occupied mind Her books and her big quiet room and the glimpse of the flower decked garden from her window with just these things to help her she had dug herself into the deep heart of life where the wells of contentment spring Bird s song in the early morn and the long still day before her in which to find herself to take a new firmer hold on the hidden strength of the world And just to keep her in touch with the surface of things visits from her friends Then later more tightly gripping actuality with a new keen sharp growing pleasure the visits of a friend While those lasted there was nothing she would have changed for her quiet room her sofa the room that he lit with his coming where she rested and rested shut in with the memory of all he said looked thought in her presence until again he came While they lasted She had been content never strong never able to do very much with seclusion before During the time of his visits she revelled rejoiced in it asking nothing further While they lasted sitting still Oh so still hugging her joy she didn t think wouldn t think how it might end Sometimes just sometimes by a merciful providence things do not end She lived for months on the bare chance of its not ending Yet as we know the end came At first while the world called her widowed she sat with her unwidowed heart waiting for him in the old room in the old way Surely now he would come She had given good measure of fondness and duty and friendship that was only that under another name to the one who until now had stood between her and her heart s desire and parting with him and all the associations that went with him had surprisingly hurt her Always frail she was ill torn with sorrow and pity and then very slowly again she recovered And while she recovered lying still in the old way she gave her heart wings wild surging wings at last at last Sped it forth forth to bring her joy to compel it While she waited in this fashion a sweet recaptured sense of familiarity made his coming seem imminent She had only to wait and he would be here She couldn t have mistaken the looks that had never been translated into words that hadn t needed words Though she had longed and ached for a word then she was quite content now He had wanted her just as she was unashamed and untainted And to preserve her as she was he had gone away And now for the very first time she was truly glad he had gone in that abrupt speechless fashion in spite of the heartache and the long years between them really and truly glad Nothing had been spoilt they had snatched at no stolen joys And the rapture what rapture of meeting would blot out all that they had suffered in silence the separation all of it As she waited getting well for him she had no regrets growing more and more sure of his coming It was not until she was well again not until the months had piled themselves on each other that growing more frightened than she knew she began her new work of preparation Suddenly impulsively when she had reached the stage of giving him up for days at a time when hope had nearly abandoned her then he came He had left a woman so hopeful in outlook so young and peaceful in spirit that with her the advancing years would not matter On his journey back to her visualising her afresh touching up his memory of her he pictured her going a little grey That would suit her grey was her colour blending to lavender in the clothes she always wore for him A little grey but her clear pale skin unfaded her large eyes full of pure guarded secrets secrets soon to unfold for him alone A haven a haven So he thought of her and now ready for her coming to her he craved the rest she would give him rest more than anything in all the world She with her sweet white hands when he held them kissed them would unlock the doors of peace for him drawing him into her life letting him potter and linger linger at her side Even when long ago he had insisted to her that for him there was no way of rest he had known that she just she meant rest for him when he could claim her for his own Other women other pursuits offered him excitement stimulation and then a weariness too profound for words But rest bodily spiritually was her unique gift for him She he smiled as he thought it would teach him to sit still And tired so tired he hurried to her across the world as fast as he could go Waiting at her door the door opened crossing the threshold Oh he had never thought his luck would be so great as to be taken direct to the well remembered room upstairs Yet with only a few short inquiries he was taken there she for whom he asked the mistress of the house would be in her sitting room he was told and if he was an old friend He explained that he was a very old friend following the maid upstairs But the maid was mistaken her mistress was not in her private sitting room not in the house at all she had gone out and it proved on investigation that she had left no word The maid returning suggested however that she would not be long Her mistress had a meeting this evening she was expecting some one before dinner no she would certainly not be long so so if he would like to wait He elected to wait a little impatiently He knew it was absurd that coming without warning after how many years was it he should yet have made so sure of finding her at home Absurd unreasonable and yet he was disappointed He ought to have written but he had not waited to write He had pictured the meeting how many times Times without number and always pictured her waiting at home And then the room Left alone in it he paced the room But the room enshrined in his heart of hearts was not this room Was there surely there was some mistake There could be no mistake There could not be two upstairs rooms in this comparatively small house of this size and with this aspect westward and overlooking with two large windows the little walled garden into which he had so often gazed standing and talking to her saying over his shoulders the things he dare not say face to face that would have meant so much more helped out with look and gesture face to face The garden as far as he could see was the same except that he fancied it less trim less perfect in order in the old days it would be for months at a time all the outside world she saw there had been object enough in keeping it trim Now it looked to his fancy like a woman whose beauty was fading a little because she had lost incentive to be beautiful He turned from the garden his heart amazed fearful back to the room The room of the old days with closed eyes he reproduced it its white walls its few good pictures its curtains and carpet of deep blue Her sofa by the window the wide armchair on which he always sat the table where in and out of season roses his roses stood The little old gilt clock on the mantlepiece that so quickly cruelly ticked away their hour Books books everywhere the most important journals and a medley of the lighter magazines those with her work basket proving her feminine and the range of her interests her inconsistency A woman s room revealing at a glance her individuality her spirit But this room He looked for the familiar things the sofa the bookshelves the little table dedicated to flowers Yes the sofa was there but pushed away as though seldom used on the bookshelves new strange books were crowding out the old on the little table drooped a few faded flowers in an awkward vase On the mantlepiece where she would never have more than one or two good ornaments and the old gilt clock were now stacks of papers a rack bulging with packing materials something like that an ink bottle a candlestick the candle trailed over with sealing wax and an untidy ball of string And right in the centre of the room a great clumsy writing table an office table piled with papers again ledgers a portable typewriter and a litter of cigarette ends Like a Mistress on the track of a much doubted maid he ran his finger along the edge of a bookcase and then the mantlepiece He looked at his fingers there was no denying the dust he had wiped away She must have changed her room why had she done it But the maid had said in her sitting room He waited now frightened now fuming Still she did not come Should he not wait should he go if this was her room But he had come so far and he needed her so he must stay For some dear foolish woman s reason she must have lent her room for the use of a feminine busy body a political higher thought pseudo spiritualistic friend He must weed out her friends The trend of the work done in this room now his quick mind had seized upon titles of books papers it was enough Notices stuck in the Venetian Mirror the desecration for meetings of this and that society and all of them so he judged just excuses for putting unwanted fingers into unwanted dangerous pies He thought of it like that he could not help it he saw too far into motive and internal action was too impatient of the little storms the paltry tea cup things She with her unique gift of serenity her place was not among the busybodies grinding axes that were better blunt interfering with the slow slow working of the Mills of God Her gift was example rare and delicate her light the silver light of a soul that through suffering and patience and contemplation knows itself and is unafraid For such fussing unstable work as it was used for now she ought not even to have lent her room the room he had looked on as a temple of quietness the shrine of a priceless temperament He smiled his first smile she should not lend it again Then the door opened Suddenly almost noisily she came in She had heard downstairs his name So far she was prepared with her greeting She came with hands out stretched he took her hands and dropped them When he could interrupt her greeting he said forcing the words So now you are quite strong and busy She told him how busy She told him how but not why she had awakened from her long selfish dream She said she had found so late but surely not too late the joy of action constant unremitting work for the world s sake Do you remember how you used to complain you couldn t sit still I am like that now And he listened listened each word a deeper stab straight at his defenceless heart Of all the many things he had done since they met he had nothing to say Having just let her talk how she talked as soon as he decently could he went Of all he had come to tell her he said not a word Tired so bitterly tired he had come seeking rest and now there was no more a place of rest for him anywhere Yes he had come across the world to find himself overdue to find himself too late He went out again as soon as he decently could taking only a picture of her that in sixty over charged minutes had wiped out the treasured picture of years Sixty minutes After waiting for years she had kept him an hour desperately by sheer force of will keeping a man too stunned at first to resist to break free Then at last he broke free of that room and that woman and went For years he had pictured her sitting still as no other woman sat still tranquil and graceful her hair going a little grey above her clear pale skin her eyes of a dream ridden saint And now he must picture her forced into life vivaciously restlessly eager full of plans futile plans how he knew those plans for the world s upheaval adding unrest to unrest And now he must picture her with the grey hair outwitted by art with paint on her beautiful ravaged face At first he had wanted to take her in his arms with his strength to still her with his tears to wash the paint off But he couldn t he couldn t He knew that his had been a dream of such supreme sweetness that to awaken was an agony he could never hide knew that you can t re enter dreamland once you wake So he went He never knew with the door shut on him how she fell on her sofa her vivacity quenched her soul spent He never knew that having failed as she thought to draw him to her with what she was she had vainly foolishly tried a new model himself He did not know how inartistic love can be when love is desperate MAJOR WILBRAHAM By HUGH WALPOLE From The Chicago Tribune nineteen twenty one I am quite aware that in giving you this story just as I was told it I shall incur the charge of downright and deliberate lying Especially I shall be told this by any one who knew Wilbraham personally Wilbraham was not of course his real name but I think that there are certain people who will recognize him from this description of him I do not know that it matters very much if they do Wilbraham himself would certainly not mind did he know Does he know It was the thing above all that he wanted those last hours before he died that I should pass on my conviction of the truth of what he told me to others What he did not know was that I was not convinced How could I be But when the whole comfort of his last hours hung on the simple fact that I was of course I pretended to the best of my poor ability I would have done more than that to make him happy It is precisely the people who knew him well who will declare at once that my little story is impossible But did they know him well Does any one know any one else well Aren t we all as lonely and removed from one another as mariners on separate desert islands In any case I did not know him well and perhaps for that very reason was not so greatly surprised at his amazing revelations surprised at the revelations themselves of course but not at his telling them There was always in him and I have known him here and there loosely in club and London fashion for nearly twenty years something romantic and something sentimental I knew that because it was precisely those two attributes that he drew out of me Most men are conscious at some time in their lives of having felt for a member of their own sex an emotion that is something more than simple companionship It is a queer feeling quite unlike any other in life distinctly romantic and the more that perhaps for having no sex feeling in it Like the love of women it is felt generally at sight but unlike that love it is I think a supremely unselfish emotion It is not acquisitive nor possessive nor jealous and exists best perhaps when it is not urged too severely but is allowed to linger in the background of life giving real happiness and security and trust standing out indeed as something curiously reliable just because it is so little passionate This emotion has an odd place in our English life because the men who feel it if they have been to public school and university have served a long training in repressing every sign or expression of sentiment towards any other man nevertheless it persists romantically and deeply persists and the war of nineteen fourteen offered many curious examples of it Wilbraham roused just that feeling in me I remember with the utmost distinctness my first meeting with him It was just after the Boer war and old Johnny Beaminster gave a dinner party to some men pals of his at the Phoenix Johnny was not so old then none of us were it was a short time after the death of that old harpy the Duchess of Wrexe and some wag said that the dinner was in celebration of that happy occasion Johnny was not so ungracious as that but he gave us a very merry evening and he did undoubtedly feel a kind of lightness in the general air There were about fifteen of us and Wilbraham was the only man present I d never seen before He was only a captain then and neither so red faced nor so stout as he afterwards became He was pretty bulky though even then and with his sandy hair cropped close his staring blue eyes his toothbrush moustache and sharp alert movements looked the typical traditional British officer There was nothing at all to distinguish him from a thousand other officers of his kind and yet from the moment I saw him I had some especial and personal feeling about him He was not in type at all the man to whom at that time I should have felt drawn My first book had just been published and although as I now perceive its publication had not caused the slightest ripple upon any water the congratulations of my friends and relations who felt compelled poor things to say something because they had received copies from the author had made me feel that the literary world was all buzzing at my ears I could see at a glance that Kipling was probably the only decent author about whom Wilbraham knew anything and the fragments of his conversation that I caught did not promise anything intellectually exciting from his acquaintanceship The fact remains that I wanted to know him more than any other man in the room and although I only exchanged a few words with him that night I thought of him for quite a long time afterwards It did not follow from this as it ought to have done that we became great friends That we never were although it was myself whom he sent for three days before his death to tell me his queer little story It was then at the very last that he confided to me that he too had felt something at our first meeting different to what one generally feels that he had always wanted to turn our acquaintance into friendship and had been too shy I also was shy and so we missed one another as I suppose in this funny constrained traditional country of ours thousands of people miss one another every day But although I did not see him very often and was in no way intimate with him I kept my ears open for any account of his doings From one point of view the Club Window outlook he was a very usual figure one of those stout rubicund jolly men a good polo player a good man in a house party genial natured and none too brilliantly brained whom every one liked and no one thought about All this he was on one side of the report but on the other there were certain stories that were something more than the ordinary Wilbraham was obviously a sentimentalist and an enthusiast there was the extraordinary case shortly after I first met him of his championship of X a man who had been caught in an especially bestial kind of crime and received a year s imprisonment for it On X leaving prison Wilbraham championed and defended him put him up for months in his rooms in Duke Street walked as often as possible in his company down Piccadilly and took him over to Paris It says a great deal for Wilbraham s accepted normality and his general popularity that this championship of X did him no harm It was so obvious that he himself was the last man in the world to be afflicted with X s peculiar habits Some men it is true did murmur something about birds of a feather one or two kind friends warned Wilbraham in the way kind friends have and to them he simply said If a feller s a pal he s a pal All this might in the end have done Wilbraham harm had not X most happily committed suicide in Paris in nineteen oh five There followed a year or two later the much more celebrated business of Lady C I need not go into all that now but here again Wilbraham constituted himself her defender although she robbed cheated and maligned him as she robbed cheated and maligned every one who was good to her It was quite obvious that he was not in love with her the obviousness of it was one of the things in him that annoyed her He simply felt apparently that she had been badly treated the very last thing that she had been gave her any money he had put his rooms at the disposal of herself and her friends and as I have said championed her everywhere This affair did very nearly finish him socially and in his regiment It was not so much that they minded his caring for Lady C after all any man can be fooled by any woman but it was Lady C s friends who made the whole thing so impossible Such a crew Such a horrible crew And it was a queer thing to see Wilbraham with his straight blue eyes and innocent mouth and general air of amiable simplicity in the company of men like Colonel B and young Kenneth Parr There is no harm considering the later publicity of his case in mentioning his name Well that affair luckily came to an end just in time Lady C disappeared to Berlin and was no more seen There were other cases into which I need not go when Wilbraham was seen in strange company always championing somebody who was not worth the championing He had no social tact and for them at any rate no moral sense In himself he was the ordinary normal man about town no prude but straight as a man can be in his debts his love affairs his friendships and his sport Then came the war He did brilliantly at Mons was wounded twice went out to Gallipoli had a touch of Palestine and returned to France again to share in Foch s final triumph No man can possibly have had more of the war than he had and it is my own belief that he had just a little too much of it He had been always perhaps a little queer as we are most of us queer somewhere and the horrors of that horrible war undoubtedly affected him Finally he lost just a week before the armistice one of his best friends Ross McLean a loss from which he certainly never recovered I have now I think brought together all the incidents that can throw any kind of light upon the final scene In the middle of nineteen nineteen he retired from the army and it was from this time to his death that I saw something of him He went back to his old home at Horton s in Duke street and as I was living at that time in Marlborough Chambers in Jermyn street we were in easy reach of one another The early part of nineteen twenty was a queer time People had become I imagine pretty well accustomed to realizing that those two wonderful hours of Armistice day had not ushered in the millennium any more than those first marvellous moments of the Russian revolution produced it Every one has always hoped for the millennium but the trouble since the days of Adam and Eve has always been that people have such different ideas as to what exactly that millennium shall be The plain facts of the matter simply were that during nineteen nineteen and nineteen twenty the world changed from a war of nations to a war of classes that inevitable change that history has always shown follows on great wars As no one ever reads history it was natural enough that there should be a great deal of disappointment and a great deal of astonishment Men at the head of affairs who ought to have known better cried aloud How ungrateful these people are after all we ve done for them and the people underneath shouted that everything had been muddled and spoiled and that they would have done much better had they been at the head of affairs an assertion for which there was no sort of justification Wilbraham being a sentimentalist and an idealist suffered more from this general disappointment than most people He had had wonderful relations with the men under him throughout the war He had never tired of recounting how marvelously they had behaved what heroes they were and that it was they who would pull the country together At the same time he had a naive horror of bolshevism and anything unconstitutional and he watched the transformation of his brave lads into discontented and idle workmen with dismay and deep distress He used sometimes to come around to my rooms and talk to me he had the bewildered air of a man walking in his sleep He made the fatal mistake of reading all the papers and he took in the Daily Herald in order that he might see what it was these fellows had to say for themselves The Herald upset him terribly Its bland assumption that Russians and Sein Feiners could do no wrong but that the slightest sign of assertion of authority on the part of any government was wicked tyranny shocked his very soul I remember that he wrote a long most earnest letter to Lansbury pointing out to him that if he subverted all authority and constitutional government his own party would in its turn be subverted when it came to govern Of course he received no answer During these months I came to love the man The attraction that I had felt for him from the very first deeply underlay all my relation to him but as I saw more of him I found many very positive reasons for my liking He was the simplest bravest purest most loyal and most unselfish soul alive He seemed to me to have no faults at all unless it were a certain softness towards the wishes of those whom he loved He could not bear to hurt anybody but he never hesitated if some principle in which he believed was called in question He had not of course a subtle mind he was no analyst of character but that did not make him uninteresting I never heard any one call him dull company although men laughed at him for his good nature and unselfishness and traded on him all the time He was the best human being I have ever known or am ever likely to know Well the crisis arrived with astonishing suddenness About the second or third of August I went down to stay with some friends at the little fishing village of Rafiel in Glebeshire I saw him just before I left London and he told me that he was going to stay in London for the first half of August that he liked London in August even though his club would be closed and Horton s delivered over to the painters I heard nothing about him for a fortnight and then I received a most extraordinary letter from Box Hamilton a fellow clubman of mine and Wilbraham s Had I heard he said that poor old Wilbraham had gone right off his knocker Nobody knew exactly what had happened but suddenly one day at lunch time Wilbraham had turned up at Grey s the club to which our own club was a visitor during its cleaning had harangued every one about religion in the most extraordinary way had burst out from there and started shouting in Piccadilly had after collecting a crowd disappeared and not been seen until the next morning when he had been found nearly killed after a hand to hand fight with the market men in Covent Garden It may be imagined how deeply this disturbed me especially as I felt that I was myself to blame I had noticed that Wilbraham was ill when I had seen him in London and I should either have persuaded him to come with me to Glebeshire or stayed with him in London I was just about to pack up and go to town when I received a letter from a doctor in a nursing home in South Audley street saying that a certain Major Wilbraham was in the home dying and asking persistently for myself I took a motor to Drymouth and was in London by five o clock I found the South Audley Street nursing home and was at once surrounded with the hush the shaded rooms the scents of medicine and flowers and some undefinable cleanliness that belongs to those places I waited in a little room the walls decorated with sporting prints the green baize table gloomily laden with volumes of Punch and the Tatler Wilbraham s doctor came in to see me a dapper smart little man efficient and impersonal He told me that Wilbraham had at most only twenty four hours to live that his brain was quite clear and that he was suffering very little pain that he had been brutally kicked in the stomach by some man in the Covent Garden crowd and had there received the internal injuries from which he was now dying His brain is quite clear the doctor said Let him talk It can do him no harm Nothing can save him His head is full of queer fancies he wants every one to listen to him He s worrying because there s some message he wants to send he wants to give it to you When I saw Wilbraham he was so little changed that I felt no shock Indeed the most striking change in him was the almost exultant happiness in his voice and eyes It is true that after talking to him a little I knew that he was dying He had that strange peace and tranquillity of mind that one saw so often with dying men in the war I will try to give an exact account of Wilbraham s narrative nothing else is of importance in this little story but that narrative I can make no comment I have no wish to do so I only want to pass it on as he begged me to do If you don t believe me he said give other people the chance of doing so I know that I am dying I want as many men and women to have a chance of judging this as is humanly possible I swear to you that I am telling the truth and the exact truth in every detail I began my account by saying that I was not convinced How could I be convinced At the same time I have none of those explanations with which people are so generously forthcoming on these occasions I can only say that I do not think Wilbraham was insane nor drunk nor asleep Nor do I believe that some one played a practical joke Whether Wilbraham was insane between the hours when his visitor left him and his entrance into the nursing home I must leave to my readers I myself think he was not After all everything depends upon the relative importance that we place upon ambitions possessions emotions ideas Something suddenly became of so desperate an importance to Wilbraham that nothing else at all mattered He wanted every one else to see the importance of it as he did That is all It had been a hot and oppressive day London had seemed torrid and uncomfortable The mere fact that Oxford street was up annoyed him After a slight meal in his flat he went to the Promenade Concert at Queen s Hall It was the second night of the season Monday night Wagner night He bought himself a five shilling ticket and sat in the middle of the balcony overlooking the floor He was annoyed again when he discovered that he had been given a ticket for the non smoking section of the balcony He had heard no Wagner since August nineteen fourteen and was anxious to discover the effect that hearing it again would have upon him The effect was disappointing The music neither caught nor held him The Meistersinger had always been a great opera for him The third act music that Sir Henry Wood gave to him didn t touch him anywhere He also discovered that six years abstinence had not enraptured him any more deeply with the rushing fiddles in the Tannhaeuser Overture nor with the spinning music in the Flying Dutchman Then came suddenly the prelude to the third act of Tristan That caught him the peace and tranquillity that he needed lapped him round he was fully satisfied and could have listened for another hour He walked home down Regent Street the quiet melancholy of the shepherd s pipe accompanying him pleasing him and tranquillizing him As he reached his flat ten o clock struck from saint James Church He asked the porter whether any one had wanted him during his absence whether any one was waiting for him now some friend had told him that he might come up and use his spare room one night that week No no one had been There was no one there waiting Great was his surprise therefore when opening the door of his flat he found some one standing there one hand resting on the table his face turned towards the open door Stronger however than Wilbraham s surprise was his immediate conviction that he knew his visitor well and this was curious because the face was undoubtedly strange to him I beg your pardon Wilbraham said to him hesitating I wanted to see you the Stranger said smiling When Wilbraham was telling me this part of his story he seemed to be enveloped enveloped is the word that best conveys my own experience of him by some quite radiant happiness He smiled at me confidentially as though he were telling me something that I had experienced with him and that must give me the same happiness that it gave to him Ought I to have expected Ought I to have known he stammered No you couldn t have known the Stranger answered You re not late I knew when you would come Wilbraham told me that during these moments he was surrendering himself to an emotion and intimacy and companionship that was the most wonderful thing that he had ever known It was that intimacy and companionship he told me for which all his days he had been searching It was the one thing that life never seemed to give even in the greatest love the deepest friendship there was that seed of loneliness hidden He had never found it in man or woman Now it was so wonderful that the first thing he said was And now you re going to stay aren t you You won t go away at once Of course I ll stay he answered If you want me His Visitor was dressed in some dark suit there was nothing about Him in any way odd or unusual His Face was thin and pale His smile kindly His English was without accent His voice was soft and very melodious But Wilbraham could notice nothing but His Eyes they were the most beautiful tender gentle Eyes that he had ever seen in any human being They sat down Wilbraham s overwhelming fear was lest his Guest should leave him They began to talk and Wilbraham took it at once as accepted that his Friend knew all about him everything He found himself eagerly plunging into details of scenes episodes that he had long put behind him put behind him for shame perhaps or for regret or for sorrow He knew at once that there was nothing that he need veil nor hide nothing He had no sense that he must consider susceptibilities nor avoid self confession that was humiliating But he did find as he talked on a sense of shame from another side creep towards him and begin to enclose him Shame at the smallness meanness emptiness of the things that he declared He had had always behind his mistakes and sins a sense that he was a rather unusually interesting person if only his friends knew everything about him they would be surprised at the remarkable man that he really was Now it was exactly the opposite sense that came over him In the gold rimmed mirror that was over his mantlepiece he saw himself diminishing diminishing diminishing First himself large red faced smiling rotund lying back in his chair then the face shrivelling the limbs shortening then the face small and peaked the hands and legs little and mean then the chair enormous about and around the little trembling animal cowering against the cushion He sprang up No no I can t tell you any more and you ve known it all so long I am mean small nothing I have not even great ambition nothing His Guest stood up and put His Hand on his shoulder They talked standing side by side and He said some things that belonged to Wilbraham alone that he would not tell me Wilbraham asked Him why He had come and to him I will come now to a few of My friends He said First one and then another Many people have forgotten Me behind My words They have built up such a mountain over Me with the doctrines they have attributed to Me the things that they say that I did I am not really He said laughing His Hand on Wilbraham s shoulder so dull and gloomy and melancholy as they have made Me I loved Life I loved men I loved laughter and games and the open air I liked jokes and good food and exercise All things that they have forgotten So from now I shall come back to one or two I am lonely when they see Me so solemnly Another thing He said They are making life complicated now To lead a good life to be happy to manage the world only the simplest things are needed Love Unselfishness Tolerance Can I go with You and be with You always Wilbraham asked Do you really want that He said Yes said Wilbraham bowing his head Then you shall come and never leave Me again In three days from now Then he kissed Wilbraham on the forehead and went away I think that Wilbraham himself became conscious as he told me this part of his story of the difference between the seen and remembered Figure and the foolish inadequate reported words Even now as I repeat a little of what Wilbraham said I feel the virtue and power slipping away And so it goes on As the Figure recedes the words become colder and colder and the air that surrounds them has in it less and less of power But on that day when I sat beside Wilbraham s bed the conviction in his voice and eyes held me so that although my reason kept me back my heart told me that he had been in contact with some power that was a stronger force than anything that I myself had ever known But I have determined to make no personal comment on this story I am here simply as a narrator of fact Wilbraham told me that after his Visitor left him he sat there for some time in a dream Then he sat up startled as though some voice calling had wakened him with an impulse that was like a fire suddenly blazing up and lighting the dark places of his brain I imagine that all Wilbraham s impulses in the past chivalric idealistic foolish had been of that kind sudden of an almost ferocious energy and determination blind to all consequences He must go out at once and tell every one of what had happened to him I once read a story somewhere about some town that was expecting a great visitor Everything was ready the banners hanging the music prepared the crowds waiting in the street A man who had once been for some years at the court of the expected visitor saw him enter the city sombrely clad on foot Meanwhile his Chamberlain entered the town in full panoply with the trumpets blowing and many riders in attendance The man who knew the real thing ran to every one telling the truth but they laughed at him and refused to listen And the real king departed quietly as he had come It was I suppose an influence of this kind that drove Wilbraham now Suddenly something was of so great an importance to him that nothing else mockery hostility scorn counted After all simply a supreme example of the other impulses that had swayed him throughout his life What followed might I think have been to some extent averted had his appearance been different London is a home of madmen and casually permits any lunacy so that public peace is not endangered had poor Wilbraham looked a fanatic with pale face long hair ragged clothes much would have been forgiven him but for a stout middle aged gentleman well dressed well groomed What could be supposed but insanity and insanity of a very ludicrous kind He put on his coat and went out From this moment his account was confused His mind as he spoke to me kept returning to that Visitor What happened after his Friend s departure was vague and uncertain to him largely because it was unimportant He does not know what time it was when he went out but I gather that it must have been about midnight There were still people in Piccadilly Somewhere near the Berkeley Hotel he stopped a gentleman and a lady He spoke I am sure so politely that the man he addressed must have supposed that he was asking for a match or an address or something of the kind Wilbraham told me that very quietly he asked the gentleman whether he might speak to him for a moment that he had something very important to say That he would not as a rule dream of interfering in any man s private affairs but that the importance of his communication outweighed all ordinary conventions that he expected that the gentleman had hitherto as had been his own case felt much doubt about religious questions but that now all doubt was once and forever over that I expect that at that fatal word Religion the gentleman started as though he had been stung by a snake felt that this mild looking man was a dangerous lunatic and tried to move away It was the lady with him so far as I can discover who cried out Oh poor man he s ill and wanted at once to do something for him By this time a crowd was beginning to collect and as the crowd closed around the central figures more people gathered upon the outskirts and peering through wondered what had happened whether there was an accident whether it were a drunk whether there had been a quarrel and so on Wilbraham I fancy began to address them all telling them his great news begging them with desperate urgency to believe him Some laughed some stared in wide eyed wonder the crowd was increasing and then of course the inevitable policeman with his move on please appeared How deeply I regret that Wilbraham was not there and then arrested He would be alive and with us now if that had been done But the policeman hesitated I suppose to arrest any one as obviously a gentleman as Wilbraham a man too as he soon perceived who was perfectly sober even though he was not in his right mind Wilbraham was surprised at the policeman s interference He said that the last thing that he wished to do was to create any disturbance but that he could not bear to let all these people go to their beds without giving them a chance of realizing first that everything was now altered that he had the most wonderful news The crowd was dispersed and Wilbraham found himself walking alone with the policeman beside the Green Park He must have been a very nice policeman because before Wilbraham s death he called at the Nursing Home and was very anxious to know how the poor gentleman was getting on He allowed Wilbraham to talk to him and then did all he could to persuade him to walk home and go to bed He offered to get him a taxi Wilbraham thanked him said he would do so and bade him good night and the policeman seeing that Wilbraham was perfectly composed and sober left him After that the narrative is more confused Wilbraham apparently walked down Knightsbridge and arrived at last somewhere near the Albert Hall He must have spoken to a number of different people One man a politician apparently was with him for a considerable time but only because he was so anxious to emphasise his own views about the Coalition Government and the wickedness of Lloyd George Another was a journalist who continued with him for a while because he scented a story for his newspaper Some people may remember that there was a garbled paragraph about a Religious Army Officer in the Daily Record One lady thought that Wilbraham wanted to go home with her and was both angry and relieved when she found that it was not so He stayed at a cabman s shelter for a time and drank a cup of coffee and told the little gathering there his news They took it very calmly They had met so many queer things in their time that nothing seemed odd to them His account becomes clearer again when he found himself a little before dawn in the park and in the company of a woman and a broken down pugilist I saw both these persons afterwards and had some talk with them The pugilist had only the vaguest sense of what had happened Wilbraham was a proper old bird and had given him half a crown to get his breakfast with They had all slept together under a tree and he had made some rather voluble protests because the other two would talk so continuously and prevented his sleeping It was a warm night and the sun had come up behind the trees surprisin quick He had liked the old boy especially as he had given him half a crown The woman was another story She was quiet and reserved dressed in black with a neat little black hat with a green feather in it She had yellow fluffy hair and bright childish blue eyes and a simple innocent expression She spoke very softly and almost in a whisper So far as I could discover she could see nothing odd in Wilbraham nor in anything that he had said She was the one person in all the world who had understood him completely and found nothing out of the way in his talk She had liked him at once she said I could see that he was kind she added earnestly as though to her that was the most important thing in all the world No his talk had not seemed odd to her She had believed every word that he had said Why not You could not look at him and not believe what he said Of course it was true And why not What was there against it It had been a great help for her what the gentleman had told her Yes and he had gone to sleep with his head in her lap and she had stayed awake all night thinking and he had waked up just in time to see the sun rise Some sunrise that was too That was a curious little fact that all three of them even the battered pugilist should have been so deeply struck by that sunrise Wilbraham on the last day of his life when he hovered between consciousness and unconsciousness kept recalling it as though it had been a vision The sun and the trees suddenly green and bright like glittering swords All shapes swords plowshares elephants and camels and the sky pale like ivory See now the sun is rushing up faster than ever to take us with him up up leaving the trees like green clouds beneath us far far beneath us The woman said that it was the finest sunrise she had ever seen He talked to her all the time about his plans He was looking disheveled now and unshaven and dirty She suggested that he should go back to his flat No he wished to waste no time Who knew how long he had got It might be only a day or two He would go to Covent Garden and talk to the men there She was confused as to what happened after that When they got to the market the carts were coming in and men were very busy She saw the gentleman speak to one of them very earnestly but he was busy and pushed him aside He spoke to another who told him to clear out Then he jumped on to a box and almost the last sight she had of him was his standing there in his soiled clothes a streak of mud on his face his arms outstretched and crying It s true Stop just a moment you must hear me Some one pushed him off the box The pugilist rushed in then cursing them and saying that the man was a gentleman and had given him half a crown and then some hulking great fellow fought the pugilist and there was a regular melee Wilbraham was in the middle of them was knocked down and trampled upon No one meant to hurt him I think They all seemed very sorry afterwards He died two days after being brought into the Nursing Home He was very happy just before he died pressed my hand and asked me to look after the girl Isn t it wonderful were his last words to me that it should be true after all As to Truth who knows Truth is a large order This is true as far as Wilbraham goes every word of it Beyond that Well it must be jolly to be so happy as Wilbraham was This will seem a lying story to some a silly and pointless story to others I wonder THE YEARBOOK OF THE BRITISH AND IRISH SHORT STORY JULY nineteen twenty one TO JUNE nineteen twenty two ABBREVIATIONS The following abbreviations are used in this
