31-121969-0000	train-other-500	He was perhaps in more respects than one all ears And these ears missus Caudle his lawful wedded wife as she would ever and anon impress upon him for she was not a woman to wear chains without shaking them
31-121969-0001	train-other-500	took whole and sole possession of They were her entire property as expressly made to convey to Caudle s brain the stream of wisdom that continually flowed from the lips of his wife
31-121969-0002	train-other-500	as was the tin funnel through which missus Caudle in vintage time bottled her elder wine There was however this difference between the wisdom and the wine The wine was always sugared
31-121969-0003	train-other-500	the wisdom never It was expressed crude from the heart of missus Caudle who doubtless trusted to the sweetness of her husband s disposition to make it agree with him
31-121969-0004	train-other-500	Philosophers have debated whether morning or night is most conducive to the strongest and clearest moral impressions The Grecian sage confessed that his labours smelt of the lamp
31-121969-0005	train-other-500	In like manner did missus Caudle s wisdom smell of the rushlight She knew that her husband was too much distracted by his business
none	none	 as toyman and doll merchant 
31-121969-0006	train-other-500	to digest her lessons in the broad day Besides she could never make sure of him he was always liable to be summoned to the shop Now
31-121969-0007	train-other-500	from eleven at night until seven in the morning there was no retreat for him He was compelled to lie and listen Perhaps there was little magnanimity in this on the part of missus Caudle
none	none	 but in marriage as in war it is permitted to take every advantage of the enemy 
31-121969-0008	train-other-500	Besides missus Caudle copied very ancient and classic authority
none	none	 Minerva s bird the very wisest thing in feathers is silent all the day 
31-121969-0009	train-other-500	So was missus Caudle Like the owl she hooted only at night mister Caudle was blessed with an indomitable constitution One fact will prove the truth of this
31-121969-0010	train-other-500	He lived thirty years with missus Caudle surviving her Yes it took thirty years for missus Caudle to lecture and dilate upon the joys griefs duties and vicissitudes comprised within that seemingly small circle
31-121969-0011	train-other-500	the wedding ring We say seemingly small for the thing as viewed by the vulgar naked eye is a tiny hoop made for the third feminine finger
31-121969-0012	train-other-500	Alack like the ring of Saturn for good or evil it circles a whole world Or to take a less gigantic figure it compasses a vast region it may be Arabia Felix
31-121969-0013	train-other-500	and it may be Arabia Petrea A lemon hearted cynic might liken the wedding ring to an ancient circus in which wild animals clawed one another for the sport of lookers on
31-121969-0014	train-other-500	Perish the hyperbole We would rather compare it to an elfin ring in which dancing fairies made the sweetest music for infirm humanity Manifold are the uses of rings
31-121969-0015	train-other-500	Even swine are tamed by them You will see a vagrant hilarious devastating porker a full blooded fellow that would bleed into many many fathoms of black pudding you will see him escaped from his proper home straying in a neighbour s garden
31-121969-0016	train-other-500	How he tramples upon the heart s ease how with quivering snout he roots up lilies odoriferous bulbs Here he gives a reckless snatch at thyme and marjoram and here he munches violets and gilly flowers
31-121969-0017	train-other-500	At length the marauder is detected seized by his owner and driven beaten home To make the porker less dangerous it is determined that he shall be RINGED The sentence is pronounced execution ordered
31-121969-0018	train-other-500	Listen to his screams Would you not think the knife was in his throat And yet they re only boring through his nose Hence for all future time the porker behaves himself with a sort of forced propriety
31-121969-0019	train-other-500	for in either nostril he carries a ring It is for the greatness of humanity a saddening thought that sometimes men must be treated no better than pigs
31-121969-0020	train-other-500	But mister Job Caudle was not of these men Marriage to him was not made a necessity No for him call it if you will a happy chance a golden accident It is however enough for us to know that he was married
31-121969-0021	train-other-500	and was therefore made the recipient of a wife s wisdom missus Caudle like Mahomet s dove continually pecked at the good man s ears and it is a happiness to learn from what he left behind
31-121969-0022	train-other-500	that he had hived all her sayings in his brain and further that he employed the mellow evening of his life to put such sayings down that in due season they might be enshrined in imperishable type
none	none	 When mister Job Caudle was left in this briary world without his daily guide and nocturnal monitress 
31-121969-0023	train-other-500	he was in the ripe fulness of fifty seven For three hours at least after he went to bed such slaves are we to habit he could not close an eye His wife still talked at his side
31-121969-0024	train-other-500	True it was she was dead and decently interred His mind it was a comfort to know it could not wander on this point this he knew Nevertheless his wife was with him
31-121969-0025	train-other-500	The Ghost of her Tongue still talked as in the life and again and again did Job Caudle hear the monitions of bygone years At times so loud so lively so real were the sounds that Job with a cold chill
31-121969-0026	train-other-500	doubted if he were really widowed And then with the movement of an arm a foot he would assure himself that he was alone in his holland Nevertheless the talk continued It was terrible to be thus haunted by a voice
31-121969-0027	train-other-500	to have advice commands remonstrance all sorts of saws and adages still poured upon him and no visible wife Now did the voice speak from the curtains now from the tester and now did it whisper to Job from the very pillow that he pressed
31-121969-0028	train-other-500	It s a dreadful thing that her tongue should walk in this manner said Job and then he thought confusedly of exorcism or at least of counsel from the parish priest
31-121969-0029	train-other-500	Whether Job followed his own brain or the wise direction of another we know not But he resolved every night to commit to paper one curtain lecture of his late wife
31-121969-0030	train-other-500	The employment would possibly lay the ghost that haunted him It was her dear tongue that cried for justice and when thus satisfied it might possibly rest in quiet And so it happened
31-121969-0031	train-other-500	Job faithfully chronicled all his late wife s lectures the ghost of her tongue was thenceforth silent and Job slept all his after nights in peace When Job died a small packet of papers was found inscribed as follows
31-121969-0032	train-other-500	Curtain Lectures delivered in the course of Thirty Years by missus Margaret Caudle and suffered by Job her Husband That mister Caudle had his eye upon the future printer is made pretty probable
31-121969-0033	train-other-500	by the fact that in most places he had affixed the text
none	none	 such text for the most part arising out of his own daily conduct to the lecture of the night He had also with an instinctive knowledge of the dignity of literature left a bank note of very fair amount with the manuscript Following our duty as editor we trust we have done justice to both documents LECTURE I mister CAUDLE HAS LENT FIVE POUNDS TO A FRIEND 
31-121970-0000	train-other-500	You ought to be very rich mister Caudle I wonder who d lend you five pounds But so it is a wife may work and may slave Ha dear the many things that might have been done with five pounds As if people picked up money in the street
31-121970-0001	train-other-500	But you always were a fool mister Caudle I ve wanted a black satin gown these three years and that five pounds would have entirely bought it But it s no matter how I go not at all Everybody says I don t dress as becomes your wife
31-121970-0002	train-other-500	and I don t but what s that to you mister Caudle Nothing Oh no you can have fine feelings for everybody but those belonging to you I wish people knew you as I do that s all You like to be called liberal and your poor family pays for it
31-121970-0003	train-other-500	All the girls want bonnets and where they re to come from I can t tell Half five pounds would have bought em but now they must go without
none	none	 Of course THEY belong to you and anybody but your own flesh and body mister Caudle The man called for the water rate to day but I should like to know how people are to pay taxes who throw away five pounds to every fellow that asks them 
31-121970-0004	train-other-500	Perhaps you don t know that Jack this morning knocked his shuttlecock through his bedroom window I was going to send for the glazier to mend it but after you lent that five pounds I was sure we couldn t afford it Oh no
31-121970-0005	train-other-500	the window must go as it is and pretty weather for a dear child to sleep with a broken window He s got a cold already on his lungs and I shouldn t at all wonder if that broken window settled him
31-121970-0006	train-other-500	If the dear boy dies his death will be upon his father s head for I m sure we can t now pay to mend windows We might though and do a good many more things too if people didn t throw away their five pounds
31-121970-0007	train-other-500	Next Tuesday the fire insurance is due I should like to know how it s to be paid Why it can t be paid at all That five pounds would have more than done it and now insurance is out of the question
31-121970-0008	train-other-500	And there never were so many fires as there are now I shall never close my eyes all night but what s that to you so people can call you liberal mister Caudle Your wife and children may all be burnt alive in their beds
none	none	 as all of us to a certainty shall be for the insurance MUST drop 
31-121970-0009	train-other-500	And after we ve insured for so many years But how I should like to know are people to insure who make ducks and drakes of their five pounds I did think we might go to Margate this summer
31-121970-0010	train-other-500	There s poor little Caroline I m sure she wants the sea But no dear creature she must stop at home all of us must stop at home she ll go into a consumption there s no doubt of that yes sweet little angel
31-121970-0011	train-other-500	I ve made up my mind to lose her NOW The child might have been saved but people can t save their children and throw away their five pounds too I wonder where poor little Mopsy is
none	none	 While you were lending that five pounds the dog ran out of the shop 
31-121970-0012	train-other-500	You know I never let it go into the street for fear it should be bit by some mad dog and come home and bite all the children It wouldn t now at all astonish me if the animal was to come back with the hydrophobia
none	none	 and give it to all the family 
31-121970-0013	train-other-500	However what s your family to you so you can play the liberal creature with five pounds Do you hear that shutter how it s banging to and fro Yes I know what it wants as well as you it wants a new fastening
31-121970-0014	train-other-500	I was going to send for the blacksmith to day but now it s out of the question NOW it must bang of nights since you ve thrown away five pounds Ha there s the soot falling down the chimney If I hate the smell of anything it s the smell of soot And you know it
31-121970-0015	train-other-500	but what are my feelings to you SWEEP THE CHIMNEY Yes it s all very fine to say sweep the chimney but how are chimneys to be swept how are they to be paid for by people who don t take care of their five pounds
none	none	 Do you hear the mice running about the room I hear them 
31-121970-0016	train-other-500	If they were to drag only you out of bed it would be no matter SET A TRAP FOR THEM Yes
none	none	 it s easy enough to say set a trap for em 
31-121970-0017	train-other-500	But how are people to afford mouse traps when every day they lose five pounds Hark I m sure there s a noise downstairs It wouldn t at all surprise me if there were thieves in the house Well
31-121970-0018	train-other-500	it MAY be the cat but thieves are pretty sure to come in some night There s a wretched fastening to the back door but these are not times to afford bolts and bars when people won t take care of their five pounds
31-121970-0019	train-other-500	Mary Anne ought to have gone to the dentist s to morrow She wants three teeth taken out Now it can t be done Three teeth that quite disfigure the child s mouth But there they must stop and spoil the sweetest face that was ever made
none	none	 Otherwise she d have been a wife for a lord 
31-121970-0020	train-other-500	Now when she grows up who ll have her Nobody We shall die and leave her alone and unprotected in the world
none	none	 But what do you care for that Nothing so you can squander away five pounds 
31-121970-0021	train-other-500	And thus comments Caudle according to my wife she dear soul couldn t have a satin gown the girls couldn t have new bonnets the water rate must stand over
31-121970-0022	train-other-500	Jack must get his death through a broken window our fire insurance couldn t be paid so that we should all fall victims to the devouring element we couldn t go to Margate and Caroline would go to an early grave
31-121970-0023	train-other-500	the dog would come home and bite us all mad the shutter would go banging for ever the soot would always fall the mice never let us have a wink of sleep thieves be always breaking in the house our dear Mary Anne be for ever left an unprotected maid
none	none	 and with other evils falling upon us all all because I would go on lending five pounds LECTURE II mister CAUDLE HAS BEEN AT A TAVERN WITH A FRIEND AND IS ENOUGH TO POISON A WOMAN WITH TOBACCO SMOKE Poor me Ha I m sure I don t know who d be a poor woman I don t know who d tie themselves up to a man if they knew only half they d have to bear A wife must stay at home and be a drudge whilst a man can go anywhere 
31-121971-0000	train-other-500	It s enough for a wife to sit like Cinderella by the ashes whilst her husband can go drinking and singing at a tavern YOU NEVER SING How do I know you never sing
none	none	 It s very well for you to say so but if I could hear you I daresay you re among the worst of em 
31-121971-0001	train-other-500	And now I suppose it will be the tavern every night If you think I m going to sit up for you mister Caudle you re very much mistaken No and I m not going to get out of my warm bed to let you in either

31-121971-0003	train-other-500	Nice companions he picks up there Yes people who make it a boast to treat their wives like slaves and ruin their families There s that wretch Harry Prettyman See what he s come to He doesn t get home now till two in the morning
31-121971-0004	train-other-500	and then in what a state He begins quarrelling with the door mat that his poor wife may be afraid to speak to him A mean wretch But don t you think I ll be like missus Prettyman No I wouldn t put up with it from the best man that ever trod

31-121971-0011	train-other-500	Talking about getting divorced I m sure tobacco ought to be good grounds How little does a woman think when she marries that she gives herself up to be poisoned You men contrive to have it all of your own side you do

31-121971-0018	train-other-500	And how your pot companions will laugh at you when they see your name in the Gazette For it MUST happen Your business is sure to fall off for what respectable people will buy toys for their children of a drunkard

none	none	 what that poor creature has to bear 
31-121971-0022	train-other-500	and had got at the brandy A pretty thing for a wife to wake at six in the morning and instead of her husband to see his dirty boots But I ll not be made your victim mister Caudle not I You shall never get at my keys

31-121972-0003	train-other-500	How any decent man can go and spend his nights in a tavern oh yes mister Caudle I daresay you DO go for rational conversation
31-121972-0004	train-other-500	I should like to know how many of you would care for what you call rational conversation if you had it without your filthy brandy and water yes and your more filthy tobacco smoke
31-121972-0005	train-other-500	I m sure the last time you came home I had the headache for a week But I know who it is who s taking you to destruction It s that brute Prettyman He has broken his own poor wife s heart and now he wants to
31-121972-0006	train-other-500	but don t you think it mister Caudle I ll not have my peace of mind destroyed by the best man that ever trod Oh yes I know you don t care so long as you can appear well to all the world but the world little thinks how you behave to me
none	none	 It shall know it though 
31-121972-0007	train-other-500	that I m determined How any man can leave his own happy fireside to go and sit and smoke and drink and talk with people who wouldn t one of em lift a finger to save him from hanging how any man can leave his wife and a good wife too though I say it
31-121972-0008	train-other-500	for a parcel of pot companions oh it s disgraceful mister Caudle it s unfeeling No man who had the least love for his wife could do it And I suppose this is to be the case every Saturday
31-121972-0009	train-other-500	But I know what I ll do I know it s no use mister Caudle your calling me a good creature I m not such a fool as to be coaxed in that way No if you want to go to sleep you should come home in Christian time not at half past twelve
31-121972-0010	train-other-500	There was a time when you were as regular at your fireside as the kettle That was when you were a decent man and didn t go amongst Heaven knows who drinking and smoking and making what you think your jokes
31-121972-0011	train-other-500	I never heard any good come to a man who cared about jokes No respectable tradesman does But I know what I ll do I ll scare away your Skylarks The house serves liquor after twelve of a Saturday

mister Caudle I knew it would come to this I said it would when you joined those precious Skylarks People being called out of their beds at all hours of the night to bail a set of fellows who are never so happy as when they re leading sober men to destruction I should like to know what the neighbours will think of you with people from the police knocking at the door at two in the morning Don t tell me that the man has been ill used he s not the man to be ill used And you must go and bail him I know the end of that he ll run away and you ll have to pay the money I should like to know what s the use of my working and slaving to save a farthing when you throw away pounds upon your precious Skylarks A pretty cold you ll have to morrow morning being called out of your warm bed this weather but don t you think I ll nurse you not I not a drop of gruel do you get from me I m sure you ve plenty of ways of spending your money not throwing it away upon a set of dissolute peace breakers It s all very well for you to say you haven t thrown away your money but you will He ll be certain to run off it isn t likely he ll go upon his trial and you ll be fixed with the bail Don t tell me there s no trial in the matter because I know there is it s for something more than quarrelling with the policeman that he was locked up People aren t locked up for that No it s for robbery or something worse perhaps And as you have bailed him people will think you are as bad as he is Don t tell me you couldn t help bailing him you should have shown yourself a respectable man and have let him been sent to prison Now people know you re the friend of drunken and disorderly persons you ll never have a night s sleep in your bed Not that it would matter what fell upon you if it wasn t your poor wife who suffered Of course all the business will be in the newspapers and your name with it I shouldn t wonder too if they give your picture as they do the other folks of the Old Bailey A pretty thing that to go down to your children I m sure it will be enough to make them change their name No I shall not go to sleep it s all very well for you to say go to sleep after such a disturbance But I shall not go to sleep mister Caudle certainly not Her will I have no doubt says Caudle was strong but nature was stronger and she did sleep this night inflicting upon me a remarkably short lecture LECTURE V mister CAUDLE HAS REMAINED DOWNSTAIRS TILL PAST ONE WITH A FRIEND Pretty time of night to come to bed mister Caudle Ugh As cold too as any ice Enough to give any woman her death I m sure What I SHOULDN T HAVE LOCKED UP THE COALS If I hadn t I ve no doubt the fellow would have stayed all night It s all very well for you mister Caudle to bring people home but I wish you d think first what s for supper That beautiful leg of pork would have served for our dinner to morrow and now it s gone I can t keep the house upon the money and I won t pretend to do it if you bring a mob of people every night to clear out the cupboard I wonder who ll be so ready to give you a supper when you want one for want one you will unless you change your plans Don t tell me I know I m right You ll first be eaten up and then you ll be laughed at I know the world No indeed mister Caudle I don t think ill of everybody don t say that But I can t see a leg of pork eaten up in that way without asking myself what it s all to end in if such things go on And then he must have pickles too Couldn t be content with my cabbage no mister Caudle I won t let you go to sleep It s very well for you to say let you go to sleep after you ve kept me awake till this time WHY DID I KEEP AWAKE How do you suppose I could go to sleep when I knew that man was below drinking up your substance in brandy and water for he couldn t be content upon decent wholesome gin Upon my word you ought to be a rich man mister Caudle You have such very fine friends I wonder who gives you brandy when you go out No indeed he couldn t be content with my pickled cabbage and I should like to know who makes better but he must have walnuts And you too like a fool now don t you think to stop me mister Caudle a poor woman may be trampled to death and never say a word you too like a fool I wonder who d do it for you to insist upon the girl going out for pickled walnuts And in such a night too With snow upon the ground Yes you re a man of fine feelings you are mister Caudle but the world doesn t know you as I know you fine feelings indeed to send the poor girl out when I told you and told your friend too a pretty brute he is I m sure that the poor girl had got a cold and I dare say chilblains on her toes But I know what will be the end of that she ll be laid up and we shall have a nice doctor s bill And you ll pay it I can tell you for I won t YOU WISH YOU WERE OUT OF THE WORLD Oh yes that s all very easy I m sure I might wish it Don t swear in that dreadful way Aren t you afraid that the bed will open and swallow you And don t swing about in that way THAT will do no good THAT won t bring back the leg of pork and the brandy you ve poured down both of your throats Oh I know it I m sure of it I only recollected it when I d got into bed and if it hadn t been so cold you d have seen me downstairs again I can tell you I recollected it and a pretty two hours I ve passed that I left the key in the cupboard and I know it I could see by the manner of you when you came into the room I know you ve got at the other bottle However there s one comfort you told me to send for the best brandy the very best for your other friend who called last Wednesday Ha ha It was British the cheapest British and nice and ill I hope the pair of you will be to morrow There s only the bare bone of the leg of pork but you ll get nothing else for dinner I can tell you It s a dreadful thing that the poor children should go without but if they have such a father they poor things must suffer for it Nearly a whole leg of pork and a pint of brandy A pint of brandy and a leg of pork A leg of leg leg pint And mumbling the syllables says mister Caudle s MS she went to sleep LECTURE VI mister CAUDLE HAS LENT AN ACQUAINTANCE THE FAMILY UMBRELLA Bah That s the third umbrella gone since Christmas WHAT WERE YOU TO DO Why let him go home in the rain to be sure I m very certain there was nothing about HIM that could spoil Take cold indeed He doesn t look like one of the sort to take cold Besides he d have better taken cold than take our only umbrella Do you hear the rain mister Caudle I say do you hear the rain And as I m alive if it isn t saint Swithin s day Do you hear it against the windows Nonsense you don t impose upon me You can t be asleep with such a shower as that Do you hear it I say Oh you DO hear it Well that s a pretty flood I think to last for six weeks and no stirring all the time out of the house Pooh don t think me a fool mister Caudle Don t insult me HE return the umbrella Anybody would think you were born yesterday As if anybody ever DID return an umbrella There do you hear it Worse and worse Cats and dogs and for six weeks always six weeks And no umbrella I should like to know how the children are to go to school to morrow They sha n t go through such weather I m determined No they shall stop at home and never learn anything the blessed creatures sooner than go and get wet And when they grow up I wonder who they ll have to thank for knowing nothing who indeed but their father People who can t feel for their own children ought never to be fathers But I know why you lent the umbrella Oh yes I know very well I was going out to tea at dear mother s to morrow you knew that and you did it on purpose Don t tell me you hate me to go there and take every mean advantage to hinder me But don t you think it mister Caudle No sir if it comes down in buckets full I ll go all the more No and I won t have a cab Where do you think the money s to come from You ve got nice high notions at that club of yours A cab indeed Cost me sixteenpence at least sixteenpence two and eightpence for there s back again Cabs indeed I should like to know who s to pay for em I can t pay for em and I m sure you can t if you go on as you do throwing away your property and beggaring your children buying umbrellas Do you hear the rain mister Caudle I say do you hear it But I don t care I ll go to mother s to morrow I will and what s more I ll walk every step of the way and you know that will give me my death Don t call me a foolish woman it s you that s the foolish man You know I can t wear clogs and with no umbrella the wet s sure to give me a cold it always does But what do you care for that Nothing at all I may be laid up for what you care as I daresay I shall and a pretty doctor s bill there ll be I hope there will It will teach you to lend your umbrellas again I shouldn t wonder if I caught my death yes and that s what you lent the umbrella for Of course Nice clothes I shall get too trapesing through weather like this My gown and bonnet will be spoilt quite NEEDN T I WEAR EM THEN Indeed mister Caudle I SHALL wear em No sir I m not going out a dowdy to please you or anybody else Gracious knows it isn t often that I step over the threshold indeed I might as well be a slave at once better I should say But when I do go out mister Caudle I choose to go like a lady Oh that rain if it isn t enough to break in the windows Ugh I do look forward with dread for to morrow How I am to go to mother s I m sure I can t tell But if I die I ll do it No sir I won t borrow an umbrella No and you sha n t buy one Now mister Caudle only listen to this if you bring home another umbrella I ll throw it in the street I ll have my own umbrella or none at all Ha and it was only last week I had a new nozzle put to that umbrella I m sure if I d have known as much as I do now it might have gone without one for me Paying for new nozzles for other people to laugh at you Oh it s all very well for you you can go to sleep You ve no thought of your poor patient wife and your own dear children You think of nothing but lending umbrellas Men indeed call themselves lords of the creation pretty lords when they can t even take care of an umbrella I know that walk to morrow will be the death of me But that s what you want then you may go to your club and do as you like and then nicely my poor dear children will be used but then sir then you ll be happy Oh don t tell me I know you will Else you d never have lent the umbrella You have to go on Thursday about that summons and of course you can t go No indeed you DON T go without the umbrella You may lose the debt for what I care it won t be so much as spoiling your clothes better lose it people deserve to lose debts who lend umbrellas And I should like to know how I m to go to mother s without the umbrella Oh don t tell me that I said I WOULD go that s nothing to do with it nothing at all She ll think I m neglecting her and the little money we were to have we sha n t have at all because we ve no umbrella The children too Dear things They ll be sopping wet for they sha n t stop at home they sha n t lose their learning it s all their father will leave em I m sure But they SHALL go to school Don t tell me I said they shouldn t you are so aggravating Caudle you d spoil the temper of an angel They SHALL go to school mark that And if they get their deaths of cold it s not my fault I didn t lend the umbrella At length writes Caudle I fell asleep and dreamt that the sky was turned into green calico with whalebone ribs that in fact the whole world turned round under a tremendous umbrella LECTURE VII mister CAUDLE HAS VENTURED A REMONSTRANCE ON HIS DAY S DINNER COLD MUTTON AND NO PUDDING missus CAUDLE DEFENDS THE COLD SHOULDER Umph I m sure Well I wonder what it will be next There s nothing proper now nothing at all Better get somebody else to keep the house I think I can t do it now it seems I m only in the way here I d better take the children and go What am I grumbling about now It s very well for you to ask that I m sure I d better be out of the world than there now mister Caudle there you are again I SHALL speak sir It isn t often I open my mouth Heaven knows But you like to hear nobody talk but yourself You ought to have married a negro slave and not any respectable woman You re to go about the house looking like thunder all the day and I m not to say a word Where do you think pudding s to come from every day You show a nice example to your children you do complaining and turning your nose up at a sweet piece of cold mutton because there s no pudding You go a nice way to make em extravagant teach em nice lessons to begin the world with Do you know what puddings cost or do you think they fly in at the window You hate cold mutton The more shame for you mister Caudle I m sure you ve the stomach of a lord you have No sir I didn t choose to hash the mutton It s very easy for you to say hash it but I know what a joint loses in hashing it s a day s dinner the less if it s a bit Yes I daresay other people may have puddings with cold mutton No doubt of it and other people become bankrupts But if ever you get into the Gazette it sha n t be MY fault no I ll do my duty as a wife to you mister Caudle you shall never have it to say that it was MY housekeeping that brought you to beggary No you may sulk at the cold meat ha I hope you ll never live to want such a piece of cold mutton as we had to day and you may threaten to go to a tavern to dine but with our present means not a crumb of pudding do you get from me You shall have nothing but the cold joint nothing as I m a Christian sinner Yes there you are throwing those fowls in my face again I know you once brought home a pair of fowls I know it and weren t you mean enough to want to stop em out of my week s money Oh the selfishness the shabbiness of men They can go out and throw away pounds upon pounds with a pack of people who laugh at em afterwards but if it s anything wanted for their own homes their poor wives may hunt for it I wonder you don t blush to name those fowls again I wouldn t be so little for the world mister Caudle What are you going to do GOING TO GET UP Don t make yourself ridiculous mister Caudle I can t say a word to you like any other wife but you must threaten to get up DO be ashamed of yourself Puddings indeed Do you think I m made of puddings Didn t you have some boiled rice three weeks ago Besides is this the time of the year for puddings It s all very well if I had money enough allowed me like any other wife to keep the house with then indeed I might have preserves like any other woman now it s impossible and it s cruel yes mister Caudle cruel of you to expect it APPLES AREN T SO DEAR ARE THEY I know what apples are mister Caudle without your telling me But I suppose you want something more than apples for dumplings I suppose sugar costs something doesn t it And that s how it is That s how one expense brings on another and that s how people go to ruin PANCAKES What s the use of your lying muttering there about pancakes Don t you always have em once a year every Shrove Tuesday And what would any moderate decent man want more Pancakes indeed Pray mister Caudle no it s no use your saying fine words to me to let you go to sleep I sha n t pray do you know the price of eggs just now There s not an egg you can trust to under seven and eight a shilling well you ve only just to reckon up how many eggs don t lie swearing there at the eggs in that manner mister Caudle unless you expect the bed to let you fall through You call yourself a respectable tradesman I suppose Ha I only wish people knew you as well as I do Swearing at eggs indeed But I m tired of this usage mister Caudle quite tired of it and I don t care how soon it s ended I m sure I do nothing but work and labour and think how to make the most of everything and this is how I m rewarded I should like to see anybody whose joints go further than mine But if I was to throw away your money into the street or lay it out in fine feathers on myself I should be better thought of The woman who studies her husband and her family is always made a drudge of It s your fine fal lal wives who ve the best time of it What s the use of your lying groaning there in that manner That won t make me hold my tongue I can tell you You think to have it all your own way but you won t mister Caudle You can insult my dinner look like a demon I may say at a wholesome piece of cold mutton ah the thousands of far better creatures than you are who d been thankful for that mutton and I m never to speak But you re mistaken I will Your usage of me mister Caudle is infamous unworthy of a man I only wish people knew you for what you are but I ve told you again and again they shall some day Puddings And now I suppose I shall hear of nothing but puddings Yes and I know what it would end in First you d have a pudding every day oh I know your extravagance then you d go for fish then I shouldn t wonder if you d have soup turtle no doubt then you d go for a dessert and oh I see it all as plain as the quilt before me but no not while I m alive What your second wife may do I don t know perhaps SHE LL be a fine lady but you sha n t be ruined by me mister Caudle that I m determined Puddings indeed Pu dding s Pud Exhausted nature says Caudle could hold out no longer She went to sleep LECTURE VIII CAUDLE HAS BEEN MADE A MASON missus CAUDLE INDIGNANT AND CURIOUS Now mister Caudle mister Caudle I say oh you can t be asleep already I know now what I mean to say is this there s no use none at all in our having any disturbance about the matter but at last my mind s made up mister Caudle I shall leave you Either I know all you ve been doing to night or to morrow morning I quit the house No no there s an end of the marriage state I think an end of all confidence between man and wife if a husband s to have secrets and keep em all to himself Pretty secrets they must be when his own wife can t know em Not fit for any decent person to know I m sure if that s the case Now Caudle don t let us quarrel there s a good soul tell me what it s all about A pack of nonsense I dare say still not that I care much about it still I SHOULD like to know There s a dear Eh oh don t tell me there s nothing in it I know better I m not a fool mister Caudle I know there s a good deal in it Now Caudle just tell me a little bit of it I m sure I d tell you anything You know I would Well Caudle you re enough to vex a saint Now don t you think you re going to sleep because you re not Do you suppose I d ever suffered you to go and be made a mason if I didn t suppose I was to know the secret too Not that it s anything to know I dare say and that s why I m determined to know it But I know what it is oh yes there can be no doubt The secret is to ill use poor women to tyrannise over em to make em your slaves especially your wives It must be something of the sort or you wouldn t be ashamed to have it known What s right and proper never need be done in secret It s an insult to a woman for a man to be a freemason and let his wife know nothing of it But poor soul she s sure to know it somehow for nice husbands they all make Yes yes a part of the secret is to think better of all the world than their own wives and families I m sure men have quite enough to care for that is if they act properly to care for them they have at home They can t have much care to spare for the world besides And I suppose they call you BROTHER Caudle A pretty brother indeed Going and dressing yourself up in an apron like a turnpike man for that s what you look like And I should like to know what the apron s for There must be something in it not very respectable I m sure Well I only wish I was Queen for a day or two I d put an end to freemasonry and all such trumpery I know Now come Caudle don t let s quarrel Eh You re not in pain dear What s it all about What are you lying laughing there at But I m a fool to trouble my head about you And you re not going to let me know the secret eh You mean to say you re not Now Caudle you know it s a hard matter to put me in a passion not that I care about the secret itself no I wouldn t give a button to know it for it s all nonsense I m sure It isn t the secret I care about it s the slight mister Caudle it s the studied insult that a man pays to his wife when he thinks of going through the world keeping something to himself which he won t let her know Man and wife one indeed I should like to know how that can be when a man s a mason when he keeps a secret that sets him and his wife apart Ha you men make the laws and so you take good care to have all the best of em to yourselves otherwise a woman ought to be allowed a divorce when a man becomes a mason when he s got a sort of corner cupboard in his heart a secret place in his mind that his poor wife isn t allowed to rummage Caudle you sha n t close your eyes for a week no you sha n t unless you tell me some of it Come there s a good creature there s a love I m sure Caudle I wouldn t refuse you anything and you know it or ought to know it by this time I only wish I had a secret To whom should I think of confiding it but to my dear husband I should be miserable to keep it to myself and you know it Now Caudle Was there ever such a man A man indeed A brute yes mister Caudle an unfeeling brutal creature when you might oblige me and you won t I m sure I don t object to your being a mason not at all Caudle I dare say it s a very good thing I dare say it is it s only your making a secret of it that vexes me But you ll tell me you ll tell your own Margaret You won t You re a wretch mister Caudle But I know why oh yes I can tell The fact is you re ashamed to let me know what a fool they ve been making of you That s it You at your time of life the father of a family I should be ashamed of myself Caudle And I suppose you ll be going to what you call your Lodge every night now Lodge indeed Pretty place it must be where they don t admit women Nice goings on I dare say Then you call one another brethren Brethren I m sure you d relations enough you didn t want any more But I know what all this masonry s about It s only an excuse to get away from your wives and families that you may feast and drink together that s all That s the secret And to abuse women as if they were inferior animals and not to be trusted That s the secret and nothing else Now Caudle don t let us quarrel Yes I know you re in pain Still Caudle my love Caudle Dearest I say Caudle I recollect nothing more says Caudle for I had eaten a hearty supper and somehow became oblivious LECTURE IX mister CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO GREENWICH FAIR Ho mister Caudle I hope you enjoyed yourself at Greenwich HOW DO I KNOW YOU VE BEEN AT GREENWICH I know it very well sir know all about it know more than you think I know I thought there was something in the wind Yes I was sure of it when you went out of the house to day I knew it by the looks of you though I didn t say anything Upon my word And you call yourself a respectable man and the father of a family Going to a fair among all sorts of people at your time of life Yes and never think of taking your wife with you Oh no you can go and enjoy yourself out with I don t know who go out and make yourself very pleasant I dare say Don t tell me I hear what a nice companion mister Caudle is what a good tempered person Ha I only wish people could see you at home that s all But so it is with men They can keep all their good temper for out of doors their wives never see any of it Oh dear I m sure I don t know who d be a poor woman Now Caudle I m not in an ill temper not at all I know I used to be a fool when we were first married I used to worry and fret myself to death when you went out but I ve got over that I wouldn t put myself out of the way now for the best man that ever trod For what thanks does a poor woman get None at all No it s those who don t care for their families who are the best thought of I only wish I could bring myself not to care for mine And why couldn t you say like a man you were going to Greenwich Fair when you went out It s no use your saying that mister Caudle don t tell me that you didn t think of going you d made up your mind to it and you know it Pretty games you ve had no doubt I should like to have been behind you that s all A man at your time of life And I of course I never want to go out Oh no I may stay at home with the cat You couldn t think of taking your wife and children like any other decent man to a fair Oh no you never care to be seen with us I m sure many people don t know you re married at all how can they Your wife s never seen with you Oh no anybody but those belonging to you Greenwich Fair indeed Yes and of course you went up and down the hill running and racing with nobody knows who Don t tell me I know what you are when you re out You don t suppose mister Caudle I ve forgotten that pink bonnet do you No I won t hold my tongue and I m not a foolish woman It s no matter sir if the pink bonnet was fifty years ago it s all the same for that No and if I live for fifty years to come I never will leave off talking of it You ought to be ashamed of yourself mister Caudle Ha few wives would have been what I ve been to you I only wish my time was to come over again that s all I wouldn t be the fool I have been Going to a fair and I suppose you had your fortune told by the gipsies You needn t have wasted your money I m sure I can tell you your fortune if you go on as you do Yes the gaol will be your fortune mister Caudle And it would be no matter none at all if your wife and children didn t suffer with you And then you must go riding upon donkeys YOU DIDN T GO RIDING UPON DONKEYS Yes it s very well for you to say so but I dare say you did I tell you Caudle I know what you are when you re out I wouldn t trust any of you you especially Caudle Then you must go in the thick of the fair and have the girls scratching your coat with rattles YOU COULDN T HELP IT IF THEY DID SCRATCH YOUR COAT Don t tell me people don t scratch coats unless they re encouraged to do it And you must go in a swing too YOU DIDN T GO IN A SWING Well if you didn t it was no fault of yours you wished to go I ve no doubt And then you must go into the shows There you don t deny that You did go into a show WHAT OF IT mister CAUDLE A good deal of it sir Nice crowding and squeezing in those shows I know Pretty places And you a married man and the father of a family No I won t hold my tongue It s very well for you to threaten to get up You re to go to Greenwich Fair and race up and down the hill and play at kiss in the ring Pah it s disgusting mister Caudle Oh I dare say you DID play at it if you didn t you d have liked and that s just as bad and you can go into swings and shows and roundabouts If I was you I should hide my head under the clothes and be ashamed of myself And what is most selfish most mean of you Caudle you can go and enjoy yourself and never so much as bring home for the poor children a gingerbread nut Don t tell me that your pocket was picked of a pound of nuts Nice company you must have been in to have your pocket picked But I daresay I shall hear all about it to morrow I ve no doubt sir you were dancing at the Crown and Anchor I should like to have seen you No I m not making myself ridiculous It s you that s making yourself ridiculous and everybody that knows you says so Everybody knows what I have to put up with from you Going to a fair indeed At your time Here says Caudle I dozed off hearing confusedly the words hill gipsies rattles roundabouts swings pink bonnet nuts LECTURE X ON

to talk to you and you SHALL hear me I m put upon all day long it s very hard if I can t speak a word at night besides it isn t often I open my mouth goodness knows Because ONCE in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button you must almost swear the roof off the house YOU DIDN T SWEAR Ha mister Caudle you don t know what you do when you re in a passion YOU WERE NOT IN A PASSION Weren t you Well then I don t know what a passion is and I think I ought by this time I ve lived long enough with you mister Caudle to know that It s a pity you haven t something worse to complain of than a button off your shirt If you d SOME wives you would I know I m sure I m never without a needle and thread in my hand What with you and the children I m made a perfect slave of And what s my thanks Why if once in your life a button s off your shirt what do you cry OH at I say once mister Caudle or twice or three times at most I m sure Caudle no man s buttons in the world are better looked after than yours I only wish I had kept the shirts you had when you were first married I should like to know where were your buttons then Yes it IS worth talking of But that s how you always try to put me down You fly into a rage and then if I only try to speak you won t hear me That s how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves a poor woman isn t allowed to get a word in A nice notion you have of a wife to suppose she s nothing to think of but her husband s buttons A pretty notion indeed you have of marriage Ha if poor women only knew what they had to go through What with buttons and one thing and another They d never tie themselves up no not to the best man in the world I m sure WHAT WOULD THEY DO mister CAUDLE Why do much better without you I m certain And it s my belief after all that the button wasn t off the shirt it s my belief that you pulled it off that you might have something to talk about Oh you re aggravating enough when you like for anything All I know is it s very odd that the button should be off the shirt for I m sure no woman s a greater slave to her husband s buttons than I am I only say it s very odd However there s one comfort it can t last long I m worn to death with your temper and sha n t trouble you a great while Ha you may laugh And I dare say you would laugh I ve no doubt of it That s your love that s your feeling I know that I m sinking every day though I say nothing about it And when I m gone we shall see how your second wife will look after your buttons You ll find out the difference then Yes Caudle you ll think of me then for then I hope you ll never have a blessed button to your back No I m not a vindictive woman mister Caudle nobody ever called me that but you What do you say NOBODY EVER KNEW SO MUCH OF ME That s nothing at all to do with it Ha I wouldn t have your aggravating temper Caudle for mines of gold It s a good thing I m not as worrying as you are or a nice house there d be between us I only wish you d had a wife that WOULD have talked to you Then you d have known the difference But you impose upon me because like a poor fool I say nothing I should be ashamed of myself Caudle And a pretty example you set as a father You ll make your boys as bad as yourself Talking as you did all breakfast time about your buttons And of a Sunday morning too And you call yourself a Christian I should like to know what your boys will say of you when they grow up And all about a paltry button off one of your wristbands A decent man wouldn t have mentioned it WHY WON T I HOLD MY TONGUE Because I WON T hold my tongue I m to have my peace of mind destroyed I m to be worried into my grave for a miserable shirt button and I m to hold my tongue Oh but that s just like you men But I know what I ll do for the future Every button you have may drop off and I won t so much as put a thread to em And I should like to know what you ll do then Oh you must get somebody else to sew em must you That s a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to a wife And to such a wife as I ve been too such a negro slave to your buttons as I may say Somebody else to sew em eh No Caudle no not while I m alive When I m dead and with what I have to bear there s no knowing how soon that may be when I m dead I say oh what a brute you must be to snore so YOU RE NOT SNORING Ha that s what you always say but that s nothing to do with it You must get somebody else to sew em must you Ha I shouldn t wonder Oh no I should be surprised at nothing now Nothing at all It s what people have always told me it would come to and now the buttons have opened my eyes But the whole world shall know of your cruelty mister Caudle After the wife I ve been to you Somebody else indeed to sew your buttons I m no longer to be mistress in my own house Ha Caudle I wouldn t have upon my conscience what you have for the world I wouldn t treat anybody as you treat no I m not mad It s you mister Caudle who are mad or bad and that s worse I can t even so much as speak of a shirt button but that I m threatened to be made nobody of in my own house Caudle you ve a heart like a hearth stone you have To threaten me and only because a button a button I was conscious of no more than this says Caudle for here nature relieved me with a sweet deep sleep LECTURE XI missus CAUDLE SUGGESTS THAT HER DEAR MOTHER SHOULD COME AND LIVE WITH THEM Is your cold better to night Caudle Yes I thought it was Twill be quite well to morrow I dare say There s a love You don t take care enough of yourself Caudle you don t And you ought I m sure if only for my sake For whatever I should do if anything was to happen to you but I think of it no I can t bear to think OF THAT Still you ought to take care of yourself for you know you re not strong Caudle you know you re not Wasn t dear mother so happy with us to night Now you needn t go to sleep so suddenly I say wasn t she so happy YOU DON T KNOW How can you say you don t know You must have seen it But she is always happier here than anywhere else Ha what a temper that dear soul has I call it a temper of satin it is so smooth so easy and so soft Nothing puts her out of the way And then if you only knew how she takes your part Caudle I m sure if you had been her own son ten times over she couldn t be fonder of you Don t you think so Caudle Eh love Now do answer HOW CAN YOU TELL Nonsense Caudle you must have seen it I m sure nothing delights the dear soul so much as when she s thinking how to please you Don t you remember Thursday night the stewed oysters when you came home That was all dear mother s doings Margaret says she to me it s a cold night and don t you think dear mister Caudle would like something nice before he goes to bed And that Caudle is how the oysters came about Now don t sleep Caudle do listen to me for five minutes tisn t often I speak goodness knows And then what a fuss she makes when you are out if your slippers aren t put to the fire for you SHE S VERY GOOD Yes I know she is Caudle And hasn t she been six months though I promised her not to tell you six months working a watch pocket for you And with HER eyes dear soul and at HER time of life And then what a cook she is I m sure the dishes she ll make out of next to nothing I try hard enough to follow her but I m not ashamed to own it Caudle she quite beats me Ha the many nice little things she d simmer up for you and I can t do it the children you know it Caudle take so much of my time I can t do it love and I often reproach myself that I can t Now you shan t go to sleep Caudle at least not for five minutes You must hear me I ve been thinking dearest ha that nasty cough love I ve been thinking darling if we could only persuade dear mother to come and live with us Now Caudle you can t be asleep it s impossible you were coughing only this minute yes to live with us What a treasure we should have in her Then Caudle you never need go to bed without something nice and hot And you want it Caudle YOU DON T WANT IT Nonsense you do for you re not strong Caudle you know you re not I m sure the money she d save us in housekeeping Ha what an eye she has for a joint The butcher doesn t walk that could deceive dear mother And then again for poultry What a finger and thumb she has for a chicken I never could market like her it s a gift quite a gift And then you recollect her marrow puddings YOU DON T RECOLLECT EM Oh fie Caudle how often have you flung her marrow puddings in my face wanting to know why I couldn t make em And I wouldn t pretend to do it after dear mother I should think it presumption Now love if she was only living with us come you re not asleep Caudle if she was only living with us you could have marrow puddings every day Now don t fling yourself about and begin to swear at marrow puddings you know you like em dear What a hand too dear mother has for a pie crust But it s born with some people What do you say WHY WASN T IT BORN WITH ME Now Caudle that s cruel unfeeling of you I wouldn t have uttered such a reproach to you for the whole world Consider dear people can t be born as they like How often too have you wanted to brew at home And I never could learn anything about brewing But ha what ale dear mother makes YOU NEVER TASTED IT No I know that But I recollect the ale we used to have at home and father would never drink wine after it The best sherry was nothing like it YOU DARE SAY NOT No it wasn t indeed Caudle Then if dear mother was only with us what money we should save in beer And then you might always have your own nice pure good wholesome ale Caudle and what good it would do you For you re not strong Caudle And then dear mother s jams and preserves love I own it Caudle it has often gone to my heart that with cold meat you haven t always had a pudding Now if mother was with us in the matter of fruit puddings she d make it summer all the year round But I never could preserve now mother does it and for next to no money whatever What nice dogs in a blanket she d make for the children WHAT S DOGS IN A BLANKET Oh they re delicious as dear mother makes em Now you HAVE tasted her Irish stew Caudle You remember that Come you re not asleep you remember that And how fond you are of it And I know I never have it made to please you Well what a relief to me it would be if dear mother was always at hand that you might have a stew when you liked What a load it would be off my mind Again for pickles Not at all like anybody else s pickles Her red cabbage why it s as crisp as biscuit And then her walnuts and her all sorts Eh Caudle You know how you love pickles and how we sometimes tiff about em Now if dear mother was here a word would never pass between us And I m sure nothing would make me happier for you re not asleep Caudle for I can t bear to quarrel can I love The children too are so fond of her And she d be such a help to me with em I m sure with dear mother in the house I shouldn t care a fig for measles or anything of the sort As a nurse she s such a treasure And at her time of life what a needle woman And the darning and mending for the children it really gets quite beyond me now Caudle Now with mother at my hand there wouldn t be a stitch wanted in the house And then when you re out late Caudle for I know you must be out late sometimes I can t expect you of course to be always at home why then dear mother could sit up for you and nothing would delight the dear soul half so much And so Caudle love I think dear mother had better come don t you Eh Caudle Now you re not asleep darling don t you think she d better come You say NO You say NO again YOU WON T HAVE HER you say YOU WON T THAT S FLAT Caudle Cau Cau dle Cau dle Here missus Caudle says her husband suddenly went into tears and I went to sleep LECTURE XII mister CAUDLE HAVING COME HOME A LITTLE LATE DECLARES THAT HENCEFORTH HE WILL HAVE A KEY Pon my word mister Caudle I think it a waste of time to come to bed at all now The cocks will be crowing in a minute Keeping people up till past twelve Oh yes you re thought a man of very fine feelings out of doors I dare say It s a pity you haven t a little feeling for those belonging to you at home A nice hour to keep people out of their beds WHY DID I SIT UP THEN Because I chose to sit up but that s my thanks No it s no use your talking Caudle I never WILL let the girl sit up for you and there s an end What do you say WHY DOES SHE SIT UP WITH ME THEN That s quite a different matter you don t suppose I m going to sit up alone do you What do you say WHAT S THE USE OF TWO SITTING UP That s my business No Caudle it s no such thing I DON T sit up because I may have the pleasure of talking about it and you re an ungrateful unfeeling creature to say so I sit up because I choose it and if you don t come home all the night long and twill soon come to that I ve no doubt still I ll never go to bed so don t think it Oh yes the time runs away very pleasantly with you men at your clubs selfish creatures You can laugh and sing and tell stories and never think of the clock never think there s such a person as a wife belonging to you It s nothing to you that a poor woman s sitting up and telling the minutes and seeing all sorts of things in the fire and sometimes thinking something dreadful has happened to you more fool she to care a straw about you This is all nothing Oh no when a woman s once married she s a slave worse than a slave and must bear it all And what you men can find to talk about I can t think Instead of a man sitting every night at home with his wife and going to bed at a Christian hour going to a club to meet a set of people who don t care a button for him it s monstrous What do you say YOU ONLY GO ONCE A WEEK That s nothing at all to do with it you might as well go every night and I daresay you will soon But if you do you may get in as you can I won t sit up for you I can tell you My health s being destroyed night after night and oh don t say it s only once a week I tell you that s nothing to do with it if you had any eyes you would see how ill I am but you ve no eyes for anybody belonging to you oh no your eyes are for people out of doors It s very well for you to call me a foolish aggravating woman I should like to see the woman who d sit up for you as I do YOU DIDN T WANT ME TO SIT UP Yes yes that s your thanks that s your gratitude I m to ruin my health and to be abused for it Nice principles you ve got at that club mister Caudle But there s one comfort one great comfort it can t last long I m sinking I feel it though I never say anything about it but I know my own feelings and I say it can t last long And then I should like to know who will sit up for you Then I should like to know how your second wife what do you say YOU LL NEVER BE TROUBLED WITH ANOTHER Troubled indeed I never troubled you Caudle No it s you who ve troubled me and you know it though like a foolish woman I ve borne it all and never said a word about it But it CAN T last that s one blessing Oh if a woman could only know what she d have to suffer before she was married Don t tell me you want to go to sleep If you want to go to sleep you should come home at proper hours It s time to get up for what I know now Shouldn t wonder if you hear the milk in five minutes there s the sparrows up already yes I say the sparrows and Caudle you ought to blush to hear em YOU DON T HEAR EM Ha you won t hear em you mean I hear em No mister Caudle it ISN T the wind whistling in the keyhole I m not quite foolish though you may think so I hope I know wind from a sparrow Ha when I think what a man you were before we were married But you re now another person quite an altered creature But I suppose you re all alike I dare say every poor woman s troubled and put upon though I should hope not so much as I am Indeed I should hope not Going and staying out and What YOU LL HAVE A KEY Will you Not while I m alive mister Caudle I m not going to bed with the door upon the latch for you or the best man breathing YOU WON T HAVE A LATCH YOU LL HAVE A CHUBB S LOCK Will you I ll have no Chubb here I can tell you What do you say YOU LL HAVE THE LOCK PUT ON TO MORROW Well try it that s all I say Caudle try it I won t let you put me in a passion but all I say is try it A respectable thing that for a married man to carry about with him a street door key That tells a tale I think A nice thing for the father of a family A key What to let yourself in and out when you please To come in like a thief in the middle of the night instead of knocking at the door like a decent person Oh don t tell me that you only want to prevent me sitting up if I choose to sit up what s that to you Some wives indeed would make a noise about sitting up but YOU VE no reason to complain goodness knows Well upon my word I ve lived to hear something Carry the street door key about with you I ve heard of such things with young good for nothing bachelors with nobody to care what became of em but for a married man to leave his wife and children in a house with a door upon the latch don t talk to me about Chubb it s all the same a great deal you must care for us Yes it s very well for you to say that you only want the key for peace and quietness what s it to you if I like to sit up You ve no business to complain it can t distress you Now it s no use your talking all I say is this Caudle if you send a man to put on any lock here I ll call in a policeman as I m your married wife I will No I think when a man comes to have the street door key the sooner he turns bachelor altogether the better I m sure Caudle I don t want to be any clog upon you Now it s no use your telling me to hold my tongue for I What I GIVE YOU THE HEADACHE DO I No I don t Caudle it s your club that gives you the headache it s your smoke and your well if ever I knew such a man in all my life there s no saying a word to you You go out and treat yourself like an emperor and come home at twelve at night or any hour for what I know and then you threaten to have a key and and and I did get to sleep at last says Caudle amidst the falling sentences of take children into a lodging separate maintenance won t be made a slave of and so forth LECTURE XIII missus CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO SEE HER DEAR MOTHER CAUDLE ON THE JOYFUL OCCASION HAS GIVEN A PARTY AND ISSUED A CARD OF INVITATION It IS hard I think mister Caudle that I can t leave home for a day or two but the house must be turned into a tavern a tavern a pothouse Yes I thought you were very anxious that I should go I thought you wanted to get rid of me for something or you would not have insisted on my staying at dear mother s all night You were afraid I should get cold coming home were you Oh yes you can be very tender you can mister Caudle when it suits your own purpose Yes and the world thinks what a good husband you are I only wish the world knew you as well as I do that s all but it shall some day I m determined I m sure the house will not be sweet for a month All the curtains are poisoned with smoke and what s more with the filthiest smoke I ever knew TAKE EM DOWN THEN Yes it s all very well for you to say take em down but they were only cleaned and put up a month ago but a careful wife s lost upon you mister Caudle You ought to have married somebody who d have let your house go to wreck and ruin as I will for the future People who don t care for their families are better thought of than those who do I ve long found out THAT And what a condition the carpet s in They ve taken five pounds out of it if a farthing with their filthy boots and I don t know what besides And then the smoke in the hearthrug and a large cinder hole burnt in it I never saw such a house in MY life If you wanted to have a few friends why couldn t you invite em when your wife s at home like any other man not have em sneaking in like a set of housebreakers directly a woman turns her back They must be pretty gentlemen they must mean fellows that are afraid to face a woman Ha and you all call yourselves the lords of the creation I should only like to see what would become of the creation if you were left to yourselves A pretty pickle creation would be in very soon You must all have been in a nice condition What do you say YOU TOOK NOTHING Took nothing didn t you I m sure there s such a regiment of empty bottles I haven t had the heart to count em And punch too you must have punch There s a hundred half lemons in the kitchen if there s one for Susan like a good girl kept em to show em me No sir Susan SHAN T LEAVE THE HOUSE What do you say SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL TALES AND YOU WILL BE MASTER IN YOUR OWN HOUSE Will you If you don t alter mister Caudle you ll soon have no house to be master of A whole loaf of sugar did I leave in the cupboard and now there isn t as much as would fill a teacup Do you suppose I m to find sugar for punch for fifty men What do you say THERE WASN T FIFTY That s no matter the more shame for em sir I m sure they drank enough for fifty Do you suppose I m to find sugar for punch for all the world out of my housekeeping money YOU DON T ASK ME Don t you ask me You do you know you do for if I only want a shilling extra the house is in a blaze And yet a whole loaf of sugar can you throw away upon No I WON T be still and I WON T let you go to sleep If you d got to bed at a proper hour last night you wouldn t have been so sleepy now You can sit up half the night with a pack of people who don t care for you and your poor wife can t get in a word And there s that china image that I had when I was married I wouldn t have taken any sum of money for it and you know it and how do I find it With its precious head knocked off And what was more mean more contemptible than all besides it was put on again as if nothing had happened YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT Now how can you lie there in your Christian bed Caudle and say that You know that that fellow Prettyman knocked off the head with the poker You know that he did And you hadn t the feeling yes I will say it you hadn t the feeling to protect what you knew was precious to me Oh no if the truth was known you were glad to see it broken for that very reason Every way I ve been insulted I should like to know who it was who corked whiskers on my dear aunt s picture Oh you re laughing are you YOU RE NOT LAUGHING Don t tell me that I should like to know what shakes the bed then if you re not laughing Yes corked whiskers on her dear face and she was a dear soul to you Caudle and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to see her ill used Oh you may laugh It s very easy to laugh I only wish you d a little feeling like other people that s all Then there s my china mug the mug I had before I was married when I was a happy creature I should like to know who knocked the spout off that mug Don t tell me it was cracked before it s no such thing Caudle there wasn t a flaw in it and now I could have cried when I saw it Don t tell me it wasn t worth twopence How do you know You never buy mugs But that s like men they think nothing in a house costs anything There s four glasses broke and nine cracked At least that s all I ve found out at present but I daresay I shall discover a dozen to morrow And I should like to know where the cotton umbrella s gone to and I should like to know who broke the bell pull and perhaps you don t know there s a leg off a chair and perhaps I was resolved said Caudle to know nothing and so went to sleep in my ignorance LECTURE XIV missus CAUDLE THINKS IT HIGH TIME THAT THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE SUMMER CLOTHING There Caudle If there s anything in the world I hate and you know it Caudle it is asking you for money I am sure for myself I d rather go without a thing a thousand times and I do the more shame of you to let me but there now there you fly out again WHAT DO I WANT NOW Why you must know what s wanted if you d any eyes or any pride for your children like any other father WHAT S THE MATTER AND WHAT AM I DRIVING AT Oh nonsense Caudle As if you didn t know I m sure if I d any money of my own I d never ask you for a farthing never it s painful to me goodness knows What do you say IF IT S PAINFUL WHY SO OFTEN DO IT Ha I suppose you call that a joke one of your club jokes I wish you d think a little more of people s feelings and less of your jokes As I say I only wish I d any money of my own If there is anything that humbles a poor woman it is coming to a man s pocket for every farthing It s dreadful Now Caudle if ever you kept awake you shall keep awake to night yes you shall hear me for it isn t often I speak and then you may go to sleep as soon as you like Pray do you know what month it is And did you see how the children looked at church to day like nobody else s children WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THEM Oh Caudle How can you ask Poor things weren t they all in their thick merinos and beaver bonnets What do you say WHAT OF IT What you ll tell me that you didn t see how the Briggs s girls in their new chips turned their noses up at em And you didn t see how the Browns looked at the Smiths and then at our dear girls as much as to say Poor creatures what figures for the month of May YOU DIDN T SEE IT The more shame for you you would if you d had the feelings of a parent but I m sorry to say Caudle you haven t I m sure those Briggs s girls the little minxes put me into such a pucker I could have pulled their ears for em over the pew What do you say I OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF TO OWN IT No mister Caudle the shame lies with you that don t let your children appear at church like other people s children that make em uncomfortable at their devotions poor things for how can it be otherwise when they see themselves dressed like nobody else Now Caudle it s no use talking those children shall not cross the threshold next Sunday if they haven t things for the summer Now mind they sha n t and there s an end of it I won t have em exposed to the Briggs s and the Browns again no they shall know they have a mother if they ve no father to feel for em What do you say Caudle A GOOD DEAL I MUST THINK OF CHURCH IF I THINK SO MUCH OF WHAT WE GO IN I only wish you thought as much as I do you d be a better man than you are Caudle I can tell you but that s nothing to do with it I m talking about decent clothes for the children for the summer and you want to put me off with something about the church but that s so like you Caudle I M ALWAYS WANTING MONEY FOR CLOTHES How can you lie in your bed and say that I m sure there s no children in the world that cost their father so little but that s it the less a poor woman does upon the less she may It s the wives who don t care where the money comes from who re best thought of Oh if my time was to come over again would I mend and stitch and make the things go so far as I have done No that I wouldn t Yes it s very well for you to lie there and laugh it s easy to laugh Caudle very easy to people who don t feel Now Caudle dear What a man you are I know you ll give me the money because after all I think you love your children and like to see em well dressed It s only natural that a father should Eh Caudle eh Now you sha n t go to sleep till you ve told me HOW MUCH MONEY DO I WANT Why let me see love There s Caroline and Jane and Susannah and Mary Anne and What do you say I NEEDN T COUNT EM YOU KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE Ha that s just as you take me up Well how much money will it take Let me see and don t go to sleep I ll tell you in a minute You always love to see the dear things like new pins I know that Caudle and though I say it bless their little hearts they do credit to you Caudle Any nobleman of the land might be proud of em Now don t swear at noblemen of the land and ask me what they ve to do with your children you know what I meant But you ARE so hasty Caudle HOW MUCH Now don t be in a hurry Well I think with good pinching and you know Caudle there s never a wife who can pinch closer than I can I think with pinching I can do with twenty pounds What did you say TWENTY FIDDLESTICKS What YOU WON T GIVE HALF THE MONEY Very well mister Caudle I don t care let the children go in rags let them stop from church and grow up like heathens and cannibals and then you ll save your money and I suppose be satisfied YOU GAVE ME TWENTY POUNDS FIVE MONTHS AGO What s five months ago to do with now Besides what I HAVE had is nothing to do with it What do you say TEN POUNDS ARE ENOUGH Yes just like you men you think things cost nothing for women but you don t care how much you lay out upon yourselves THEY ONLY WANT BONNETS AND FROCKS How do you know what they want HOW should a man know anything at all about it And you won t give more than ten pounds Very well Then you may go shopping with it yourself and see what YOU LL make of it I ll have none of your ten pounds I can tell you No sir no you have no cause to say that I DON T WANT TO DRESS THE CHILDREN UP LIKE COUNTESSES You often fling that in my teeth you do but you know it s false Caudle you know it I only want to give em proper notions of themselves and what indeed CAN the poor things think when they see the Briggs s and the Browns and the Smiths and their fathers don t make the money you do Caudle when they see them as fine as tulips Why they must think themselves nobody and to think yourself nobody depend upon it Caudle isn t the way to make the world think anything of you What do you say WHERE DID I PICK UP THAT Where do you think I know a great deal more than you suppose yes though you don t give me credit for it Husbands seldom do However the twenty pounds I WILL have if I ve any or not a farthing No sir no I DON T WANT TO DRESS UP THE CHILDREN LIKE PEACOCKS AND PARROTS I only want to make em respectable and what do you say YOU LL GIVE FIFTEEN POUNDS No Caudle no not a penny will I take under twenty if I did it would seem as if I wanted to waste your money and I m sure when I come to think of it twenty pounds will hardly do Still if you ll give me twenty no it s no use your offering fifteen and wanting to go to sleep You sha n t close an eye until you promise me twenty Come Caudle love twenty and then you may go to sleep Twenty twenty twenty My impression is writes Caudle that I fell asleep sticking firmly to the fifteen but in the morning missus Caudle assured me as a woman of honour that she wouldn t let me wink an eye before I promised the twenty and man is frail and woman is strong she had the money LECTURE XV mister CAUDLE HAS AGAIN STAYED OUT LATE missus CAUDLE AT FIRST INJURED AND VIOLENT MELTS Perhaps mister Caudle you ll tell me where this is to end Though goodness knows I needn t ask THAT The end is plain enough Out out out Every night every night I m sure men who can t come home at reasonable hours have no business with wives they have no right to destroy other people if they choose to go to destruction themselves Ha lord Oh dear I only hope none of my girls will ever marry I hope they ll none of em ever be the slave their poor mother is they shan t if I can help it What do you say NOTHING Well I don t wonder at that mister Caudle you ought to be ashamed to speak I don t wonder that you can t open your mouth I m only astonished that at such hours you have the confidence to knock at your own door Though I m your wife I must say it I do sometimes wonder at your impudence What do you say NOTHING Ha you are an aggravating creature Caudle lying there like the mummy of a man and never as much as opening your lips to one Just as if your own wife wasn t worth answering It isn t so when you re out I m sure Oh no then you can talk fast enough here there s no getting a word from you But you treat your wife as no other man does and you know it Out out every night What YOU HAVEN T BEEN OUT THIS WEEK BEFORE That s nothing at all to do with it You might just as well be out all the week as once just And I should like to know what could keep you out till these hours BUSINESS Oh yes I dare say Pretty business a married man and the father of a family must have out of doors at one in the morning What I SHALL DRIVE YOU MAD Oh no you haven t feelings enough to go mad you d be a better man Caudle if you had WILL I LISTEN TO YOU What s the use Of course you ve some story to put me off with you can all do that and laugh at us afterwards No Caudle don t say that I m not always trying to find fault not I It s you I never speak but when there s occasion and what in my time I ve put up with there isn t anybody in the world that knows WILL I HEAR YOUR STORY Oh you may tell it if you please go on only mind I sha n t believe a word of it I m not such a fool as other women are I can tell you There now don t begin to swear but go on And that s your story is it That s your excuse for the hours you keep That s your apology for undermining my health and ruining your family What do you think your children will say of you when they grow up going and throwing away your money upon good for nothing pot house acquaintance HE S NOT A POT HOUSE ACQUAINTANCE Who is he then Come you haven t told me that but I know it s that Prettyman Yes to be sure it is Upon my life Well if I ve hardly patience to lie in the bed I ve wanted a silver teapot these five years and you must go and throw away as much money as what YOU HAVEN T THROWN IT AWAY Haven t you Then my name s not Margaret that s all I know A man gets arrested and because he s taken from his wife and family and locked up you must go and trouble your head with it And you must be mixing yourself up with nasty sheriff s officers pah I m sure you re not fit to enter a decent house and go running from lawyer to lawyer to get bail and settle the business as you call it A pretty settlement you ll make of it mark my words Yes and to mend the matter to finish it quite you must be one of the bail That any man who isn t a born fool should do such a thing for another Do you think anybody would do as much for you YES You say yes Well I only wish just to show that I m right I only wish you were in a condition to try em I should only like to see you arrested You d find the difference that you would What s other people s affairs to you If you were locked up depend upon it there s not a soul would come near you No it s all very fine now when people think there isn t a chance of your being in trouble but I should only like to see what they d say to you if YOU were in a sponging house Yes I should enjoy THAT just to show you that I m always right What do you say YOU THINK BETTER OF THE WORLD Ha that would be all very well if you could afford it but you re not in means I know to think so well of people as all that And of course they only laugh at you Caudle s an easy fool they cry I know it as well as if I heard em Caudle s an easy fool anybody may lead him Yes anybody but his own wife and she of course is nobody And now everybody that s arrested will of course send to you Yes mister Caudle you ll have your hands full now no doubt of it You ll soon know every sponging house and every sheriff s officer in London Your business will have to take care of itself you ll have enough to do to run from lawyer to lawyer after the business of other people Now it s no use calling me a dear soul not a bit No and I shan t put it off till to morrow It isn t often I speak but I WILL speak now I wish that Prettyman had been at the bottom of the sea before what IT ISN T PRETTYMAN Ah it s very well for you to say so but I know it is it s just like him He looks like a man that s always in debt that s always in a sponging house Anybody might swear it I knew it from the very first time you brought him here from the very night he put his nasty dirty wet boots on my bright steel fender Any woman could see what the fellow was in a minute Prettyman a pretty gentleman truly to be robbing your wife and family Why couldn t you let him stop in the sponging Now don t call upon heaven in that way and ask me to be quiet for I won t Why couldn t you let him stop there He got himself in he might have got himself out again And you must keep me awake ruin my sleep my health and for what you care my peace of mind Ha everybody but you can see how I m breaking You can do all this while you re talking with a set of low bailiffs A great deal you must think of your children to go into a lawyer s office And then you must be bail you must be bound for mister Prettyman You may say bound Yes you ve your hands nicely tied now How he laughs at you and serve you right Why in another week he ll be in the East Indies of course he will And you ll have to pay his debts yes your children may go in rags so that mister Prettyman what do you say IT ISN T PRETTYMAN I know better Well if it isn t Prettyman that s kept you out if it isn t Prettyman you re bail for who is it then I ask who is it then What MY BROTHER BROTHER TOM Oh Caudle dear Caudle It was too much for the poor soul says Caudle she sobbed as if her heart would break and I and here the MS is blotted as though Caudle himself had dropped tears as he wrote LECTURE XVI BABY IS TO BE CHRISTENED missus CAUDLE CANVASSES THE MERITS OF PROBABLE GODFATHERS Come now love about baby s name The dear thing s three months old and not a name to its back yet There you go again Talk of it to morrow No we ll talk of it to night There s no having a word with you in the daytime but here you can t leave me Now don t say you wish you could Caudle that s unkind and not treating a wife especially the wife to you as she deserves It isn t often that I speak but I DO believe you d like never to hear the sound of my voice I might as well have been born dumb I suppose the baby MUST have a godfather and so Caudle who shall we have Who do you think will be able to do the most for it No Caudle no I m not a selfish woman nothing of the sort but I hope I ve the feelings of a mother and what s the use of a godfather if he gives nothing else to the child but a name A child might almost as well not be christened at all And so who shall we have What do you say ANYBODY Aren t you ashamed of yourself Caudle Don t you think something will happen to you to talk in that way I don t know where you pick up such principles I m thinking who there is among our acquaintance who can do the most for the blessed creature and you say ANYBODY Caudle you re quite a heathen There s Wagstaff No chance of his ever marrying and he s very fond of babies He s plenty of money Caudle and I think he might be got Babies I know it babies are his weak side Wouldn t it be a blessed thing to find our dear child in his will Why don t you speak I declare Caudle you seem to care no more for the child than if it was a stranger s People who can t love children more than you do ought never to have em YOU DON T LIKE WAGSTAFF No more do I much but what s that to do with it People who ve their families to provide for mustn t think of their feelings I don t like him but then I m a mother and love my baby YOU WON T HAVE WAGSTAFF AND THAT S FLAT Ha Caudle you re like nobody else not fit for this world you re not What do you think of Pugsby I can t bear his wife but that s nothing to do with it I know my duty to my babe I wish other people did What do you say PUGSBY S A WICKED FELLOW Ha that s like you always giving people a bad name We mustn t always believe what the world says Caudle it doesn t become us as Christians to do it I only know that he hasn t chick or child and besides that he s very strong interest in the Blue coats and so if Pugsby Now don t fly out at the man in that manner Caudle you ought to be ashamed of yourself You can t speak well of anybody Where DO you think to go to What do you say then to Sniggins Now don t bounce round in that way letting the cold air into the bed What s the matter with Sniggins YOU WOULDN T ASK HIM A FAVOUR FOR THE WORLD Well it s a good thing the baby has somebody to care for it I will What do you say I SHAN T I will I can tell you Sniggins besides being a warm man has good interest in the Customs and there s nice pickings there if one only goes the right way to get em It s no use Caudle your fidgetting about not a bit I m not going to have baby lost sacrificed I may say like its brothers and sisters WHAT DO I MEAN BY SACRIFICED Oh you know what I mean very well What have any of em got by their godfathers beyond a half pint mug a knife and fork and spoon and a shabby coat that I know was bought second hand for I could almost swear to the place And then there was your fine friend Hartley s wife what did she give to Caroline Why a trumpery lace cap it made me blush to look at What IT WAS THE BEST SHE COULD AFFORD Then she d no right to stand for the child People who can t do better than that have no business to take the responsibility of godmother They ought to know their duties better Well Caudle you can t object to Goldman YES YOU DO Was there ever such a man What for HE S A USURER AND A HUNKS Well I m sure you ve no business in this world Caudle you have such high flown notions Why isn t the man as rich as the bank And as for his being a usurer isn t it all the better for those who come after him I m sure it s well there s some people in the world who save money seeing the stupid creatures who throw it away But you are the strangest man I really believe you think money a sin instead of the greatest blessing for I can t mention any of our acquaintance that s rich and I m sure we don t know too many such people that you haven t something to say against em It s only beggars that you like people with not a shilling to bless themselves Ha though you re my husband I must say it you re a man of low notions Caudle I only hope none of the dear boys will take after their father And I should like to know what s the objection to Goldman The only thing against him is his name I must confess it I don t like the name of Lazarus it s low and doesn t sound genteel not at all respectable But after he s gone and done what s proper for the child the boy could easily slip Lazarus into Laurence I m told the thing s done often No Caudle don t say that I m not a mean woman certainly not quite the reverse I ve only a parent s love for my children and I must say it I wish everybody felt as I did I suppose if the truth was known you d like your tobacco pipe friend your pot companion Prettyman to stand for the child YOU D HAVE NO OBJECTION I thought not Yes I knew what it was coming to He s a beggar he is and a person who stays out half the night yes he does and it s no use your denying it a beggar and a tippler and that s the man you d make godfather to your own flesh and blood Upon my word Caudle it s enough to make a woman get up and dress herself to hear you talk Well I can hardly tell you if you won t have Wagstaff or Pugsby or Sniggins or Goldman or somebody that s respectable to do what s proper the child sha n t be christened at all As for Prettyman or any such raff no never I m sure there s a certain set of people that poverty s catching from and that Prettyman s one of em Now Caudle I won t have my dear child lost by any of your spittoon acquaintance I can tell you No unless I can have MY way the child sha n t be christened at all What do you say IT MUST HAVE A NAME There s no must at all in the case none No it shall have no name and then see what the world will say I ll call it Number Six yes that will do as well as anything else unless I ve the godfather I like Number Six Caudle ha ha I think that must make you ashamed of yourself if anything can Number Six Caudle a much better name than mister Prettyman could give yes Number Six What do you say ANYTHING BUT NUMBER SEVEN Oh Caudle if ever At this moment writes Caudle little Number Six began to cry and taking advantage of the happy accident I somehow got to sleep LECTURE XVII CAUDLE IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY HAS VENTURED TO QUESTION THE ECONOMY OF WASHING AT HOME Pooh A pretty temper you come to bed in mister Caudle I can see Oh don t deny it I think I ought to know by this time But it s always the way whenever I get up a few things the house can hardly hold you Nobody cries out more about clean linen than you do and nobody leads a poor woman so miserable a life when she tries to make her husband comfortable Yes mister Caudle comfortable You needn t keep chewing the word as if you couldn t swallow it WAS THERE EVER SUCH A WOMAN No Caudle I hope not I should hope no other wife was ever put upon as I am It s all very well for you I can t have a little wash at home like anybody else but you must go about the house swearing to yourself and looking at your wife as if she was your bitterest enemy But I suppose you d rather we didn t wash at all Yes then you d be happy To be sure you would you d like to have all the children in their dirt like potatoes anything so that it didn t disturb you I wish you d had a wife who never washed SHE D have suited you she would Yes a fine lady who d have let your children go that you might have scraped em She d have been much better cared for than I am I only wish I could let all of you go without clean linen at all yes all of you I wish I could And if I wasn t a slave to my family unlike anybody else I should No mister Caudle the house isn t tossed about in water as if it was Noah s Ark And you ought to be ashamed of yourself to talk of Noah s Ark in that loose manner I m sure I don t know what I ve done to be married to a man of such principles No and the whole house DOESN T taste of soap suds either and if it did any other man but yourself would be above naming it I suppose I don t like washing day any more than yourself What do you say YES I DO Ha you re wrong there mister Caudle No I don t like it because it makes everybody else uncomfortable No and I ought not to have been born a mermaid that I might always have been in water A mermaid indeed What next will you call me But no man mister Caudle says such things to his wife as you However as I ve said before it can t last long that s one comfort What do you say YOU RE GLAD OF IT You re a brute mister Caudle No you DIDN T mean washing I know what you mean A pretty speech to a woman who s been the wife to you I have You ll repent it when it s too late yes I wouldn t have your feelings when I m gone Caudle no not for the Bank of England And when we only wash once a fortnight Ha I only wish you had some wives they d wash once a week Besides if once a fortnight s too much for you why don t you give me money that we may have things to go a month Is it MY fault if we re short What do you say MY ONCE A FORTNIGHT LASTS THREE DAYS No it doesn t never well very seldom and that s the same thing Can I help it if the blacks will fly and the things must be rinsed again Don t say that I m NOT made happy by the blacks and they DON T prolong my enjoyment and more than that you re an unfeeling man to say so You re enough to make a woman wish herself in her grave you are Caudle And a pretty example you set to your sons Because we d a little wash to day and there wasn t a hot dinner and who thinks of getting anything hot for washer women because you hadn t everything as you always have it you must swear at the cold mutton and you don t know what that mutton costs a pound I dare say you must swear at a sweet wholesome joint like a lord What YOU DIDN T SWEAR Yes it s very well for you to say so but I know when you re swearing and you swear when you little think it and I say you must go on swearing as you did and seize your hat like a savage and rush out of the house and go and take your dinner at a tavern A pretty wife people must think you have when they find you dining at a public house A nice home they must think you have mister Caudle What YOU LL DO SO EVERY TIME I WASH Very well mister Caudle very well We ll soon see who s tired of that first for I ll wash a stocking a day if that s all sooner than you should have everything as you like Ha that s so like you you d trample everybody under foot if you could you know you would Caudle so don t deny it Now if you begin to shout in that manner I ll leave the bed It s very hard that I can t say a single word to you but you must almost raise the place YOU DIDN T SHOUT I don t know what you call shouting then I m sure the people must hear you in the next house No it won t do to call me soft names now Caudle I m not the fool that I was when I was first married I know better now You re to treat me in the manner you have all day and then at night the only time and place when I can get a word in you want to go to sleep How can you be so mean Caudle What WHY CAN T I PUT THE WASHING OUT Now you have asked that a thousand times but it s no use Caudle so don t ask it again I won t put it out What do you say missus PRETTYMAN SAYS IT S QUITE AS CHEAP Pray what s missus Prettyman to me I should think mister Caudle that I know very well how to take care of my family without missus Prettyman s advice missus Prettyman indeed I only wish she d come here that I might tell her so missus Prettyman But perhaps she d better come and take care of your house for you Oh yes I ve no doubt she d do it much better than I do MUCH No Caudle I WON T HOLD MY TONGUE I think I ought to be mistress of my own washing by this time and after the wife I ve been to you it s cruel of you to go on as you do Don t tell me about putting the washing out I say it isn t so cheap I don t care whether you wash by the dozen or not it isn t so cheap I ve reduced everything and I save at least a shilling a week What do you say A TRUMPERY SHILLING Ha I only hope to goodness you ll not come to want talking of shillings in the way you do Now don t begin about your comfort don t go on aggravating me and asking me if your comfort s not worth a shilling a week That s nothing at all to do with it nothing but that s your way when I talk of one thing you talk of another that s so like you men and you know it Allow me to tell you mister Caudle that a shilling a week is two pound twelve a year and take two pound twelve a year for let us say thirty years and well you needn t groan mister Caudle I don t suppose it will be so long oh no you ll have somebody else to look after your washing long before that and if it wasn t for my dear children s sake I shouldn t care how soon You know my mind and so good night mister Caudle Thankful for her silence writes Caudle I was fast dropping to sleep when jogging my elbow my wife observed Mind there s the cold mutton to morrow nothing hot till that s gone Remember too as it was a short wash to day we wash again on Wednesday LECTURE XVIII CAUDLE WHILST WALKING WITH HIS WIFE HAS BEEN BOWED TO BY A YOUNGER AND EVEN PRETTIER WOMAN THAN missus CAUDLE If I m not to leave the house without being insulted mister Caudle I had better stay indoors all my life What Don t tell me to let you have ONE night s rest I wonder at your impudence It s mighty fine I never can go out with you and goodness knows it s seldom enough without having my feelings torn to pieces by people of all sorts A set of bold minxes WHAT AM I RAVING ABOUT Oh you know very well very well indeed mister Caudle A pretty person she must be to nod to a man walking with his own wife Don t tell me that it s Miss Prettyman what s Miss Prettyman to me Oh YOU VE MET HER ONCE OR TWICE AT HER BROTHER S HOUSE Yes I dare say you have no doubt of it I always thought there was something very tempting about that house and now I know it all Now it s no use mister Caudle your beginning to talk loud and twist and toss your arms about as if you were as innocent as a born babe I m not to be deceived by such tricks now No there was a time when I was a fool and believed anything but I thank my stars I ve got over that A bold minx You suppose I didn t see her laugh too when she nodded to you Oh yes I knew what she thought me a poor miserable creature of course I could see that No don t say so Caudle I DON T always see more than anybody else but I can t and won t be blind however agreeable it might be to you I must have the use of my senses I m sure if a woman wants attention and respect from a man she d better be anything than his wife I ve always thought so and to day s decided it No I m not ashamed of myself to talk so certainly not A GOOD AMIABLE YOUNG CREATURE INDEED Yes I dare say very amiable no doubt Of course you think her so You suppose I didn t see what sort of a bonnet she had on Oh a very good creature And you think I didn t see the smudges of court plaster about her face YOU DIDN T SEE EM Very likely but I did Very amiable to be sure What do you say I MADE HER BLUSH AT MY ILL MANNERS I should have liked to have seen her blush Twould have been rather difficult mister Caudle for a blush to come through all that paint No I m not a censorious woman mister Caudle quite the reverse No and you may threaten to get up if you like I will speak I know what colour is and I say it WAS paint I believe mister Caudle I once had a complexion though of course you ve quite forgotten that I think I once had a colour before your conduct destroyed it Before I knew you people used to call me the Lily and Rose but what are you laughing at I see nothing to laugh at But as I say anybody before your own wife And I can t walk out with you but you re bowed to by every woman you meet WHAT DO I MEAN BY EVERY WOMAN WHEN IT S ONLY MISS PRETTYMAN That s nothing at all to do with it How do I know who bows to you when I m not by Everybody of course And if they don t look at you why you look at them Oh I m sure you do You do it even when I m out with you and of course you do it when I m away Now don t tell me Caudle don t deny it The fact is it s become such a dreadful habit with you that you don t know when you do it and when you don t But I do Miss Prettyman indeed What do you say YOU WON T LIE STILL AND HEAR ME SCANDALISE THAT EXCELLENT YOUNG WOMAN Oh of course you ll take her part Though to be sure she may not be so much to blame after all For how is she to know you re married You re never seen out of doors with your own wife never Wherever you go you go alone Of course people think you re a bachelor What do you say YOU WELL KNOW YOU RE NOT That s nothing to do with it I only ask What must people think when I m never seen with you Other women go out with their husbands but as I ve often said I m not like any other woman What are you sneering at mister Caudle HOW DO I KNOW YOU RE SNEERING Don t tell me I know well enough by the movement of the pillow No you never take me out and you know it No and it s not my own fault How can you lie there and say that Oh all a poor excuse That s what you always say You re tired of asking me indeed because I always start some objection Of course I can t go out a figure And when you ask me to go you know very well that my bonnet isn t as it should be or that my gown hasn t come home or that I can t leave the children or that something keeps me indoors You know all this well enough before you ask me And that s your art And when I DO go out with you I m sure to suffer for it Yes you needn t repeat my words SUFFER FOR IT But you suppose I have no feelings oh no nobody has feelings but yourself Yes I d forgot Miss Prettyman perhaps yes she may have feelings of course And as I ve said I dare say a pretty dupe people think me To be sure a poor forlorn creature I must look in everybody s eyes But I knew you couldn t be at mister Prettyman s house night after night till eleven o clock and a great deal you thought of me sitting up for you I knew you couldn t be there without some cause And now I ve found it out Oh I don t mind your swearing mister Caudle It s I if I wasn t a woman who ought to swear But it s like you men Lords of the creation as you call yourselves Lords indeed And pretty slaves you make of the poor creatures who re tied to you But I ll be separated Caudle I will and then I ll take care and let all the world know how you ve used me What do you say I MAY SAY MY WORST Ha don t you tempt any woman in that way don t Caudle for I wouldn t answer for what I said Miss Prettyman indeed and oh yes now I see Now the whole light breaks in upon me Now I know why you wished me to ask her with mister and missus Prettyman to tea And I like a poor blind fool was nearly doing it But now as I say my eyes are open And you d have brought her under my own roof now it s no use your bouncing about in that fashion you d have brought her into the very house where Here says Caudle I could endure it no longer So I jumped out of bed and went and slept somehow with the children LECTURE XIX missus CAUDLE THINKS IT WOULD LOOK WELL TO KEEP THEIR WEDDING DAY Caudle love do you know what next Sunday is NO YOU DON T Well was there ever such a strange man Can t you guess darling Next Sunday dear Think love a minute just think WHAT AND YOU DON T KNOW NOW Ha if I hadn t a better memory than you I don t know how we should ever get on Well then pet shall I tell you what next Sunday is Why then it s our wedding day What are you groaning at mister Caudle I don t see anything to groan at If anybody should groan I m sure it isn t you No I rather think it s I who ought to groan Oh dear That s fourteen years ago You were a very different man then mister Caudle What do you say AND I WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WOMAN Not at all just the same Oh you needn t roll your head about on the pillow in that way I say just the same Well then if I m altered whose fault is it Not mine I m sure certainly not Don t tell me that I couldn t talk at all then I could talk just as well then as I can now only then I hadn t the same cause It s you who ve made me talk What do you say YOU RE VERY SORRY FOR IT Caudle you do nothing but insult me Ha you were a good tempered nice creature fourteen years ago and would have done anything for me Yes yes if a woman would be always cared for she should never marry There s quite an end of the charm when she goes to church We re all angels while you re courting us but once married how soon you pull our wings off No mister Caudle I m not talking nonsense but the truth is you like to hear nobody talk but yourself Nobody ever tells me that I talk nonsense but you Now it s no use your turning and turning about in that way it s not a bit of what do you say YOU LL GET UP No you won t mister Caudle you ll not serve me that trick again for I ve locked the door and hid the key There s no getting hold of you all the day time but here you can t leave me You needn t groan again mister Caudle Now Caudle dear do let us talk comfortably After all love there s a good many folks who I daresay don t get on half so well as we ve done We ve both our little tempers perhaps but you ARE aggravating you must own that Caudle Well never mind we won t talk of it I won t scold you now We ll talk of next Sunday love We never have kept our wedding day and I think it would be a nice day to have our friends What do you say THEY D THINK IT HYPOCRISY No hypocrisy at all I m sure I try to be comfortable and if ever man was happy you ought to be No Caudle no it isn t nonsense to keep wedding days it isn t a deception on the world and if it is how many people do it I m sure it s only a proper compliment that a man owes to his wife Look at the Winkles don t they give a dinner every year Well I know and if they do fight a little in the course of the twelvemonth that s nothing to do with it They keep their wedding day and their acquaintance have nothing to do with anything else As I say Caudle it s only a proper compliment that a man owes to his wife to keep his wedding day It s as much as to say to the whole world There if I had to marry again my blessed wife s the only woman I d choose Well I see nothing to groan at mister Caudle no nor to sigh at either but I know what you mean I m sure what would have become of you if you hadn t married as you have done why you d have been a lost creature I know it I know your habits Caudle and I don t like to say it but you d have been little better than a ragamuffin Nice scrapes you d have got into I know if you hadn t had me for a wife The trouble I ve had to keep you respectable and what s my thanks Ha I only wish you d had some women But we won t quarrel Caudle No you don t mean anything I know We ll have this little dinner eh Just a few friends Now don t say you don t care that isn t the way to speak to a wife and especially the wife I ve been to you Caudle Well you agree to the dinner eh Now don t grunt mister Caudle but speak out You ll keep your wedding day What IF I LET YOU GO TO SLEEP Ha that s unmanly Caudle Can t you say Yes without anything else I say can t you say Yes There bless you I knew you would And now Caudle what shall we have for dinner No we won t talk of it to morrow we ll talk of it now and then it will be off my mind I should like something particular something out of the way just to show that we thought the day something I should like mister Caudle you re not asleep WHAT DO I WANT Why you know I want to settle about the dinner HAVE WHAT I LIKE No as it s your fancy to keep the day it s only right that I should try to please you We never had one Caudle so what do you think of a haunch of venison What do you say MUTTON WILL DO Ha that shows what you think of your wife I dare say if it was with any of your club friends any of your pot house companions you d have no objection to venison I say if what do you mutter LET IT BE VENISON Very well And now about the fish What do you think of a nice turbot No mister Caudle brill won t do it shall be turbot or there sha n t be any fish at all Oh what a mean man you are Caudle Shall it be turbot IT SHALL Very well And now about the soup now Caudle don t swear at the soup in that manner you know there must be soup Well once in a way and just to show our friends how happy we ve been we ll have some real turtle NO YOU WON T YOU LL HAVE NOTHING BUT MOCK Then mister Caudle you may sit at the table by yourself Mock turtle on a wedding day Was there ever such an insult What do you say LET IT BE REAL THEN FOR ONCE Ha Caudle As I say you were a very different person fourteen years ago And Caudle you ll look after the venison There s a place I know somewhere in the City where you get it beautiful You ll look to it YOU WILL Very well And now who shall we invite WHO I LIKE Now you know Caudle that s nonsense because I only like whom you like I suppose the Prettymans must come But understand Caudle I don t have Miss Prettyman I m not going to have my peace of mind destroyed under my own roof if she comes I don t appear at the table What do you say VERY WELL Very well be it then And now Caudle you ll not forget the venison In the City my dear You ll not forget the venison A haunch you know a nice haunch And you ll not forget the venison Three times did I fall off to sleep says Caudle and three times did my wife nudge me with her elbow exclaiming You ll not forget the venison At last I got into a sound slumber and dreamt I was a pot of currant jelly LECTURE XX BROTHER CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO A MASONIC CHARITABLE DINNER missus CAUDLE HAS HIDDEN THE BROTHER S CHEQUE BOOK But all I say is this I only wish I d been born a man What do you say YOU WISH I HAD mister Caudle I ll not lie quiet in my own bed to be insulted Oh yes you DID mean to insult me I know what you mean You mean if I HAD been born a man you d never have married me That s a pretty sentiment I think and after the wife I ve been to you And now I suppose you ll be going to public dinners every day It s no use your telling me you ve only been to one before that s nothing to do with it nothing at all Of course you ll be out every night now I knew what it would come to when you were made a mason when you were once made a brother as you call yourself I knew where the husband and father would be I m sure Caudle and though I m your own wife I grieve to say it I m sure you haven t so much heart that you have any to spare for people out of doors Indeed I should like to see the man who has No no Caudle I m by no means a selfish woman quite the contrary I love my fellow creatures as a wife and mother of a family who has only to look to her own husband and children ought to love em A brother indeed What would you say if I was to go and be made a sister Why I know very well the house wouldn t hold you WHERE S YOUR WATCH How should I know where your watch is You ought to know But to be sure people who go to public dinners never know where anything is when they come home You ve lost it no doubt and twill serve you quite right if you have If it should be gone and nothing more likely I wonder if any of your brothers will give you another Catch em doing it YOU MUST FIND YOUR WATCH AND YOU LL GET UP FOR IT Nonsense don t be foolish lie still Your watch is on the mantelpiece Ha isn t it a good thing for you you ve somebody to take care of it What do you say I M A DEAR CREATURE Very dear indeed you think me I dare say But the fact is you don t know what you re talking about to night I m a fool to open my lips to you but I can t help it WHERE S YOUR WATCH Haven t I told you on the mantelpiece ALL RIGHT INDEED Pretty conduct you men call all right There now hold your tongue mister Caudle and go to sleep I m sure tis the best thing you can do to night You ll be able to listen to reason to morrow morning now it s thrown away upon you WHERE S YOUR CHEQUE BOOK Never mind your cheque book I took care of that WHAT BUSINESS HAD I TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET Every business No no If you choose to go to public dinners why as I m only your wife I can t help it But I know what fools men are made of there and if I know it you never take your cheque book again with you What Didn t I see your name down last year for ten pounds Job Caudle esquire ten pounds It looked very well in the newspapers of course and you thought yourself a somebody when they knocked the tavern tables but I only wish I d been there yes I only wish I d been in the gallery If I wouldn t have told a piece of my mind I m not alive Ten pounds indeed and the world thinks you a very fine person for it I only wish I could bring the world here and show em what s wanted at home I think the world would alter their mind then yes a little What do you say A WIFE HAS NO RIGHT TO PICK HER HUSBAND S POCKET A pretty husband you are to talk in that way Never mind you can t prosecute her for it or I ve no doubt you would none at all Some men would do anything What YOU VE A BIT OF A HEADACHE I hope you have and a good bit too You ve been to the right place for it No I won t hold my tongue It s all very well for you men to go to taverns and talk and toast and hurrah and I wonder you re not all ashamed of yourselves to drink the Queen s health with all the honours I believe you call it yes pretty honours you pay to the sex I say I wonder you re not ashamed to drink that blessed creature s health when you ve only to think how you use your own wives at home But the hypocrites that the men are oh WHERE S YOUR WATCH Haven t I told you It s under your pillow there you needn t be feeling for it I tell you it s under your pillow IT S ALL RIGHT Yes a great deal you know of what s right just now Ha was there ever any poor soul used as I am I M A DEAR CREATURE Pah mister Caudle I ve only to say I m tired of your conduct quite tired and don t care how soon there s an end of it WHY DID I TAKE YOUR CHEQUE BOOK I ve told you to save you from ruin mister Caudle YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE RUINED Ha you don t know anything when you re out I know what they do at those public dinners charities they call em pretty charities True Charity I believe always dines at home I know what they do the whole system s a trick No I M NOT A STONY HEARTED CREATURE and you ought to be ashamed to say so of your wife and the mother of your children but you ll not make me cry to night I can tell you I was going to say that oh you re such an aggravating man I don t know what I was going to say THANK HEAVEN What for I don t see that there s anything to thank Heaven about I was going to say I know the trick of public dinners They get a lord or a duke if they can catch him anything to make people say they dined with nobility that s it yes they get one of these people with a star perhaps in his coat to take the chair and to talk all sorts of sugar plum things about charity and to make foolish men with wine in em feel that they ve no end of money and then shutting their eyes to their wives and families at home all the while that their own faces are red and flushed like poppies and they think to morrow will never come then they get em to put their hand to paper Then they make em pull out their cheques But I took your book mister Caudle you couldn t do it a second time What are you laughing at NOTHING It s no matter I shall see it in the paper to morrow for if you gave anything you were too proud to hide it I know YOUR charity WHERE S YOUR WATCH Haven t I told you fifty times where it is In the pocket over your head of course Can t you hear it tick No you can hear nothing to night And now mister Caudle I should like to know whose hat you ve brought home You went out with a beaver worth three and twenty shillings the second time you ve worn it and you bring home a thing that no Jew in his senses would give me fivepence for I couldn t even get a pot of primroses and you know I always turn your old hats into roots not a pot of primroses for it I m certain of it now I ve often thought it but now I m sure that some people dine out only to change their hats WHERE S YOUR WATCH Caudle you re bringing me to an early grave WE HOPE THAT CAUDLE WAS PENITENT FOR HIS CONDUCT INDEED THERE IS WE THINK EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS SO FOR TO THIS LECTURE HE HAS APPENDED NO COMMENT THE MAN HAD NOT THE FACE TO DO IT LECTURE XXI mister CAUDLE HAS NOT ACTED LIKE A HUSBAND AT THE WEDDING DINNER Ah me It s no use wishing none at all but I do wish that yesterday fourteen years could come back again Little did I think mister Caudle when you brought me home from church your lawful wedded wife little I say did I think that I should keep my wedding dinner in the manner I have done to day Fourteen years ago Yes I see you now in your blue coat with bright buttons and your white watered satin waistcoat and a moss rose bud in your button hole which you said was like me What YOU NEVER TALKED SUCH NONSENSE Ha mister Caudle you don t know what you talked that day but I do Yes and you then sat at the table as if your face as I may say was buttered with happiness and What No mister Caudle don t say that I have not wiped the butter off not I If you above all men are not happy you ought to be gracious knows Yes I WILL talk of fourteen years ago Ha you sat beside me then and picked out all sorts of nice things for me You d have given me pearls and diamonds to eat if I could have swallowed em Yes I say you sat beside me and What do you talk about YOU COULDN T SIT BESIDE ME TO DAY That s nothing at all to do with it But it s so like you I can t speak but you fly off to something else Ha and when the health of the young couple was drunk what a speech you made then It was delicious How you made everybody cry as if their hearts were breaking and I recollect it as if it was yesterday how the tears ran down dear father s nose and how dear mother nearly went into a fit Dear souls They little thought with all your fine talk how you d use me HOW HAVE YOU USED ME Oh mister Caudle how can you ask that question It s well for you I can t see you blush HOW have you used me Well that the same tongue could make a speech like that and then talk as it did to day HOW DID YOU TALK Why shamefully What did you say about your wedded happiness Why nothing What did you say about your wife Worse than nothing just as if she were a bargain you were sorry for but were obliged to make the best of What do you say AND BAD S THE BEST If you say that again Caudle I ll rise from my bed YOU DIDN T SAY IT What then did you say Something very like it I know Yes a pretty speech of thanks for a husband And everybody could see that you didn t care a pin for me and that s why you had em here that s why you invited em to insult me to their faces What I MADE YOU INVITE EM Oh Caudle what an aggravating man you are I suppose you ll say next I made you invite Miss Prettyman Oh yes don t tell me that her brother brought her without you knowing it What DIDN T I HEAR HIM SAY SO Of course I did but do you suppose I m quite a fool Do you think I don t know that that was all settled between you And she must be a nice person to come unasked to a woman s house But I know why she came Oh yes she came to look about her Oh the meaning s plain enough She came to see how she should like the rooms how she should like my seat at the fireplace how she and if it isn t enough to break a mother s heart to be treated so how she should like my dear children Now it s no use your bouncing about at but of course that s it I can t mention Miss Prettyman but you fling about as if you were in a fit Of course that shows there s something in it Otherwise why should you disturb yourself Do you think I didn t see her looking at the ciphers on the spoons as if she already saw mine scratched out and hers there No I sha n t drive you mad mister Caudle and if I do it s your own fault No other man would treat the wife of his bosom in What do you say YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE MARRIED A HEDGEHOG Well now it s come to something But it s always the case Whenever you ve seen that Miss Prettyman I m sure to be abused A hedgehog A pretty thing for a woman to be called by her husband Now you don t think I ll lie quietly in bed and be called a hedgehog do you mister Caudle Well I only hope Miss Prettyman had a good dinner that s all I had none You know I had none how was I to get any You know that the only part of the turkey I care for is the merry thought And that of course went to Miss Prettyman Oh I saw you laugh when you put it on her plate And you don t suppose after such an insult as that I d taste another thing upon the table No I should hope I have more spirit than that Yes and you took wine with her four times What do you say ONLY TWICE Oh you were so lost fascinated mister Caudle yes fascinated that you didn t know what you did However I do think while I m alive I might be treated with respect at my own table I say while I m alive for I know I sha n t last long and then Miss Prettyman may come and take it all I m wasting daily and no wonder I never say anything about it but every week my gowns are taken in I ve lived to learn something to be sure Miss Prettyman turned up her nose at my custards It isn t sufficient that you are always finding fault yourself but you must bring women home to sneer at me at my own table What do you say SHE DIDN T TURN UP HER NOSE I know she did not but what it s needless Providence has turned it up quite enough for her already And she must give herself airs over my custards Oh I saw her mincing with the spoon as if she was chewing sand What do you say SHE PRAISED MY PLUM PUDDING Who asked her to praise it Like her impudence I think Yes a pretty day I ve passed I shall not forget this wedding day I think And as I say a pretty speech you made in the way of thanks No Caudle if I was to live a hundred years you needn t groan mister Caudle I shall not trouble you half that time if I was to live a hundred years I should never forget it Never You didn t even so much as bring one of your children into your speech And dear creatures what have THEY done to offend you No I shall not drive you mad It s you mister Caudle who ll drive me mad Everybody says so And you suppose I didn t see how it was managed that you and THAT Miss Prettyman were always partners at whist HOW WAS IT MANAGED Why plain enough Of course you packed the cards and could cut what you liked You d settled that between you Yes and when she took a trick instead of leading off a trump she play whist indeed what did you say to her when she found it was wrong Oh it was impossible that HER heart should mistake And this mister Caudle before people with your own wife in the room And Miss Prettyman I won t hold my tongue I WILL talk of Miss Prettyman who s she indeed that I shouldn t talk of her I suppose she thinks she sings What do you say SHE SINGS LIKE A MERMAID Yes very very like a mermaid for she never sings but she exposes herself She might I think have chosen another song I LOVE SOMEBODY indeed as if I didn t know who was meant by that somebody and all the room knew it of course and that was what it was done for nothing else However mister Caudle as my mind s made up I shall say no more about the matter to night but try to go to sleep And to my astonishment and gratitude writes Caudle she kept her word LECTURE XXII CAUDLE COMES HOME IN THE EVENING AS missus CAUDLE HAS JUST STEPPED OUT SHOPPING ON HER RETURN AT TEN CAUDLE REMONSTRATES mister Caudle you ought to have had a slave yes a black slave and not a wife I m sure I d better been born a negro at once much better WHAT S THE MATTER NOW Well I like that Upon my life mister Caudle that s very cool I can t leave the house just to buy a yard of riband but you storm enough to carry the roof off YOU DIDN T STORM YOU ONLY SPOKE Spoke indeed No sir I ve not such superfine feelings and I don t cry out before I m hurt But you ought to have married a woman of stone for you feel for nobody that is for nobody in your own house I only wish you d show some of your humanity at home if ever so little that s all What do you say WHERE S MY FEELINGS TO GO SHOPPING AT NIGHT When would you have me go In the broiling sun making my face like a gipsy s I don t see anything to laugh at mister Caudle but you think of anybody s face before your wife s Oh that s plain enough and all the world can see it I dare say now if it was Miss Prettyman s face now now mister Caudle What are you throwing yourself about for I suppose Miss Prettyman isn t so wonderful a person that she isn t to be named I suppose she s flesh and blood What YOU DON T KNOW Ha I don t know that What mister Caudle YOU LL HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM YOU LL NOT BE TORMENTED IN THIS MANNER No you won t sir not while I m alive A separate room And you call yourself a religious man mister Caudle I d advise you to take down the Prayer Book and read over the Marriage Service A separate room indeed Caudle you re getting quite a heathen A separate room Well the servants would talk then But no no man not the best that ever trod Caudle should ever make me look so contemptible I SHA N T go to sleep and you ought to know me better than to ask me to hold my tongue Because you come home when I ve just stepped out to do a little shopping you re worse than a fury I should like to know how many hours I sit up for you What do you say NOBODY WANTS ME TO SIT UP Ha that s like the gratitude of men just like em But a poor woman can t leave the house that what WHY CAN T I GO AT REASONABLE HOURS Reasonable What do you call eight o clock If I went out at eleven and twelve as you come home then you might talk but seven or eight o clock why it s the cool of the evening the nicest time to enjoy a walk and as I say do a little bit of shopping Oh yes mister Caudle I do think of the people that are kept in the shops just as much as you but that s nothing at all to do with it I know what you d have You d have all those young men let away early from the counter to improve what you please to call their minds Pretty notions you pick up among a set of free thinkers and I don t know what When I was a girl people never talked of minds intellect I believe you call it Nonsense a new fangled thing just come up and the sooner it goes out the better Don t tell me What are shops for if they re not to be open late and early too And what are shopmen if they re not always to attend upon their customers People pay for what they have I suppose and aren t to be told when they shall come and lay their money out and when they sha n t Thank goodness if one shop shuts another keeps open and I always think it a duty I owe to myself to go to the shop that s open last it s the only way to punish the shopkeepers that are idle and give themselves airs about early hours Besides there s some things I like to buy best at candle light Oh don t talk to me about humanity Humanity indeed for a pack of tall strapping young fellows some of em big enough to be shown for giants And what have they to do Why nothing but to stand behind a counter and talk civility Yes I know your notions you say that everybody works too much I know that You d have all the world do nothing half its time but twiddle its thumbs or walk in the parks or go to picture galleries and museums and such nonsense Very fine indeed but thank goodness the world isn t come to that pass yet What do you say I am mister Caudle A FOOLISH WOMAN THAT CAN T LOOK BEYOND MY OWN FIRESIDE Oh yes I can quite as far as you and a great deal farther But I can t go out shopping a little with my dear friend missus Wittles what do you laugh at Oh don t they Don t women know what friendship is Upon my life you ve a nice opinion of us Oh yes we can we can look outside of our own fenders mister Caudle And if we can t it s all the better for our families A blessed thing it would be for their wives and children if men couldn t either You wouldn t have lent that five pounds and I dare say a good many other five pounds that I know nothing of if you a lord of the creation had half the sense women have You seldom catch us I believe lending five pounds I should think not No we won t talk of it to morrow morning You re not going to wound my feelings when I come home and think I m to say nothing about it You have called me an inhuman person you have said I have no thought no feeling for the health and comfort of my fellow creatures I don t know what you haven t called me and only for buying a but I sha n t tell you what no I won t satisfy you there but you ve abused me in this manner and only for shopping up to ten o clock You ve a great deal of fine compassion you have I m sure the young man that served me could have knocked down an ox yes strong enough to lift a house but you can pity him oh yes you can be all kindness for him and for the world as you call it Oh Caudle what a hypocrite you are I only wish the world knew how you treated your poor wife What do you say FOR THE LOVE OF MERCY LET YOU SLEEP Mercy indeed I wish you could show a little of it to other people Oh yes I DO know what mercy means but that s no reason I should go shopping a bit earlier than I do and I won t No you ve preached this over to me again and again you ve made me go to meetings to hear about it but that s no reason women shouldn t shop just as late as they choose It s all very fine as I say for you men to talk to us at meetings where of course we smile and all that and sometimes shake our white pocket handkerchiefs and where you say we have the power of early hours in our own hands To be sure we have and we mean to keep it That is I do You ll never catch me shopping till the very last thing and as a matter of principle I ll always go to the shop that keeps open latest It does the young men good to keep em close to business Improve their minds indeed Let em out at seven and they d improve nothing but their billiards Besides if they want to improve themselves can t they get up this fine weather at three Where there s a will there s a way mister Caudle I thought writes Caudle that she had gone to sleep In this hope I was dozing off when she jogged me and thus declared herself Caudle you want nightcaps but see if I budge to buy em till nine at night LECTURE XXIII missus CAUDLE WISHES TO KNOW IF THEY RE GOING TO THE SEA SIDE OR NOT THIS SUMMER THAT S ALL Hot Yes it IS hot I m sure one might as well be in an oven as in town this weather You seem to forget it s July mister Caudle I ve been waiting quietly have never spoken yet not a word have you said of the seaside yet Not that I care for it myself oh no my health isn t of the slightest consequence And indeed I was going to say but I won t that the sooner perhaps I m out of this world the better Oh yes I dare say you think so of course you do else you wouldn t lie there saying nothing You re enough to aggravate a saint Caudle but you shan t vex me No I ve made up my mind and never intend to let you vex me again Why should I worry myself But all I want to ask you is this do you intend to go to the sea side this summer YES YOU LL GO TO GRAVESEND Then you ll go alone that s all I know Gravesend You might as well empty a salt cellar in the New River and call that the sea side What IT S HANDY FOR BUSINESS There you are again I can never speak of taking a little enjoyment but you fling business in my teeth I m sure you never let business stand in the way of your own pleasure mister Caudle not you It would be all the better for your family if you did You know that Matilda wants sea bathing you know it or ought to know it by the looks of the child and yet I know you Caudle you d have let the summer pass over and never said a word about the matter What do you say MARGATE S SO EXPENSIVE Not at all I m sure it will be cheaper for us in the end for if we don t go we shall all be ill every one of us in the winter Not that my health is of any consequence I know that well enough It never was yet You know Margate s the only place I can eat a breakfast at and yet you talk of Gravesend But what s my eating to you You wouldn t care if I never ate at all You never watch my appetite like any other husband otherwise you d have seen what it s come to What do you say HOW MUCH WILL IT COST There you are mister Caudle with your meanness again When you want to go yourself to Blackwall or to Greenwich you never ask how much will it cost What YOU NEVER GO TO BLACKWALL Ha I don t know that and if you don t that s nothing at all to do with it Yes you can give a guinea a plate for whitebait for yourself No sir I m not a foolish woman and I know very well what I m talking about nobody better A guinea for whitebait for yourself when you grudge a pint of shrimps for your poor family Eh YOU DON T GRUDGE EM ANYTHING Yes it s very well for you to lie there and say so WHAT WILL IT COST It s no matter what it will cost for we won t go at all now No we ll stay at home We shall all be ill in the winter every one of us all but you and nothing ever makes you ill I ve no doubt we shall all be laid up and there ll be a doctor s bill as long as a railroad but never mind that It s better much better to pay for nasty physic than for fresh air and wholesome salt water Don t call me woman and ask what it will cost I tell you if you were to lay the money down before me on that quilt I wouldn t go now certainly not It s better we should all be sick yes then you ll be pleased That s right mister Caudle go to sleep It s like your unfeeling self I m talking of our all being laid up and you like any stone turn round and begin to go to sleep Well I think that s a pretty insult HOW CAN YOU SLEEP WITH SUCH A SPLINTER IN YOUR FLESH I suppose you mean to call me the splinter and after the wife I ve been to you But no mister Caudle you may call me what you please you ll not make me cry now No no I don t throw away my tears upon any such person now What DON T Ha that s your ingratitude But none of you men deserve that any woman should love you My poor heart Everybody else can go out of town except us Ha If I d only married Simmons What WHY DIDN T I Yes that s all the thanks I get WHO S SIMMONS Oh you know very well who Simmons is He d have treated me a little better I think He WAS a gentleman YOU CAN T TELL May be not but I can With such weather as this to stay melting in London and when the painters are coming in YOU WON T HAVE THE PAINTERS IN But you must and if they once come in I m determined that none of us shall stir then Painting in July with a family in the house We shall all be poisoned of course but what do you care for that WHY CAN T I TELL YOU WHAT IT WILL COST How can I or any woman tell exactly what it will cost Of course lodgings and at Margate too are a little dearer than living at your own house POOH YOU KNOW THAT Well if you did mister Caudle I suppose there s no treason in naming it Still if you take em for two months they re cheaper than for one No mister Caudle I shall not be quite tired of it in one month No and it isn t true that I no sooner get out than I want to get home again To be sure I was tired of Margate three years ago when you used to leave me to walk about the beach by myself to be stared at through all sorts of telescopes But you don t do that again mister Caudle I can tell you WHAT WILL I DO AT MARGATE Why isn t there bathing and picking up shells and aren t there the packets with the donkeys and the last new novel whatever it is to read for the only place where I really relish a book is at the sea side No it isn t that I like salt with my reading mister Caudle I suppose you call that a joke You might keep your jokes for the daytime I think But as I was saying only you always will interrupt me the ocean always seems to me to open the mind I see nothing to laugh at but you always laugh when I say anything Sometimes at the sea side especially when the tide s down I feel so happy quite as if I could cry When shall I get the things ready For next Sunday WHAT WILL IT COST Oh there don t talk of it No we won t go I shall send for the painters to morrow What I CAN GO AND TAKE THE CHILDREN AND YOU LL STAY No sir you go with me or I don t stir I m not going to be turned loose like a hen with her chickens and nobody to protect me So we ll go on Monday Eh WHAT WILL IT COST What a man you are Why Caudle I ve been reckoning that with buff slippers and all we can t well do it under seventy pounds No I won t take away the slippers and say fifty It s seventy pounds and no less Of course what s over will be so much saved Caudle what a man you are Well shall we go on Monday What do you say YOU LL SEE There s a dear Then Monday Anything for a chance of peace writes Caudle I consented to the trip for I thought I might sleep better in a change of bed LECTURE XXIV missus CAUDLE DWELLS ON CAUDLE S CRUEL NEGLECT OF HER ON BOARD THE RED ROVER missus CAUDLE SO ILL WITH THE SEA THAT THEY PUT UP AT THE DOLPHIN HERNE BAY Caudle have you looked under the bed WHAT FOR Bless the man Why for thieves to be sure Do you suppose I d sleep in a strange bed without Don t tell me it s nonsense I shouldn t sleep a wink all night Not that you d care for that not that you d hush I m sure I heard somebody No it s not a bit like a mouse Yes that s like you laugh It would be no laughing matter if I m sure there IS somebody I m sure there is Yes mister Caudle now I AM satisfied Any other man would have got up and looked himself especially after my sufferings on board that nasty ship But catch you stirring Oh no You d let me lie here and be robbed and killed for what you d care Why you re not going to sleep What do you say IT S THE STRANGE AIR AND YOU RE ALWAYS SLEEPY IN A STRANGE AIR That shows the feelings you have after what I ve gone through And yawning too in that brutal manner Caudle you ve no more heart than that wooden figure in a white petticoat at the front of the ship No I COULDN T leave my temper at home I dare say Because for once in your life you ve brought me out yes I say once or two or three times it isn t more because as I say you once bring me out I m to be a slave and say nothing Pleasure indeed A great deal of pleasure I m to have if I m told to hold my tongue A nice way that of pleasing a woman Dear me if the bed doesn t spin round and dance about I ve got all that filthy ship in my head No I sha n t be well in the morning But nothing ever ails anybody but yourself You needn t groan in that way mister Caudle disturbing the people perhaps in the next room It s a mercy I m alive I m sure If once I wouldn t have given all the world for anybody to have thrown me overboard What are you smacking your lips at mister Caudle But I know what you mean of course you d never have stirred to stop em not you And then you might have known that the wind would have blown to day but that s why you came Whatever I should have done if it hadn t been for that good soul that blessed Captain Large I m sure all the women who go to Margate ought to pray for him so attentive in sea sickness and so much of a gentleman How I should have got down stairs without him when I first began to turn I don t know Don t tell me I never complained to you you might have seen I was ill And when everybody was looking like a bad wax candle you could walk about and make what you call your jokes upon the little buoy that was never sick at the Nore and such unfeeling trash Yes Caudle we ve now been married many years but if we were to live together for a thousand years to come what are you clasping your hands at a thousand years to come I say I shall never forget your conduct this day You could go to the other end of the ship and smoke a cigar when you knew I should be ill oh you knew it for I always am The brutal way too in which you took that cold brandy and water you thought I didn t see you but ill as I was hardly able to hold my head up I was watching you all the time Three glasses of cold brandy and water and you sipped em and drank the health of people who you didn t care a pin about whilst the health of your own lawful wife was nothing Three glasses of brandy and water and I left as I may say alone You didn t hear em but everybody was crying shame of you What do you say A GOOD DEAL MY OWN FAULT I TOOK TOO MUCH DINNER Well you are a man If I took more than the breast and leg of that young goose a thing I may say just out of the shell with the slightest bit of stuffing I m a wicked woman What do you say LOBSTER SALAD La how can you speak of it A month old baby would have eaten more What GOOSEBERRY PIE Well if you ll name that you ll name anything Ate too much indeed Do you think I was going to pay for a dinner and eat nothing No mister Caudle it s a good thing for you that I know a little more of the value of money than that But of course you were better engaged than in attending to me mister Prettyman came on board at Gravesend A planned thing of course You think I didn t see him give you a letter IT WASN T A LETTER IT WAS A NEWSPAPER I daresay ill as I was I had my eyes It was the smallest newspaper I ever saw that s all But of course a letter from Miss Prettyman Now Caudle if you begin to cry out in that manner I ll get up Do you forget that you are not at your own house making that noise Disturbing everybody Why we shall have the landlord up And you could smoke and drink forward as you called it What YOU COULDN T SMOKE ANYWHERE ELSE That s nothing to do with it Yes forward What a pity that Miss Prettyman wasn t with you I m sure nothing could be too forward for her No I won t hold my tongue and I ought not to be ashamed of myself It isn t treason is it to speak of Miss Prettyman After all I ve suffered to day and I m not to open my lips Yes I m to be brought away from my own home dragged down here to the sea side and made ill and I m not to speak I should like to know what next It s a mercy some of the dear children were not drowned not that their father would have cared so long as he could have had his brandy and cigars Peter was as near through one of the holes as IT S NO SUCH THING It s very well for you to say so but you know what an inquisitive boy he is and how he likes to wander among steam engines No I won t let you sleep What a man you are What I VE SAID THAT BEFORE That s no matter I ll say it again Go to sleep indeed as if one could never have a little rational conversation No I sha n t be too late for the Margate boat in the morning I can wake up at what hour I like and you ought to know that by this time A miserable creature they must have thought me in the ladies cabin with nobody coming down to see how I was YOU CAME A DOZEN TIMES No Caudle that won t do I know better You never came at all Oh no cigars and brandy took all your attention And when I was so ill that I didn t know a single thing that was going on about me and you never came Every other woman s husband was there ha twenty times And what must have been my feelings to hear em tapping at the door and making all sorts of kind inquiries something like husbands and I was left to be ill alone Yes and you want to get me into an argument You want to know if I was so ill that I knew nothing how could I know that you didn t come to the cabin door That s just like your aggravating way but I m not to be caught in that manner Caudle No It is very possible writes Caudle that she talked two hours more but happily the wind got suddenly up the waves bellowed and soothed by the sweet lullaby to say nothing of the Dolphin s brandy and water I somehow sank to repose LECTURE XXV missus CAUDLE WEARIED OF MARGATE HAS A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE FRANCE Bless me aren t you tired Caudle NO Well was there ever such a man But nothing ever tires you Of course it s all very well for you yes you can read your newspapers and What SO CAN I And I wonder what would become of the children if I did No it s enough for their father to lose his precious time talking about politics and bishops and lords and a pack of people who wouldn t care a pin if we hadn t a roof to cover us it s well enough for no Caudle no I m not going to worry you I never worried you yet and it isn t likely I should begin now But that s always the way with you always I m sure we should be the happiest couple alive only you do so like to have all the talk to yourself We re out upon pleasure and therefore let s be comfortable Still I must say it when you like you re an aggravating man Caudle and you know it WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW There now we won t talk of it No let s go to sleep otherwise we shall quarrel I know we shall What have you done indeed That I can t leave my home for a few days but I must be insulted Everybody upon the pier saw it SAW WHAT How can you lie there in the bed and ask me Saw what indeed Of course it was a planned thing regularly settled before you left London Oh yes I like your innocence mister Caudle not knowing what I m talking about It s a heart breaking thing for a woman to say of her own husband but you ve been a wicked man to me Yes and all your tossing and tumbling about in the bed won t make it any better Oh it s easy enough to call a woman a dear soul I must be very dear indeed to you when you bring down Miss Prettyman to there now you needn t shout like a wild savage Do you know that you re not in your own house do you know that we re in lodgings What do you suppose the people will think of us You needn t call out in that manner for they can hear every word that s said What do you say WHY DON T I HOLD MY TONGUE THEN To be sure anything for an excuse with you Anything to stop my mouth Miss Prettyman s to follow you here and I m to say nothing I know she HAS followed you and if you were to go before a magistrate and take a shilling oath to the contrary I wouldn t believe you No Caudle I wouldn t VERY WELL THEN Ha what a heart you must have to say very well and after the wife I ve been to you I m to be brought from my own home dragged down here to the sea side to be laughed at before the world don t tell me Do you think I didn t see how she looked at you how she puckered up her farthing mouth and what WHY DID I KISS HER THEN What s that to do with it Appearances are one thing mister Caudle and feelings are another As if women can t kiss one another without meaning anything by it And you I could see you looked as cold and as formal at her as well Caudle I wouldn t be the hypocrite you are for the world There now I ve heard all that story I daresay she did come down to join her brother How very lucky though that you should be here Ha ha how very lucky that ugh ugh ugh and with the cough I ve got upon me oh you ve a heart like a sea side flint Yes that s right That s just like your humanity I can t catch a cold but it must be my own fault it must be my thin shoes I daresay you d like to see me in ploughman s boots twould be no matter to you how I disfigured myself Miss Prettyman s foot NOW would be another thing no doubt I thought when you would make me leave home I thought we were coming here on pleasure but it s always the way you embitter my life The sooner that I m out of the world the better What do you say NOTHING But I know what you mean better than if you talked an hour I only hope you ll get a better wife that s all mister Caudle What YOU D NOT TRY Wouldn t you I know you In six months you d fill up my place yes and dreadfully my dear children would suffer for it Caudle if you roar in that way the people will give us warning to morrow CAN T I BE QUIET THEN Yes that s like your artfulness anything to make me hold my tongue But we won t quarrel I m sure if it depended upon me we might be as happy as doves I mean it and you needn t groan when I say it Good night Caudle What do you say BLESS ME Well you are a dear soul Caudle and if it wasn t for that Miss Prettyman no I m not torturing you I know very well what I m doing and I wouldn t torture you for the world but you don t know what the feelings of a wife are Caudle you don t Caudle I say Caudle Just a word dear WELL Now why should you snap me up in that way YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP So do I but that s no reason you should speak to me in that manner You know dear you once promised to take me to France YOU DON T RECOLLECT IT Yes that s like you you don t recollect many things you ve promised me but I do There s a boat goes on Wednesday to Boulogne and comes back the day afterwards WHAT OF IT Why for that time we could leave the children with the girls and go nicely NONSENSE Of course if I want anything it s always nonsense Other men can take their wives half over the world but you think it quite enough to bring me down here to this hole of a place where I know every pebble on the beach like an old acquaintance where there s nothing to be seen but the same machines the same jetty the same donkeys the same everything But then I d forgot Margate has an attraction for you Miss Prettyman s here No I m not censorious and I wouldn t backbite an angel but the way in which that young woman walks the sands at all hours there there I ve done I can t open my lips about that creature but you always storm You know that I always wanted to go to France and you bring me down here only on purpose that I should see the French cliffs just to tantalise me and for nothing else If I d remained at home and it was against my will I ever came here I should never have thought of France but to have it staring in one s face all day and not be allowed to go it s worse than cruel mister Caudle it s brutal Other people can take their wives to Paris but you always keep me moped up at home And what for Why that I may know nothing yes just on purpose to make me look little and for nothing else HEAVEN BLESS THE WOMAN Ha you ve good reason to say that mister Caudle for I m sure she s little blessed by you She s been kept a prisoner all her life has never gone anywhere oh yes that s your old excuse talking of the children I want to go to France and I should like to know what the children have to do with it They re not babies NOW are they But you ve always thrown the children in my face If Miss Prettyman there now do you hear what you ve done shouting in that manner The other lodgers are knocking overhead who do you think will have the face to look at em to morrow morning I sha n t breaking people s rest in that way Well Caudle I declare it s getting daylight and what an obstinate man you are tell me shall I go to France I forget says Caudle my precise answer but I think I gave her a very wide permission to go somewhere whereupon though not without remonstrance as to the place she went to sleep LECTURE XXVI missus CAUDLE S FIRST NIGHT IN FRANCE SHAMEFUL INDIFFERENCE OF CAUDLE AT THE BOULOGNE CUSTOM HOUSE I suppose mister Caudle you call yourself a man I m sure such men should never have wives If I could have thought it possible you d have behaved as you have done and I might if I hadn t been a forgiving creature for you ve never been like anybody else if I could only have thought it you d never have dragged me to foreign parts Never Well I DID say to myself if he goes to France perhaps he may catch a little politeness but no you began as Caudle and as Caudle you ll end I m to be neglected through life now Oh yes I ve quite given up all thoughts of anything but wretchedness I ve made up my mind to misery now YOU RE GLAD OF IT Well you must have a heart to say that I declare to you Caudle as true as I m an ill used woman if it wasn t for the dear children far away in blessed England if it wasn t for them I d never go back with you No I d leave you in this very place Yes I d go into a convent for a lady on board told me there was plenty of em here I d go and be a nun for the rest of my days and I see nothing to laugh at mister Caudle that you should be shaking the bed things up and down in that way But you always laugh at people s feelings I wish you d only some yourself I d be a nun or a Sister of Charity IMPOSSIBLE Ha mister Caudle you don t know even now what I can be when my blood s up You ve trod upon the worm long enough some day won t you be sorry for it Now none of your profane cryings out You needn t talk about Heaven in that way I m sure you re the last person who ought What I say is this Your conduct at the Custom House was shameful cruel And in a foreign land too But you brought me here that I might be insulted you d no other reason for dragging me from England Ha let me once get home mister Caudle and you may wear your tongue out before you get me into outlandish places again WHAT HAVE YOU DONE There now that s where you re so aggravating You behave worse than any Turk to me what YOU WISH YOU WERE A TURK Well I think that s a pretty wish before your lawful wife Yes a nice Turk you d make wouldn t you Don t think it WHAT HAVE YOU DONE Well it s a good thing I can t see you for I m sure you must blush Done indeed Why when the brutes searched my basket at the Custom House A REGULAR THING IS IT Then if you knew that why did you bring me here No man who respected his wife would And you could stand by and see that fellow with mustachios rummage my basket and pull out my night cap and rumple the borders and well if you d had the proper feelings of a husband your blood would have boiled again But no There you stood looking as mild as butter at the man and never said a word not when he crumpled my night cap it went to my heart like a stab crumpled it as if it were any duster I dare say if it had been Miss Prettyman s night cap oh I don t care about your groaning if it had been her night cap her hair brush her curl papers you d have said something then Oh anybody with the spirit of a man would have spoken out if the fellow had had a thousand swords at his side Well all I know is this if I d have married somebody I could name he wouldn t have suffered me to be treated in that way not he Now don t hope to go to sleep mister Caudle and think to silence me in that manner I know your art but it won t do It wasn t enough that my basket was turned topsy turvy but before I knew it they spun me into another room and HOW COULD YOU HELP THAT You never tried to help it No although it was a foreign land and I don t speak French not but what I know a good deal more of it than some people who give themselves airs about it though I don t speak their nasty gibberish still you let them take me away and never cared how I was ever to find you again In a strange country too But I ve no doubt that that s what you wished yes you d have been glad enough to have got rid of me in that cowardly manner If I could only know your secret thoughts Caudle that s what you brought me here for to lose me And after the wife I ve been to you What are you crying out FOR MERCY S SAKE Yes a great deal you know about mercy Else you d never have suffered me to be twisted into that room To be searched indeed As if I d anything smuggled about me Well I will say it after the way in which I ve been used if you d the proper feelings of a man you wouldn t sleep again for six months Well I know there was nobody but women there but that s nothing to do with it I m sure if I d been taken up for picking pockets they couldn t have used me worse To be treated so and specially by one s own sex it s THAT that aggravates me And that s all you can say WHAT COULD YOU DO Why break open the door I m sure you must have heard my voice you shall never make me believe you couldn t hear that Whenever I shall sew the strings on again I can t tell If they didn t turn me out like a ship in a storm I m a sinner And you laughed YOU DIDN T LAUGH Don t tell me you laugh when you don t know anything about it but I do And a pretty place you have brought me to A most respectable place I must say Where the women walk about without any bonnets to their heads and the fish girls with their bare legs well you don t catch me eating any fish while I m here WHY NOT Why not do you think I d encourage people of that sort What do you say GOOD NIGHT It s no use your saying that I can t go to sleep so soon as you can Especially with a door that has such a lock as that to it How do we know who may come in What ALL THE LOCKS ARE BAD IN FRANCE The more shame for you to bring me to such a place then It only shows how you value me Well I dare say you are tired I am But then see what I ve gone through Well we won t quarrel in a barbarous country We won t do that Caudle dear what s the French for lace I know it only I forget it The French for lace love What DENTELLE Now you re not deceiving me YOU NEVER DECEIVED ME YET Oh don t say that There isn t a married man in this blessed world can put his hand upon his heart in bed and say that French for lace dear Say it again DENTELLE Ha Dentelle Good night dear Dentelle Den telle I afterwards writes Caudle found out to my cost wherefore she inquired about lace For she went out in the morning with the landlady to buy a veil giving only four pounds for what she could have bought in England for forty shillings LECTURE XXVII missus CAUDLE RETURNS TO HER NATIVE LAND UNMANLY CRUELTY OF CAUDLE WHO HAS REFUSED TO SMUGGLE A FEW THINGS FOR HER There it isn t often that I ask you to do anything for me mister Caudle goodness knows and when I do I m always refused of course Oh yes anybody but your own lawful wife Every other husband aboard the boat could behave like a husband but I was left to shift for myself To be sure that s nothing new I always am Every other man worthy to be called a man could smuggle a few things for his wife but I might as well be alone in the world Not one poor half dozen of silk stockings could you put in your hat for me and everybody else was rolled in lace and I don t know what Eh What mister Caudle WHAT DO I WANT WITH SILK STOCKINGS Well it s come to something now There was a time I believe when I had a foot yes and an ankle too but when once a woman s married she has nothing of the sort of course No I m NOT a cherub mister Caudle don t say that I know very well what I am I dare say now you d have been delighted to smuggle for Miss Prettyman Silk stockings become her YOU WISH MISS PRETTYMAN WAS IN THE MOON Not you mister Caudle that s only your art your hypocrisy A nice person too she d be for the moon it would be none the brighter for her being in it I know And when you saw the Custom House officers look at me as though they were piercing me through what was your conduct Shameful You twittered about and fidgeted and flushed up as if I really WAS a smuggler SO I WAS What had that to do with it It wasn t the part of a husband I think to fidget in that way and show it YOU COULDN T HELP IT Humph And you call yourself a person of strong mind I believe One of the lords of the creation Ha ha couldn t help it But I may do all I can to save the money and this is always my reward Yes mister Caudle I shall save a great deal HOW MUCH I sha n t tell you I know your meanness you d want to stop it out of the house allowance No it s nothing to you where I got the money from to buy so many things The money was my own Well and if it was yours first that s nothing to do with it No I haven t saved it out of the puddings But it s always the woman who saves who s despised It s only your fine lady wives who re properly thought of If I was to ruin you Caudle then you d think something of me I sha n t go to sleep It s very well for you who re no sooner in bed than you re fast as a church but I can t sleep in that way It s my mind keeps me awake And after all I do feel so happy to night it s very hard I can t enjoy my thoughts NO I CAN T THINK IN SILENCE There s much enjoyment in that to be sure I ve no doubt now you could listen to Miss Prettyman oh I don t care I will speak It was a little more than odd I think that she should be on the jetty when the boat came in Ha she d been looking for you all the morning with a telescope I ve no doubt she s bold enough for anything And then how she sneered and giggled when she saw me and said how fat I d got like her impudence I think What WELL SHE MIGHT But I know what she wanted yes she d have liked to have had me searched She laughed on purpose I only wish I d taken two of the dear girls with me What things I could have stitched about em No I m not ashamed of myself to make my innocent children smugglers the more innocent they looked the better but there you are with what you call your principles again as if it wasn t given to everybody by nature to smuggle I m sure of it it s born with us And nicely I ve cheated em this day Lace and velvet and silk stockings and other things to say nothing of the tumblers and decanters No I didn t look as if I wanted a direction for fear somebody should break me That s another of what you call your jokes but you should keep em for those who like em I don t WHAT HAVE I MADE AFTER ALL I ve told you you shall never never know Yes I know you d been fined a hundred pounds if they d searched me but I never meant that they should I daresay you wouldn t smuggle oh no you don t think it worth your while You re quite a conjuror you are Caudle Ha ha ha WHAT AM I LAUGHING AT Oh you little know such a clever creature Ha ha Well now I ll tell you I knew what an unaccommodating animal you were so I made you smuggle whether or not HOW Why when you were out at the Cafe I got your great rough coat and if I didn t stitch ten yards of best black velvet under the lining I m a sinful woman And to see how innocent you looked when the officers walked round and round you It was a happy moment Caudle to see you What do you call it A SHAMEFUL TRICK UNWORTHY OF A WIFE I COULDN T CARE MUCH FOR YOU As if I didn t prove that by trusting you with ten yards of velvet But I don t care what you say I ve saved everything all but that beautiful English novel that I ve forgot the name of And if they didn t take it out of my hand and chopped it to bits like so much dog s meat SERVED ME RIGHT And when I so seldom buy a book No I don t see how it served me right If you can buy the same book in France for four shillings that people here have the impudence to ask more than a guinea for well if they DO steal it that s their affair not ours As if there was anything in a book to steal And now Caudle when are you going home What OUR TIME ISN T UP That s nothing to do with it If we even lose a week s lodging and we mayn t do that we shall save it again in living But you re such a man Your home s the last place with you I m sure I don t get a wink of a night thinking what may happen Three fires last week and any one might as well have been at our house as not NO THEY MIGHTN T Well you know what I mean but you re such a man I m sure too we ve had quite enough of this place But there s no keeping you out of the libraries Caudle You re getting quite a gambler And I don t think it s a nice example to set your children raffling as you do for French clocks and I don t know what But that s not the worst you never win anything Oh I forgot Yes a needle case that under my nose you gave to Miss Prettyman A nice thing for a married man to make presents and to such a creature as that too A needle case I wonder whenever she has a needle in HER hand I know I shall feel ill with anxiety if I stop here Nobody left in the house but that missus Closepeg And she is such a stupid woman It was only last night that I dreamt I saw our cat quite a skeleton and the canary stiff on its back at the bottom of the cage You know Caudle I m never happy when I m away from home and yet you will stay here No home s my comfort I never want to stir over the threshold and you know it If thieves were to break in what could that missus Closepeg do against em And so Caudle you ll go home on Saturday Our dear dear home On Saturday Caudle What I answered says Caudle I forget but I know that on the Saturday we were once again shipped on board the Red Rover LECTURE XXVIII missus CAUDLE HAS RETURNED HOME THE HOUSE OF COURSE NOT FIT TO BE SEEN mister CAUDLE IN SELF DEFENCE TAKES A BOOK After all Caudle it is something to get into one s own bed again I SHALL sleep to night What YOU RE GLAD OF IT That s like your sneering I know what you mean Of course I never can think of making myself comfortable but you wound my feelings If you cared for your own bed like any other man you d not have stayed out till this hour Don t say that I drove you out of the house as soon as we came in it I only just spoke about the dirt and the dust but the fact is you d be happy in a pig sty I thought I could have trusted that missus Closepeg with untold gold and did you only see the hearthrug When we left home there was a tiger in it I should like to know who could make out the tiger now Oh it s very well for you to swear at the tiger but swearing won t revive the rug again Else you might swear You could go out and make yourself comfortable at your club You little know how many windows are broken How many do you think No I sha n t tell you to morrow you shall know now I m sure Talking about getting health at Margate all my health went away directly I went into the kitchen There s dear mother s china bowl cracked in two places I could have sat down and cried when I saw it a bowl I can recollect when I was a child Eh I SHOULD HAVE LOCKED IT UP THEN Yes that s your feeling for anything of mine I only wish it had been your punch bowl but thank goodness I think that s chipped Well you haven t answered about the windows you can t guess how many YOU DON T CARE Well if nobody caught cold but you it would be little matter Six windows clean out and three cracked YOU CAN T HELP IT I should like to know where the money s to come from to mend em They sha n t be mended that s all Then you ll see how respectable the house will look But I know very well what you think Yes you re glad of it You think that this will keep me at home but I ll never stir out again Then you can go to the sea side by yourself then perhaps you can be happy with Miss Prettyman Now Caudle if you knock the pillow with your fist in that way I ll get up It s very odd that I can t mention that person s name but you begin to fight the bolster and do I don t know what There must be something in it or you wouldn t kick about so A guilty conscience needs no but you know what I mean She wasn t coming to town for a week and then of a sudden she d had a letter I dare say she had And then as she said it would be company for her to come with us No doubt She thought I should be ill again and down in the cabin but with all her art she does not know the depth of me quite Not but what I was ill though like a brute you wouldn t see it What do you say GOOD NIGHT LOVE Yes you can be very tender I dare say like all of your sex to suit your own ends but I can t go to sleep with my head full of the house The fender in the parlour will never come to itself again I haven t counted the knives yet but I ve made up my mind that half of em are lost No I don t always think the worst no and I don t make myself unhappy before the time but of course that s my thanks for caring about your property If there aren t spiders in the curtains as big as nutmegs I m a wicked creature Not a broom has the whole place seen since I ve been away But as soon as I get up won t I rummage the house out that s all I hadn t the heart to look at my pickles but for all I left the door locked I m sure the jars have been moved Yes you can swear at pickles when you re in bed but nobody makes more noise about em when you want em I only hope they ve been to the wine cellar then you may know what my feelings are That poor cat too What YOU HATE CATS Yes poor thing because she s my favourite that s it If that cat could only speak What IT ISN T NECESSARY I don t know what you mean mister Caudle but if that cat could only speak she d tell me how she s been cheated Poor thing I know where the money s gone to that I left for her milk I know Why what have you got there mister Caudle A book What IF YOU AREN T ALLOWED TO SLEEP YOU LL READ Well now it is come to something If that isn t insulting a wife to bring a book to bed I don t know what wedlock is But you sha n t read Caudle no you sha n t not while I ve strength to get up and put out a candle And that s like your feelings You can think a great deal of trumpery books yes you can t think too much of the stuff that s put into print but for what s real and true about you why you ve the heart of a stone I should like to know what that book s about What MILTON S PARADISE LOST I thought some rubbish of the sort something to insult me A nice book I think to read in bed and a very respectable person he was who wrote it WHAT DO I KNOW OF HIM Much more than you think A very pretty fellow indeed with his six wives What HE HADN T SIX HE D ONLY THREE That s nothing to do with it but of course you ll take his part Poor women A nice time they had with him I dare say And I ve no doubt mister Caudle you d like to follow mister Milton s example else you wouldn t read the stuff he wrote But you don t use me as he treated the poor souls who married him Poets indeed I d make a law against any of em having wives except upon paper for goodness help the dear creatures tied to them Like innocent moths lured by a candle Talking of candles you don t know that the lamp in the passage is split to bits I say you don t do you hear me mister Caudle Won t you answer Do you know where you are What IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN Are you Then you ve no business there at this time of night And saying this writes Caudle she scrambled from the bed and put out the night LECTURE XXIX missus CAUDLE THINKS THE TIME HAS COME TO HAVE A COTTAGE OUT OF TOWN Oh Caudle you ought to have had something nice to night for you re not well love I know you re not Ha that s like you men so headstrong You will have it that nothing ails you but I can tell Caudle The eye of a wife and such a wife as I ve been to you can at once see whether a husband s well or not You ve been turning like tallow all the week and what s more you eat nothing now It makes me melancholy to see you at a joint I don t say anything at dinner before the children but I don t feel the less No no you re not very well and you re not as strong as a horse Don t deceive yourself nothing of the sort No and you don t eat as much as ever and if you do you don t eat with a relish I m sure of that You can t deceive me there But I know what s killing you It s the confinement it s the bad air you breathe it s the smoke of London Oh yes I know your old excuse you never found the air bad before Perhaps not But as people grow older and get on in trade and after all we ve nothing to complain of Caudle London air always disagrees with em Delicate health comes with money I m sure of it What a colour you had once when you d hardly a sixpence and now look at you Twould add thirty years to your life and think what a blessing that would be to me not that I shall live a tenth part of the time thirty years if you d take a nice little house somewhere at Brixton YOU HATE BRIXTON I must say it Caudle that s so like you any place that s really genteel you can t abide Now Brixton and Baalam Hill I think delightful So select There nobody visits nobody unless they re somebody To say nothing of the delightful pews that make the churches so respectable However do as you like If you won t go to Brixton what do you say to Clapham Common Oh that s a very fine story Never tell me No you wouldn t be left alone a Robinson Crusoe with wife and children because you re in the retail way What THE RETIRED WHOLESALES NEVER VISIT THE RETIRED RETAILS AT CLAPHAM Ha that s only your old sneering at the world mister Caudle but I don t believe it And after all people should keep to their station or what was this life made for Suppose a tallow merchant does keep himself above a tallow chandler I call it only a proper pride What YOU CALL IT THE ARISTOCRACY OF FAT I don t know what you mean by aristocracy but I suppose it s only another of your dictionary words that s hardly worth the finding out What do you say to Hornsey or Muswell Hill Eh TOO HIGH What a man you are Well then Battersea TOO LOW You re an aggravating creature Caudle you must own that Hampstead then TOO COLD Nonsense it would brace you up like a drum Caudle and that s what you want But you don t deserve anybody to think of your health or your comforts either There s some pretty spots I m told about Fulham Now Caudle I won t have you say a word against Fulham That must be a sweet place dry and healthy and every comfort of life about it else is it likely that a bishop would live there Now Caudle none of your heathen principles I won t hear em I think what satisfies a bishop ought to content you but the politics you learn at that club are dreadful To hear you talk of bishops well I only hope nothing will happen to you for the sake of the dear children A nice little house and a garden I know it I was born for a garden There s something about it makes one feel so innocent My heart somehow always opens and shuts at roses And then what nice currant wine we could make And again get em as fresh as you will there s no radishes like your own radishes They re ten times as sweet What AND TWENTY TIMES AS DEAR Yes there you go Anything that I fancy you always bring up the expense No mister Caudle I should not be tired of it in a month I tell you I was made for the country But here you ve kept me and much you ve cared about my health here you ve kept me in this filthy London that I hardly know what grass is made of Much you care for your wife and family to keep em here to be all smoked like bacon I can see it it s stopping the children s growth they ll be dwarfs and have their father to thank for it If you d the heart of a parent you couldn t bear to look at their white faces Dear little Dick he makes no breakfast What HE ATE SIX SLICES THIS MORNING A pretty father you must be to count em But that s nothing to what the dear child could do if like other children he d a fair chance Ha and when we could be so comfortable But it s always the case you never will be comfortable with me How nice and fresh you d come up to business every morning and what pleasure it would be for me to put a tulip or a pink in your button hole just as I may say to ticket you from the country But then Caudle you never were like any other man But I know why you won t leave London Yes I know Then you think you couldn t go to your filthy club that s it Then you d be obliged to be at home like any other decent man Whereas you might if you liked enjoy yourself under your own apple tree and I m sure I should never say anything about your tobacco out of doors My only wish is to make you happy Caudle and you won t let me do it You don t speak love Shall I look about a house to morrow It will be a broken day with me for I m going out to have little pet s ears bored What YOU WON T HAVE HER EARS BORED And why not I should like to know IT S A BARBAROUS SAVAGE CUSTOM Oh mister Caudle the sooner you go away from the world and live in a cave the better You re getting not fit for Christian society What next My ears were bored and What SO ARE YOURS I know what you mean but that s nothing to do with it My ears I say were bored and so were dear mother s and grandmother s before her and I suppose there were no more savages in our family than in yours mister Caudle Besides why should little pet s ears go naked any more than any of her sisters They wear earrings you never objected before What YOU VE LEARNED BETTER NOW Yes that s all with your filthy politics again You d shake all the world up in a dice box if you d your way not that you care a pin about the world only you d like to get a better throw for yourself that s all But little pet SHALL be bored and don t think to prevent it I suppose she s to be married some day as well as her sisters And who ll look at a girl without earrings I should like to know If you knew anything of the world you d know what a nice diamond earring will sometimes do when one can get it before this But I know why you can t abide earrings now Miss Prettyman doesn t wear em she would I ve no doubt if she could only get em Yes it s Miss Prettyman who There Caudle now be quiet and I ll say no more about pet s ears at present We ll talk when you re reasonable I don t want to put you out of temper goodness knows And so love about the cottage What TWILL BE SO FAR FROM BUSINESS But it needn t be far dearest Quite a nice distance so that on your late nights you may always be at home have your supper get to bed and all by eleven Eh sweet one I don t know what I answered says Caudle but I know this in less than a fortnight I found myself in a sort of a green bird cage of a house which my wife gentle satirist insisted upon calling The Turtle Dovery LECTURE XXX missus CAUDLE COMPLAINS OF THE TURTLE DOVERY DISCOVERS BLACK BEETLES THINKS IT NOTHING BUT RIGHT THAT CAUDLE SHOULD SET UP A CHAISE Tush You d never have got me into this wilderness of a place mister Caudle if I d only have thought what it was Yes that s right throw it in my teeth that it was my choice that s manly isn t it When I saw the place the sun was out and it looked beautiful now it s quite another thing No mister Caudle I don t expect you to command the sun and if you talk about Joshua in that infidel way I ll leave the bed No sir I don t expect the sun to be in your power but that s nothing to do with it I talk about one thing and you always start another But that s your art I m sure a woman might as well be buried alive as live here In fact I am buried alive I feel it I stood at the window three hours this blessed day and saw nothing but the postman No it isn t a pity that I hadn t something better to do I had plenty but that s my business mister Caudle I suppose I m to be mistress of my own house If not I d better leave it And the very first night we were here you know it the black beetles came into the kitchen If the place didn t seem spread all over with a black cloth I m a story teller What are you coughing at mister Caudle I see nothing to cough at But that s just your way of sneering Millions of black beetles And as the clock strikes eight out they march What THEY RE VERY PUNCTUAL I know that I only wish other people were half as punctual twould save other people s money and other people s peace of mind You know I hate a black beetle No I don t hate so many things But I do hate black beetles as I hate ill treatment mister Caudle And now I have enough of both goodness knows Last night they came into the parlour Of course in a night or two they ll walk up into the bedroom They ll be here regiments of em on the quilt But what do you care Nothing of the sort ever touches you but you know how they come to me and that s why you re so quiet A pleasant thing to have black beetles in one s bed WHY DON T I POISON EM A pretty matter indeed to have poison in the house Much you must think of the dear children A nice place too to be called the Turtle Dovery DIDN T I CHRISTEN IT MYSELF I know that but then I knew nothing of the black beetles Besides names of houses are for the world outside not that anybody passes to see ours Didn t missus Digby insist on calling their new house Love in Idleness though everybody knew that that wretch Digby was always beating her Still when folks read Rose Cottage on the wall they seldom think of the lots of thorns that are inside In this world mister Caudle names are sometimes quite as good as things That cough again You ve got a cold and you ll always be getting one for you ll always be missing the omnibus as you did on Tuesday and always be getting wet No constitution can stand it Caudle You don t know what I felt when I heard it rain on Tuesday and thought you might be in it What I M VERY GOOD Yes I trust so I try to be so Caudle And so dear I ve been thinking that we d better keep a chaise YOU CAN T AFFORD IT AND YOU WON T Don t tell me I know you d save money by it I ve been reckoning what you lay out in omnibuses and if you d a chaise of your own besides the gentility of the thing you d be money in pocket And then again how often I could go with you to town and how again I could call for you when you liked to be a little late at the club dear Now you re obliged to be hurried away I know it when if you d only a carriage of your own you could stay and enjoy yourself And after your work you want enjoyment Of course I can t expect you always to run home directly to me and I don t Caudle and you know it A nice neat elegant little chaise What YOU LL THINK OF IT There s a love You are a good creature Caudle and twill make me so happy to think you don t depend upon an omnibus A sweet little carriage with our own arms beautifully painted on the panels What ARMS ARE RUBBISH AND YOU DON T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ANY Nonsense to be sure you have and if not of course they re to be had for money I wonder where Chalkpit s the milkman s arms came from I suppose you can buy em at the same place He used to drive a green cart and now he s got a close yellow carriage with two large tortoise shell cats with their whiskers as if dipped in cream standing on their hind legs upon each door with a heap of Latin underneath You may buy the carriage if you please mister Caudle but unless your arms are there you won t get me to enter it Never I m not going to look less than missus Chalkpit Besides if you haven t arms I m sure my family have and a wife s arms are quite as good as a husband s I ll write to morrow to dear mother to know what we took for our family arms What do you say What A MANGLE IN A STONE KITCHEN PROPER mister Caudle you re always insulting my family always but you shall not put me out of temper to night Still if you don t like our arms find your own I daresay you could have found em fast enough if you d married Miss Prettyman Well I will be quiet and I won t mention that lady s name A nice lady she is I wonder how much she spends in paint Now don t I tell you I won t say a word more and yet you will kick about Well we ll have the carriage and the family arms No I don t want the family legs too Don t be vulgar mister Caudle You might perhaps talk in that way before you d money in the Bank but it doesn t at all become you now The carriage and the family arms We ve a country house as well as the Chalkpits and though they praise their place for a little paradise I dare say they ve quite as many blackbeetles as we have and more too The place quite looks it Our carriage and our arms And you know love it won t cost much next to nothing to put a gold band about Sam s hat on a Sunday No I don t want a full blown livery At least not just yet I m told that Chalkpits dress their boy on a Sunday like a dragon fly and I don t see why we shouldn t do what we like with our own Sam Nevertheless I ll be content with a gold band and a bit of pepper and salt No I shall not cry out for plush next certainly not But I will have a gold band and YOU WON T AND I KNOW IT Oh yes that s another of your crotchets mister Caudle like nobody else you don t love liveries I suppose when people buy their sheets or their tablecloths or any other linen they ve a right to mark what they like upon it haven t they Well then You buy a servant and you mark what you like upon him and where s the difference None that I can see Finally says Caudle I compromised for a gig but Sam did not wear pepper and salt and a gold band LECTURE XXXI missus CAUDLE COMPLAINS VERY BITTERLY THAT mister CAUDLE HAS BROKEN HER CONFIDENCE O you ll catch me mister Caudle telling you anything again Now I don t want to have any noise I don t wish you to put yourself in a passion All I say is this never again do I open my lips to you about anybody No if man and wife can t be one why there s an end of everything Oh you know well what I mean mister Caudle you ve broken my confidence in the most shameful the most heartless way and I repeat it I can never be again to you as I have been No the little charm it wasn t much that remained about married life is gone for ever Yes the bloom s quite wiped off the plum now Don t be such a hypocrite Caudle don t ask me what I mean missus Badgerly has been here more like a fiend I m sure than a quiet woman I haven t done trembling yet You know the state of my nerves too you know yes sir I HAD nerves when you married me and I haven t just found em out Well you ve something to answer for I think The Badgerlys are going to separate she takes the girls and he the boys and all through you How you can lay your head upon that pillow and think of going to sleep I can t tell WHAT HAVE YOU DONE Well you have a face to ask the question Done You ve broken my confidence mister Caudle you ve taken advantage of my tenderness my trust in you as a wife the more fool I for my pains and you ve separated a happy couple for ever No I m not talking in the clouds I m talking in your bed the more my misfortune Now Caudle yes I shall sit up in the bed if I choose I m not going to sleep till I have this properly explained for missus Badgerly sha n t lay her separation at my door You won t deny that you were at the club last night No bad as you are Caudle and though you re my husband I can t think you a good man I try to do but I can t bad as you are you can t deny you were at the club What YOU DON T DENY IT That s what I say you can t And now answer me this question What did you say before the whole world of mister Badgerly s whiskers There s nothing to laugh at Caudle if you d have seen that poor woman to day you d have a heart of stone to laugh What did you say of his whiskers Didn t you tell everybody he dyed em Didn t you hold the candle up to em as you said to show the purple TO BE SURE YOU DID Ha people who break jokes never care about breaking hearts Badgerly went home like a demon called his wife a false woman vowed he d never enter a bed again with her and to show he was in earnest slept all night upon the sofa He said it was the dearest secret of his life said she had told me and that I had told you and that s how it has come out What do you say BADGERLY WAS RIGHT I DID TELL YOU I know I did but when dear missus Badgerly mentioned the matter to me and a few friends as we were all laughing at tea together quite in a confidential way when she just spoke of her husband s whiskers and how long he was over em every morning of course poor soul she never thought it was to be talked of in the world again Eh THEN I HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL YOU OF IT And that s the way I m thanked for my confidence Because I don t keep a secret from you but show you I may say my naked soul Caudle that s how I m rewarded Poor missus Badgerly for all her hard words after she went away I m sure my heart quite bled for her What do you say mister Caudle SERVES HER RIGHT SHE SHOULD HOLD HER TONGUE Yes that s like your tyranny you d never let a poor woman speak Eh what what mister Caudle That s a very fine speech I dare say and wives are very much obliged to you only there s not a bit of truth in it No we women don t get together and pick our husbands to pieces just as sometimes mischievous little girls rip up their dolls That s an old sentiment of yours mister Caudle but I m sure you ve no occasion to say it of me I hear a good deal of other people s husbands certainly I can t shut my ears I wish I could but I never say anything about you and I might and you know it and there s somebody else that knows it too No I sit still and say nothing what I have in my own bosom about you Caudle will be buried with me But I know what you think of wives I heard you talking to mister Prettyman when you little thought I was listening and you didn t know much what you were saying I heard you My dear Prettyman says you when some women get talking they club all their husbands faults together just as children club their cakes and apples to make a common feast for the whole set Eh YOU DON T REMEMBER IT But I do and I remember too what brandy was left when Prettyman left Twould be odd if you could remember much about it after that And now you ve gone and separated man and wife and I m to be blamed for it You ve not only carried misery into a family but broken my confidence You ve proved to me that henceforth I m not to trust you with anything mister Caudle No I ll lock up whatever I know in my own breast for now I find nobody not even one s own husband is to be relied upon From this moment I may look upon myself as a solitary woman Now it s no use your trying to go to sleep What do you say YOU KNOW THAT Very well Now I want to ask you one question more Eh YOU WANT TO ASK ME ONE Very well go on I m not afraid to be catechised I never dropped a syllable that as a wife I ought to have kept to myself no I m not at all forgetting what I ve said and whatever you ve got to ask me speak out at once No I don t want you to spare me all I want you is to speak YOU WILL SPEAK Well then do What WHO TOLD PEOPLE YOU D A FALSE FRONT TOOTH And is that all Well I m sure as if the world couldn t see it I know I did just mention it once but then I thought everybody knew it besides I was aggravated to do it yes aggravated I remember it was that very day at missus Badgerly s when husbands whiskers came up Well after we d done with them somebody said something about teeth Whereupon Miss Prettyman a minx she was born to destroy the peace of families I know she was she was there and if I d only known that such a creature was no I m not rambling not at all and I m coming to the tooth To be sure this is a great deal you ve got against me isn t it Well somebody spoke about teeth when Miss Prettyman with one of her insulting leers said she thought mister Caudle had the whitest teeth she ever HAD beheld Of course my blood was up every wife s would be and I believe I might have said Yes they were well enough but when a young lady so very much praised a married man s teeth she perhaps didn t know that one of the front ones was an elephant s Like her impudence I set HER down for the rest of the evening But I can see the humour you re in to night You only came to bed to quarrel and I m not going to indulge you All I say is this after the shameful mischief you ve made at the Badgerlys you never break my confidence again Never and now you know it Caudle hereupon writes And here she seemed inclined to sleep Not for one moment did I think to prevent her LECTURE XXXII missus CAUDLE DISCOURSES OF MAIDS OF ALL WORK AND MAIDS IN GENERAL mister CAUDLE S INFAMOUS BEHAVIOUR TEN YEARS AGO There now it isn t my intention to say a word to night mister Caudle No I want to go to sleep if I can for after what I ve gone through to day and with the headache I ve got and if I haven t left my smelling salts on the mantelpiece on the right hand corner just as you go into the room nobody could miss it I say nobody could miss it in a little green bottle and well there you lie like a stone and I might perish and you wouldn t move Oh my poor head But it may open and shut and what do you care Yes that s like your feeling just I want my salts and you tell me there s nothing like being still for a headache Indeed But I m not going to be still so don t you think it That s just how a woman s put upon But I know your aggravation I know your art You think to keep me quiet about that minx Kitty your favourite sir Upon my life I m not to discharge my own servant without but she shall go If I had to do all the work myself she shouldn t stop under my roof I can see how she looks down upon me I can see a great deal mister Caudle that I never choose to open my lips about but I can t shut my eyes Perhaps it would have been better for my peace and mind if I always could Don t say that I m not a foolish woman and I know very well what I m saying I suppose you think I forget THAT Rebecca I know it s ten years ago that she lived with us but what s that to do with it Things aren t the less true for being old I suppose No and your conduct mister Caudle at that time if it was a hundred years ago I should never forget What I SHALL ALWAYS BE THE SAME SILLY WOMAN I hope I shall I trust I shall always have my eyes about me in my own house Now don t think of going to sleep Caudle because as you ve brought this up about that Rebecca you shall hear me out Well I do wonder that you can name her Eh YOU DIDN T NAME HER That s nothing at all to do with it for I know just as well what you think as if you did I suppose you ll say that you didn t drink a glass of wine to her NEVER So you said at the time but I ve thought of it for ten long years and the more I ve thought the surer I am of it And at that very time if you please to recollect at that very time little Jack was a baby I shouldn t have so much cared but for that but he was hardly running alone when you nodded and drank a glass of wine to that creature No I m not mad and I m not dreaming I saw how you did it and the hypocrisy made it worse and worse I saw you when the creature was just behind my chair you took up a glass of wine and saying to me Margaret and then lifting up your eyes at the bold minx and saying my dear as if you wanted me to believe that you spoke only to me when I could see you laugh at her behind me And at that time little Jack wasn t on his feet What do you say HEAVEN FORGIVE ME Ha mister Caudle it s you that ought to ask for that I m safe enough I am it s you who should ask to be forgiven No I wouldn t slander a saint and I didn t take away the girl s character for nothing I know she brought an action for what I said and I know you had to pay damages for what you call my tongue I well remember all that And serve you right if you hadn t laughed at her it wouldn t have happened But if you will make free with such people of course you re sure to suffer for it Twould have served you right if the lawyer s bill had been double Damages indeed Not that anybody s tongue could have damaged her And now mister Caudle you re the same man you were ten years ago What YOU HOPE SO The more shame for you At your time of life with all your children growing up about you to WHAT AM I TALKING OF I know very well and so would you if you had any conscience which you haven t When I say I shall discharge Kitty you say she s a very good servant and I sha n t get a better But I know why you think her good you think her pretty and that s enough for you as if girls who work for their bread have any business to be pretty which she isn t Pretty servants indeed going mincing about with their fal lal faces as if even the flies would spoil em But I know what a bad man you are now it s no use your denying it for didn t I overhear you talking to mister Prettyman and didn t you say that you couldn t bear to have ugly servants about you I ask you didn t you say that PERHAPS YOU DID You don t blush to confess it If your principles mister Caudle aren t enough to make a woman s blood run cold Oh yes you ve talked that stuff again and again and once I might have believed it but I know a little more of you now You like to see pretty servants just as you like to see pretty statues and pretty pictures and pretty flowers and anything in nature that s pretty just as you say for the eye to feed upon Yes I know your eyes very well I know what they were ten years ago for shall I ever forget that glass of wine when little Jack was in arms I don t care if it was a thousand years ago it s as fresh as yesterday and I never will cease to talk of it When you know me how can you ask it And now you insist upon keeping Kitty when there s no having a bit of crockery for her That girl would break the Bank of England I know she would if she was to put her hand upon it But what s a whole set of blue china to her beautiful blue eyes I know that s what you mean though you don t say it Oh you needn t lie groaning there for you don t think I shall ever forget Rebecca Yes it s very well for you to swear at Rebecca now but you didn t swear at her then mister Caudle I know Margaret my dear Well how you can have the face to look at me YOU DON T LOOK AT ME The more shame for you I can only say that either Kitty leaves the house or I do Which is it to be mister Caudle Eh YOU DON T CARE BOTH But you re not going to get rid of me in that manner I can tell you But for that trollop now you may swear and rave as you like YOU DON T INTEND TO SAY A WORD MORE Very well it s no matter what you say her quarter s up on Tuesday and go she shall A soup plate and a basin went yesterday A soup plate and a basin and when I ve the headache as I have mister Caudle tearing me to pieces But I shall never be well in this world never A soup plate and a basin She slept writes Caudle and poor Kitty left on Tuesday LECTURE XXXIII missus CAUDLE HAS DISCOVERED THAT CAUDLE IS A RAILWAY DIRECTOR When I took up the paper to day Caudle you might have knocked me down with a feather Now don t be a hypocrite you know what s the matter And when you haven t a bed to lie upon and are brought to sleep upon coal sacks and then I can tell you mister Caudle you may sleep by yourself then you ll know what s the matter Now I ve seen your name and don t deny it Yes the Eel Pie Island Railway and among the Directors Job Caudle esquire of the Turtle Dovery and no I won t be quiet It isn t often goodness knows that I speak but seeing what I do I won t be silent WHAT DO I SEE Why there mister Caudle at the foot of the bed I see all the blessed children in tatters I see you in a gaol and the carpets hung out of the windows And now I know why you talk in your sleep about a broad and narrow gauge I couldn t think what was on your mind but now it s out Ha mister Caudle there s something about a broad and narrow way that I wish you d remember but you re turned quite a heathen yes you think of nothing but money now DON T I LIKE MONEY To be sure I do but then I like it when I m certain of it no risks for me Yes it s all very well to talk about fortunes made in no time they re like shirts made in no time it s ten to one if they hang long together And now it s plain enough why you can t eat or drink or sleep or do anything All your mind s allotted into railways for you shan t make me believe that Eel Pie Island s the only one Oh no I can see by the looks of you Why in a little time if you haven t as many lines in your face as there are lines laid down Every one of your features seems cut up and all seem travelling from one another Six months ago Caudle you hadn t a wrinkle yes you d a cheek as smooth as any china and now your face is like the Map of England At your time of life too You who were for always going small and sure You to make heads and tails of your money in this way It s that stock broker s dog at Flam Cottage he s bitten you I m sure of it You re not fit to manage your own property now and I should only be acting the part of a good wife if I were to call in the mad doctors Well I shall never know rest any more now There won t be a soul knock at the door after this that I sha n t think it s the man coming to take possession Twill be something for the Chalkpits to laugh at when we re sold up I think I see em here bidding for all our little articles of bigotry and virtue and what are you laughing at THEY RE NOT BIGOTRY AND VIRTUE BUT BIJOUTERIE AND VERTU It s all the same only you re never so happy as when you re taking me up If I can tell what s coming to the world I m a sinner Everybody s for turning their farthings into double sovereigns and cheating their neighbours of the balance And you too you re beside yourself Caudle I m sure of it I ve watched you when you thought me fast asleep And then you ve lain and whispered and whispered and then hugged yourself and laughed at the bed posts as if you d seen em turned to sovereign gold I do believe that you sometimes think the patchwork quilt is made of thousand pound bank notes Well when we re brought to the Union then you ll find out your mistake But it will be a poor satisfaction for me every night to tell you of it What mister Caudle THEY WON T LET ME TELL YOU OF IT And you call that some comfort And after the wife I ve been to you But now I recollect I think I ve heard you praise that Union before though like a fond fool as I ve always been I never once suspected the reason of it And now of course day and night you ll never be at home No you ll live and sleep at Eel Pie Island I shall be left alone with nothing but my thoughts thinking when the broker will come and you ll be with your brother directors I may slave and I toil to save sixpences and you ll be throwing away hundreds And then the expensive tastes you ve got Nothing good enough for you now I m sure you sometimes think yourself King Solomon But that comes of making money if indeed you have made any without earning it No I don t talk nonsense people CAN make money without earning it And when they do why it s like taking a lot of spirits at one draught it gets into their head and they don t know what they re about And you re in that state now mister Caudle I m sure of it by the way of you There s a tipsiness of the pocket as well as of the stomach and you re in that condition at this very moment Not that I should so much mind that is if you HAVE made money if you d stop at the Eel Pie line But I know what these things are they re like treacle to flies when men are well in em they can t get out of em or if they do it s often without a feather to fly with No if you ve really made money by the Eel Pie line and will give it to me to take care of for the dear children why perhaps love I ll say no more of the matter What NONSENSE Yes of course I never ask you for money but that s the word And now catch you stopping at the Eel Pie line Oh no I know your aggravating spirit In a day or two I shall see another fine flourish in the paper with a proposal for a branch from Eel Pie Island to the Chelsea Bun house Give you a mile of rail and I know you men you ll take a hundred Well if it didn t make me quiver to read that stuff in the paper and your name to it But I suppose it was mister Prettyman s work for his precious name s among em How you tell the people that eel pies are now become an essential element of civilisation I learnt all the words by heart that I might say em to you that the Eastern population of London are cut off from the blessings of such a necessary and that by means of the projected line eel pies will be brought home to the business and bosoms of Ratcliff Highway and the adjacent dependencies Well when you men lords of the creation as you call yourselves do get together to make up a company or anything of the sort is there any story book can come up to you And so you look solemnly in one another s faces and never so much as moving the corners of your mouths pick one another s pockets No I m not using hard words mister Caudle but only the words that s proper And this I MUST say Whatever you ve got I m none the better for it You never give me any of your Eel Pie shares What do you say YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME Not I I ll have nothing to do with any wickedness of the kind If like any other husband you choose to throw a heap of money into my lap what YOU LL THINK OF IT WHEN THE EEL PIES GO UP Then I know what they re worth they ll never fetch a farthing She was suddenly silent writes Caudle and I was sinking into sleep when she elbowed me and cried Caudle do you think they ll be up to morrow LECTURE XXXIV missus CAUDLE SUSPECTING THAT mister CAUDLE HAS MADE HIS WILL IS ONLY ANXIOUS AS A WIFE TO KNOW ITS PROVISIONS There I always said you d a strong mind when you liked Caudle and what you ve just been doing proves it Some people won t make a will because they think they must die directly afterwards Now you re above that love aren t you Nonsense you know very well what I mean I know your will s made for Scratcherly told me so What YOU DON T BELIEVE IT Well I m sure That s a pretty thing for a man to say to his wife I know he s too much of a man of business to talk but I suppose there s a way of telling things without speaking them And when I put the question to him lawyer as he is he hadn t the face to deny it To be sure it can be of no consequence to me whether your will is made or not I shall not be alive mister Caudle to want anything I shall be provided for a long time before your will s of any use No mister Caudle I sha n t survive you and though a woman s wrong to let her affection for a man be known for then she s always taken advantage of though I know it s foolish and weak to say so still I don t want to survive you How should I No no don t say that I m not good for a hundred I sha n t see you out and another husband too What a gross idea Caudle To imagine I d ever think of marrying again No never What THAT S WHAT WE ALL SAY Not at all quite the reverse To me the very idea of such a thing is horrible and always was Yes I know very well that some do marry again but what they re made of I m sure I can t tell Ugh There are men I know who leave their property in such a way that their widows to hold it must keep widows Now if there is anything in the world that is mean and small it is that Don t you think so too Caudle Why don t you speak love That s so like you I never want a little quiet rational talk but you want to go to sleep But you never were like any other man What HOW DO I KNOW There now that s so like your aggravating way I never open my lips upon a subject but you try to put me off I ve no doubt when Miss Prettyman speaks you can answer HER properly enough There you are again Upon my life it IS odd but I never can in the most innocent way mention that person s name that WHY CAN T I LEAVE HER ALONE I m sure with all my heart Who wants to talk about her I don t only you always will say something that s certain to bring up her name What was I saying Caudle Oh about the way some men bind their widows To my mind there is nothing so little When a man forbids his wife to marry again without losing what he leaves it s what I call selfishness after death Mean to a degree It s like taking his wife into the grave with him Eh YOU NEVER WANT TO DO THAT No I m sure of that love you re not the man to tie a woman up in that mean manner A man who d do that would have his widow burnt with him if he could just as those monsters that call themselves men do in the Indies However it s no matter to me how you ve made your will but it may be to your second wife What I SHALL NEVER GIVE YOU A CHANCE Ha you don t know my constitution after all Caudle I m not at all the woman I was I say nothing about em but very often you don t know my feelings And as we re on the subject dearest I have only one favour to ask When you marry again now it s no use your saying that After the comforts you ve known of marriage what are you sighing at dear after the comforts you must marry again now don t forswear yourself in that violent way taking an oath that you know you must break you couldn t help it I m sure of it and I know you better than you know yourself Well all I ask is love because it s only for your sake and it would make no difference to me then how should it but all I ask is don t marry Miss Pret There there I ve done I won t say another word about it but all I ask is don t After the way you ve been thought of and after the comforts you ve been used to Caudle she wouldn t be the wife for you Of course I could then have no interest in the matter you might marry the Queen of England for what it would be to me then I m only anxious about you Mind Caudle I m not saying anything against her not at all but there s a flightiness in her manner I dare say poor thing she means no harm and it may be as the saying is only her manner after all still there is a flightiness about her that after what you ve been used to would make you very wretched Now if I may boast of anything Caudle it is my propriety of manner the whole of my life I know that wives who re very particular aren t thought as well of as those who re not still it s next to nothing to be virtuous if people don t seem so And virtue Caudle no I m not going to preach about virtue for I never do No and I don t go about with my virtue like a child with a drum making all sorts of noises with it But I know your principles I shall never forget what I once heard you say to Prettyman and it s no excuse that you d taken so much wine you didn t know what you were saying at the time for wine brings out man s wickedness just as fire brings out spots of grease WHAT DID YOU SAY Why you said this Virtue s a beautiful thing in women when they don t make so much noise about it but there s some women who think virtue was given em as claws were given to cats yes cats was the word to do nothing but scratch with That s what you said YOU DON T RECOLLECT A SYLLABLE OF IT No that s it when you re in that dreadful state you recollect nothing but it s a good thing I do But we won t talk of that love that s all over I dare say you meant nothing But I m glad you agree with me that the man who d tie up his widow not to marry again is a mean man It makes me happy that you ve the confidence in me to say that YOU NEVER SAID IT That s nothing to do with it you ve just as good as said it No when a man leaves all his property to his wife without binding her hands from marrying again he shows what a dependence he has upon her love He proves to all the world what a wife she s been to him and how after his death he knows she ll grieve for him And then of course a second marriage never enters her head But when she only keeps his money so long as she keeps a widow why she s aggravated to take another husband I m sure of it many a poor woman has been driven into wedlock again only because she was spited into it by her husband s will It s only natural to suppose it If I thought Caudle you could do such a thing though it would break my heart to do it yet though you were dead and gone I d show you I d a spirit and marry again directly Not but what it s ridiculous my talking in such a way as I shall go long before you still mark my words and don t provoke me with any will of that sort or I d do it as I m a living woman in this bed to night I d do it I did not contradict her says Caudle but suffered her to slumber in such assurance LECTURE XXXV missus CAUDLE HAS BEEN TOLD THAT CAUDLE HAS TAKEN TO PLAY AT BILLIARDS Ah you re very late to night dear IT S NOT LATE Well then it isn t that s all Of course a woman can never tell when it s late You were late on Tuesday too a little late on the Friday before on the Wednesday before that now you needn t twist about in that manner I m not going to say anything no for I see it s now no use Once I own it used to fret me when you stayed out but that s all over you ve now brought me to that state Caudle and it s your own fault entirely that I don t care whether you ever come home or not I never thought I could be brought to think so little of you but you ve done it you ve been treading on the worm for these twenty years and it s turned at last Now I m not going to quarrel that s all over I don t feel enough for you to quarrel with I don t Caudle as true as I m in this bed All I want of you is any other man would speak to his wife and not lie there like a log all I want is this Just tell me where you were on Tuesday You were not at dear mother s though you know she s not well and you know she thinks of leaving the dear children her money but you never had any feeling for anybody belonging to me And you were not at your Club no I know that And you were not at any theatre HOW DO I KNOW Ha mister Caudle I only wish I didn t know No you were not at any of these places but I know well enough where you were THEN WHY DO I ASK IF I KNOW That s it just to prove what a hypocrite you are just to show you that you can t deceive me So mister Caudle you ve turned billiard player sir ONLY ONCE That s quite enough you might as well play a thousand times for you re a lost man Caudle Only once indeed I wonder if I was to say Only once what would you say to me But of course a man can do no wrong in anything And you re a lord of the creation mister Caudle and you can stay away from the comforts of your blessed fireside and the society of your own wife and children though to be sure you never thought anything of them to push ivory balls about with a long stick upon a green table cloth What pleasure any man can take in such stuff must astonish any sensible woman I pity you Caudle And you can go and do nothing but make cannons for that s the gibberish they talk at billiards when there s the manly and athletic game of cribbage as my poor grandmother used to call it at your own hearth You can go into a billiard room you a respectable tradesman or as you set yourself up for one for if the world knew all there s very little respectability in you you can go and play billiards with a set of creatures in mustachios when you might take a nice quiet hand with me at home But no anything but cribbage with your own wife Caudle it s all over now you ve gone to destruction I never knew a man enter a billiard room that he wasn t lost for ever There was my uncle Wardle a better man never broke the bread of life he took to billiards and he didn t live with aunt a month afterwards A LUCKY FELLOW And that s what you call a man who leaves his wife a lucky fellow But to be sure what can I expect We shall not be together long now it s been some time coming but at last we must separate and the wife I ve been to you But I know who it is it s that fiend Prettyman I WILL call him a fiend and I m by no means a foolish woman you d no more have thought of billiards than a goose if it hadn t been for him Now it s no use Caudle your telling me that you have only been once and that you can t hit a ball anyhow you ll soon get over all that and then you ll never be at home You ll be a marked man Caudle yes marked there ll be something about you that ll be dreadful for if I couldn t tell a billiard player by his looks I ve no eyes that s all They all of em look as yellow as parchment and wear mustachios I suppose you ll let yours grow now though they ll be a good deal troubled to come I know that Yes they ve all a yellow and sly look just for all as if they were first cousins to people that picked pockets And that will be your case Caudle in six months the dear children won t know their own father Well if I know myself at all I could have borne anything but billiards The companions you ll find The Captains that will be always borrowing fifty pounds of you I tell you Caudle a billiard room s a place where ruin of all sorts is made easy I may say to the lowest understanding so you can t miss it It s a chapel of ease for the devil to preach in don t tell me not to be eloquent I don t know what you mean mister Caudle and I shall be just as eloquent as I like But I never can open my lips and it isn t often goodness knows that I m not insulted No I won t be quiet on this matter I won t Caudle on any other I wouldn t say a word and you know it if you didn t like it but on this matter I WILL speak I know you can t play at billiards and never could learn I dare say not but that makes it all the worse for look at the money you ll lose see the ruin you ll be brought to It s no use your telling me you ll not play now you can t help it And nicely you ll be eaten up Don t talk to me dear aunt told me all about it The lots of fellows that go every day into billiard rooms to get their dinners just as a fox sneaks into a farm yard to look about him for a fat goose and they ll eat you up Caudle I know they will Billiard balls indeed Well in my time I ve been over Woolwich Arsenal you were something like a man then for it was just before we were married and then I saw all sorts of balls mountains of em to be shot away at churches and into people s peaceable habitations breaking the china and nobody knows what I say I ve seen all these balls well I know I ve said that before but I choose to say it again and there s not one of em iron as they are that could do half the mischief of a billiard ball That s a ball Caudle that s gone through many a wife s heart to say nothing of her children And that s a ball that night and day you ll be destroying your family with Don t tell me you ll not play When once a man s given to it as my poor aunt used to say the devil s always tempting him with a ball as he tempted Eve with an apple I shall never think of being happy any more No that s quite out of the question You ll be there every night I know you will better than you so don t deny it every night over that wicked green cloth Green indeed It s red crimson red Caudle if you could only properly see it crimson red with the hearts those balls have broken Don t tell me not to be pathetic I shall as pathetic as it suits me I suppose I may speak However I ve done It s all settled now You re a billiard player and I m a wretched woman I did not deny either position writes Caudle and for this reason I wanted to sleep LECTURE THE LAST missus CAUDLE HAS TAKEN COLD THE TRAGEDY OF THIN SHOES I m not going to contradict you Caudle you may say what you like but I think I ought to know my own feelings better than you I don t wish to upbraid you neither I m too ill for that but it s not getting wet in thin shoes oh no it s my mind Caudle my mind that s killing me Oh yes gruel indeed you think gruel will cure a woman of anything and you know too how I hate it Gruel can t reach what I suffer but of course nobody is ever ill but yourself Well I I didn t mean to say that but when you talk in that way about thin shoes a woman says of course what she doesn t mean she can t help it You ve always gone on about my shoes when I think I m the fittest judge of what becomes me best I dare say twould be all the same to you if I put on ploughman s boots but I m not going to make a figure of my feet I can tell you I ve never got cold with the shoes I ve worn yet and tisn t likely I should begin now No Caudle I wouldn t wish to say anything to accuse you no goodness knows I wouldn t make you uncomfortable for the world but the cold I ve got I got ten years ago I have never said anything about it but it has never left me Yes ten years ago the day before yesterday HOW CAN I RECOLLECT IT Oh very well women remember things you never think of poor souls they ve good cause to do so Ten years ago I was sitting up for you there now I m not going to say anything to vex you only do let me speak ten years ago I was waiting for you and I fell asleep and the fire went out and when I woke I found I was sitting right in the draught of the keyhole That was my death Caudle though don t let that make you uneasy love for I don t think you meant to do it Ha it s all very well for you to call it nonsense and to lay your ill conduct upon my shoes That s like a man exactly There never was a man yet that killed his wife who couldn t give a good reason for it No I don t mean to say that you ve killed me quite the reverse still there s never been a day that I haven t felt that key hole What WHY WON T I HAVE A DOCTOR What s the use of a doctor Why should I put you to expense Besides I dare say you ll do very well without me Caudle yes after a very little time you won t miss me much no man ever does Peggy tells me Miss Prettyman called to day WHAT OF IT Nothing of course Yes I know she heard I was ill and that s why she came A little indecent I think mister Caudle she might wait I shan t be in her way long she may soon have the key of the caddy now Ha mister Caudle what s the use of your calling me your dearest soul now Well I do believe you I dare say you do mean it that is I hope you do Nevertheless you can t expect I can lie quiet in this bed and think of that young woman not indeed that she s near so young as she gives herself out I bear no malice towards her Caudle not the least Still I don t think I could lie at peace in my grave if well I won t say anything more about her but you know what I mean I think dear mother would keep house beautifully for you when I m gone Well love I won t talk in that way if you desire it Still I know I ve a dreadful cold though I won t allow it for a minute to be the shoes certainly not I never would wear em thick and you know it and they never gave me a cold yet No dearest Caudle it s ten years ago that did it not that I ll say a syllable of the matter to hurt you I d die first Mother you see knows all your little ways and you wouldn t get another wife to study you and pet you up as I ve done a second wife never does it isn t likely she should And after all we ve been very happy It hasn t been my fault if we ve ever had a word or two for you couldn t help now and then being aggravating nobody can help their tempers always especially men Still we ve been very happy haven t we Caudle Good night Yes this cold does tear me to pieces but for all that it isn t the shoes God bless you Caudle no it s NOT the shoes I won t say it s the key hole but again I say it s not the shoes God bless you once more But never say it s the shoes The above significant sketch is a correct copy of a drawing from the hand of Caudle at the end of this Lecture It can hardly we think be imagined that missus Caudle during her fatal illness never mixed admonishment with soothing as before but such fragmentary Lectures were doubtless considered by her disconsolate widower as having too touching too solemn an import to be vulgarised by type They were however printed on the heart of Caudle for he never ceased to speak of the late partner of his bed as either his sainted creature or that angel now in heaven POSTSCRIPT Our duty of editorship is closed We hope we have honestly fulfilled the task of selection from a large mass of papers We could have presented to the female world a Lecture for Every Night in the year Yes three hundred and sixty five separate Lectures We trust however that we have done enough And if we have armed weak woman with even one argument in her unequal contest with that imperious creature man if we have awarded to a sex as missus Caudle herself was wont to declare put upon from the beginning the slightest means of defence if we have supplied a solitary text to meet any one of the manifold wrongs with which woman in her household life is continually pressed by her tyrannic taskmaster man we feel that we have only paid back one grain hardly one of that mountain of more than gold it is our felicity to owe her During the progress of these Lectures it has very often pained us and that excessively to hear from unthinking inexperienced men bachelors of course that every woman no matter how divinely composed has in her ichor flowing veins one drop no bigger than a wren s eye of Caudle that Eve herself may now and then have been guilty of a lecture murmuring it balmily amongst the rose leaves It may be so still be it our pride never to believe it NEVER
