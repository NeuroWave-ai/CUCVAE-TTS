THREW UP HIS HANDS four hundred thirteen CAREERS OF DANGER AND DARING Illustration THE STEEPLE CLIMBER I IN WHICH WE MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF STEEPLE BOB DURING the summer months of nineteen hundred what blazing hot months to be sure people on lower Broadway were constantly coming upon other people with chins in the air staring up and exclaiming Dear me isn t it wonderful or There s that fellow again I m sure he ll break his neck Then they would pass on and give place to other wonderers The occasion of this general surprise and apprehension was a tall man dressed entirely in white who appeared day after day swinging on a little seat far up the side of this or that church steeple or right at the top hugging the gold cross or weather vane or higher still working his way with a queer kicking hitching movement up various hundred foot flagpoles that rise from the heaven challenging office buildings down near Wall Street At these perilous altitudes he would hang for hours shifting his ropes occasionally raising his swing or lowering it but not doing anything that his sidewalk audience could see very well or clearly understand Yet thousands watched him with fascination and a kodak army descended upon neighboring housetops and newspapers followed the movements of Steeple Bob in thrilling chronicle That is what he was called in large black letters at the head of columns Steeple Bob but I came to know him at his modest quarters on Lexington Avenue where he was plain mister Merrill a serious mannered and an unpretentious young man very fond of his wife and his dog very fond of spending evenings over books of adventure and quite indifferent to his day time notoriety I call him a young man yet in years of service not in age he is the oldest steeple climber in the business ever since his teacher Steeple Charlie fell from his swing some years ago in New Bedford Massachusetts and died the steeple climber s death I often saw books of the sea on Merrill s table and accounts of whaling voyages and he told me one evening while through an open door came the snores of his weary partner about his own adventurous boyhood with three years cruising in Uncle Sam s navy on the school ships Minnesota and Yantic he shipped at the age of twelve and two years at whale fishing in the North Sea Quite ideal training this for a steeple climber he learned to handle ropes and make them fast so they would stay fast he learned to climb and keep his head at the top of a swaying masthead he learned to bear exposure as lads must who are washed on deck every morning with a hose and stand for inspection winter and summer bare to the waist And he gained strength of arm and back swinging at the oar while whale lines strained on the sunk harpoon and patience in long stern chases and nerve when some stricken monster lashed the waters in agony and the boat danced on a reddened sea Merrill laughed about the climb up old Trinity s spire the first climb when he carried up the hauling rope and worked his way clear to the cross with nothing to help him but the hands and feet he was born with and did it coolly while men on the street below turned away sickened with fear for him I m telling you the truth said Steeple Bob when I say it was an easy climb any fairly active man could do it if he d forget the height I m not talking about all steeples some are hard and dangerous but the one on Trinity in spite of its three hundred odd feet has knobs of stone for ornament all the way up they call them corbels and all you have to do is to step from one to another How much of a step Oh when I stood on one the next one came to my breast and then I could just touch the one above that Illustration I HAD TO CRAWL AROUND AND OVER IT He called this easy climbing The only ticklish bit was just at the top where two great stones weighing about a ton apiece swell out like an apple on a stick and I had to crawl around and over that apple which was four feet or so across If it hadn t been for grooves and scrollwork in the stone I couldn t have done it and even as it was I had two or three minutes of hard wriggling after I kicked off with my feet and began pulling myself up You mean you hung by your hands from this big ball of stone I hung mostly by my fingers the scrolls weren t deep enough for my hands to go in And you drew yourself slowly up and around and over that ball Certainly that was the only way And it was at the very top Yes just under the cross It wasn t much though you could do it yourself I really think Merrill believed this He honestly saw no particular danger in that climb nor could I discover that he ever saw any particular danger in anything he had done He always made the point that if he had really thought the thing dangerous he wouldn t have done it And I conclude from this that being a steeple climber depends quite as much upon how a man thinks as upon what he can do A funny thing happened he added After I got over this hard place I slid into a V shaped space between the bulging stone and the steeple shaft and I lay there on my back for a minute or so resting But when I started to raise myself I found my weight had worked me down in the crotch and jammed me fast and it was quite a bit of time before I could get free How much time A minute Yes five minutes and it seemed a good deal longer Five minutes struggling in a sort of stone trap stretched out helpless at the very top of a steeple where one false move would mean destruction that is what Merrill spoke of as a funny thing Thanks I thought I will take my fun some other way and lower down You would be surprised he went on to feel the movement of a steeple It trembles all the time and answers every jar on the street below I guess old Trinity s steeple sways eighteen inches every time an elevated train passes And saint Paul s is even worse Why she rocks like a beautifully balanced cradle it would make some people seasick Perhaps you don t know it but the better a steeple is built the more she sways You want to look out for the ones that stand rigid there s something wrong with them most likely they re out of plumb Isn t there danger I asked that a steeple may get swaying too much say in a gale and go clear over Gale or not said Merrill a well made steeple must rock in the wind the same as a tree rocks That is the way it takes the storm by yielding to it If it didn t yield it would probably break Why the great shaft of the Washington Monument sways four or five feet when the wind blows hard Then he explained that modern steeples are built with a steel backbone if I may so call it running down from the top for many feet inside the stonework At Trinity for instance this backbone known as a dowel is four inches thick and forty five feet long a great steel mast stretching down through the cross down inside the heavy stones and ornaments and ending in massive beams and braces where the steeple s greater width gives full security What sort of work did you do on these steeples I asked All kinds stone mason s work painter s work blacksmith s work carpenter s work why a good steeple climber has to know something about most every trade It s painting flagpoles and scraping off shale from a steeple s sides and repairing loose stones and ornaments and putting up lightning rods and gilding crosses and cleaning smoke stacks so high that it makes you dizzy to look up let alone looking down and a dozen other things Sometimes we have to take a whole steeple down beginning at the top stone by stone unless it s a wooden steeple and then we burn her down five or six feet at a time with creosote painted around where you want the fire to stop the creosote puts it out Once I blew off the whole top of a steeple with dynamite and by the way I ll tell you about that some time Conversing with a steeple climber when he feels like telling things is like breathing oxygen you find it over stimulating In ten minutes matter of fact talking he opens so many vistas of thrilling interest that you stand before them bewildered He starts to answer one question and you burn to interrupt him with ten others each of which will lead you hopelessly away from the remaining nine Did you ever have any experiences with lightning I asked Merrill one day Oh a few he said A thunderbolt struck the Trinity steeple the very day we finished our work We had just taken down our tackle and staging after gilding the cross when by the way they say there s a hundred dollars in gold under that cross Really I exclaimed How did it get there Somebody ordered it put there when the steeple was built People often do queer things like that I painted a flagpole on a barn up in Massachusetts where there was four hundred dollars in gold hidden under the weather vane Everybody knew it was there because the farmer who put it there told everybody and my partner was crazy to saw off the end of that pole some night and fool em but of course I wouldn t have it Here was I quite off my thunderbolt trail and although curious about that farmer I came back to it resolutely Well resumed Merrill this lightning stroke came down the new rod all right until it reached the bell deck and there it circled round and round the steeple four or five times wrapping my assistant in bluish white flame Then it took a long jump straight down Wall Street smashed a flagpole to slivers and vanished Say there are things about lightning I ve never heard explained I know of a steeple climber for instance who was killed by lightning it must have been lightning although no one saw it strike There were two of them working on a scaffolding when a thunder storm came up and this man s partner started for the ground as climbers with any sense always do But this fellow was lazy or out of sorts or something and said he wouldn t go down he d stay on the steeple until the storm was over And he did stay there without getting any harm so far as anybody on the ground could see except a wetting Just the same when his partner went up again he found him stretched out on the scaffolding dead Frightened to death I suggested Illustration AT THE TOP OF saint PAUL S NEW YORK Merrill shook his head No they said it was lightning but it s queer how lightning could kill a man without being seen isn t it Then Merrill gave an experience of his own with a thunderbolt It was during this same busy summer of nineteen hundred while he and his partner were scraping the great steel smoke stack that rises from ground to roof along one side of the American Tract Society Building that towering structure which looks down with contempt no doubt upon ordinary church steeples We were in our saddles Merrill explained swung down about two thirds of the smoke stack s length when some black clouds warned us of danger and we hauled ourselves up to the roof My partner Walter Tyghe got off his saddle and stood there where my wife was waiting she often goes to climbing jobs with me she s less anxious when she can watch me but I thought the storm was passing over and kept on scraping sort of half resting on the cornice half on my saddle Suddenly a bolt shot down from a little pink cloud just overhead and splintered a big flagpole I had just put halyards on and then jumped past us all so close that it knocked Walter over and made me sick and giddy so that I fell back limp on my saddle board and swung there helpless until my wife pulled the trip rope that opens the lock block and drew me in from the edge That s not the first time she s been on deck at the right minute Once she came up a steeple to tell me something and found the hauling line smoldering from my helper s cigarette If that line had burned through it would have dropped me to the ground from the steeple top saddle lock block and all The man with the cigarette was so scared he quit smoking for good and all Here in reply to my question Merrill explained the working of a lock block which is simply a pulley that allows a rope to pass through it but will not let it go back With this block the steeple climber can be hauled up easily but cannot fall even if the man hauling should let go the rope When it is necessary to descend a pull on the trip rope releases a safety catch and the saddle goes down Do steeple climbers always work in pairs I asked him Illustration THEN MY PARTNER STOOD ON MY SHOULDERS Usually It would be hard for one man to do a steeple alone There are lots of places where you must have some one to fasten a rope or hold the end of a plank or pass you something Besides it wouldn t be good for a man s mind to be spending days and days upon steeples all alone It s bad enough with a partner to talk to That makes me think of poor old Dan O Brien If I hadn t been up with him one day Merrill checked himself and changed the subject I ll give you a case where a man alone could never have done the thing I don t care how clever a steeple climber he might be It was on saint Paul s New York after we had finished the job and taken everything down Then somebody noticed that the weather vane on top of the ball wasn t turning properly I knew in a minute what the matter was it was easy enough to fix it but the thing was to reach the weather vane I don t mean that the climb up the steeple was anything we had done that before but if I tried to climb around that big ball again it was the same sort of a wriggling business as that over the bulging stones at Trinity I would be sure to scrape off a lot of the fine gilding we had just put on And yet I couldn t get at the weather vane without getting over the ball I studied quite a while on this little problem and solved it with my partner s help We both climbed the steeple as far as the ball we went up the lightning rod then we roped ourselves on the steeple shaft by life lines and then my partner that was Joe Lawlor stood on my shoulders and did the job You see it was easy enough that way Easy enough Think of it Two men clinging to the point of a steeple One of them braces himself with the toes of his rubber shoes in crannies of the stone and the other balancing on his shoulders like a circus performer does a piece of work no matter what with a reeling abyss all around what is looking over a precipice compared to this and all the time the spire swaying back and forth like a forest tree And then you hear that instead of getting a large sum for such an achievement these men taking it through the year get scarcely more than ordinary workmen s wages II HOW THEY BLEW OFF THE TOP OF A STEEPLE WITH DYNAMITE KNOWN over all Connecticut 
5118-40456-0001	train-other-500	was the Congregational Church in Hartford that stood for years on Pearl Street and was famous alike for the burning words spoken beneath its roof and the tall straight spire that reached above it two hundred and thirty eight feet measured the drop from
5118-40456-0002	train-other-500	cross to pavement But churches pass like other things and near the century end came the decision by landowners and lease interpreters that this graceful length of brownstone and the pile beneath it must move off the premises which meant of course
5118-40456-0003	train-other-500	that the steeple must come down the time appointed for this demolition being August eighteen ninety nine
none	none	 Now the taking down of a steeple two hundred and thirty eight feet high that rises on a closely built city street is not so simple a proceeding as might at first appear 
5118-40456-0004	train-other-500	If you suggest pulling the steeple over all the neighbors cry out
none	none	 They wish to know where it is going to strike 
5118-40456-0005	train-other-500	Are you sure it won t smash down on their housetops
none	none	 Can you make a steeple fall this way or that way as woodmen make trees fall 
5118-40456-0006	train-other-500	How do you know you can Besides how are you going to hitch fast the rope that will pull it over And who will climb with such a rope to the steeple top It must be said
5118-40456-0007	train-other-500	that there is usually some young man at hand some dare devil character of the vicinity who is ready to try the thing and is positive he can succeed at it But luckily he seldom gets a chance to try
5118-40456-0008	train-other-500	It s queer said Merrill telling me the story how people ever built a steeple like this one without a window in it or an air passage or anything for ventilation
none	none	 Between the bell deck and the cross there wasn t a single opening from the inside out so I had to break my way through up near the top 
5118-40456-0009	train-other-500	What a place for a man to work squeezed in the point of a stifling funnel
none	none	 with no swing for his hammer and no air to breathe 
5118-40456-0010	train-other-500	and the scorch of an August sun After fifteen minutes of it my wrists and temples would be pounding so I d have to come down and rest Of course the purpose of this hole that I knocked through the steeple top
5118-40456-0011	train-other-500	was to make fast ropes and pulleys so my partner and I could hoist ourselves along the outside and not have to climb up the inside cross beams which I can tell you is a lively bit of athletics Well we got our ropes fixed all right
5118-40456-0012	train-other-500	about twenty five feet below the top and the bosun s saddle
none	none	 swung below for us to travel up 
5118-40456-0013	train-other-500	and down in and then we made fast another set of ropes and pulleys about fifteen feet higher up
none	none	 this was for hoisting timber and stuff that we needed 
5118-40456-0014	train-other-500	How did you get up that fifteen feet I inquired Worked up on the stirrups that is two nooses around the steeple each ending in a loop one for the right foot one for the left
5118-40456-0015	train-other-500	You stand in the right stirrup and work the left loop up then you stand in the left stirrup and work the right loop up Sometimes in hard places you have to throw your nooses around the shaft as a cowboy casts a rope Come down some day and watch us work
none	none	 you ll see the whole thing To this invitation I gave glad acceptance I certainly wished to see this stirrup climbing process Illustration SOMETIMES IN HARD PLACES YOU HAVE TO THROW YOUR NOOSES AROUND THE SHAFT The next thing continued Merrill was to make another hole in the steeple through a keystone a little below our first hole In this hole we set a block of Norway pine resting on an iron jack The block was about a foot square and twenty two inches high a big tough piece 
5118-40456-0016	train-other-500	you see and by screwing up the jack we could make that part as solid as the keystone was We made this hole on the east side of the steeple
none	none	 which was the side we wanted her to fall on the only side she could fall on without injuring something and we had it figured out so close that we dug a trench on that side straight out from the steeple s base ten feet wide and four feet deep and told people we intended to have the whole top of that steeple say a length of thirty five feet and a weight of thirty five tons come off at one time and land right square in that trench and nowhere else That s what we intended to do Now began the hoisting of materials 
5118-40456-0017	train-other-500	first a lot of half inch wire cable enough for four turns around the steeple then eight sixteen foot timbers two inches thick and a foot wide then a lot of maple wedges
none	none	 We bandaged the steeple with the cable and drew it tight with tackle 
5118-40456-0018	train-other-500	Then we lowered the timbers lengthwise inside the cable which we could do because the steeple was an octagon with ornamented corners
none	none	 and these left spaces where the wire rope was stretched around Then we wedged fast the eight timbers so that they formed a sixteen foot half collar on the west side of the steeple 
5118-40456-0019	train-other-500	just opposite our hole where the jack was In other words we had the steeple shored in so that when we let her go no loose stones could fall on the west side everything must fall to the east Last of all
none	none	 we widened our hole on the east side stripping away stones until that whole side lay open 
5118-40456-0020	train-other-500	in a half circular mouth about four feet high And in this mouth were two teeth one might say
none	none	 that held the stone jaws apart 
5118-40456-0021	train-other-500	the iron jack biting into the block of Norway pine
none	none	 On those two now came the steeple s weight or anyhow one half of it To knock out one of these teeth would be to leave the east side of the steeple unsupported 
5118-40456-0022	train-other-500	with the result that it must topple over in that direction and fall to the ground
none	none	 Anyway that was our reasoning 
5118-40456-0023	train-other-500	and it seemed sound enough the only question was how we were going to knock out that block of Norway pine Well the day of the test came and I guess five thousand people were there to see what would happen
5118-40456-0024	train-other-500	Everybody was discussing it and farmers had driven in for miles just as they do for a hanging
none	none	 You understand I was under the orders of the contractor and he had his own plan about getting the block out He proposed to hitch a rope to it drop this rope to a donkey engine in the yard and set the engine winding up the rope He said the block would have to come out then and the steeple fall I agreed that the block might come out but was afraid it would tip up through the strain coming at an angle and throw the steeple over to the west just the way we didn t want it to go And if that steeple ever fell to the west 
5118-40456-0025	train-other-500	there was no telling how many people it would kill in the crowd without counting damage to houses However the contractor was boss and he stuck to it his way was right so we hitched the engine to the block and set her going
none	none	 She puffed and tugged a little and then snapped the rope We got another rope and she broke that too Then we got a stronger rope and the engine just kicked herself around the yard and had lots of fun 
5118-40456-0026	train-other-500	but the block never budged All that morning we tried one scheme after another to make that engine pull the block out but we might as well have hitched a rope to the church the steeple s weight was too much for us
5118-40456-0027	train-other-500	And all the time the crowd was getting bigger and bigger until the police could hardly manage it Finally the contractor being very mad and quite anxious
none	none	 said he d be hanged if he could get the block out and for me to try my scheme 
5118-40456-0028	train-other-500	and do it quick for some men were
none	none	 going about saying the thing was dangerous and ought to be stopped 
5118-40456-0029	train-other-500	He didn t have to speak twice before I was on my way up that steeple carrying an inch auger a fifty foot fuse and a stick of dynamite

5118-40456-0031	train-other-500	and before I was twenty feet up the ladder a police officer was after me ordering me down I went right ahead pretending not to hear and when I got to the bell deck he was puffing along ten yards below me
5118-40456-0032	train-other-500	I swung into my bosun s saddle and began pulling myself up outside the steeple and I guess the whole five thousand people around the church bent back their heads to watch me As soon as I began to rise in the saddle I knew I was all right
none	none	 for I coiled up the hauling line on my arm so the officer couldn t follow me All he could do was stand on the bell deck and gape after me like the rest and growl When I reached the block I bored a six inch hole into her 
5118-40456-0033	train-other-500	at a downward slant and in this I put some crumbs of dynamite not much only about half a teaspoonful and then I stuck in the fuse and tamped her solid with sand
none	none	 Then I lit the other end dropped it down inside the steeple and slid down the rope as fast as I could yelling to the officer that I d touched her off You ought to have seen him get out of that steeple He never waited to arrest me or anything 
5118-40456-0034	train-other-500	he had pressing business on the ground By the time I got down you could see a little trail of bluish smoke drifting away from the hole and there was a hush over the crowd except for the police trying to make them stand back behind the ropes
5118-40456-0035	train-other-500	I don t know as I ever saw a bigger crowd the street was jammed for blocks either way Well sir that was a queer acting fuse It smoked and smoked for about ten minutes

5118-40456-0036	train-other-500	he was sure I had made another failure I didn t know what to think I just waited We waited ten minutes twelve minutes it seemed like an hour but nobody dared go up to see what the matter was Then suddenly the explosion came
5118-40456-0037	train-other-500	no louder than a pistol crack for dynamite isn t noisy but it stirred me more than a cannon Start your engine I shouted and the little dummy had just time to wind up half a turn of the hitch line when the old steeple top swayed and broke clean in two
5118-40456-0038	train-other-500	right where the block was and the whole upper length fell like one piece fell to the east
none	none	 just as we had planned it 
5118-40456-0039	train-other-500	and landed in the trench every stone of it there wasn t a piece as big as your fingernail sir outside that trench And while she was falling I don t know how many kodaks were snapped in the hope of getting a picture
none	none	 men and women with cameras had been waiting for hours on the roofs of high buildings and two or three of them actually caught a picture of the steeple top as it hung in the air for a fraction of a second at right angles to the base Illustration PICTURE OF THE FALLING STEEPLE PHOTOGRAPHED JUST AFTER THE DYNAMITE EXPLODED THE FALLING SECTION WAS thirty five FEET IN LENGTH AND WEIGHED thirty five TONS III THE GREATEST DANGER TO A STEEPLE CLIMBER LIES IN BEING STARTLED IT appears that professional steeple climbers are quiet mannered men with a certain gentleness of voice like deaf people that impresses one far more than any strident boasting This habit of silence they form from being silent so much aloft And when they do speak it is in a low tone because that is the least startling to a man as he swings over some reeling gulf Next to an actual disaster which usually kills outright and painlessly what a steeple climber most dreads is being startled This was explained to me in one of our many talks by Steeple Bob famous over the land for daring feats but never reckless ones How plainly I call up his pale serious face and the massive shoulders somewhat bent and the forearm with muscles to impress a prize fighter Pleasant to note that Merrill uses excellent English Did you ever have an impulse to jump off a steeple I questioned recalling the sensations of many people in looking down even from a housetop I ve kept pretty free from that said he but there s no doubt climbing steeples does tell on a man s nerves Now there was Dan O Brien he had an impulse to jump off a steeple one day and a strong impulse too He went mad on one of the tallest spires in Cincinnati right at the top of it Went mad Yes sir raving mad and I was by him when it happened I forget whether the church was Baptist or Presbyterian but I know it stood on Sixth Street near Vine and there was a big hand on top of the steeple with the forefinger pointing to heaven We were putting fresh gilding on this hand I was working on the thumb side and O Brien on the little finger side both of us standing on tiny stagings about the size of a chair seat and both of us made fast to the steeple by life lines under our arms That s an absolute rule in climbing steeples never to do the smallest thing unless you re secured by a life line It was coming on dark and I was hurrying to get the gold leaf on because we d given the hand a fresh coat of sizing that would be dry before morning We hadn t spoken for some time when suddenly I heard a laugh from O Brien s side that sent a shiver down my spine Did you ever hear a crazy man laugh Well if ever you do you ll remember it I looked at him and saw by his face that something was wrong What are you doing said I He answered very polite and steady like but his tone was queer I m trying to figure out how long it would take a man to get down if he went the fastest way I thought I had better keep him in a good humor so I said I ll tell you what Dan you brace up and get this gold on and then we ll race to the ground in our saddles That s a fair idea said he in a shrill voice but I ve got a better one We ll race down without any saddles yes sir without any lines without a blamed thing Don t be a fool Dan What you want to do is to get that gold on quick I tried to speak sharp No sir I m going to jump and so are you I caught his eye just then and saw it wasn t any time to bother about gold leaf I reached up and eased the hitch of my line around the hand so I could swing toward him I knew if I once got my grip on him he wouldn t make any more trouble But I d never had a crazy man to deal with and I didn t realize how tricky and quick they are While I was working around to his side and thinking he didn t notice it he was laying for me out of the corner of his eye and the first thing I knew he had me by the throat and everything was turning black I let go of the line and dropped back on my saddle board helpless and if it hadn t been for blind luck I guess the people down below would have got their money s worth in about a minute But my hand struck on the tool box as he pressed me back and I had just strength enough left to shut my fingers on the first tool I touched and strike at him with it The tool happened to be a monkey wrench and when a man gets a clip on the head with a thing like that he s pretty apt to keep still for a while And that s what O Brien did He keeled over and lay there and I did too until my head got steady Even then I guess we d both have fallen if it hadn t been for the life lines The rest was simple enough after I got my senses back Dan was unconscious and all I had to do was fasten a rope to him and lower away They took care of him down below until the ambulance came and he spent that night in a hospital And he s spent most of his years since then in an asylum his mind all gone except for short periods when he comes to himself again and then he always starts out to put an end to me That last impulse to destroy me has never left him It was after this that I learned about that other danger to steeple climbers of being startled Merrill says that men of his craft whether they realize it or not work under constant nervous strain However calm a steeple climber may think himself his body is always afraid his muscles are always tense his clutch on ropes and stones is always harder two or three times harder than the need is his knees hug what comes between them so tightly that it hurts even when they might safely be relaxed That is the trouble a steeple climber cannot relax his body or control its instinctive shrinking It is not looking down into the gulf around him that he minds the climber who cannot do that with indifference is unfit for the business what he sees he can cope with it is what he cannot see that does the mischief what he fears vaguely And a sudden noise an unexpected movement may throw him into all but panic So the veteran climber swinging at the steeple top opposite his partner is careful to say in a low tone I m going to lower my saddle before he does lower it or I m going to strike a match before he strikes it Sometimes a new helper at the hauling line down on the bell deck will shift his place from weariness or thoughtlessness and let the line move up an inch or two which drops the saddle an inch or two far aloft drops it suddenly with a jerk It s a little thing yet the climber s heart would not pound harder were the whole steeple falling Merrill told me that one of his greatest frights came from the simple brushing against his legs of a rope pulled without a word by a careless partner To Merrill s nerves all a quiver this was not a rope but some nameless catastrophe to overwhelm him He knew only that something had moved where nothing had any business to move that something had touched him where nothing was A steeple climber is like a child in the dark in terror of the unknown In all the world perhaps there is no one so utterly alone as he swinging hour after hour on his steeple top The aeronaut has with him a living surging creature his balloon the diver feels always the teeming life of the waters but this man lifted into still air poised on a point where nothing comes or goes where nothing moves where nothing makes a sound he in very truth is alone Illustration LOOKING FROM THE GROUND UPWARD AT saint PAUL S SPIRE BROADWAY NEW YORK CITY It s always the little things that frighten you reflected Merrill not the big things I ll give you an instance When I went up inside saint Paul s steeple the first time I wanted to inspect the beams and see how the dowel was anchored I got into a tight place that might well frighten a man I got squeezed fast between timbers that fill nearly all the slender top space and couldn t get up or down but just hung there breathing air full of dust and calling for help I called three quarters of an hour before any one came and then it was only by accident But I wasn t frightened On the other hand a day or two later when I was making fast a rope outside I was just under the ball that holds the weather vane I got a bad start from nothing at all I had my arms around the spindle of the steeple making a hitch and my head pressed against the copper sheathing when I heard a most unearthly screech I guess the shock of that thing did me five hundred dollars worth of harm shortened my life days enough to earn five hundred dollars in And what do you think it was The weather vane had turned a little in the wind and creaked on its bearings that s all It doesn t seem as if that ought to scare a man does it There was something quite touching I thought in the humble frankness of this big shouldered man Yes he had been afraid he whose business it was to fear nothing afraid of some squeaking copper and his face seemed to say that there are things about steeples not so easily explained things not even to be talked about And abruptly as by an effort he left this part of the subject and told a funny story of his adventures coming home late one night without a key and getting in by way of the roof and an iron pipe a simple enough climb had he not been taken for a purglaire by an irate German lodger who appeared in nightgown and phlegmatic fright and vowed he would haf him a revolfer a skelf skooter in the morning This effort at diversion turned Merrill into gaiety for a moment but straightway memory brought back the somber theme I ll give you another case said he changing again abruptly where I wasn t frightened but should have been It was out in Chicago and two of us were on a staging hung down the front of a clothing factory We were painting the walls My partner had made his end of the staging fast and I had made mine fast Perhaps if I d been longer in the business I would have taken more notice how he secured his rope for it meant safety to me as well as him and I knew he d been drinking but I supposed it was all right Well it wasn t all right his rope held for three or four hours and then at just about eleven o clock it slipped and the staging fell from under us We were six stories up and right below were the sidewalk flagstones That s the time I ought to have been frightened but I only said to myself Hello this thing s going down and caught the window ledge in front of me Then I hung there wondering if I could pull myself up or if any one would come to help me I called out not very loud and I wasn t excited Pretty soon I saw I couldn t pull myself up for I had a poor hold with my fingers and the ledge was smooth stone Then I saw they d have to hurry if they were going to pull me in Then I didn t care I I You fell He nodded What six stories down He nodded again The thing that saved me was an awning over the sidewalk Some man across the way saw me hanging from the window and he ran over quickly and let the awning down I d like to shake that man by the hand but I never knew who he was When I came to myself I was at the hospital done up in plaster and I stayed there nine months Badly hurt I asked shrinking Merrill smiled It didn t do me any particular good I m a big strong fellow now but I wasn t much after that fall Both my legs were broken Both my arms were broken My right shoulder and right wrist were dislocated and let s see Oh yes I had three ribs torn away from the breast bone And your My partner Poor lad You wouldn t care to hear how they found him They laid him away kindly the next day He smiled in a sort of appealing way and then came the worn wistful look I had noticed and his forehead lines deepened I fancy all men who follow steeple climbing get those strained anxious eyes IV EXPERIENCE OF AN AMATEUR CLIMBING TO A STEEPLE TOP IT came to my knowledge one bracing day in October that Steeple Bob had agreed to do that famous Brooklyn Church of the Pilgrims with its queer crooked spire and big brass ball a landmark from the river on Columbia Heights It s one of those easy jobs that are the hardest said Merrill If you want to see us use the stirrups come over That was exactly what I did want to see this puzzling stirrup process which allows a man to lift himself by his boot straps as it were up the last and narrowest and most dangerous length of a steeple so I agreed to be there If you like you can go up on the swing yourself said Merrill with the air of conferring a favor I expressed my thanks as I would to a lion tamer offering me the hospitality of his cages then asked how he meant that easy jobs are the hardest Illustration GILDING A CHURCH CROSS ABOVE NEW YORK CITY Why easy jobs make a man careless and that gets him into trouble Another thing little old churches look easy but they re apt to be treacherous Now this steeple on the Church of the Pilgrims is built of wood with loose shingles on it and a tumble down iron lightning rod and rickety beams and shaky ladders and well you feel all the time as if you were walking on eggs It s just the kind of a steeple that killed young Romaine about a month ago Of course I asked for the story of young Romaine and was told of certain climbers who advertise their skill by using a steeple top for acrobatic feats that have nothing to do with repairing Upon such Merrill frowned severely Romaine was a fine athlete said he and a fearless man but he went too far He would stretch out on his stomach across the top of a steeple and balance there without touching hands or knees and he d do all sorts of circus tricks on lightning rods and weather vanes and flagpoles anything for notoriety I told him he d get killed sure some day but he laughed at me Well it wasn t a week after I warned him when he was killed He climbed an old lightning rod without testing it it was on a little church up at Cold Spring New York and just as he was reaching the steeple top with a whole town watching him the end of the rod pulled out and he swung off with it ripping out every dowel like the buttons off a coat right down to the ground smash Poor fellow when I read the news I left my job at Trinity and took the first train up to bury him This sad story lingered in my mind that night and was there still the next afternoon as I drew near the Church of the Pilgrims to witness the first day s climbing Already at a distance I knew that the men were at work from the upbent heads of people on the street who stared and pointed And presently I made out two white figures on the steeple one swinging about fifteen feet below the ball the other standing against the shingled side without any support that I could see Up the old tower inside I made my way and two ladders beyond the bell deck came upon Walter Tyghe Steeple Bob s assistant astride of a stone saddle on one of the four peaks where the tower ends and the steeple begins There was a clear drop of a hundred feet all around him He was tending the two men aloft as witnessed a couple of ropes dangling by him It was two jerks to come down and one to go up Were he to lose his balance and let go the hauling rope the men on the swing would instantly be killed as they had no lock blocks on Come out here said Walter there s plenty of room and thus encouraged I straddled the peak and we sat face to face as two men might sit on a child s rocking horse while the tower pigeons circled beneath us alarmed at this intrusion Far down on the sidewalk were little faces of distorted people far up at the steeple top were legs kicking at ropes And off over red housetops was the river and the great towers of New York spread with silver plumes by the steam jets Now you can see the stirrups working said Walter and looking up I saw a figure swing back from the steeple an arm shoot out and a length of rope go wriggling around the shaft cast like a lasso Then the rope was drawn into a noose and the noose hauled tight The legs kicked the figure hitched itself up about a foot and again the rope was cast another rope and a second noose still higher made secure That is all there is to it The steeple climber stands in a stirrup held by one noose while he lassoes the shaft above him with another noose supporting another stirrup on which he presently stands And so foot by foot the climber rises shifting noose and stirrup at each change resting now on one now on the other and finally reaching the cross or ball or weather vane at the very top That s Joe Lawlor chuckin the rope explained Walter Merrill he s on the swing Say Lawlor s a wonder at rigging He can do anything with ropes He s the feller that climbs up the front of a house with suckers on his feet Of this fact I took note and then inquired if I couldn t get up further inside the steeple so as to be nearer the men Walter said I could climb ladders up to where they had punched a hole through for the rope to hold the block and falls and I tried it Alas when I got there after breathing dust and squeezing between beams I found that I could see nothing I was almost at the steeple top and could hear Merrill through the wooden shell humming a tune as he worked but I was further away than before Hello in there came a voice Don t monkey with that line And it came to me that this rope reaching down by me from yonder little hole the one knocked through held the block which held the swing which held the man And an accident to this rope would mean instant death I touched it and drew my hand away as one might touch some animal through the cage bars and I felt like saying Good little rope It was coming on to dark now and we all went home together over the bridge and up the avenues talking of steeples the while And Lawlor explained the action of his suckers in climbing walls which is precisely that of a boy s sucker in lifting a brick The big climbing leathers well soaked in oil are pressed alternately against the stones the right leg resting on one while the left leg presses the other against the wall a step higher And so you walk right up the building or church or flagpole and the smoother the surface the easier you go up In fact if the surface is rough you cannot use the suckers at all as the air gets under and prevents their holding Then the men spoke of various jobs aloft that called up memories Merrill told of cleaning the fifteen foot Diana statue on the Madison Square Garden tower It s hard getting over her he said because she s so blamed smooth I guess I took three quarts of rust out of her ball bearings You know she s a weather vane and turns with the wind I wondered how many New Yorkers who see the Diana every day of their lives have ever dwelt on the fact that she turns Talking of weather vanes reminded my friends of a ticklish job they did on saint Paul s steeple in New York when Merrill standing under the ball held Lawlor on his giant shoulders so that Joe could lift off the weather vane on top and ease the shaft where it had jammed With Lawlor s weight and the weather vane s weight Steeple Bob held four hundred pounds on his shoulders during those important minutes and it might almost be said stood on the dizzy edge of nothing while he did it Finally Lawlor expressed the opinion that there isn t any meaner job in the business than a chimney A chimney said I That s what I mean one o them big ones you see on factories We have to scrape em and paint em just like steeples and that means climbing up the whole length inside The climbing s easy enough on bolts and braces but it s something fierce the air you breathe Why I ve gone up a two hundred and forty foot chimney with a five foot opening at the bottom and found the soot so thick about half way up so thick sir that I ve been almost stuck in it Yes sir just had to shove my head into an eight inch hole and bore through black stuff beds of it And mind not a hole for air as big as a pin head from bottom to top After bidding the men good night I reflected with a kind of shame that I had drawn back from daring only once what they dare every day what they must dare for their living And I reasoned myself into a feeling that it was my duty under the circumstances to go up that steeple on the swing as Merrill had proposed Having begun this investigation I must see it through and in this mind I went to the church again the next day I found all hands on the bell deck spreading out packets of patent gilding for the ball which awaited its new dress all sticky from a fresh coat of sizing Lawlor remarked that there was better gold in these little yellow squares than in a wedding ring It s twenty four carats fine said he and about as thick as a cobweb As to my going up on the swing there was no difficulty Lawlor would go first and be there to keep me in good heart for they say it is not well for a novice to be at a steeple top alone Merrill would see to the lashings and Walter would give a hand at the hauling line Thus all conditions favored my ascent even the sun smiled and after taking off coat and hat I was ready There we were at the top of the tower and at the base of the steeple Lawlor red faced and red shirted preparing to ascend Merrill pale as he always is but powerful standing at the ropes and I in shirt sleeves and bareheaded watching Walter make a little harness for my kodak After a time Lawlor having reached the top called down something and Merrill answered It was my turn now I climbed out through a small window and stood on the ledge while Steeple Bob dropped the swing noose over my head and proceeded to lash me fast to seat and ropes That s in case a suicidal impulse should get hold of you he said smiling but meaning it Now keep this rope between your legs and work your hands up along it as we lift you It s anchored to saint Peter Then he explained how I was to press my toes against the steeple side so as to keep my knees from barking on the shingles And don t look down at all he told me Just watch your ropes and take it easy Are you ready At this moment Walter said something in a low tone and Merrill asked me to lend him my knife I handed it out and he stuck it in his pocket You don t need this now said he and a moment later the pulley ropes tightened and my small swing board lifted under me I was rising Shove off there with your toes he cried Take short steps Put your legs wider apart Wider yet You don t have to pull on the rope Just slide your hands along Now you re going I saw nothing but the steeple side in front of me and the life line hanging down like a bell rope between my spread legs and the pulley block creaking by my head and the toes of my shoes as I pressed them against the shingles step by step It struck me as a ridiculous thing to be climbing a steeple in patent leather shoes I smiled to think of the odd appearance I must present from below And then for the first time I let my eyes turn into the depths and caught a glimpse of men on housetops watching me I saw Merrill s upturned face down where the ropes ended And I saw little horses wriggling along on the street Illustration HOW THE STEEPLE CLIMBER GOES UP A FLAGPOLE There were three places where the steeple narrowed into slenderer lengths and at each one was a sort of cornice to be scrambled over and loose nails to be avoided and then more careful steering with legs and toes to keep on one particular face of the steeple and not swing off and come bumping back a disconcerting possibility Hello called Lawlor presently from above You re doing fine Come right along And before I knew it the swing had stopped I was at the top or as near it as the tackle could take me The remaining fifteen feet or so must be made with stirrups And there was Lawlor standing in them up by the ball There was not a stick of staging to support him he had scorned the bother of hauling up boards for so simple a job and he was working with both hands free each leg standing on its stirrup and several hitches of life line holding him to the shaft top by his waist This steeple lassoing exploit was one of the things I certainly would not attempt would not and could not Strangely enough as I hung here at rest I felt the danger more than coming up It seemed most perilous to rest my weight on the swing board and I found myself holding my legs drawn up with muscles tense as if that could make me lighter Gradually I realized the foolishness of this and relaxed into greater comfort but not entirely Even veteran steeple climbers waste much strength in needless clutching cannot free their bodies from this instinctive fear I stayed up long enough to take three photographs some minutes passed before I could unlash my kodak and here I had further proof of subconscious fright for I made such blunders with shutter and focus length as would put the youngest amateur to shame Two pictures out of the three were failures and the third but an indifferent success There is one thing to be said in extenuation that a steeple is never still but always rocking and trembling When Lawlor changed his stirrup hitches or moved from side to side the old beams would groan under us and the whole structure rock She d rock more said Lawlor if she was better built A good steeple always rocks There wasn t much more to say or do up here and presently we exchanged jerks on the line for the descent And Lawlor cried Lower away Hang on now And I did over again my humble part of leg spreading and toe steering with the result that presently I was down on the bell deck again receiving congratulations Here s your knife said Merrill after he had unlashed me What did you take it for I asked Oh men sometimes get a mania to cut the ropes when they go up the first time And that isn t good for their health I was pretty sure you d keep your head but I wasn t taking any chances After this came thanks and warm hand grips all around and then I left these daring men to their duties and went down the lower ladders I am sure I never appreciated the simple privilege of standing on a sidewalk as I did a few minutes later when I left the Church of the Pilgrims and came out into the pleasant autumn sunshine THE DEEP SEA DIVER I SOME FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF MEN WHO GO DOWN UNDER THE SEA IN old South Street far down on the New York river front is a gloomy brick building with black fire escapes zigzagging across its face and a life size diver painted over its door in red helmet and yellow goggle eyes to the awe and admiration of the young to the awe and admiration of anybody who comes through this wicked looking street by night and smells the sea and stares along miles of ships noses that reach right over the car tracks and finally stops at the black lettered announcement that wrecks are looked after here day or night and mysteries of the deep penetrated by gentlemen of the diving profession in just such gigantic suits as this painted one None of this had I noticed late one night being occupied with the silent hungry ships and the fire cars trailing over the dim bridge until a brisk banjo strumming caught my ear and I paused at the house of wrecks whence the sounds came Somebody back in these moldering shadows was playing the Turkish Patrol and playing it remarkably well I followed the light down a narrow passage and presently came upon the modern wrecker in the person of Benjamin F Bean a large man smoking contentedly at a table whereon rested a telephone and phonograph The phonograph was playing the Turkish Patrol and a single incandescent lamp swinging overhead illumined the scene There were coils of rope about and photographs of vessels in distress and a bunk with tumbled sheets at one side where mister Bean slept often with his clothes on while awaiting the ring of sundry danger bells Divers fully expect to be objects of curiosity for never do they work except before wondering audiences so this one found my visit natural enough was glad I think to talk a little and let the phonograph rest It must be rather lonely after all watching for wrecks hour after hour night after night listening always for footsteps the officer s tramp or the thug s stealthy tread listening always to the hoot of passing vessels listening always for bad news He explained to me what happens when the bad news comes say a collision up the Hudson a ferry boat on fire down the bay a line of barges sunk in the Sound any one of a dozen ordinary disasters In olden times such tidings must have traveled from mouth to mouth and the wreckers of those days flashed their calls and warnings with beacon fires Now electricity does all this much better with the click of a key and presently somebody somewhere has the office at the end of a wire telling what the trouble is and forthwith the man in charge puts machinery in motion that will change this trouble into cash Br r r r calls the telephone up spring messenger boys in distant all night stations and in half an hour door bells are ringing in Harlem or Jersey City and the men who ought to know things know them and whistles are sounding on big pontoons that can lift two hundred tons and sleepy men are tumbling out of their bunks and great chains are clanking and tug boats are sputtering forth for the towing of sundry hoisting and pumping craft that go splashing along to the danger spot with all appliances aboard pneumatic hydraulic not to mention savory hot coffee served to the divers and the crew Most divers are poor story tellers perhaps because the marvelous grows commonplace to them from over indulgence in it but the stories are there in their lives if only you can dig them out I asked Bean if he often went down himself and found that he was still in active service after twenty odd years of it which certainly had agreed with him He was just back from a sad errand in Pennsylvania A boy had gone swimming in a slate quarry and been drowned they had dragged for him and fired cannon over the water but nothing had availed and so finally a diver was sent for from the city the diver being Bean The quarry was a great chasm four or five hundred feet deep with eighty feet of water filling various galleries and rock shelves in one of which the poor lad had been caught and held The question was in which one Well said Bean coming abruptly to the end I went down and got him That was his way of telling the story he went down and got him There was nothing more to say nothing about the two days perilous search through every tunnel and recess of those rocky walls nothing about the three thousand excited people who crowded around the quarry s mouth awaiting the issue nor the scene when that pitiful burden was hauled up from the depths I asked Bean if he had ever been in great danger while under the water Nothing special he said and then added after thinking Once I had my helmet twisted off Illustration PORTRAIT OF A DIVER DRAWN FROM LIFE What below He nodded How can a diver live with his helmet off He can t usually T was just luck they got me up in time They say my face was black as a coal And he had no more to tell of this adventure With few exceptions divers take their career in exactly this phlegmatic matter of fact way I fancy a man of vivid imagination would break under the strain of such a life Yet often divers will go into great details about some little incident as when Bean described the hoisting of a certain boiler sunk outside of Sandy Hook It had been on a tug boat of such a name it was so many feet long and wide and other things about the tide and the steam derrick and what the captain said the point being that this boiler had acted as an enormous trap for the blackfish of which they had found some hundreds of big ones splashing about inside unable to escape So our talk ran on and all the time I was thinking how I would like to see these things for myself And it came to pass as the subject kept its hold on me that I did see them Indeed I spent a whole summer month and found zest in it beyond ordinary summer pleasurings in observing the practical operations of diving and wrecking as they go on in the waters about New York I discovered other wrecking companies notably one on West Street and from the head man here learned many things He took me out on a pier one day where one of his crews was rescuing thirty thousand dollars worth of copper buried under the North River Every few minutes with a chunk chunk of the engine and a rattle of chains the dredge would bring up a fistful of mud an iron fist holding a ton or so and slap it down on the deck where a strong hose stream would wash out little canvas bags of copper ore each worth a ten dollar bill in the market This will show you said the expert what a diver has to contend with at the bottom of a river He often sinks four or five feet in the mud just as those bags sink and sometimes the mud suction holds him down so hard that three men pulling on the life line can scarcely budge him And when the mud lets go the diver comes out of it like a cork from a bottle You can feel him flop over clean tuckered out with kicking and working his arms They let him lie there a minute or two to rest and then pull him up Why vessels will sink ten or twelve feet in the mud so that the diver has to take a hose down and wash a tunnel out below the keel to get a lifting chain under Wash a tunnel out I inquired That s what they do You know how you can bore a hole in a sand bank don t you with a stream of water Well it s just the same with a mud bank down below only you need more pressure Sometimes we use a stream of compressed air The diver steers the hose just as a fireman steers the fire hose and once in a while gets knocked over by the force of it just as a fireman does Tunneling mud banks under water with streams of water or streams of compressed air struck me as decidedly a novelty I was to hear of stranger things ere long My guide presently pointed out a splendidly built young man who was shoveling mud off the deck not far from us There said he is a case that illustrates the worst of this business That fellow is made to be a diver he s intelligent he s not afraid and he can stand having the suit on he s been down two or three times and done easy jobs of patching If he d keep straight for a year or two he could earn his ten dollars a day with the best of them But he won t keep straight The poor fellow drinks We can t depend on him And here he is shoveling mud for a dollar and a quarter a day and no steady work at that Illustration THE DIVER S HELMET SHOWED LIKE THE BACK OF A BIG TURTLE Ten dollars a day seemed a handsome wage and I asked if divers generally earn so much Good ones do and a diver s day is only four hours long or less when they go to great depths And they draw a salary besides and often receive handsome presents You ought to see our chief diver Bill Atkinson he lives in a brownstone house He paused a moment and then added But I guess they earn all they get A few days later I made mister Atkinson s acquaintance on board the steam pump Dunderberg then busy raising a coal barge sunk off Fourteenth Street in the East River Atkinson was down doing carpenter work on holes stove in her and I stood on deck beside the man tending him and watched the bubbles boil up from the diver s breathing and the signals on a rubber hose and a rope It was less air or more air by jerks on the hose It was rags for a leak or a heavier hammer or a piece of batten so and so long with nails ready driven at the corners all were indicated by pulls on the life line or the startling appearance of hands or fingers Atkinson s that would now and then reach above water and move impatiently The wreck was only five or six feet under and the diver s helmet showed like the back of a big turtle whenever he stood up straight on the sunken deck Suddenly there is a scurry of barefoot youths along the pier timbers The diver is coming up Now he lifts himself slowly under the crushing weight one short step at a time up the ladder No man at all is this but a dripping three eyed monster of rubber and brass infinitely fascinating to wharf loungers The tender twists off the face glass and Atkinson says something with a snap in it and explains what he is trying to do at the forward hatch Then he leans over the rail on his stomach and rests Then he goes down again He s the best natured man I know Bill is remarked Captain Taylor commander of the Dunderberg but all men get irritable under water Why I ve had men who wouldn t swear for the world up in the air tell me they rip out cuss words something terrible down on the bottom Just seems like they can t help it I noticed that the tender did not join in our talk but stood with hands on his lines and eyes on the water absorbed in his responsibility he looked like an angler about to land a big fish Neither did the men at the air pump talk This feeding breath to a diver is serious business How long would he live do you think I asked if the pump should stop Mebbe a minute mebbe two said Captain Taylor I knew a Norwegian who was down in fifty feet of water when the hose busted It busted on deck where the tender heard it and he started to lift right away It couldn t have been over a minute before they had him up but he was so near dead the doctors worked three hours on him before he came around That ll give you an idea of how far gone he was The captain told of other desperate chances faced by divers in his experience of a hose and life line fouled in a wreck of an escape valve frozen shut in winter time by the diver s congealed breath of a helmet smashed through by a load of pig iron falling from its sling of a diver dragged off a wreck by a drifting pontoon such a record of thrilling escapes and tragedies as any wrecking master could run over One realized why insurance companies refuse to take risks on divers lives and why the diver s pay is large Before long Atkinson came up again and announced that everything was ready holes stopped and suction length in place Two men helped undress him while the others set the big eight inch pipe to pumping out the wreck and soon it was spurting a thick stream over her side like a fire tower Presently the dinner bell rang from a tiny cabin below and I had the honor of breaking bread with the crew of the Dunderberg and two of the company s stanchest divers Atkinson and Timmans both small thin men with wrinkled faces both the heroes of many adventures Here was indeed a chance to find out things One of my first questions turned upon the effect of diving on a man s hearing Was it true as I had read that divers often have one or both of their ear drums ruptured by the water pressure Both men thought not most divers of their acquaintance had good hearing Diving often kills a man straight out said Timmans but aside from that I don t think it injures his health Ain t that right Bill Atkinson nodded He had observed that divers almost never take cold or have trouble with their lungs although they are constantly exposed to all weathers and often live and sleep in wet clothes for days and nights As a young man he himself had been a bookkeeper in delicate health People thought he had consumption So he gave up bookkeeping and by accident became a diver He had never had a sick day since and he had worn the suit now for twenty nine years About a man s ears said he there s no doubt you get a pressure in em when you go down and the pressure gets harder and harder the deeper you go that is until your ears crack Crack said I Well that s what we call it but I don t suppose anything really cracks After you get down say thirty feet your ears hurt a good deal especially if by chance you have a little cold and you keep opening your mouth and swallering to make the crack come and the first thing you know you hear a sound inside your head like striking a match that s the crack and then you can go on down as far as you please and you won t feel any more pain in your ears until you re coming up again then you get a reverse crack They say it s the air working in and out of your head I don t know what it is but I know some men s ears won t crack and those men can t never make divers How deep can a diver go down I inquired The company smiled at this and turned to Atkinson who smiled back and then referred modestly to one of the deepest dives on record one hundred and fifty feet made by himself some years before up the Hudson He had a pressure of six atmospheres on him at that depth and could stay down only twenty minutes I ll tell you about that some other day said he It s pretty near time now for me to be sweeping up this coal Then answering my look of surprise at the word sweeping he explained how they lessen the weight of a sunken barge by first pumping out the water in her and then pumping out the coal The same suction pipe does both and will discharge thirty five or forty tons of coal an hour on a chute which holds the coal while the water streams through During this operation the diver is down in the barge moving the suction end back and forth up and down the sweeping in question until no more coal is left for its hungry mouth We pump grain out of wrecks in the same way said Atkinson tons and tons of it and they dry it in ovens and sell it A man must look sharp though and not get himself caught We had a diver he was new at the business who got his knee against the suction pipe one day while he was pumping coal and it held him as if he was nailed there He was so scared he tore himself loose but he had to rip a piece out of his suit to do it He stayed down though just the same Illustration DIVER STANDING ON SUNKEN COAL BARGE What with a hole in his suit That doesn t matter as long as it s only in the leg You see the air in the helmet presses down hard enough to keep the water below a man s neck But he mustn t bend over so as to let his helmet get lower than the hole I should say not put in Timmans Why what would happen if he did He d be killed quicker than you can wink The air from the helmet would rush out at the hole and he d be crushed by the weight of the water I don t know whether mister Atkinson realized the full truth of his words but I found on consulting the authorities that a diver s body at thirty two feet is subjected to a pressure of water amounting to forty tons at sixty four feet to eighty tons at ninety six feet to one hundred and twenty tons et cetera And it is only the great counter pressure in the helmet of air from the air pump that enables the diver to endure this otherwise deadly weight It follows that the deeper a diver goes the harder work it is for the air pump men to drive air down to him and at great depths as many as four men are sometimes needed at the pump to conquer the water resistance and keep open the escape valve for air breathed out at the helmet top Here ended this day s talk for the coal would wait no longer Atkinson must go down again to his sweeping But there were other days for me aboard the Dunderberg other glimpses into these brave simple lives Think what these fellows do Here is a huge helpless vessel at the bottom of a bay with the tide tearing her to pieces and down into the depths comes a queer little man as big as one of her anchor points and stands beside her in the mud and feels her over and decides how he will save her and then does it does it all alone And what he does is never the same as anything he has done before for each wreck is a new problem each job of submarine patching has its own difficulties and dangers Oh bored folk idle folk go to the wreckers say I if you want a new sensation watch the big pontoons put forth their strength watch the divers and if you can set the crew of the Dunderberg to telling stories II A VISIT TO THE BURYING GROUND OF WRECKS LITTLE by little one picks up lore of the divers small things yet edifying In summer a diver wears underneath his suit to keep him cool the same flannel shirt and thick woolen socks that he wears in winter to keep him warm But he wears mittens in winter on his hands which are bare in summer On the bitterest day in January he finds comparative warmth in deep water as he finds a chill there in torrid August Summer and winter he perspires very freely and a little work brings him to the limit of his strength the strain being chiefly on the lungs The deeper he goes the more exhausting becomes every effort A diver often endures real suffering like the foot tickling torture because he cannot scratch his nose or face and they tell of one man who worked in great distress because when he got down he found a June bug in his helmet and had to bear the insect s lively promenading over his features powerless to stop it And there was a diver who in bravado used to smoke a cigarette inside his helmet Divers as a class are not superstitious Seldom do their thoughts down below stray into realms of fantasy nor have they time to dream but only to hammer and saw and ply the crowbar and drive iron spikes twenty inches long into huge timbers in short to attend strictly to their work It is amusing to note the scorn of practical divers for the nice electric lighting and telephone contrivances of divers who never dive but sell their inventions to the Government for its Newport diving school which same inventions remain for the most part in their spick span boxes It seems simple enough to have submarine lights yet divers who dive prefer to grope in the almost darkness of our ordinary waters It seems a distinct advantage that diver and tender be able to talk over a wire yet divers who dive keep jealously to the clumsy system of jerks on the lines and will not even be bothered with the Morse alphabet The fact is a diver has quite as much as he can attend to with the burden of his suit about a hundred and seventy five pounds and his two lines to watch and keep from kinks and entanglements Touch one of these lines and you touch his life Fasten a new line to him or two new lines and you enormously increase his peril Imagine yourself stumbling about in a dark forest with a man strapped on your back and several ropes dragging behind you among trees and rocks each separate rope being to you as breath and blood That is precisely the diver s case So he goes so he works And when they offer him pretty apparatus to increase his load he will have none of it Nor will he tug any extra ropes I have ways enough of dying as it is says he Working thus in gloom or darkness the diver develops his senses of feeling and locality He gains certain qualities of blind men and finds guidance in unlooked for ways The ascending bubbles from his helmet for instance shine silver white and may be seen for a couple of fathoms These bubbles have a trick of lodging in a vessel s seams and so give the diver a rough pattern of her Again in searching for leaks the sense of hearing helps him for he can distinguish after long habit the sucking sound of water rushing through the holes One is sorry to learn that divers go to pieces early few of them last beyond fifty As they grow old their keenness wanes they lose their bearings easily down below and show bad judgment And fear of the business grows upon them Often they seek false courage in strong drink which hurries on the end Too many of them after searching all their lives for wrecks wind up as wrecks themselves But it is good to know that there are exceptions divers like Bill Atkinson sturdy and true at fifty and good in the suit for years to come unless their wives persuade them to retire The diver s wife I am told poor woman starts with terror every time she hears a door bell ring I must speak now of the burying ground for wrecks one of the strangest saddest most interesting burying grounds I can think of It was a disaster to the tug boat America that brought me there this ill fated craft having been cut half through in the North River and sunk by a great liner she was helping into dock The America went down forthwith in sixty feet of water sank so suddenly that all aboard her had to cast themselves into the water and fight for it The fireman and the cook not knowing how to swim fought in vain and ended their lives there It is astonishing how many men who follow the sea as a business cannot swim Well in due course the wreckers came up to lift the tug boat and Atkinson who cannot swim either directed the job They swung chains under her fore and aft they jacked her up nearly to the surface and then while four pontoons held her the Pinafore the Catamaran and two others only the working crews know the names of these pontoons they all splashed slowly up the river under tow of the wrecking tug Fly and finally came to the burying ground of wrecks Here they jacked her up some more it was We ve got her Slack away now and R heh eh eh as the men strained at the blocks and then they grounded her on the mud where wrecks have been grounded for years and left her with all the others to rust and ruin and rot Illustration THE MEN AT WORK WITH THE AIR PUMP But before they grounded her there was a long time to wait for high tide time for a good meal on the Catamaran and a talk about hazards of the sea as divers know them It was then that Atkinson told me the promised story of his deepest dive I wish all men who do big things would speak of them as simply as he did It s like this said he in diving the same as in other things every man has his limit but he can t tell what it is until the trial comes At this time I m talking about some ten years ago I thought a hundred feet about as deep as I wanted to go If there are two hundred divers in the country you can bet on it not ten of them can go down over a hundred feet Well along comes this job in the middle of winter a head on collision up the Hudson off Fort Montgomery and a fine tug boat gone to the bottom We came up with pontoons to raise her and Captain Timmans he s the father of Timmans the diver ordered Hansen down to fix a chain under her shaft there s the man now A big Scandinavian in the listening circle looked pleased at this mention He was Hansen We knew by the sounding that she lay in a hundred and fifty feet of water on a shelf of bottom over a deeper place and Hansen was a little anxious He got me to tend him and I remember he asked me when I was putting the suit on him if I thought he could do it Remember that Hansen Hansen nodded I told him I thought I could do the job myself so why shouldn t he but that was partly to encourage him Anyhow Hansen went down and I got a signal All right from him when he struck the bottom Then the line kept very still and pretty soon I jerked it again No answer So I knew something was wrong and began to haul him up quick telling the boys to turn faster He was unconscious when we got him on deck but he soon came round and said he felt like he d been dreaming He ll tell you if that ain t right It s right said Hansen We couldn t work any more that day on account of the tide but Captain Timmans said the thing had to be done the next morning and wanted Hansen to try it again but Hansen wouldn t Wasn t no use of trying again put in Hansen That s it he d passed his limit But it seems I had a longer one Anyhow when the captain called on me I got into the suit and went down and I stayed down until that chain was under the shaft It took me twenty minutes and I don t believe I could have stood it much longer The pressure was terrible and those twenty minutes took more out of me than four hours would say at fifty feet But we got the tug boat up and she s running yet After this Hansen told a story showing what power the suction pipes exert in pumping out a vessel He was working on a wreck off City Island at the entrance to the Sound He had signaled for rags to stuff up a long crack and the tender had tied a bundle of them to the life line and lowered it to him by slacking out the line All this time the pump was working at full pressure throwing out streams from the wreck through four big pipes Suddenly the life line came near the crack and was instantly drawn into it and jammed fast so that Hansen would have been held prisoner by the very rope intended to save him had it not been for the slack paid out which was fortunately long enough to bring him up Had it been his hand or foot that was seized in that sucking clutch the incident would have had a sadder ending Illustration I STAYED DOWN UNTIL THAT CHAIN WAS UNDER THE SHAFT Then came other stories until the day was fading and the tide was right and Atkinson was ready for the grounding of this soaked and battered tug boat Presently he calls Look out for that rope Get yer jacks ready Now slack away And forthwith pulleys are creaking and great chains are grinding down link by link as the men pump at the little jacks and the forty foot timbers that stretch across pontoons and hold the wreck chains groan on their blocks and at last the America comes to rest safely ingloriously on the mud Poor America so proud and saucily tooting only the other day now a bedraggled wreck on these Weehawken flats destined to what fate who knows To be lifted from the mud patched up rebuilt quarreled over by owners and insurance people or perhaps simply left here with the others for wharf rats to swarm in and boys to go crabbing on The burying ground of wrecks What a sight from the rugged height back of the water Here are blackened shapeless hulks from the great river fire of nineteen hundred when red hot liners drifted blazing to these very flats Here is the ferry boat River Bell decked with flags in her day and danced on by gay excursionists now thick with mud and slime her deck beams spongy under foot her wheel frames twisted like a broken spider s web Here are the half sunken halves of some ice barge cut clean in two by a liner Here heaving with the tide is an aged car float with a watchman s shanty on it heaped with its rusted boilers its anchors cranes gear wheels cables pumps a tangle of iron things that were once important Here is a scuttled tug boat that has been in a law suit and the mud for years Here is a coal barge wedged open and sunk by her owner to steal the insurance money Wrecks spread all about us and above them rise the masts and cranes of pontoons and pumping craft that seem in the shadows and desolation like things of evil omen guarding their prey Night is coming on Lights show in the great city across the river Ferry boats pass Lines of barges pass Whistles sound The waves splash splash against the wrecks touching them gently one would say But nobody else cares Nobody comes near Nobody looks The divers go home The wrecking crews eat and turn in to sleep A rat squeals somewhere These helpless crippled hulks are alone in the night and they grind grind against decaying stumps They are wrecks they are dead they are buried and yet they can move a little in the mud III AN AFTERNOON OF STORY TELLING ON THE STEAM PUMP DUNDERBERG WHEN there is difficult diving to be done in the East River or in any river where the tide runs strong you will see the wrecking boats swing idly at anchor for hours waiting for slack water the only time when divers dare go down And often there is half a day s waiting for half an hour s work and often a week goes by on a two hours job say in full midstream where not even the most venturesome beginner will stay down more than twenty minutes at the turn lest he be swept away ponderous suit and all by the rush of the river It s start your patch and leave it to be ripped open by the beating sea it s get your chain fast nine weary times and have it nine times torn away over night by some foolish bumping tug boat in fact it s worry and aggravation until the thing is over Also this is the time of times if you can get aboard to make acquaintance with the wreckers to pick up lore of the diving suit and tales of the divers It was bad weather when we on the sturdy old Dunderberg were busy at a wreck off the Brooklyn shore not far from Grand Street ferry I had as much to do with lifting this wreck as the pewter spoons stuck around the little cabin It wasn t much of a wreck anyhow only a grain boat but it had my gratitude for stubbornly refusing to come up And so we had hours to spend down in the cabin aforesaid which could barely hold cook stove and dining table but managed to be parlor and bedroom besides also laundry on occasions The Dunderberg I should explain was originally a mud scow but for good conduct and an injury to her nose had been changed into a steam pump She could suck her forty tons of coal an hour out of a wreck with the best of them And she traveled with four pontoons no one of which could touch her in table fare especially coffee Late one afternoon when the rain was drizzling and the swinging brass lamps lit we sat about on wooden stools and some were curled up in bunks along the walls and listened to the talk of Atkinson and Timmans and Hansen who had seen and done strange things in their time They were discussing the escape valve in a diver s helmet and arguing whether it pays to stiffen the spring for very deep diving Atkinson who had worked eight fathoms deeper than either of them said he left his spring alone he used the same suit and the same valve action for any depth But I look out for sand banks said he ever since that fellow you know who I mean had one cave in on him in the North River He was tunneling under a vessel with a wall of sand beside him higher than his head and the first thing he knew he was flat on his back with sand jammed in his valve so it couldn t open It wasn t a minute before he was shot up to the surface like a balloon The reason of that he explained for my benefit is because a diving suit with its valve shut gets lighter and lighter as they drive down air from the air pump until all of a sudden it comes up man and all just as a plank would if you held it on the bottom and then let it go Illustration THE MAN WHO ATTENDS TO THE DIVER S SIGNALS Talking about planks coming up said Timmans who was seated under the picture of a prize fighter I was down on the North German Lloyd steamer Main the one that was burned and sunk fixing a suction pipe to pump grain out of her when a big wooden hatch got loose and came up under me I was working between decks and the hatch swung me right up against the overhead beams and held me there squeezing the life line and hose so tight I couldn t signal It s lucky the hose was wire wound or that would have been the last of me But I got my air all right and after a while I worked free Wire wound and all observed Atkinson I ve had my hose squeezed so the air was shut off I was on a wreck off one of the Hoboken docks once when an eight inch suction pipe caught the hose coming down through a hatch and the next second I felt my air stop though I could hear the pump beating I jerked slack away on the life line and that loosed the hose and saved me but I got a blast of compressed air as the jam eased that jumped me up a yard Suppose your life line had been jammed too I asked so that you couldn t jerk slack away Atkinson paused to think There s a difference of opinion about how long a man can live on the air that s in his helmet Some say three or four minutes I don t believe it I think two minutes would do the business There was George Seaman began Timmans Yes said Atkinson taking up the story as was a senior s right there was George Seaman who put trust in the argument of Tom Scott and Low and some of those old timers that a man can cut his hose and press his thumb quick against the hole and live long enough on what air s in the helmet to reach the top Years ago they used to give that talk to us youngsters but I notice none of em ever tried it Well Seaman he did try it he was down on a wreck somewhere along Sixtieth Street and his hose got caught in the timbers The life line was all right and he was getting air enough only when they tried to haul him up he stuck on account of the hose They tried three times to lift him and each time he d come up a few feet and stick and then they d have to let him fall back You can see that s awful discouraging for a man especially when he s tired and cold If Seaman had kept his nerve and waited they d prob bly have sent another diver down to get him untangled but he didn t keep his nerve All he saw was that the hose was caught and he couldn t free it and they couldn t get him up It s a lot easier to get rattled at the bottom of a river than up in the air and Seaman called to mind what he d heard about stopping the hole with your thumb and he got out his knife All divers carry a knife fast to the suit See like this He drew a two edged knife a wicked looking weapon out of its leathern sheath and moved his thumb along the edge Then Seaman he felt for the hose and made ready to cut His idea was you see to slash the hose at one stroke then jerk on the life line to be hauled up quick and keep the hole shut with his thumb while he came up I can picture him now with his knife on the hose sort of praying a minute like a man might with a knife at his throat That s what it amounted to Well he wrote the story of what he did right there on the hose and wrote it plain They ve got the piece at the office and they ll show it to you if you ask em Seaman made his cut with about two men s strength I ll bet not one of you boys could do near as well as he did at cutting a hose through with one stroke His slash came clear through all but a shaving of rubber and he tried to cut that with a second stroke but the knife struck a new place about an inch away and he slashed her half through there Then he tried nine times more and made nine separate cuts at the hose and there they are to day about half an inch apart each one a little shallower than the one before and the last two or three only scratches on the outside That was just as he died and you can figure out how long it prob bly took him to make those eleven knife strokes I suppose there ought to be thirteen but eleven s what there is You ll count em Not only did I count them these eleven tragic cuts but I have the piece of hose to this day The office people gave it to me and never do I look but with a shiver at this dumb record in diminuendo of agony and sacrifice I suppose that settled the question of stopping a hose with your thumb I remarked That s what it did said Atkinson After this there were more stories I can t begin to say how many more Every time a diver goes down one would say something new happens to him something worth telling about Hansen related an experience of his with a conger eel Atkinson told how a Dock Department diver named Fairchild was blown to death under forty feet of water when twenty eight pounds of dynamite he was putting in for blasting went off too soon Timmans told how he fainted away once one hundred and five feet down and another time let the water into his suit by pulling out a helmet lug on a foolish wager And that reminded Atkinson of the time his gasket the rubber joint under the collar was cut through by the slam of an iron ladder and the air went out Hooo and a quick jerk on the life line was all that saved him Last of all they told the story of old Captain Conkling and the Holyoke Dam a story known to every diver It seems there was a leak in this dam and the water was rushing through with so strong a suction that it seemed certain death for a diver to go near enough to stop the leak Yet it was extremely important that the leak be stopped in fact the saving of the dam depended on it So Captain Conkling who was in charge of the job induced one of his divers to go down and reluctantly the man put on his suit but insisted on having an extra rope and a very strong one tied around his waist What s that for asked Conkling That s to help get my body out if the life line breaks said the diver Go on and do your work replied Conkling who had little use for sentiment It happened exactly as the diver feared He was drawn into the suction of the hole and when they tried to pull him up both hose and life line parted and the man was drowned but they managed to rescue his body with the heavy line just as he had planned Then Conkling called for another diver but not a man responded They said they weren t that kind of fools All right said the captain in his businesslike way then I ll go down myself and stop that hole And he called the men to dress him At this time Captain Conkling was seventy five years old and had retired long since from active diving But he was as strong as a horse still and no man had ever questioned his courage In vain they tried to dissuade him I ll stop that hole said he and I don t want any extra rope either He kept his word He went down and he stopped the hole but it was with his dead body and to day somewhere in the Holyoke Dam lie the bones of brave old Captain Conkling incased in full diving dress helmet and hose and life line buried in that mass of masonry No man ever dared go down after his body IV

5101-40462-0001	train-other-500	leaned against the step ladder that reached down from hatch to cabin on the Dunderberg and remarked while the others listened I did a queer job of diving once down into the hold of a steamship a National liner
5101-40462-0002	train-other-500	that lay in her dock blazing with electric lights and dry as a bone Just the same I needed my suit when I got down into her
none	none	 in fact I wouldn t have lasted there very long without air from the pump 
5101-40462-0003	train-other-500	Some queer cargo suggested Atkinson That s it She was loaded with caustic soda or whatever they make bleaching powder of barrels and barrels of it with the heads broke in after a storm
5101-40462-0004	train-other-500	and it wasn t good stuff to breathe I can tell you First they set men shoveling it out with sponges in their mouths against the dust and gases but one man coughed so hard he tore something in his lungs or head and died Then they sent for a diver
5101-40462-0005	train-other-500	that was me and I worked hours down there hoisting and shoveling like I was at the bottom of the bay only there was no water to carry the weight Say but wasn t that suit heavy and when I looked out through my helmet glasses
5101-40462-0006	train-other-500	it seemed as if I was digging through a snow field with such a terrible dazzle it made my eyes ache to look at
none	none	 it I suppose you don t usually see much under water 
5101-40462-0007	train-other-500	said I Depends on what water it is answered Timmans All rivers around New York are black as ink twenty feet down remarked Atkinson I know they are said Timmans but I ve seen different rivers
5101-40462-0008	train-other-500	When I was diving off the Kennebec s mouth five miles southeast of the Seguin light we were getting up the wreck of the Mary Lee then gentlemen
5101-40462-0009	train-other-500	I looked through as beautiful clear water as you could find in a drug store filter Why it reminded me of the West Indies I could see plainly for well
5101-40462-0010	train-other-500	certainly seventy five feet over swaying kelp weed eight feet high with blood red leaves as big as a barrel all dotted over with black spots There were acres and acres of it swarming with rock crabs and lobsters
5101-40462-0011	train-other-500	and all kinds of fish Any sharks said I Hansen and Atkinson smiled for this is a question always put to divers who usually have to admit that they never even saw a shark
5101-40462-0012	train-other-500	Not so Timmans I had an experience with a shark he answered gravely but it wasn t up in Maine It was while we were trying to save a three thousand ton steamer of the Hamburg American Packet Company
5101-40462-0013	train-other-500	wrecked on a bar in the Magdalena River United States of Colombia I d been working for days patching her keel hung on a swinging shelf we d lowered along her side
5101-40462-0014	train-other-500	and every time I went down I saw swarms of red snappers and butterfish under my shelf darting after the refuse I d scrape off her plates and there were big jewfish too and I used to harpoon em for the men to eat
none	none	 In fact I about kept our crew supplied with fresh fish that way 
5101-40462-0015	train-other-500	Well on one particular day I noticed a sudden shadow against the light

5101-40462-0016	train-other-500	not such an enormous one but twelve feet long anyhow big enough to make me uneasy He swam slowly around me and then kept perfectly still
none	none	 looking straight at me with his little wicked eyes I didn t know what minute he might make a rush so I caught up a hammer I was working with it was my only weapon and struck it against the steamer s iron side as hard as I could You know a blow like that sounds louder under water than it does in the air and it frightened the shark so he went off like a flash Perhaps he wasn t hungry laughed one of the crew Not hungry I ll tell you how hungry those sharks were They d swallow big chunks of pork sir nailed and wired to barrel heads as fast as we could chuck em overboard swallow nails wire barrel heads and all and then we d haul em in by ropes that did for fish lines only it took twenty or thirty men to do the hauling And there were plenty of sharks round only they never seemed to tackle a man in the suit Some say it s the fire light of the valve bubbles that scares sharks off commented Atkinson I don t know what it is but I know the bubbles shine something wonderful as you watch em boiling up out of your helmet Phosphorescence I suggested and then went back into the talk for some broken threads How about that steamer you were telling about I asked the one that was wrecked on the bar Did you save her I should say we did replied Timmans and I guess the company wished we hadn t it cost them more money than the job was worth Why if I should start telling how we saved that steamer I don t know when I d get through It took us eight solid months Yes sir and that meant sixty men to feed and pay wages to forty in the wrecking crew and twenty on the tug Oh but we did have trouble trouble all the time but we had fun too especially when some o these gay Bowery lads we d picked up got loose on the mainland Talk about scraps Timmans paused as if for invitations to spin the whole yarn and these he immediately received Tell about painting the alligator urged Hansen Oh that was a bit of foolishness me an another fellow done He was a Dutchman and got me to help him catch an alligator one day He said he could bring him up North and get a big price for him Well we noosed one after a whole lot of chasing in a lagoon and kept him four or five weeks but he wouldn t eat and the boys all gave us the laugh So the Dutchman got up a scheme to paint him white and put him back in the lagoon His idea was that this white alligator would scare out all the other alligators and then we d capture mebbe twenty or thirty on the banks and make our fortune He paused a moment with a twinkling eye and Hansen snickered Well we done it We painted that alligator white and put him back in the lagoon and you can shoot me if those other alligators didn t eat him Yes sir they chewed him clean up before we d hardly got the ropes off him What did the Dutchman say asked Hansen shaking with mirth He stuck to it his idea was all right but it was the blamed alligator s fault for being too weak with fasting to fight the ones as weren t painted and he wanted somebody to help him catch another but nobody would Illustration A DIVER AT WORK ON A STEAMBOAT S PROPELLER Then Timmans came back to the saving of the wreck and it really was an amazing story of patience and ingenuity against endless obstacles I doubt if men from anywhere but America would have carried such a hopeless undertaking through to success First 
5101-40462-0017	train-other-500	they rigged up a wire railway from wreck to shore and slid off a valuable cargo of alpaca silks and beer bit by bit along the wire to land
none	none	 where they conscientiously drank the beer Then they hitched a hawser to the steamer and by clever engineering managed to drag her off the bar against the river current 
5101-40462-0018	train-other-500	but presently this current sweeping down from the mountains grew too swift for the wrecking tug and she in turn was dragged down stream against all the strength of her engines and saw herself threatened with destruction on the bar
none	none	 Then the captain of the tug in his peril 
5101-40462-0019	train-other-500	ordered the hawser cut and thirty nine men of the wrecking crew were left to their fate on the abandoned wreck Their adventures alone would make a thrilling chapter but they were rescued finally from the half sinking steamer
none	none	 after she had somehow crossed the bar and wrecked herself anew in the breakers some miles down the coast 
5101-40462-0020	train-other-500	Then weeks passed while the wrecking crew worked at patching the steamer s holes so that she would float and every day Timmans went down in his suit and did blacksmith work and carpenter work on her torn plates and beams
5101-40462-0021	train-other-500	in constant danger of being crushed in the deep sand trough she rocked and slid in Sometimes the whole iron hull beaten against by the ocean
none	none	 would go grinding along breaking down a wall of sand ten feet high almost as fast as Timmans could walk 
5101-40462-0022	train-other-500	And to be caught between her side and that wall
none	none	 would have ended his days forthwith 
5101-40462-0023	train-other-500	Diving suit and man would have been crushed like an egg shell Finally when she was ready they made fast a sixteen inch hawser and put on full steam to pull her off into deep water
5101-40462-0024	train-other-500	Off she came and all was going well with the towing when a fierce tropical storm came upon them and the steamer turned broadside to its fury and the great hawser snapped like a kite string and back she went on a coral reef
5101-40462-0025	train-other-500	Once more they began at the beginning and in time had another hawser ready and tried again This time the hawser parted by grinding on the beach as they dragged her Then after long delay
none	none	 they got a sixteen inch hawser wound with wire that would resist the friction of rocks and sand and all would have happened as they hoped 
5101-40462-0026	train-other-500	had not a sawfish sent by the evil power that thwarted them thrust its jagged weapon through the hawser strands
none	none	 piercing the wire and severing the big tow line The wrecking company still shows the saw of that mischievous fish among its curiosities So Timmans s narrative ran on endlessly with details of how they stopped some fresh leaks with sixty five barrels of cement and how they quelled a mutiny and how they finally got the steamer off and rigged up a patent rudder that steered her over twenty five hundred miles until they landed her home two hundred and fifty odd days after the expedition started All going to show the kind of stuff American wreckers are made of V IN WHICH THE AUTHOR PUTS ON A DIVING SUIT AND GOES DOWN TO A WRECK ONE day I asked Atkinson as master diver of the wrecking company if he would let me go down in his diving suit and he said yes very promptly with an odd little smile and immediately began telling of people who on various occasions had teased to go down and then had backed out at the critical moment sometimes at the very last just as the face glass was being screwed on It was a bit disconcerting to me for Atkinson seemed to imply that I of course would be different from such people and go down like a veteran whereas I was as yet only thinking of going down There s a wreck on the Hackensack said he it s a coal barge sunk in twenty feet of water We ll be pumping her out to morrow Come down about noon and I ll put the suit on you Then he told me how to find the place and spoke as if the thing were settled I thought it over that evening and decided not to go down It was not worth while to take such a risk it was a foolish idea Then I changed my mind I would go down I must not miss such a chance it would give me a better understanding of this strange business and there was no particular danger in it only a little discomfort Then I wavered again and thought of accidents to divers and tragedies of diving What if something went wrong What if the hose burst or the air valve stuck Or suppose I should injure my hearing in spite of Atkinson s assurance I looked up a book on diving and found that certain persons are warned not to try it full blooded men very pale men men who suffer much from headache men subject to rheumatism men with poor hearts or lungs and others The list seemed to include everybody and certainly included me on at least two counts Nevertheless I kept to my purpose I would go down Illustration THE AUTHOR GOING DOWN IN A DIVER S SUIT It was rising tide the next afternoon an hour before slack water slack water is the diver s harvest time when the crew of the steam pump Dunderberg gathered on deck to witness my descent and assist in dressing me for no diver can dress himself The putting on a diving suit is like squeezing into an enormous pair of rubber boots reaching up to the chin and provided with sleeves that clutch the wrists tightly with clinging bands to keep out the water Thus incased you feel as helpless and oppressed as a tightly stuffed sawdust doll and you stand anxiously while the men put the gasket a rubber joint over your shoulders and make it fast with thumb screws under a heavy copper collar Next you step into a pair of thirty pound iron shoes that are strapped over your rubber feet And now they lead you to an iron ladder that reaches down from rail to water You lift your feet somehow over the side right foot left foot and feel around for the ladder rungs Then you bend forward on the deck face down as a man would lay his neck on the block This is to let the helpers make fast around your waist the belt that is to sink you presently with its hundred pounds of lead Under this belt you feel the life line noose hugging below your arms a stout rope trailing along the deck that will follow you to the bottom and haul you back again safely let us hope Beside it trails the precious black hose that brings you air Now Atkinson himself lifts the copper helmet with its three goggle eyes and prepares to screw it on The men watch your face sharply they have seen novices weaken here Want to leave any address says Captain Taylor cheerfully I admit in my own case that at this moment I felt a very real emotion I watched two lads at the air pump wheels as if they were executioners though both had kind faces and one was sucking placidly at a clay pipe I thought how good it was to stay in the sunshine and not go down under a muddy river in a diving suit Wait a minute I cried out and went over the signals again three slow jerks on the life line to come up and so on Now the helmet settles down over my head and jars against the collar I see a man s hands through the round glasses crisscrossed over with protecting wires he is screwing the helmet down tight Now he holds the face glass before my last little open window Go ahead wid de pump calls a queer voice and forthwith a sweetish warmish breath enters the helmet and I hear the wheeze and groan of the cylinders If you get too much air pull once on the hose somebody calls if you don t get enough pull twice I wonder how I am to know whether I am getting too much or not enough but there is no time to find out I have just a moment for one deep breath from the outside when there is no more outside for me the face glass has shut it off and now grimy fingers are turning this glass in its threads turning it hard and hands are fussing with hose and life line making them fast to lugs on the helmet face one on each side so that the hose drops away under my left arm and the life line under my right Then I feel a sharp tap on my big copper crown which means I must start down That is the signal I pause a moment to see if I can breathe and find I can One step downward and I feel a tug at my trousers as the air feed plumps them out Step by step I enter the water foot by foot the river rises to my waist to my shoulders to my head With a roar in my ears and a flash of silver bubbles I sink beneath the surface I reach the ladder s end loose my hold on it and sink sink through an amber colored region slowly easily and land safely thanks to Atkinson s careful handling on the barge s deck just outside her combings and can reach one heavy foot over the depth of her hold where tons of coal await rescue A jerk comes on the life line and I answer that all is well indeed I am pleasantly disappointed thus far in my sensations It is true there is a pressure in my ears but nothing of consequence no doubt deeper it would have been different and I feel rather a sense of exhilaration from my air supply than any inconvenience At every breath the whole suit heaves and settles with the lift and fall of my lungs I carry my armor easily It seems as if I have no weight at all yet the scales would give me close to four hundred pounds Illustration THE AUTHOR AFTER HIS FIRST DIVE THE FACE PLATE HAS BEEN UNSCREWED FROM THE HELMET The fact is though I did not know it my friends up in the daylight were pumping me down too much air this in their eager desire to give enough and I was in danger of becoming more buoyant than is good for a diver in fact if the clay pipe gentleman had turned his wheel just a shade faster I should have traveled up in a rush four hundred pounds and all I learned afterward that Atkinson had an experience like this one day when a green tender mixed the signals and kept sending down more air every time he got a jerk for less Atkinson was under a vessel s keel patching a hole and he hung on there as long as he could saying things to himself while the suit swelled and swelled Then he let go and came to the surface so fast that he shot three feet out of the water and startled the poor tender into dropping his line and taking to his heels Needless to say that sort of thing is quite the reverse of amusing to a diver who must be raised and lowered slowly say at the speed of a lazy freight elevator to escape bad head pains from changing air pressure I sat down on the deck and took note of things The golden color of the water was due to the sunshine through it and the mud in it a fine effect from a mean cause For two or three feet I could see distinctly enough I noticed how red my hands were from the squeeze of rubber wrist bands I felt the diving suit over and found the legs pressed hard against my body with the weight of water I searched for the hammer and nail they had tied to me and proceeded to drive the latter into the deck I knew that divers use tools under water the hammer the saw the crowbar et cetera almost entirely by sense of feeling and I wanted to see if I could do so The thing proved easier than I had expected I hit the nail on the head nearly every time Nor did the water resistance matter much my nail went home and I was duly pleased I breathed quicker after this slight exertion and recalled Atkinson s words about the great fatigue of work under water I stood up again and shuffled to the edge of the wreck Strange to think that if I stepped off I should fall to the bottom unless the life line held me just as surely as a man might fall to the ground from a housetop I would not rise as a swimmer does And then I felt the diver s utter helplessness he cannot lift himself he cannot speak he cannot save himself except as those lines save him Let them part let one of them choke and he dies instantly And now the steady braying of the air pump beat sounded like cries of distress and the noise in my ears grew like the roar of a train All divers below hear this roaring and it keeps them from any talking one with another when two are down together they communicate by taps and jerks as they do with the tenders above I bent my head back and could see a stream of bubbles large ones rising rising from the escape valve like a ladder of glistening pearls And clinging to my little windows were myriad tiny bubbles that rose slowly The old Hackensack was boiling all about me and I saw how there may well be reason in the belief of some that this ceaseless ebullition from the helmet often accompanied by a phosphorescent light in the bubbles is the diver s safeguard against creatures of the deep Well I had had my experience and all had gone well a delightful experience a thing distinctly worth the doing It was time to feel for the life line and give the three slow pulls Where was the ladder now I was a little uncertain and understood how easily a diver even old timers have this trouble may lose his bearings There one two three And the answer comes straightway down the line one two three That means I must stand ready they are about to lift me Now the rope tightens under my arms and easily slowly I rise rise and the golden water pales to silver the bubbles boil faster and I come to the surface by the ladder s side and grope again for its rungs How heavy I have suddenly become without the river to buoy me This climbing the ladder is the hardest task of all it is like carrying two men on one s back Again I bend over the deck and see hands moving at my windows A twist a tug and off comes the face glass with a suck of air The test is over You done well is the greeting I receive and the divers welcome me almost as one of their craft Henceforth I have friends among these quiet men whose business it is to look danger in the eye and look they do without flinching as they fare over river and sea and under river and sea in search of wrecks THE BALLOONIST I HERE WE VISIT A BALLOON FARM AND TALK WITH THE MAN WHO RUNS IT I NEVER knew a man who has been so many things and been them all fairly well as has Carl Myers of Frankfort New York They call him Professor Myers ever since he took to ballooning years ago but they might call him doctor Myers for he has studied medicine or Wrestler Myers for he is skilled in all tricks of assault and defense Japanese and others or Banker Myers for he spent years in financial dealings or Printer Myers for he still sets up his own type or Telegrapher Myers or Lecturer Myers or Carpenter Myers or Photographer Myers All these callings and some others Myers has pursued with eagerness and success only making a change when driven to it by his thirst for varied knowledge and his guiding principle I refuse to let this world bore me To day the professor is sixty years old a thin wiry sharp eyed little man yet I suspect some boys of sixteen who read these pages feel older than he does You ought to hear him laugh or tell about the air ship that has carried him over thirteen States or describe his balloon farm at Frankfort I don t know when I have enjoyed myself more than during three days Professor Myers spent with me some time ago Illustration BALLOON CLOTH BY HUNDREDS OF YARDS Suppose we begin with the balloon farm which is certainly a queer place It is a joke in the neighborhood that the professor plants his balloon crop in the spring gathers it in the fall and stores it away through the winter Certain it is that in summer time the visitor and visitors come in swarms sees fields marked off in rows with stakes and cross poles on which balloon cloth by hundreds of yards seems to be growing really it is drying and other fields that look like an Eskimo village with houses of crinkly yellowish stuff really half inflated balloons and groups of men boiling varnish in great kettles which are always getting on fire and may explode and other men working nimbly at the knitting of nets and others experimenting with parachutes and the professor paddling away at the height of three thousand feet for his afternoon skycycle sail and Mme Carlotta the celebrated aeronaut also the professor s wife making an ascension now and then from the front lawn in a chosen one of her twenty odd balloons Illustration FIELDS THAT LOOK LIKE AN ESKIMO VILLAGE And in winter should you explore the upper rooms of the house you would find all the balloons tucked away snugly in cocoons as it were fast asleep ranged along the attic floor each under its net each ticketed with a record of its work marked for good or bad conduct after it has been tested by master or mistress For weeks at a time in the experiment season a captive balloon hovers above the Frankfort farm say twelve hundred feet up and the tricks they play with that balloon would draw all the boys in the country if their parents would let them go Three guy ropes hold the balloon steady like legs of an enormous tripod and straight down from the netting a fourth rope hangs free Now imagine swinging on a rope twelve hundred feet long They do that often for tests of flying machines or aeroplanes swing off the housetop and sail away in a long slow curve just clearing the ground and land on top of a windmill at the far side of the grounds That s a swing worth talking about And fancy a man hitched fast to this rope by shoulder straps and as he swings flapping a pair of great wings made of feathers and silk and trying to steer with a ridiculous spreading tail of the same materials The professor had a visit from such a man who had spent years and a fortune in contriving this flying device which alas would never fly Illustration A PAIR OF GREAT WINGS MADE OF FEATHERS AND SILK WHICH ALAS WOULD NEVER FLY Professor Myers like most aeronauts insists that traveling by balloon for one who understands it is no more perilous but rather less so than ordinary travel by rail or trolley or motor carriage He points out that for thirty odd years he and his wife have led a most active aeronaut existence have done all things that are done in balloons besides some new ones and got no harm from it some substantial good rather notably an aerial torpedo operated by electricity from the ground which flies swiftly in any desired direction its silken fans and aluminum propeller under perfect control from a switchboard also the skycycle balloon which lifts the aeronaut in a suspended saddle and allows him by the help of sail propeller and flapping aeroplanes these driven by hands and feet to make a gain on the wind when going with it of ten or twelve miles an hour On this skycycle Professor Myers has paddled hundreds of miles not trying to go against the wind but selecting currents from the many available ones that favor his purpose What is the use says he of fighting the wind when you can make the wind fight for you People who take trains or boats wait for a certain hour or a certain tide in the same way we wait for a certain wind current and there is never long to wait for the wind blows in totally different directions at different altitudes Can you know with precision I asked about these varying currents We can know a good deal by studying the clouds and by observations with kites and other instruments And we would soon know much more if experimenters would work on these lines of conquering nature by yielding to her rather than opposing her In my talks with Professor Myers of which there were many we went first into the spectacular side of ballooning the more obviously interesting part stories of hair breadth escapes and thrilling adventure of the fair lady who assumed marriage vows sailing aloft over Herkimer County of Carlotta s recent trip ninety miles in sixty minutes with natural gas in the bag of the English aeronaut who leaped from his car to death in the sea that a comrade might be saved through the lessened weight of two lovesick Frenchmen who duelled with pistols from rival balloons while all Paris gaped in wonder from the earth and shuddered when one silken bag pierced by a well aimed shot dashed down to death with principal and second And many more of that kind which I must say leave one far from convinced on the non danger point Then the professor dwelt upon various odd things about balloons this for instance that the rapid rise of an air ship makes an aeronaut suffer the same pain and pressure on his ear drums that a diver knows only now the air presses from inside the head outward And relief from this pain is found as the diver finds it by repeatedly opening the mouth and swallowing Illustration PROFESSOR MYERS IN HIS SKYCYCLE And he spoke of the strangest illusions of sight The balloon is always standing still to the person in it while the earth rushes madly along forty sixty ninety miles an hour As you shoot up the first half mile the ground beneath you seems to drop away into a deepening bowl while the horizon sweeps up like a loosened spring Then presently this illusion passes and you see everything flat There are no hills any more nor villages no towers nor steep descents only a level surface marked charmingly in color sometimes in wonderful mosaics and strangely in light and shade At the height of two miles nothing is familiar you might as well be looking at the moon for all you can recognize Roads become yellowish lines rivers brownish lines and the water vanishes a mountain range becomes a shaded strip with less shade on one edge where the sun is than on the other a forest becomes a patch of color a town another patch There is scarcely any difference between water and land and you see to the bottom of a lake so that the configuration of its bed in valley and hill are apparent through the color and the shading This singular disappearance of water bodies for it amounts to almost that has an evident importance I ll tell you what we did on Lake Ontario said the professor as a result of observations I made there from a balloon In sailing over the lake on one occasion I remarked a number of small shaded spots which puzzled me I could not imagine what they were Finally with the help of powerful field glasses I made them out to be wrecks sunk at various depths and I realized that Lake Ontario and indeed all the great lakes abound in vessels which have gone down during centuries and never been recovered No one can estimate the treasure which lies there waiting for some one to reclaim it And I saw that it is a perfectly simple matter to locate these wrecks from a balloon and to prove this I organized a modest wrecking expedition and indicated to the diver where he was to go down Down he went at that point and found the wreck I had seen and we pumped good coal out of her by hundreds of tons What I did then on a small scale might be done on a large scale by any one willing to undertake it Of course I asked the professor why it is that an aeronaut can see down into a lake better than say an observer in a boat and he explained that there is a great gain in intensity of terrestrial illumination when the viewpoint is at a height because the sun s rays converge toward the earth the sun being so many times larger and therefore this is his theory a man lifted above the earth gets many more solar rays reflected to him from a given area than he would get if nearer to that area In a word it is a matter of optics and angles but the professor declares most assuredly a fact Illustration HOW THE EARTH LOOKS WHEN VIEWED FROM A HEIGHT OF ONE MILE Photographed from a balloon Never before these talks did I realize how busy an aeronaut is how much there is to do in a balloon Besides attending to valve cords and ballast there is the barometer to keep your eyes on for by it alone can you know your altitude Around moves the needle slowly as you rise slowly as you fall one point for a thousand feet Rising or falling you know the worst or the best there Sometimes the needle sticks the barometer will not work and you must cast overside pieces of tissue paper to see by their rise or fall if you are going up or down By your senses alone you cannot tell whether you are rising or falling or your distance from the earth That is most deceiving Then you must have your watch ready to reckon your speed so many thousand feet up or down in so many seconds and your map spread out nailed to a board and that lashed fast to tell where you are and your compass out to fix the north and south points for a balloon twists slowly all the time twists one way going up and the other way coming down Nobody knows just why this is unless it be the unequal drawing of the seams as the fabric swells and shrinks I always keep the mouth of my balloon within easy reach said the professor and play with it as an engineer does with his throttle valve Sometimes I even tie it shut when I am sailing but that is dangerous Why dangerous Because the balloon might ascend suddenly and the expanding gas burst it Can you see up into the balloon I asked through the mouth Of course you can and a beautiful sight it is You look up through a round window twenty inches or so in diameter into the great bag swelled out fifty or sixty feet in diameter and perfectly tight so that every line and veining of the net shows plainly through the silk in exquisite tracery and wherever the sun strikes it you see a spread of gold and amber melting away in changing colors to the shaded parts The balloon seems to be perfectly empty perfectly still yet it swings you upward and upward like a live thing You get to feel that your balloon is alive Does it make any noise Usually not Now and then there is a creaking of the basket or a rustle of fabric as you pass from one wind current to another but as you drift along there is perfect stillness I know nothing like the peace of a balloon sweeping in a storm You feel like a disembodied spirit You have no weight no bonds you fly faster than the swiftest express train More than once Carlotta has raced a train going fifty miles an hour and beaten it Is there danger to a balloon in a thunderstorm Apparently not but it is terrifying to be in one You seem to be at the very point where the lightning starts and the thunder crash is born All about you are roarings and blinding flashes and it rains up on you and down on you and in on you from all sides While I never heard of a free balloon being struck by lightning it is a common thing for operators on the ground even in fair weather to get shocks of atmospheric electricity down the anchor ropes of captive balloons Our talk drifted on and the professor told of exciting times reporting the great yacht races from captive balloons with reporters turning seasick in the plunging basket and remarkable phenomena observed from balloons and double colored shadows of balloons called parhelions cast on clouds and wonderful light effects as when a marveling aeronaut looks down upon a sea of silver clouds bathed in sunshine and through black clefts sees a snowstorm raging underneath I was surprised to learn that at very great altitudes say above three miles the voice almost fails to serve or rather the rarefied air loses in great part its power of voice transmission so that in the vast silent spaces of the sky one aeronaut must literally shout to another in the same basket to make himself heard One would say that the great calm heavens resent the chattering intrusion of noisy little men II WHICH TREATS OF EXPERIMENTS IN STEERING BALLOONS IN all their experiments at the farm Professor Myers and Mme Carlotta have worked on individual lines he striving of late years to perfect his skycycle which is simply a balloon of torpedo shape with a rigging of propellers and fans underneath while she has been content to gain skill in steering a balloon of ordinary shape by merely moving her body and utilizing varying air currents for the wind blows in different directions as you ascend It is remarkable how the position of an aeronaut s body may alter a balloon s movements It is possible for instance to make a balloon ascend or descend without touching valve or ballast by a simple change of position Stand with your legs apart straddling from edge to edge of the basket and by throwing your weight first on one foot and then on the other you will give a polliwog movement to the big bag above you and it will go wriggling upward head first some hundreds of feet Or if you would make it descend all this the professor explained to me stand with your feet together in the middle of the basket and catching the balloon neck at both sides stretch your arms wide apart so that the fabric forms a chisel edge then sway your hips forward as far as you can then back as far as you can and keep doing this Now the wriggling process is reversed and this time the basket goes first tail wagging the dog and the balloon descends Illustration MME CARLOTTA STEERING A BALLOON BY TIPPING THE FOOT BOARD This ability to rise or fall at will allows Mme Carlotta to pass easily from one train of clouds to another and by long study of these cross moving aerial trains she is able to pick out the one she wants for a certain destination with almost the precision of a foot passenger selecting his particular street car or changing from one to another And in descending she has learned to steer forward or back to left or right by tipping the basket foot board in the direction she wishes to take The balloon follows the lowest edge of the foot board as a ship follows her rudder An almost incredible instance of the skill attained by Carlotta in these experiments was furnished some dozen years ago at Ottawa where she made an ascension never forgotten by the people of that city It was a grand occasion in honor of Queen Victoria s gift of the Crystal Palace to her loyal subjects and Canada had rarely seen such a gathering Twenty five thousand people as was estimated were packed inside the Exposition grounds to see the aeronaut rise to the clouds And there at the appointed time stood Carlotta on a raised platform with the multitude about her waiting for the balloon She wore a short skirt over a gymnasium suit and made an attractive picture with her fine figure and golden bronze hair So thought various city dignitaries who chatted with her admiringly while the crowd surged about them Meantime Professor Myers was anxiously watching the manoeuvers of some Indians hired by a committee to tow the balloon from gas works two miles distant where it had been filled This was rather against the professor s judgment for the Rideau River flowing by the grounds offered an obstacle that could be overcome only with the help of canoes and tow lines and to paddle a big balloon across a river a fresh filled hard tugging balloon is not a thing to be undertaken lightly And in spite of all their skill these Indians found themselves presently lifted into the air canoes and all oh they were badly frightened Indians not quite clear of the water but high enough to make it doubtful if they would ever reach shore and highly interesting to the crowd which pressed down to the river even into the river in well meant efforts to help and dragged the balloon up the bank and along toward the platform with such eagerness that they tore great rents in it that let out the gas in volumes In an instant as happens in crowds the balloon became the center of a struggling mass of people who slowly pressed in from all sides to see what the matter was Now when twenty five thousand people are all pressing slowly toward one point it is apt to fare ill with those at that point and had not Carlotta acted on a flash of inspiration there would surely have been disaster in that merciless crush She looked over the shouting swaying multitude and in a second saw the danger saw women held helpless and fainting in that jam of bodies saw one way and only one to save the situation and took that way Stepping off the platform she ran lightly and swiftly over heads and shoulders packed solid and came to the balloon Such was the people s fright that they scarcely felt her pass You can t go up cried her husband the balloon is a wreck I must go up she answered if I don t these people will be crushed to death There s a hole in her big enough to drive a team through he protested but already she was in the basket and a great cheer arose Illustration IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR SKILL THESE INDIANS FOUND THEMSELVES PRESENTLY LIFTED INTO THE AIR CANOES AND ALL It s better to risk one life than many she answered with decision and turning to the crowd motioned them to loose the car In their wonder the mad multitude forgot their fear and the struggling quieted All eyes were now on the balloon one woman s courage had quelled the panic The danger to the crowd was past to the woman just beginning Wait a moment shouted Professor Myers you must have more ballast But in the din of voices she misunderstood him and cast out the last bag Then with a great heave and a flapping of its torn sides the balloon wrenched itself free and shot upward a cripple soaring with its last strength Up and up it went higher and higher as the small store of gas expanded That tattered balloon with its seams gaping open raised itself somehow two miles over the city of Ottawa and then almost immediately began to fall The gas stayed in just long enough to lift the broken bag and then left it to dash downward Professor Myers heart sick on the ground turned his eyes away sure that he had seen his wife alive for the last time But Carlotta was of no such mind She had saved the crowd now she would save herself and even as the balloon dropped with frightful speed she put her plan into action Swinging herself up on the netting she caught the flapping silk above a long tear and drew it down with all her weight until it reached the car Instantly the air rushed in underneath and bellied out the fabric into a great umbrella a parachute improvised from a ripped balloon Now they were slowing up they had put the brakes on and now they were soaring easily drifting with the wind Carlotta drew a long breath of relief and looked down They were still a mile above ground She had the runaway in hand but where should she land him Most aeronauts would have been thankful enough to get down alive anywhere she proposed to do a feat of steering as well No doubt there was some gas in the upper part of the bag to help her but in the main she was guiding a parachute and she guided it so skilfully by tipping the foot board forward or back to left or right that she landed finally in a clump of evergreen trees some fifteen miles from Ottawa that she had selected as the very place she proposed to land And great were the rejoicings when it was known that she had come to no harm The story had an interesting sequel the following year when Carlotta made another ascension from the same place Where will you land this time one of the committee asked her Carlotta looked at the clouds a moment then smiling said If you like I will land exactly where I did last year This they all declared impossible for the wind was strong in just the opposite direction but Carlotta insisted she would land in that clump of evergreens and nowhere else And she kept her word She had observed that at a certain height the wind was favorable to her purpose and by the same tactics of seeking the right wind currents and by the same clever foot board tipping she reached the point she was steering for to the general wonder and admiration My acquaintance with Professor Myers has given me some light on a question often in my mind that is what kind of children these men have who follow careers of danger and daring Will the son of a steeple climber climb steeples Will the daughter of a lion tamer be afraid of a mouse And so on Of course with both father and mother aeronauts as in this case it would be strange indeed if their child did not love balloons and so it has turned out for Miss Aerial Myers now a girl in her teens has already made various ascensions and enjoys nothing better than soaring aloft on her father s skycycle which she steers skilfully Her first experience of a voyage in the air is memorable for two facts that it nearly brought destruction to herself and her mother and drew attention to an important but little known fact in ballooning science It was some years ago at the Syracuse County Fair and a balloon race had been advertised between Carlotta and young Tysdell an assistant of Professor Myers For this event an enormous crowd had gathered on the grounds And now by what tears and pleadings who can say Miss Aerial aged eleven had persuaded her too fond mother to take her along and off they went amid cheers and wavings with a strong breeze blowing and the child peering down at the dwindling earth over the basket side She watched the roads change into yellow streaks and the hills swing up from back of the horizon and the clouds spread away below them like a sea She watched her mother take readings of compass and barometer and as the wind swept them along to new view points she would cry out Here comes another town mama and clap her hands as the town raced by Illustration MME CARLOTTA CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER BALLOONIST THREE MILES AWAY Tysdell won the race having ballast in plenty to throw out while Carlotta had little since the extra lifting power of her balloon was needed for Miss Aerial Now the difficulty of managing a balloon is much increased if you have no ballast for then you cannot rise at will to enter a higher wind current blowing the way you want to go but must drift where the current you are in may take you And the current they were in took them such is the perversity of things straight toward a deep and dangerous lake Carlotta saw where they were going but was powerless to prevent it She could not throw Miss Aerial overboard like a sand bag to make the balloon go higher although she did throw overboard everything else that was movable even to her jacket and shoes Then having done all that was possible she waited clutching the basket sides with anxious fingers and wondering if there was any way to safety Suddenly an idea came to her and she scanned the heavens for Tysdell s balloon No sight of it anywhere Tysdell was three miles away hidden by clouds Nevertheless she lifted her voice and sent forth a loud cry calling his name Immediately the answer came quite distinct She explained their peril and asked Tysdell if he could come to them He said he would try and questioned her where they were and what wind currents had borne them Carlotta told Tysdell to what height he must drop she knew her own height by the barometer and in a very few minutes being able to rise and fall as he pleased he was near the two other air sailors and got his balloon down by the lake side in time to help them ashore when they struck as presently they did The basket splashed the water then skipped along the surface under the drag of the balloon and was caught finally in the arms of a tree that reached out from the bank And the only harm done was the spoiling of Miss Aerial s best frock Here was a case of conversation carried on easily between two balloons a mile or so above the earth and three miles apart But other experiments made by Mme Carlotta show that talking between balloons may go on over much greater distances a reach of nearly eight miles having been accomplished on one occasion near Ogdensburg New York The explanation of this phenomenon is perfectly simple Each balloon while it is speaking acts as a huge megaphone for the other and each balloon while it is listening acts as a huge sounding board for the other and the tighter the balloons are kept under pressure of gas the easier it is to make these great silken horns for such they are throw forth and receive the messages It should be noted that this facility for voice transmission does not exist at great heights because of the rarefied air At a mile above earth however this difficulty is not presented and it may be that a superior kind of wireless telegraphy will be introduced some day by the use of talking balloons Why not III 
5620-40466-0000	train-other-500	SOMETHING ABOUT EXPLOSIVE BALLOONS AND THE WONDERS OF HYDROGEN ONE day the professor told me about some rainfall experiments
none	none	 with balloons that he conducted years ago for the government 
5620-40466-0001	train-other-500	There was a theory
none	none	 to be tested that loud explosions at a height will make the clouds pour down water 
5620-40466-0002	train-other-500	and some gentlemen in the Department of Agriculture were anxious to set off as loud an explosion as possible say a thousand feet up in the air Professor Myers received this commission
none	none	 and proceeded at once to Washington with a gas balloon twelve feet in diameter Don t you think that balloon is rather small asked one of the gentlemen 
5620-40466-0003	train-other-500	No said Myers I should call it rather large
none	none	 The other man shook his head I m afraid it won t make noise enough to test our theory 
5620-40466-0004	train-other-500	Well said the professor I can see his eyes twinkling
none	none	 if this balloon doesn t make noise enough we ll get a bigger one 
5620-40466-0005	train-other-500	They took the balloon some miles out of Washington the professor insisted on this
none	none	 filled it with a terribly explosive mixture of oxygen and hydrogen 
5620-40466-0006	train-other-500	and sent it up about a quarter of a mile with an anchor rope holding it and a wire hanging down to a little hand dynamo or blasting machine As they made ready to turn this dynamo Professor Myers lay flat on his back
5620-40466-0007	train-other-500	eyes glued to the balloon confident but curious The handle turned a spark jumped at the other end and the ball of silk
none	none	 seemed to swell enormously and then vanish with a flash of a thousand shivers of silk 
5620-40466-0008	train-other-500	On this came the sound
none	none	 a smashing and tearing blast 
5620-40466-0009	train-other-500	louder than any thunder crash or roar of cannon It flattened men to the ground
5620-40466-0010	train-other-500	killed hundreds of little fish in a stream near by bursting their air bladders knocked over a bowling alley like a house of cards frightened cattle and brought down rain in torrents within eight minutes The Agricultural gentlemen were more than satisfied
5620-40466-0011	train-other-500	and adopted the professor s system for extended rainfall experiments only these for obvious reasons were removed to the lonely and arid plains of distant Texas It wasn t much fun living down there said the professor
5620-40466-0012	train-other-500	but we got rain whenever we wanted it What would happen I inquired if a very large balloon filled with this explosive mixture were set off over a crowded city The professor shook his head
none	none	 in his awed contemplation of this possibility 
5620-40466-0013	train-other-500	It would work fearful destruction If large enough and there is no difficulty in obtaining such a size
none	none	 it would wipe out of existence whole blocks of houses 
5620-40466-0014	train-other-500	and the people in them It would destroy an army In the course of our talks I discovered a mystic side very unexpected in the professor s nature He used to speak of hydrogen for instance
none	none	 with a certain almost reverence as if it were something endowed with life and consciousness a powerful spirit one would say not merely a commonplace product of chemistry a gas from a retort Illustration A BALLOON PICNIC AT THE AERONAUTS HOME I have often wondered he said one day as my basket has swept me along what there is in this silken bag above me that lifts me thus over mountains and cities I look up into the balloon through the open mouth 
5620-40466-0015	train-other-500	and I see nothing I hear nothing I smell nothing None of my senses answer any call yet somehow strangely in a way I can t explain I perceive a presence
5620-40466-0016	train-other-500	It would not be at all the same to me were the balloon filled with air though it would be the same to all my senses Again and again I have noted this thing that hydrogen makes itself known to men when they are near it
none	none	 He paused a moment as if to observe my attitude to see if it were one of scoffing 
5620-40466-0017	train-other-500	I made no remark but begged him to go on
none	none	 After all he continued even the books allow to hydrogen properties 
5620-40466-0018	train-other-500	that are very amazing It is the lightest of all things it passes through and beyond all things
none	none	 it is the nearest approach we know of to absolute 
5620-40466-0019	train-other-500	nothing Who can say that it is not related to the land of nothing to He hesitated You mean
none	none	 said I I 
5620-40466-0020	train-other-500	don t know what I mean I only wonder
none	none	 Take this case that happened at Ogdensburg New York during an ascension we made there We had filled the balloon with hydrogen and were just ready to start when the valve cords that hang down inside the bag from the valve at the top became twisted and drew up out of reach from the basket 
5620-40466-0021	train-other-500	In vain I tried to get them free by poking at them with sticks and long handled things
none	none	 the cords would not come down and of course no sane man would make an ascension with his balloon valve beyond control 
5620-40466-0022	train-other-500	There was nothing for it but to get inside that great gas bag and undo the tangle with my hands So I called fifteen or twenty men
none	none	 to catch hold of the netting and pull the struggling balloon down over me until I could reach the cords Then I Wait a 
5620-40466-0023	train-other-500	minute I interrupted Were you standing inside the balloon so that you had to breathe hydrogen The professor smiled I stood inside the balloon but I breathed nothing
none	none	 I held my breath which is one of the things I have practised Before I went inside I told my wife to note the time by her watch and if I did not come out before one hundred and twenty seconds had passed to have the men drag me out 
5620-40466-0024	train-other-500	You see I knew I could hold my breath one hundred and twenty seconds but no longer Well we carried out the plan and I freed the cords in less than my limit of time
none	none	 then came the uncanny part of it at least it seemed so to me I had read that hydrogen will not transmit sound but had never tested it 
5620-40466-0025	train-other-500	It is true I had at various times taken hydrogen into my lungs but never had I tried to speak in hydrogen Now was my chance
none	none	 and with all my remaining breath 
5620-40466-0026	train-other-500	I shouted as loud as I could inside that balloon Think of it
none	none	 there were my wife 
5620-40466-0027	train-other-500	and the men a few feet distant with only the
none	none	 thinnest tissue of silk between us 
5620-40466-0028	train-other-500	and a gas that was like nothing
none	none	 Yet my cry that would have reached perhaps half a mile in air could not penetrate that little void 
5620-40466-0029	train-other-500	To those outside the balloon it was as if I had not opened my lips They heard nothing not even a whisper
5620-40466-0030	train-other-500	I believe you might fire a cannon inside a bag of hydrogen and no faintest rustle of the discharge would reach your ears So you see a world of hydrogen would be a voiceless world
none	none	 Did you say you have breathed hydrogen I asked 
5620-40466-0031	train-other-500	Yes I have breathed it up to the danger point I know all the sensations There is first a mild exhilaration then a sense of sickening and head throbbing
none	none	 and finally a delicious languor that leads into stupor When you get there it is time to stop 
5620-40466-0032	train-other-500	In making ascensions we have to be very careful not to breathe too much gas from the balloon neck which hangs open over the basket More than one aeronaut has been gradually overcome without realizing that he was in danger
5620-40466-0033	train-other-500	The professor went on to tell of other singular things about this subtle gas notably that speaking within limits the higher you want a balloon to rise the less
none	none	 hydrogen you must put in it 
5620-40466-0034	train-other-500	If you fill a balloon full of hydrogen it will rise to no great height and is very apt to burst since the gas has no space to expand in
none	none	 and the way to keep a balloon rising is to make it expand more 
5620-40466-0035	train-other-500	and more as it goes up each foot of added volume displacing a foot of the air ocean
none	none	 and to that extent adding buoyancy 
5620-40466-0036	train-other-500	General Hazen and I said the professor once planned that some day when we got an appropriation we would go up in a balloon having a capacity of say forty thousand cubic feet
5620-40466-0037	train-other-500	but carrying at the ground only ten thousand cubic feet of hydrogen in other words in a shrunken quarter filled balloon
5620-40466-0038	train-other-500	Of course as we rose and the air became rarefied this hydrogen would expand against the decreasing air pressure and at a height of two miles our original ten thousand feet of gas might have swelled to twenty thousand feet at five miles to thirty thousand feet
none	none	 and so on The last ten thousand feet of expansion would have brought us to no one knows what height 
5620-40466-0039	train-other-500	but certainly we calculated to the greatest height ever reached by a balloonist He explained that the balloon record of seven miles claimed for Glaischer and Coxwell the English aeronauts is not reliable since the barometer used in that famous ascension
none	none	 it was made at Wolverhampton England 
5620-40466-0040	train-other-500	in eighteen sixty two could not register above five miles and what was accomplished beyond that height
none	none	 is matter of pure conjecture and must be less than might be done by the Hazen Myers plan since Glaischer s balloon by a serious oversight was started on its flight nearly full of hydrogen 
5620-40466-0041	train-other-500	instead of nearly empty Oh exclaimed the professor with regretful look
none	none	 why don t some of our very rich men think of these things IV THE STORY OF A BOY WHO RAN AWAY IN A BIG BALLOON ONE of the professor s hobbies is that gas balloons are better and safer than the hot air kind although the latter cost less to operate Your hot air balloon goes up with a rush but comes down again as soon as it cools and in the coming down lies the danger A gas balloon on the other hand stays up as long as you keep gas in it and the professor s secret of varnishing holds gas like a trap As to the ordinary use of hot air balloons for parachute dropping the professor has only condemnation A parachute says he is a sin and a disgrace a thing to be prohibited by law The parachute kills more people every year the professor still is talking than many a battle and kills them in unpleasant ways drops them on live electric wires which shock them to death drops them in lakes where they are drowned or in the ocean where they are eaten by sharks drops them in trees where they catch by their coat collars and choke to death drops them on sharp railings which spear them through drops them but the professor s list backed by statistics be it said is too long and gruesome It is only fair to add that I have a friend Leo Stevens a professional aeronaut who has made thousands of drops from hot air balloons and claims that nothing is safer than a parachute and says he can steer one in its downward sailing so as to avoid dangerous landing places although he does admit numerous hair breadth escapes as when he dropped from a parachute two miles out at sea this at Long Branch in eighteen ninety eight and was only saved by his life preserver and the courage of some fishermen or again when De Ive his partner in ballooning ventures dropped with him on one occasion from a big balloon one parachute was suspended on either side and landed in Lake Canandaigua and was drowned Oh there s no doubt a man takes chances on a parachute said Stevens but I like it There is a singular thing about parachutes Stevens contends not sufficiently considered by Professor Myers in his experiments The professor with his usual thoroughness has tested all shapes and kinds of parachutes by dropping them from a captive balloon with a sand bag hitched on instead of a man The dropping was done by a fuse which would burn the supporting rope and at a given moment set the parachute free just as a man under the parachute would cut it free And in a large number of cases the parachute did not open in time to save the sand bag man from destruction on the ground That proves argues the professor that parachutes are extremely dangerous Nothing of the sort answers Leo Stevens it only proves that there is a big difference between a sand bag man and a real man The sand bag is dead weight and the man is live weight A parachute will open for the one where it won t open for the other Why will it queries the professor if the man and the sand bag weigh the same Illustration STEVENS CAME DOWN ONCE WITH A PARACHUTE TWO MILES OUT IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND WAS PROMPTLY RESCUED I don t know why but it will Stevens insists If what you say were true I d be dead long ago and my wife and all my assistants I well remember my first visit to aeronaut Stevens at his little balloon establishment on Third Avenue a rambling go as you please attic with things strewn about anyhow lengths of balloon cloth hanging from rafters for the varnish to dry crinkly yellow segments of balloons heaped near a sewing machine that was stitching them into spheres rows of hot air balloons from past seasons ranged along on shelves in tight bundles models of flying machines all kinds of parachutes including one in red white and blue made to take up a dog and in various dusty corners photographs of Leo Stevens walking a tight rope Leo Stevens rising to the clouds over waving multitudes Leo Stevens and his big umbrella soaring down to earth from the height of twenty steeples swinging with dancing master grace from the bar of his trapeze I liked this place for the good natured faces of Kid Benjamin who was scooping cold salmon out of a can when I came in and a young lady with long eyelashes who was running the machine Leo Stevens was out said this young lady he was seeing some patent lawyers about his new air ship but she was missus Stevens and could she do anything for me I asked various questions and she answered them from a wide practical knowledge She had made dozens of balloons and parachutes yes and used them too It was Kid Benjamin who offered this latter information remarking that she was grand on a parachute missus Stevens smiled and explained that she had never made an ascension in her life until the previous summer and then only because her husband was in a fix through the failure of another woman to appear A balloon race had been advertised between two lady aeronauts and when the time came one of them Miss Nina Madison was missing Rather than have the thing a failure and a big crowd disappointed missus Stevens agreed to go up She would take Miss Nina s place and race the professional And she did it and she won the race You see she said I didn t feel nervous as another woman might because I d been living with balloons for years Besides they hitched me fast to the parachute ropes so I couldn t have fallen if I d wanted to It was lovely going up everybody said we made a beautiful ascension and the two balloons kept so close together that the other lady and I were talking all the way At last when we were up about three thousand feet she called out that my balloon was settling and for me to cut But I called back Cut yourself and sure enough she did in a minute and I watched her parachute open out and sink and get smaller and smaller until she reached the ground A few minutes later when I saw my balloon had really settled I cut too H o o o what a sensation You know those awful dreams where you fall and fall Well it s just like that for two or three seconds until your parachute fills wide and springs you up against the ropes Then you sail down down with a lovely easy motion until you get close to the ground But look out for the landing Once I struck in a treetop And you re liable to come down on houses or anything You re liable to come down in the middle of a lake put in Kid Benjamin Do you go up said I to the Kid whose hands and face showed black smears from painting balloon cloth He was certainly not over eighteen Do I he answered with a grin I made more n twenty ascensions and drops last summer He s the one said missus Stevens who carried that boy up hanging from the parachute ropes Don t you remember At Coney Island The boy was helping hold the balloon and when she started his foot got caught And he went up hanging by his foot The Kid nodded Yep stuck fast in the rigging by one shoe As I sat on the trapeze bar there was that boy forty feet above me kicking and yelling Say you d never guess what he was yelling about I suppose he was afraid The Kid shook his head No sir he didn t seem to mind the eight hundred feet we d gone up not a bit What worried him was sixty cents in pennies and nickels that had spilled out of his pants pockets while he was upside down Then the Kid explained how he postponed his parachute drop on this occasion and got down safely boy and all by letting the balloon cool off and gradually settle to the ground Isn t a parachute pretty long when it hangs down I asked Certainly It s thirty five feet from where she hitches on t the balloon to where you sit on the bar That s length o ropes and length o cloth both Then how can you cut her loose from way down on the bar I ll tell you put in missus Stevens You just pull a tape that hangs down inside the parachute from a cutaway block at the parachute head The holding rope passes through that block and there s a knife blade in the block over the rope The tape pulls the knife blade down and away you go It s one of my husband s inventions She was plainly very proud of her husband Presently entered Leo Stevens himself a surprisingly young man for such a veteran scarcely over thirty the explanation being that he began ballooning as a mere child Before he was ten he had gained some mastery of slack wire feats and at thirteen he was known over the country as Prince Leo a marvel of the air in black and gold making the fortune of some gentlemen who exploited him His arrival recalled the object of my visit which was to get from him some practical ideas for balloon and parachute experiments on a small scale the sort of thing boys might undertake in their own backyards and on learning this Stevens caught my idea at once He knew just what I wanted and was glad to help me He liked boys himself and we settled down forthwith to a consideration of segments and materials and dimensions and after a little planning and measuring he had the problem solved A hot air balloon is the easiest and cheapest for boys to make said Stevens and it goes up with more of a rush than a gas balloon So we ll tell them how to make a hot air balloon I remember a boys balloon picnic that I got up one summer at Chautauqua Lake while I was making ascensions there What fun those boys did have We sent up a kitten in a strawberry basket strapped fast you know so she couldn t fall out and the basket hung from the parachute by a time fuse that burned loose about a thousand feet up and down came the whole thing parachute kitten and all sailing beautifully and landing as easily as you please It never hurt the kitten at all But the balloon drifted nearly a mile away across a swamp and stuck in a big tree What a time those boys had chasing it and climbing after it and slopping home with it after dark through the swamp with lanterns and torches I suppose they got well spanked a good many of them but boys don t mind How big was this balloon Illustration About eleven feet high inflated that s a good size I mean eleven feet high inflated but the segments must be cut out eighteen feet long to allow for the curve See and he made a sketch of a single segment There must be fourteen segments like this each one eighteen feet long and two feet wide at the widest part then tapering to a point at one end the top and to a width of five inches at the other end the mouth which must be left open These segments are made from ordinary sheets of tissue paper first pasted into long sheets use ordinary starch paste and then cut out after the pattern Then the fourteen segments must be pasted together lengthwise along the edges and they will form a balloon with enough lifting power to take up a parachute and small passenger say a kitten or a puppy We must tell them how to fill this balloon with hot air I suggested That s so said Stevens Well it s very simple They must dig a trench in the yard or somewhere five feet long and one foot deep with a hole dug at one end for a fire Then they must cover over the trench with pieces of tin and spread dirt over that and boards over all this is for a good draught Then they must make a fire in the hole at one end of the trench out of barrel staves or anything that will give a hot flame and toward the last they might throw on a little kerosene That s exactly the way we make our fires for big ascensions At the other end of the trench they must fix a length of stove pipe sticking straight up out of the draught hole into the mouth of the balloon and four or five boys must stand around on fences and boxes to hold the side of the balloon away from the fire which will shoot high above the chimney Many a big hot air balloon has been burned up that way on a windy day and in our ascensions we have dozens of ropes sewn all over the balloon sides we call them wind guys so that men can pull the cloth away from the fire while it s filling Say talking about boys getting spanked I must tell you a story The story was from his own boyish experience how he made his first trip to the clouds at the age of twelve and set a whole city talking This was the city of Cleveland Ohio where on a certain Sunday afternoon there was to be a balloon ascension at the great pleasure park Young Stevens of course was present wild with excitement for balloons had been in his thoughts and dreams ever since he could remember He pressed forward through the crowd and with bulging eyes watched the aeronaut arrange his barrels and pipes for the hydrogen making danced with delight as the great bag swelled and struggled and finally was bitter in disappointment when the police appeared suddenly with orders to prevent the ascension because the day was Sunday Then while the balloonist was protesting and pleading Stevens formed his plan He would go up himself instead of the man There was the balloon all ready held by a single rope There was the basket swinging impatiently empty and he more impatient than the basket Quickly he turned to a boy who was with him Say I ll tell you what You get a knife and cut that rope and I ll go up But the boy demurred Anyhow he had no knife So away dashed Stevens and returned in a jiffy with a knife taken from his father s shop It was a sharp one There panted the boy Now cut her quick soon as I climb in The people about were so occupied with the parley growing warm between balloonist and police that few paid attention when a little shaver in knickerbockers crept close to the basket and then slipped over its side But the next minute nine thousand people paid considerable attention and shouted their surprise and delight as the eager balloon suddenly shot skyward a small white face peering down and trying not to look frightened The knife had done its work and the subject of dispute abruptly removed was presently soaring half a mile above the city drifting with the wind Meantime little Leo curled up at the bottom of the car was saying over to himself a story he had read of two little babies who went up once in a balloon and sailed far far away and never came back but they might have come back if only they had been strong enough to pull a string that hung over them Hello So there was a string to pull Well any boy could pull a string He wasn t a baby But where was the old string He must look about and find it And sure enough he did find it only it turned out to be a stout rope and he tugged at it valiantly until the valve opened and the balloon began to descend just as the story book said it would And so occupied was Leo with keeping this valve open that he never once looked at the wide view spread beneath him nor knew where he was until he came bumping into a treetop and found himself upset among the branches which first tore his clothes to tatters and then dropped him into a muddy canal whence he emerged a sadly battered and bedraggled aeronaut yet happy And even when his mother chastised him that evening with a ram rod his father being a gun maker he remained serene for had he not gone up in a balloon and was not the whole of Cleveland admiring him and would he not go up again he knew he would despite all promises made under ram rod stress as soon as the chance presented And within a year the chance did present a bait of fifty dollars per ascension being offered the lad and the outcome was he ran away from home and saw no more of his family until years had passed and he had grown accustomed to dangers of the air and diamonds of value in his apparel Isn t it queer said Stevens talking it over how a fellow will stay away from his people when everything is all right and get back to them through trouble After I started in to be a balloonist I never saw my mother for seven years Then I came once more to Cleveland to give an exhibition at the very park where I first went up they call it Forest City Park I was to perform on a slack wire nine hundred feet long stretched between two towers one hundred and fifty feet high My wire wasn t long enough to reach all the way so they spliced on a length of three hundred feet more and before I began my feats I walked back and forth over the wire to test it I always do that Then I walked to the middle of the wire and pretended to slip and fall that s a regular trick to startle the crowd You let yourself drop suddenly catch on the wire and spring up again Well this time when I let myself drop I didn t spring up again and I didn t know anything more for nineteen days when I came to myself in the Huron Street Hospital Somehow that splice in the wire had broken and I went straight to the ground breaking one arm both wrists and cracking my spinal column in four places It s a wonder I lived at all they say and during that hard time my mother came to me as mothers do Oh she doesn t love the balloon business I can tell you But I love it I ve made over a thousand ascensions and never been badly hurt but once Illustration We were far away now from our balloon making and I reminded Stevens that we had still to tell the boys how to make a parachute All right said he here you are and he gave me the following directions The parachute is made of fourteen segments of tissue paper each one like this measuring thirty six inches long six inches wide at the base and tapering like the pattern up to a point These segments must be pasted together lengthwise the fourteen points joining at the top of the parachute and in each one of the fourteen side seams a length of eighty inches of No eight thread must be pasted leaving two inches sticking out at the top and about four feet hanging down below The short ends at the top must be tied together and these made fast to a piece of iron hoop pasted in the mouth of the balloon Here the fuse must be placed and lighted just as the balloon is ready to start A five minute fuse will be long enough and it must be so placed that when it has burned its time the parachute will fall from the balloon The long ends below must be tied to a curtain ring from which the little basket hangs with the kitten securely fastened in it by a piece of cloth pierced with four holes for the four legs This can be brought up over the kitten s back and tied to the sides of the basket In this way the kitten is in neither danger nor discomfort The boys must be careful to make this plain to mothers and sisters or their experiments may be stopped by family orders I ll guarantee one thing though if they carry out these instructions carefully your boy friends will have a fine time I certainly hope they will THE PILOT I SOME STIRRING TALES OF THE SEA HEARD AT THE PILOTS CLUB OF all the clubs in New York I know none where a man who values the real things of life may spend a pleasanter hour than at the Pilots Club far down on the lower water front looking out of lofty windows in one of those great structures that make the city seen from the bay a place of wonderful fairy towers Here on the walls are pictures that call up thrilling scenes as this painting of pilot boat No eleven they call her The Phantom rescuing passengers from the Oregon helpless in the great storm of eighteen eighty six sixty miles beyond Sandy Hook We shall find men sitting about these rooms smoking and reading who can tell the story of that night in simple rugged words that will make the water devils dance before us Look at them These are the pilots of New York greatest seaport in the world with its tidy annual total of twenty odd millions in tonnage entered and cleared against fifteen millions for London These are the boys some of them nearing seventy who bring the mighty liners in and take them out who fight through any sea at a vessel s blue light bidding and climb her fortress sides by a slamming whip lash ladder that shames the flying trapeze And this in trim derby hat sometimes a topper with gloves and smart necktie and some New York Heralds tucked away in a coat tail pocket Look at them These are the boys who stay out when every other floating thing comes in who face an Arctic rigor when masts are barrel big with ice and ropes like trees and when climbing to a steamer s deck is like skating up an iceberg These are the boys who know through fog and darkness the call of the whistling buoy that sings at the mouth of Gedney s and can say Good morning to every bobbing juniper spar that marks the long ship lane red lights on starboard buoys as you come in white lights on port buoys who know the way even when the glass and iron lamp frames are all but sunk with ice west northwest and a quarter west for a mile and a half till the beacon lights of Waackaack and Point Comfort line out straight on the Jersey shore then west by south until the Sandy Hook light lines with the old South Beacon then a short way northwest by west and a quarter west until the Conover Beacon lines with Chapel Hill and so on straight to the Narrows These are the boys who know every rock and shoal in this most treacherous bay with its thirteen lighthouses its two light ships and its eighty danger spots marked by nun buoys bell buoys electric light buoys whistling buoys all familiar to them as their own homes Great boys they are for story telling these pilots and by the hour I have listened to their memories of the sea Two things made deep impression on me so do we of less heroic lives take note of weakness in the strong one that many pilots cannot swim the same is true of deep sea divers the other that pilots even after years at sea may be victims of seasickness like any novice Pilot Breed for instance as trusty a man as stands at a liner s wheel assured me that every time he goes out for duty he goes out for torture too And he does his duty and he bears the torture so that after all we must count this rather strength than weakness Illustration THE RESCUE OF THE OREGON S PASSENGERS How can you do your work I asked if you are in such distress Because I have to he answered with a wistful smile You know sailors are often seasick but they go aloft just the same and work because they have to You could do it yourself if you had to And yet he added half shutting his eyes I ve many a time been so bad when we ve tossed and tossed for days and nights on the watch for vessels that I ve come pretty near to dropping quietly overboard and ending it This he said without any special emphasis yet one could see that it was true Why don t you give up the life I suggested Perhaps I would said he if I could do as well at anything else Besides Then came the queerest reason His father it seems a pilot before him had suffered from seasickness for thirty seven years and then for thirty years more had been quite free from it Now said Breed I ve been a pilot for twenty two years so I figure if I stick to it fifteen years more I may be like my father after that and have no more trouble Think of that for a scheme of life Presently another pilot joined us and set forth a remarkable experience I was taking the steamer Lahn once said he through a heavy fog and the captain and I were both on the bridge anxious to locate the light ship You know she lies eight miles off the Hook and gives incoming vessels their first bearings for the channel Of course we didn t expect to see her light you couldn t see anything in such weather but we listened for her fog horn How we did listen And presently we heard it You get accustomed to judging distances over water by the sound and I put that light ship at five miles away or thereabouts and I wasn t far wrong Well we headed straight for it and heard the fog horn all the time for about a mile Then it suddenly stopped Hullo said I What s up Confound those light ship people growled the captain I ll make complaint against them for stopping their horn Wait a little said I and kept listening listening for the horn to blow again and all the time we were running nearer to the shoal Pretty soon we slowed down and went on a couple of miles then another mile It seemed as if we must have reached the light ship and the captain was in a state of mind Then suddenly the fog horn sounded again not four lengths away sir and the queer thing is it had been sounding the whole blamed time we got positive proof of it afterward only we hadn t heard it The explanation was that we had passed through two sound zones that s what the scientific people call em and I can tell you those sound zones make considerable trouble for pilots To this perplexing statement the others nodded grave assent and Breed capped the tale with a sound zone story of his own It was just off quarantine and he was turning a liner to bring her up to dock when another liner came along also running in Breed gave the signal three times for the other liner to port her helm and she signaled back three times for him to port his By good luck each vessel did the right thing and they passed safely but neither pilot heard the whistle of the other and each made angry complaint that the other had failed to whistle yet witnesses testified that both had whistled and each one swore that he had The truth was according to the gentlemen who explain acoustic puzzles that these two steamers happened to be placed there down the bay like two people in a whispering gallery who cannot hear each other where they are but would hear plainly if they moved further apart or drew closer together so as to be in the foci of sound Thus it was that distant vessels heard both sets of whistles although there was a nearer region where these were inaudible Investigation has shown that these sound zones frequently establish themselves at sea they vary in extent with wind and tide so that the sound of horn or bell may be heard for a mile or two and then become inaudible for say two miles and then become audible again almost as plainly as at first for several miles more The theory is that the sound waves somehow go skipping over the sea like a flat pebble over a mill pond in long jumps and that a vessel under the highest part of one of these jumps is out of the sound influence but will come into it again by going ahead a certain distance or going back a certain distance Whether this explanation be the true one or not the facts are abundantly vouched for and are believed to explain various collisions and wrecks that have long been looked upon as mysteries There are lots of queer things about our business reflected an old pilot Now you take steamers they re just as different as people each one has her own ways and most likely her own partic lar kind of crankiness They talk about twin steamers but there s no such thing You can have em both made in the same yard with every measurement alike and they ll be as different sir as as two violins Why I never saw a craft that d sail the same on both tacks they re always harder on one than the other And as for compasses well I don t suppose there s ever two that came into this port with needles pointing just the same way They all lean a shade one way or the other same as watches Lean a shade put in another man I ve known em to lean a whole lot I ve known a steamer s compass to point plumb northeast instead of north And that time we nearly went on the rocks by it We were coming along past Fire Island and the night was pretty thick I felt something was queer and wouldn t go below although the captain wanted me to I kept looking up looking up searching for the north star and pretty soon I made it out or thought I did through a rift in the blackness Hold on said I to the captain something s the matter with your compass There s the north star ahead of us and it ought to be abaft the bridge North star nothing said the captain You re tired man you need a rest Now you just turn in for an hour and I ll run her You ll run her on the rocks said I inside of fifteen minutes unless you pull her out of here I tell you that compass is crazy Well sir he began to get scared when he saw me so positive and a little later he pulled her out just in time too for we were right on the breakers of Long Island thanks to that lying compass I ve heard it s the magnetic sand at Shinnecock that devils compasses You know there s acres and acres of it along there This led to a discussion of magnetic sand and it was edifying to see how well informed these pilots are in the latest advances of science They set forth for example the clear advantage of literally pouring oil upon furious waters and were all agreed that the foam of a spent wave spreading around a life boat will often protect her against a succeeding wave The foam seems to act like oil in preventing a driving wind from tossing up the surface getting a hold on it one might say Taking it altogether I asked do you men regard a pilot s life as very dangerous It was Breed who answered Taking it altogether said he I regard a pilot s life as about the most dangerous going Here s a little thing to show you how fast they go these lives of pilots When I was received as apprentice there were eighteen other apprentices ahead of me and the only way we could get to be pilots was through somebody dropping out for there were never more than just so many licenses issued Well when I had been an apprentice for three years the whole eighteen had been received as pilots and there were seven vacancies besides That makes twenty five dead pilots in three years and most of em killed Why in the blizzard of eighteen eighty eight alone ten of our boats were wrecked At this there was a solemn shaking of heads then stories of the taking off of this or that gallant fellow There was Van Pelt one of the strongest men in the service a pilot from a family of pilots killed by the stroke of a tow line a big hawser that snapped across his body like a knife when the towing bitts pulled out and cut him clean in two Then there was that Norwegian apprentice who was lost when they tried to send a small boat after Denny Reardon on the Massachusetts in the storm of November eighteen ninety seven The Massachusetts was loaded with lions tigers and elephants the whole Barnum Bailey show and Reardon had just got her safely over the bar There was a fierce sea on that night and Reardon waited at the steamer s side waited and peered out at the flare up light while the boys on the New York tried to do the launching trick And in one of the upsets this Norwegian chap was swept astern and churned to death in the screw blades Illustration A PILOT BOAT RIDING OUT A STORM Then there was Harry Devere a Brooklyn pilot who happened to be out in the cyclone of eighteen ninety four miles from land in the little pilot schooner with its jaunty seventeen on the canvas There they were riding out the storm as pilot boats do facing it not running when up loomed a big West Indian fruiter burning a blue light forward which meant she was in sore need of a man at the wheel who knew the dangers in these parts The old ocean was killing mad that night air and water straining in a death struggle and already four pilots had been carried on by liners carried on to Europe because there was no human way of putting them off To start for that vessel now was madness and every man in the pilot crew knew it and so did Devere But he started just the same He said he would try and he did tried through a cyclone that was sweeping a whole heaven of snow down upon the bellowing sea as if to smother its fury Down into this they went three of them and somehow by a miracle of skill got the yawl under the vessel s lea Then smash they were hurled against the iron side and Devere sprang for the rope ladder a poor fluttering thing He caught it held fast and the next moment was torn away by a great wave that cast him back into the waste of waters And so he perished You ought to hear them tell these stories On the whole it seemed clear there is danger enough in this calling for the most extravagant taste And the chief danger is not this boarding of vessels in storms nor yet the dancing out of tempests in cockle shell craft where a steamer would scurry to shelter neither of these but the everlasting peril of being run down That is a danger to break men s nerves for always night and day the pilot boats must lie in the swift track of the liners right in the track else they will pass unseen and it must be known that this is a narrow track a funnel for the ships of all the world which pass ceaselessly ceaselessly converging from all ports diverging to all ports in storm in fog in darkness and there the pilot boats must lie flying their square blue flags by day burning their flare up lights every fifteen minutes by night waiting waiting in just such strained suspense as a man would feel before the rush of a silent locomotive sure to kill him if he does not see it before the rush of many silent locomotives which come while he sleeps while he eats perhaps while he prays And constantly in the pilot records is this laconic entry No eight run over and sunk all hands lost No eleven run over and sunk one man saved the rest lost Pilot boat Columbia cut down by a liner ten men lost No chance for heroic struggle here no death with dramatic setting and columns in the papers but a stupid blundering execution while the men rest helpless on weary bunks lulled by the surging sea run over and sunk II WHICH SHOWS HOW PILOTS ON THE saint LAWRENCE FIGHT THE ICE FLOES NO study of pilot life can be complete without mention of the river pilot who has to face perils in the rapids not a whit less real than those faced by his brother pilot on the sea I got my first glimpse of the river pilot oddly enough in frozen December time when even that great waterway of northern America I mean the saint Lawrence was all but a solid bed of ice not quite however and to that chance I owed a glimpse of Canadian boatmen at the hazard of their winter work which is none the less interesting for being unfamiliar It was fifteen degrees below zero just pleasant Christmas weather in Quebec and the old river of saintly fame was grinding along with its gorge of ice streaming along under a dazzle of sun steaming up little clouds of frozen water vapor low hanging and spreading over it like tumbled fleece in patches of shine and shadow quite a balloon effect I fancied as I came down the cliff In a tug boat office at the river s edge chatting around a stove yet bundled thickly as if no stove were there I found some half dozen sharp glancing men who might have been actors in New York or noblemen in Russia I judge by the fineness of their furs but were pilots here lower river pilots who as one of them assured me are vastly more important than the upper river kind I learned also from one who wore a coat of yellowish gray skins with otter trimmings that they were a belated company who would start shortly for Orleans Island across the ice That was Orleans Island there to the left No it did not seem far but I might find it far enough if I tried to get there 
5620-40469-0000	train-other-500	At this they all laughed Meekly I sat down as was befitting and listened to the talk They conversed in bad French or worse English
none	none	 and were most of them strange to say 
5620-40469-0001	train-other-500	Scotchmen who had never seen Scotland and never would Douglasses and Browns
none	none	 and McGregors who couldn t pronounce their own names 
5620-40469-0002	train-other-500	but could take a liner to the gulf day or night through the reefs of Crane Island past the menacing twin Pilgrims by windings and dangers safe down to sea I asked the man what they were going to Orleans Island for
5620-40469-0003	train-other-500	and he explained that they lived there through the winter months they and other pilots many others It was a pilot colony set out in midstream
none	none	 Yes it was cut off from the land quite cut off they liked it so 
5620-40469-0004	train-other-500	Sometimes they didn t come ashore for weeks it was not exactly fun fighting those ice floes And they all laughed again well not exactly Meantime several jolly little cutters no higher than cradles
5620-40469-0005	train-other-500	had jingled up with more men in furs and one woman Also boxes and bundles Pilots I asked The man nodded And the woman Dees lady pilot s wife She been seek And he went on in a jargon that is charming but
5620-40469-0006	train-other-500	not for imitation to explain that they would lay the sick lady in the bottom of the boat and pile coats over her and around her
none	none	 until it was tolerably sure she couldn t freeze 
5620-40469-0007	train-other-500	From the way he spoke one would fancy they were about to start for the North Pole but I presently understood that this two mile ice journey over the crackling saint Lawrence
none	none	 the crackling comes from the ice crust breaking as the tide drops under it 
5620-40469-0008	train-other-500	is about as hard a test of men s endurance as any Arctic performance They were all gathered now save one whose cutter tarried still
5620-40469-0009	train-other-500	He was a good pilot but overfond of the convivial glass and was no doubt this very moment in some uproarious company forgetful that the start was to be sharp on the hour Well they would give him ten minutes more
none	none	 say fifteen minutes pauvre garcon Then they fell to discussing winter navigation and whether it would ever come on the saint Lawrence as it had on rivers in Russia 
5620-40469-0010	train-other-500	A pilot in coon skins was sure it would come they would put on one of these new fangled ice crunching steamers to keep the main channel open
none	none	 and sacre bleu there you are That would save five months every year But the others shook their heads they didn t believe it and didn t want it anyway 
5620-40469-0011	train-other-500	A pilot sir must have a certain time to smoke his pipe Then one man told what the ice did to a sailing vessel he was taking down the river late one season He hoped never to take another down so late
5620-40469-0012	train-other-500	He had got out of his course one night in the dangerous ways off Crane Island and finally dropped anchor to hold her against the crush of ice
none	none	 But the anchor chain snapped like shoe string under the ice pressure and they were borne along on a glacier field until they struck on a reef just what he had feared Now the ice could neither break the reef nor drive them over it but it ground its way right through the schooner s stern ripping her wide open so that the river poured in and down they went until the yard arms touched the hummocks with pilot and crew left to scramble over the floe as best they could in the darkness and wait for daylight on the frozen rocks At this the others taking up the cue of thrilling happenings told stories of dangers on the river one after another until the tardy pilot who had jingled up meanwhile unnoticed was in his turn forced to wait for them I was just putting off one night began a tall man who spoke better English than the rest just putting off from this very place Thash nothing interrupted the later comer I shaw sh sword fish clashe a wh whale once off Saguenay River an wh whale an sh sword fish then he mumbled to himself and dozed by the stove The tall man went on with his tale which described how on the night in question he was about to board a down coming steamer of the Leyland line he was to take the place of the Montreal pilot when she crashed into a tramp steamer coming up in a head on collision and two sailors sleeping in their bunks were instantly killed He described the panic that ensued and told what they did and wound up with a queer theory which he declared perfectly sound and the others agreed with him that the growth of cities along the river is every year increasing the danger of such night collisions through the dazzle of lights Presently we started for the boats A burly line with caps reaching down and collars reaching up until everything was covered ears forehead chin everything but a peeping place for nose and eyes I can still hear the squeak and crunch of snow under foot and see the glare of it We passed a snow field where the river buoys are left through winter spar buoys gas buoys and bell buoys ranged along now like great red tops numbed by the cold to sleep Illustration RIVER BUOYS ON THE BANK FOR THE WINTER Then they put off in the boats three open boats that are sleds as well with runners on the flat bottoms and ends turned up in an easy slant so that when the broken ice gets too thick for paddling they may be hauled up to slide over it This queer method of transit is practised on the saint Lawrence by those who dare during certain weeks of winter when the river is no longer open nor yet frozen into a solid ice bridge but partly open and partly solid So it was now The first rule of the boats is that every man lay hand to paddle and work There are no passengers here but the sick and they are rarely taken Not that the pilots would mind paddling other men across but the other men would almost certainly freeze if they sat still There is no safety against the blasts that sweep this river when the glass says twenty below but in vigorous ceaseless exertion 
5620-40469-0013	train-other-500	So there they go through the ice choked river
none	none	 swinging their paddles lustily every pilot of them heads nodding under black astrakhan caps 
5620-40469-0014	train-other-500	shoulders heaving off for home
none	none	 Now they strike the first solid place and the men forward climb out carefully and heave up the boat s nose a couple of feet to see if the ice will hold her 
5620-40469-0015	train-other-500	Then all climb out and with dragging and pushing get ahead for a hundred feet or so See now they stop and swing their arms Already the pitiless wind is biting through their furs And think of that poor woman
none	none	 Presently they reach an open spot some dozen yards across and all but one take places in the boat 
5620-40469-0016	train-other-500	the stern man standing behind on the ice to push off and then with nicely judged effort spring aboard as he gives the last impulse that shoots her into the river
none	none	 From the open space they paddle into a jam of grinding ice blocks that hold hard against them but are scarce solid enough to bear the sledges They must work through somehow poling and fending to yonder heaped up ledge where up they go again on a great rough raft of ice that will test their muscles and their skill before they get across and drift them a quarter of a mile or so up stream while they are doing it Up stream did I say 
5620-40469-0017	train-other-500	Yes for there is this odd thing about the saint Lawrence even at Quebec that its current streams up and down up and down as the tide changes For seven hours the river conquers the tide and the water runs down to sea
5620-40469-0018	train-other-500	Then for five hours the tide conquers the river and the water runs up from the sea So now after all their toiling they are actually further from home than when they started
none	none	 They should have set out just before the turn of tide that was their plan but they waited until just after the turn and will pay for the delay and their yarn spinning with an hour more of this ice fighting than they need have had and an hour out there is a long long time Even here on the bank much less than an hour is enough of time The cold grows piercing The day is drawing to a close The sky is dull The river grinds on with its grayish burden On the heights of Levis opposite some lights of early evening break out There also pilots live Indians come from an Indian village down the river where they make the peerless birch canoes All along this grand saint Lawrence live men whose business it is to face unusual perils whose nerve fails them not whether paddling some frail bark through furious rapids or guiding a steamboat down a raging torrent with many lives in their keeping We must see more of these men and watch them at their work We must see the Iroquois pilots at their reservation near Montreal the lads Lord Wolseley took with him up the Nile to brave its cataracts when the English set out in eighteen eighty four to bring relief to Gordon We must see Big John famous now for years as wheelsman of the great excursion boats that shoot the rage of waters at Lachine We must see the raftsmen too and ah but it is cold here let us climb the cliff again and find some shelter III NOW WE WATCH THE MEN WHO SHOOT THE FURIOUS RAPIDS AT LACHINE WOULD you see the most skilful pilots in the world men who know all the tricks with ocean liners and the Indian tricks as well who fight the rush of seventy foot tides in the Bay of Fundy or drive their frail canoes through furious gorges or coolly turn the nose of a thousand ton steamboat into the white jaws of rock split rapids where a yard either way or a second s doubt would mean destruction or hitch long hawsers to a log raft big as a city block the lumber in a single raft may be worth a hundred thousand dollars and swing her down a tumbling waterway hundreds of miles with a peril in every one and land her safe If you would see all this go to the wonderful saint Lawrence which sweeps in wide and troubled reaches from the Great Lakes to the sea Of course I do not mean that any one man can do all these things that would be asking too much but each in his own line half breed or Indian or fur bundled voyageur has such quickness of eye such surety of hand that you will be glad to watch the rafters on their rafts and ask no more of them or the canoeists at their paddles or the big craft pilots at their wheels Let us stand on the long iron bridge that spans the saint Lawrence just above Montreal the very place to study the river as it narrows and runs swifter for its smashing plunge through yonder rapids to the east the dreaded Lachine Rapids whose snarling teeth flash white in the sun Look down into the greenish rush and see how the waters hurl past these good stone piers sharp pointed up stream against the tearing of winter ice Here goes the torrent of Niagara and the inland ocean of Superior and Erie and Ontario all crushed into a funnel of land by this big island at the left that blocks the flow and gorged by the in pour of the Ottawa a few miles back that brings down the floods of southern Canada As fast as a horse can gallop runs the river here and faster and faster it goes as the long slant takes it ten twelve fourteen miles an hour which is something for a river until a dozen islands strewn across the funnel s lower end goad the rapids to their greatest rage Here is where they kill Then suddenly all is quiet and the river spreading to a triple width rests after its madness in Montreal s placid harbor Illustration BIG JOHN STEERING A BOAT THROUGH THE LACHINE RAPIDS Standing here I think of my first experience in shooting these rapids it was on one of the large river boats and I must confess that it gave me no very thrilling sense of danger There were two or three plunges to be sure at the steepest part and a little swaying or lurching but so far as movement goes nothing to disturb one accustomed to the vicissitudes of say ordinary trolley car navigation However when I came to the reason of this fairly smooth descent and saw what it means to stand at the wheel through that treacherous channel I found my wonder growing I thought of the lion tamer whose skill is shown not so much by what happens while he is in the cage as by what does not happen A hundred ways there are of doing the wrong thing with one of these boats and only a single way of doing the right thing For four miles the pilot must race along a squirming twisting plunging thread of water that leaps ahead like a greyhound and changes its crookedness somewhat from day to day with wind and tide In that thread alone is safety elsewhere is ruin and wreck Instantly he must read the message of a boiling eddy or the menace of a beckoning reef and take it this way or that instantly for there are the hungry rocks on either hand He must know things without seeing them must feel the pulse of the rapids as it were so that when a mist clouds his view or the shine of a low hung rainbow dazzles him he may still go right It is a fact that with all the pilots in this pilot land and all the hardy watermen born and brought up on the saint Lawrence there are not ten perhaps not six men in Canada to day French or English or Indian who would dare this peril 
5620-40470-0000	train-other-500	For all other rapids of the route the Gallop Rapids the Split rock Rapids the Cascades and the rest there are pilots in plenty but not for those of Lachine And to use the same simile again
5620-40470-0001	train-other-500	I saw that the shooting of these Lachine Rapids is like the taming of a particularly fierce lion it is a business by itself that few men care to undertake So it came that I sought out one of these few
none	none	 Fred Ouillette pilot and son of a pilot an idol in the company s eyes a hero to the boys of Montreal a figure to be stared at always by anxious passengers as he peers through the window atop the forward deck a man whom people point to as he passes There s the fellow that took us through the rapids That s Ouillette 
5620-40470-0002	train-other-500	This unsought notoriety has made him shy He does not like to talk about his work or tell you how it feels to do this thing
none	none	 A dash of Indian blood is in him with some of the silent stoic Indian nature 
5620-40470-0003	train-other-500	Yet certain facts he vouchsafed when I went to his home that help one to an understanding of the pilot s life He emphasized this for instance as essential in a man who would face that fury of waters he must not be afraid
none	none	 One would say that the rapids feel where the mastery is whether with them or with the pilot and woe to him if pounding heart or wavering hand 
5620-40470-0004	train-other-500	betray him The rapids will have no mercy
none	none	 And there are pilots it appears who know the Lachine Rapids every foot of them and could do Ouillette s work perfectly if Ouillette were standing near yet would fail utterly 
5620-40470-0005	train-other-500	if left alone Every danger they can overcome but the one that lies in themselves They cannot brave their own fear
none	none	 He cited the case of a pilot s son who had worked in the Lachine Rapids for years helping his father and learned the river as well as a man can know it At the old man s death this son announced that he would take his father s place and shoot the rapids as they always had done yet a season passed then a second season 
5620-40470-0006	train-other-500	and always he postponed beginning and with one excuse or another took his boats through the Lachine Canal a safe but tame short cut not likely to draw tourists
none	none	 Not start heem right that fadder said Ouillette Now too late 
5620-40470-0007	train-other-500	Now nevair he can learn heem right Why how should he have started him I asked
none	none	 Same way like my fadder start me 
5620-40470-0008	train-other-500	And then in his jerky Canadian speech he explained how this was
none	none	 Ouillette went back to his own young manhood to the years when he too stood by his father s side and watched him take the big boats down What a picture he drew in his queer rugged phrases I could see the old pilot braced at the six foot wheel with three men in oilskins standing by to help him put her over Fred one of the three 
5620-40470-0009	train-other-500	And it was Hip Bas Hip Bas
none	none	 Up Down Up Down until the increasing roar of the cataract drowned all words and then it was a jerk of shoulders or head this way or that while the men strained at the spokes Never once was the wheel at rest after they entered the rapids but spinning spinning always while the boat shot like a snake through black rocks and churning chasms Illustration FRED OUILLETTE THE YOUNG PILOT They used to take the boats as Ouillette takes them still at Cornwall sixty miles up the river and before coming to Lachine they would shoot the swift Coteau Rapids where many a life has gone then the terrifying Cedar Rapids which seem the most dangerous of all and finally the Split rock Rapids which some say are the most dangerous And each year as the season opened Fred would ask his father to let him take the wheel some day when the river was high and the rocks well covered and the boat lightly laden wishing thus to try the easiest rapids under easiest conditions 
5620-40470-0010	train-other-500	But his father would look at him and say Do you know the river my son Are you sure you know the river And Fred would answer Father I think I do
none	none	 For how could he be sure until he had stood the test 
5620-40470-0011	train-other-500	So it went on from year to year and Ouillette was almost despairing of a chance to show himself worthy of his father s teaching when suddenly the chance came in a way never to be forgotten
none	none	 It was late in the summer and the rapids being low were at their very worst since the rocks were nearer the surface 
5620-40470-0012	train-other-500	Besides that on this particular day they were carrying a heavy load and the wind was southeast blowing hard the very wind to make trouble at the bad places
none	none	 They had shot through all the rapids but the last and were well below the Lachine bridge when the elder Ouillette asked the boy 
5620-40470-0013	train-other-500	My son do you know the river And Fred answered as usual without any thought of what was coming next Father I think I do
none	none	 They were just at the danger point now and all the straining waters were sucking them down to the first plunge 
5620-40470-0014	train-other-500	Then take her through said the old man stepping back there is the wheel My fadder
none	none	 he make terreeble thing for me too much terreeble thing said Ouillette shaking his head at the memory But he took her through somehow half blinded by the swirl of water and the shock 
5620-40470-0015	train-other-500	At the wheel he stood and with a touch of his father s hand now and then to help him he brought the boat down safely
none	none	 There was a kind of Spartan philosophy in the old man s action 
5620-40470-0016	train-other-500	His idea was that could he once make his son face the worst of this business and come out unharmed then never would the boy know fear again for all the rest would be easier than what he had already done
none	none	 And certainly his plan worked well for Fred Ouillette has been fearless in the rapids ever since 
5620-40470-0017	train-other-500	Have you lost any lives I asked reaching out for thrilling stories Nevair said he Ever come near it
none	none	 He looked at me a moment and then said quietly Always sair we come near it Illustration THE INDIAN PILOTS RESCUE PASSENGERS FROM THE STEAMER ON THE ROCKS Then he told of cases where at the last moment he had seen some mad risk in going down and had turned his steamer in the very throat of the torrent and with groaning wheels and straining timbers fought his way back foot by foot to safety Once a fog dropped about them suddenly 
5620-40470-0018	train-other-500	and once the starboard rudder chain broke This last was all but a disaster for they were down so far that the river must surely have conquered the engines had they tried to head up stream
none	none	 Ouillette saw there was only one way to save his boat and the lives she carried 
5620-40470-0019	train-other-500	and putting the wheel hard aport for the port chain held he ran her on the rocks

5620-40470-0021	train-other-500	Think of that Hour after hour with paddles alone these dauntless sons of Iroquois braves fought the rapids triumphed over the rapids and brought to land through the night and the rage of waters
none	none	 every soul on that imperiled vessel Another instance he gave showing the admirable alertness of these Indians as well as their skill with the canoe It was in the summer of nineteen hundred late of an afternoon and so heavy was the August heat that even on the river the passengers were gasping for air Shortly after they entered the cataract several persons saw a large man climb to the top of a water tank on the hurricane deck and seat himself there in one of the folding deck chairs The man s purpose was evidently to seek a cooler spot than he had found below and the boat was running so steadily that no one thought of danger Indeed there would have been no danger had not the gentleman fallen into a comfortable doze just as Ouillette steadied the boat for her first downward leap and then brought her over to starboard with a jerk which jerk so effectually disturbed the large man s slumbers that the first thing he knew he was shot off his rickety chair over the side of the water tank clean over the steamboat s decks down splash into the saint Lawrence at a point where it is not good for any man to be He was right in the main sweep of the river where one may live for twenty minutes if he can keep afloat so long but scarcely longer since twenty minutes will bring him to the last rush of rapids where swimmers do not live Illustration MAN OVERBOARD AN INDIAN CANOE TO THE RESCUE What happened after this I have from an eye witness who rushed back with others at the cry Man overboard and joined in a reckless throwing over of chairs boxes and life preservers that profited little for the man was left far behind by the steamboat which could do nothing and Ouillette could do nothing but whistle a hoarse danger warning and go its way A magnificent swimmer he must have been this rudely awakened tourist for the passengers crowded astern could follow the black speck that was his head bobbing along steadily undisturbed one would say by dangers apparently going up stream as the steamboat gained on him really coming down stream with the full force of the current and yielding to it entirely all strength saved for steering Not a man on the boat believed that the swimmer would come out alive and helpless to save they stood there in sickening fascination watching him sweep down to his death Then suddenly rang out a cry Look There A canoe And out from the shadows and shallows off shore shot a slender prow with a figure in bow and stern The Indians were coming to the rescue They must have started even as the man fell such a thing it is to be an Indian and with a knowledge of the rapids that is theirs alone they had aimed the swift craft in a long slant that would let them overtake the swimmer just here 
5620-40470-0022	train-other-500	at this very place where now they were about to overtake him
none	none	 at this very place where presently they did overtake him and draw him up all but exhausted from as close to the brink of the Great Rapids as ever he will get until he passes over them Then they paddled back IV WHAT CANADIAN PILOTS DID IN THE CATARACTS OF THE NILE AND now suppose we follow these Indians to their reservation at Caughnawaga where the government has given them land and civic rights and encouragement to peaceful ways 
5620-40471-0000	train-other-500	The surest time of year to find the pilots at home is the winter season for then with navigation frozen up they have weeks to spend drifting along in the sleepy village life waiting for the spring

5620-40471-0007	train-other-500	And be sure we shall not have been long in Caughnawaga without hearing of the proud part these Indians took in the British expedition up the Nile in eighteen eighty four to relieve Khartum
none	none	 Treasured in more than one household are these words of Lord Wolseley written to the governor general of Canada I desire to place on record not only my own opinion but that of every officer connected with the management of the boat columns that the services of these voyageurs has been of the greatest possible value 
5620-40471-0008	train-other-500	They have on many occasions shown not only great skill but also great courage in navigating their boats through difficult and dangerous waters How many men did Caughnawaga send on this expedition I inquired
5620-40471-0009	train-other-500	Fifty five men besides Louis Jackson said one of the Indians Oh said I and and who is Louis Jackson The Indian s face showed plain disgust that there should be any one who did not know all about Louis Jackson Louis Jackson was the leader He is our chief man He lives over there
none	none	 It resulted in my calling on mister Jackson a big powerful man fully meriting I should say the high opinion in which he is held If there is any Indian strain in him it must be very slight he would pass rather for an uncommonly energetic Englishman with such a fund of adventure to his credit and so entertaining a way of drawing upon it that one would listen for hours while he talks Jackson made clear to me what important duty was given the Canadian voyageurs in this Nile campaign By their success or failure in taking heavy laden boats up the cataracts Lord Wolseley proposed to decide whether the troops for Gordon s relief should go straight up the Nile or around by the Red Sea and the desert It was the river if they succeeded it was the desert if they failed and twenty thousand soldiers waited at Alexandria in a fever of impatience while Jackson and his band with some hundreds of voyageurs from other provinces let it be seen if their training on the saint Lawrence would serve against river perils in ancient Egypt Lord Wolseley was confident it would for during the Riel rebellion he had found out what stuff was in these men Still he dared not start his army until it was certain those formidable cataracts could be surmounted And that meant a month let the men strain as they might at paddles and hauling lines a month to wait a month for Gordon to wait Illustration THE PILOT BIG JOHN Oh said Jackson gloomily if Lord Wolseley had only trusted us without any trial Why there was nothing sir in that Nile River we hadn t tackled a hundred times as boys right here in the saint Lawrence When you talk of cataracts it sounds big 
5620-40471-0010	train-other-500	but we ve got rapids all around here just plain every day rapids that will make their cataracts look sick Of course we did it
none	none	 did it easy but when we got up to the top of the whole business 
5620-40471-0011	train-other-500	where was our army Back in Alexandria sir And it makes a man sad to know that those boys in Khartum were dying just then
none	none	 it makes a man mighty sad to know that One sees what ground there may be for such lament on turning up the dates of this unhappy Nile expedition and the heart aches at the sight of those dumb figures Think of it the relief party reached Khartum about February one eighteen eighty five too late by less than a week Khartum had fallen Khartum sore stricken lay in fresh smoking ruins And when at last British gunboats firing as they came steamed into view of the tortured city that had hoped for them so long there was no General Gordon within walls to thrill with joy 
5620-40471-0013	train-other-500	General Gordon was dead cut down ruthlessly by the Arabs a few days before
none	none	 killed on January twenty seven with his countrymen so near so short a distance down the river that their camp might almost have been made out with field glasses What a difference here a little more hurrying would have made a very little more hurrying 
5620-40471-0014	train-other-500	It would be interesting indeed if we might hear the whole story of these months spent in fighting a river in battling with cataract after cataract in rowing and steering and sailing and hauling a fleet of boats and supplies for an army up up
5620-40471-0015	train-other-500	up into unknown rapids through a burning desert such a long long way It would be an inspiration could we know in detail what these pilots did and suffered what perils they defied and how some of them perished in short
5620-40471-0016	train-other-500	what problems of the river they went at and how they fared in solving them That would make a book by itself A few things we may know however This for instance that while the maps put down six cataracts in the Nile between Cairo and Khartum
5620-40471-0017	train-other-500	say fifteen hundred miles there are in truth many more than six Between the second and third alone there are more than six and some of them bad
none	none	 Also that the river beyond the third cataract curves away in a great rambling S so that Lord Wolseley planned to send an expedition as he actually did straight on from that point by a short cut across the desert The important thing then 
5620-40471-0018	train-other-500	and the difficult thing was to reach the third cataract and upon this all the skill of the voyageurs was concentrated The first cataract about five hundred miles above Cairo is fairly easy of ascent the second cataract some two hundred and fifty miles farther on
none	none	 is perhaps the most dangerous of all and resembles its rival at Lachine in this that the Nile here strains through myriad foam lashed islands strewn in the channel for a length of seven miles like teeth of a crooked comb A balloonist hovering here would see the river streaming through these islands in countless channels that wind and twist in a maze of silver threads But to lads in the boats these silver threads were so many plunging foes torrents behind torrents sweeping down roaring streets of rock boiling through jagged lanes of rock and up that seven mile way the pilots had to go and keep their craft afloat Illustration HAULING A STEAMER UP THE NILE RAPIDS Jackson described the boats used in this hazardous undertaking There were first the ordinary whale boats about twenty five feet long and five feet high with a crew of ten Dongolese at the oars and two or three sails to catch the helpful northerly winds Overhead was an awning stretched against the scorching sun and around the sides were boxes and bags of provisions and ammunition five or six tons to a boat piled high for shelter against bullets for no one could tell when a band of Arabs lurking at some vantage point might fall to picking off the men At a cataract the crew would go ashore save two a voyageur in the stern to steer and another in the bow to fend off rocks 
5620-40471-0019	train-other-500	or in case of need give one swift severing hatchet stroke on the hauling rope
none	none	 For of course the ascending power came from a line of Dongolese black fellows with backs and muscles to delight a prize fighter who by sheer strength of body would drag the boat cargo and all or sometimes lightened of her cargo by the land carriers up up with grunting and heaving against the down rush of the river And woe to the boat if her hatchet man fails to cut the rope at the very second of danger So long as the craft can live his arm must stay uplifted yet he must cut instantly when it is plain she can live no longer And here one marvels for how can anything be plain in a blinding deafening cataract And how shall the man decide as they rise on a glassy sweep and hang for an instant over some rock gulf beaten into by tons of water whether they can go through it or not Truly this is no place for wavering nerve or halting judgment The man must know and act know and act because he is that kind of a man and even so in hard places above the second cataract two Indians from Caughnawaga Morris and Capitan fine pilots both held back their blades too long or striking as the boat plunged missed the rope and paid for the error with their lives Illustration CUTTING THE LINE A MOMENT OF PERIL And even with hauling line cut in time the pilots have only changed from peril to peril for now they are adrift in the cataract and must shoot down unknown rapids chancing everything swinging into shore as soon as may be with the help of paddle and sail Then is all to be done over again the line made fast 
5620-40471-0020	train-other-500	the black men harnessed on and the risk of a new channel encountered as before Thus days or weeks would pass in getting the whale boats up a single cataract
5620-40471-0021	train-other-500	And sometimes they would face the still more formidable task of dragging a whole steamboat up the rapids with troops aboard and stores to last for weeks Then how the hauling men would swarm at the lines
none	none	 and shout queer African words and strain at the ropes when the order came 
5620-40471-0022	train-other-500	until knees and shoulders scraped the ground
none	none	 This was no problem for untutored minds but took the best wits of Royal Engineers and gentlemen from the schools who knew the ways of hitching tackle to things so as to make pulley blocks work miracles 
5620-40471-0023	train-other-500	At least it seemed a miracle the day they started the big side wheeler Nassif Kheir up the second cataract with five hawsers on her
none	none	 three spreading from her bow and two checking her swing on either quarter and her own steam helping her There stood five hundred Dongolese ready to haul and there was the whole floating population pilots soldiers and camp followers gathered on the banks to wonder and to criticize the job which nobody understood but half a dozen straight little men in white helmets who stood about on rocks and snapped things out in English that were straightway yelled down the lines in vigorous Dongolese It was Trigonometry speaking and the law of component forces and Confound those niggers Tell em to slack away on that starboard hawser Tell em to slack away Illustration OVER THEY WENT THE WHOLE BLACK LINE OF THEM It was respectfully presented to Mathematics esquire that the niggers in question couldn t slack away any more without letting the hawser go or tumbling into the rapids for they were on one of the little islands on the brink of it holding the steamer back while the land lines hauled against them Illustration HOW THE ENGINEERS WERE CARRIED OVER TO THE NILE ISLANDS Then in they go ordered Trigonometry Tell em to get over to that next island Tell em to get over quick And over they went the whole black line of them right through the rapids swimming and struggling in the buffeting surge getting across somehow hawser and all where white men must have perished And the steamboat had gained a hundred feet Then one of the front lines of haulers in turn had to move forward to an island to swim for it with six hundred feet of hawser slapping the river as they dragged it What a picture here as these naked men leaped in fearless each with a flashing bayonet thrust in his thick white turban Mathematics esquire had no notion of trying this sort of thing when he changed islands vastly preferring his pulley blocks and would presently be hauled across on a rope trolley as passengers are swung ashore from wrecks by the life saving men That made a picture too Thus slowly and with infinite pains they worked the patient steamboat length by length island by island torrent by torrent up through the Great Gate Bab el Kebir up to the very head waters of the second cataract and there with victory in their grasp saw the forward hawser snap suddenly with the noise of a gun and the old side wheeler swing out helpless into the main rush of the river swing clean around as the side lines held and then start down Whereupon it was Cut hawsers everybody and drop these pulley blocks and tackle fixings useless now and let her go let her go since there is no stopping her and Heaven help the boys on board Then amid shouts of dismay the big boat Nassif Kheir plunged forward to her destruction while the mathematical gentlemen stared in horror then stared in amazement For look She keeps to the channel She is running true Wonder of wonders she is shooting the rapids shooting the greatest cataract of the Nile where boats of her tonnage never passed before The Nassif Kheir was saved and every man aboard her and every box of stores She was saved by an humble Canadian pilot who had never studied trigonometry but who stepped to the wheel when he saw the peril and steered her down those furious rapids 
5620-40471-0024	train-other-500	as he had steered other boats down other rapids on the old saint Lawrence
none	none	 After that when the expedition found itself in trouble in the upper cataracts say those of Tangoor or Akashe or Ambigole or Dal and when the Royal Engineers had drawn up some neat plan with compasses and squares for doing a certain thing with a boat and had proved by the books that it could be done and agreed that it should be done forthwith then some one would usually say just at the last as by an afterthought I suppose we might as well have in one of those voyageur chaps just to see what he thinks of it And they usually had him in THE BRIDGE BUILDER I IN WHICH WE VISIT A PLACE OF UNUSUAL FEARS AND PERILS AS I went time and again to the great East River Bridge the new one whose huge steel towers were drawing to full height in the last months of the century I found myself under a growing impression that here at last was a business with not only danger in it but fear of danger Divers and steeple climbers I had seen who pronounced their work perfectly safe though I knew better and balloonists of the same mind about perils of the air there were none they declared despite a list of deaths to prove the contrary And so on with others But here on the bridge were men who showed by little things and sometimes admitted that they were afraid of the black ribbed monster And it seemed to me that these were men with the best kind of grit in them for although they were afraid of the bridge they were not afraid of their fear and they stuck to their job week after week month after month facing the same old peril until well I came upon this fear of the bridge the very first time I sought leave to go upon the unfinished structure It was in a little shanty of an office on the Brooklyn side where after some talk I suggested to an assistant engineer bent over his plans that I would like to take a picture or two from the top of the tower That seemed a simple enough thing Think you can keep your head up there said he with a sharp look I told him I had climbed to a steeple top Yes But you were lashed fast then in a swing and had a rope to hold on to Here you ve got to climb up by yourself without anything to hold on to and it s twice as high as the average steeple How high is that I asked Well the saddles are three hundred and forty feet above the river Saddles That s what we call em They re beds of steel on top of the towers for the cables to rest on nice little beds weighing thirty six tons each Oh said I How do you get them up Swing em up with steam derricks and cables Guess you wouldn t care for that job hanging out on one o those booms by your eyelashes Perhaps not I admitted But I d like to watch it He said I must see somebody with more authority and turned to his plans You don t feel in danger yourself do you I persisted when you go up Don t eh he answered Well I nearly got cut in two the other day by a plate washer It fell over a hundred feet and went two inches slam into a piece of timber I was standing on Then he explained what havoc a small piece of iron some stray bolt or hammer can work after a long drop That plate washer said he weighed only two pounds and a half when it began to fall but it weighed as much as you do when it struck and you re a fair size Illustration THE WORK OF THE BRIDGE BUILDERS A TOWER OF THE NEW EAST RIVER BRIDGE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE NARROW ESCAPE OF JACK MCGREGGOR ON THE SWINGING COLUMN SEE PAGE one hundred ninety two Is that based on calculation said I or is it a joke It s based on the laws of gravitation he answered and it s no joke for the man who gets hit Say why don t you go down in the yard and look around a little I told him I would and presently went down into the yard a noisy confusing place where the wind was humming through a forest of scaffolding that held the bare black roadway skeleton a hundred feet overhead It was a long street of iron resting on a long street of wood with timber and steel built up in X s on X s the whole rising in an easy slant to yonder grim tower that loomed heavy and ugly against the sky a huge bow legged H with the upper half stretched to a great length and each leg piled up with more black X s held by two enormous ones between It looked for all the world as if it had come ready made in a box and had been jointed together like children s blocks which is about the truth for this great bridge was finished on paper then in all its parts before ever a beam of it saw the East River As I drew near its feet which could take a row of houses between heel and toe I had the illusion due to bigness and height that the whole tower was rocking toward me under the hurrying clouds and at first I did not see the workmen swarming over it they were so tiny But they were making noise enough these workmen with their striking and hoisting and shouting There was the ring of hammers the chunk chunk of engines the hiss of steam the mellow sound of planks falling on planks and the angry clash of metal Presently far up the sides of the tower I made out painters dangling on scaffolding or crawling out on girders busy with scrapers and brushes And higher still I saw the glow of red hot iron where the riveters were working And at the very top I watched black dots of men swing out over the gulf on the monster derrick booms or haul on the guiding lines And from time to time the signal bell would send its impatient call to the throttle man below six strokes four strokes one stroke telling him what to do with his engine and to do it quick The yardmen seemed to get on in the din by a system of strange yells Here were a score of sturdy fellows doing something with a long steel floor beam They were working in scattered groups some on the ground some on the roadway overhead It was lower pulley blocks and spread out flapping cables and hitch fast the load all without any hurry Suddenly a man at the left would put a hand to his mouth and sing out Hey y y and a man overhead would answer Yeow yeow yeow and then they all would cry Ho hoo ho hoooo and up would go the floor beam twisting as she lifted a nice little load of ten tons and presently clang down on her lofty bed like a peal of high pitched thunder I chanced to be talking with the yard foreman when there came such a sudden clang and then I saw an easy going rather stolid man pass through a singular transformation Like a piece of bent steel he sprang back every muscle in him tense and up came his arms for defense and there in his eyes was the look I came to know that meant terror of the bridge and fear of sudden death To me unfamiliar with the constant danger that clang meant nothing to him it was like a snarl of the grave Better stand back here said he and led me over by the air compressing engine where we were out of range Then he told how a superintendent of construction had been nearly killed not long before by a piece of falling iron just where we were standing And looking up through the criss cross maze with openings everywhere from ground to sky with workmen everywhere handling loose iron I realized that this was a kind of slow fire battle field not so very glorious but deadly enough with shots coming from sky to earth every ten minutes every half hour who can know at what moment the man above him will drop something or at what moment he himself will drop something on the man below A tiered up battle field this where each black X with its hammers and bolts and busy gang is a haphazard battery against all the X s below and a helpless target under all the X s above Why sir said the foreman that tower went into a reg lar panic one day because some fool new man on top upset a keg o bolts Sounded as if the whole business was coming down on us I began to realize what tension these men work under what vital force they waste in vague alarms Illustration THERE WAS PAT FAST ASLEEP LEGS DANGLING HEAD NODDING AS COMFORTABLE AS YOU PLEASE It s queer though continued the foreman how the boys get used to it See those timbers right at the top that come together in a point We call that an A frame it s for the hoisting Well the boys walk those cross timbers all the time say a length of thirty feet and a width of one It s nothing on the ground but up there with the wind blowing well you try it I saw one fellow do a thing that knocked me He stopped half way across a timber not over eight inches wide took out his match box stood on his right foot lifted his left foot and struck a match on his left heel Then he nursed the flame in his hands got his pipe going good and walked on across the timber Wha d ye think of that There he was balanced on one foot sir with an awful death on either side and the wind just whooping all because his pipe went out I wouldn t do it for for Well I wouldn t do it Why didn t he wait to light his pipe until he got across I asked The foreman shook his head I give it up He just happened to think of it then and he done it That s the way they are some of em Why there was another fellow Pat Reagan as good a man as we ve got and he went sound asleep one day last summer it was a nice warm day sitting on the top chord That s a long narrow girder at the very highest point of the end span First thing we knew there was Pat legs dangling head nodding comfortable as you please A few inches either way would have fixed him forever but he stuck there by an Irishman s luck until two of his mates climbed up softly and grabbed him They didn t dare yell for fear he d be startled and fall While we were talking the wind had strengthened and now every line and rope on the structure stood out straight from the sides and swirls of spray from hoisting engines overhead flew across the yard also occasional splinters The foreman hurried a man aloft with orders to lash fast everything There s a hard blow coming up he predicted and it wouldn t do a thing to those big timbers on the tower if we left em around loose People have no idea what force is in the wind Why sir I ve seen it blow a keg of railroad spikes off that tower clean across the yard And one day two planks thirteen feet long and two inches thick went flying over the whole approach works right plumb through the front of a saloon out on the street That made eight hundred feet the wind carried those planks As for coats and overalls why we ve watched lots of em start from the tower top and sail off over Brooklyn city like kites yes sir like kites and nobody ever knew where they landed I don t see how the men keep their footing in such a gale I remarked Well said he we order them down when it blows an out and out gale but they work in most anything short of a gale And it s a wonder how they do it It s not so bad if the wind is steady for then you can lean against it same as a man leans on a bicycle going around a curve but Do you mean I interrupted that they walk narrow girders leaning against the wind against a hard wind Certainly they have to But that s not the worst of it Suppose a man is leaning just enough to balance the wind and suddenly the wind lets up say on a gusty day Then where s your man Or suppose it s winter and the whole bridge is coated with ice so that walking girders is like sliding on glass Then where is he especially when it s blowing tricky blasts Oh it s no dream my friend working on a bridge And I in hearty accord with that opinion betook me back to the office where I read just outside the door this ominous notice All accidents must be reported as soon as possible or claims therefor will be disregarded A workman came up at this moment and with a half smile asked if I knew their motto the motto of the bridge men No said I what is it We never die said he with a grim glance at the notice we don t have to Then pointing overhead Come up and see us I ll introduce you to the boys II THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO NOVICES IN BALANCING ALONG NARROW GIRDERS AND WATCHING THE TRAVELER GANG NOT that day but later on when I had arranged it I accepted this bluff invitation and became acquainted with the boys the ones who never die and took in the fears and wonders of the bridge at closer view My permit was granted on the express understanding that I hold nobody responsible for any harm that might befall I was fortunate in having with me as companion in this climb mister Varian the artist who had faced perils of many sorts but none like these First we clambered pyramid fashion up the pile of granite big as a church that will hold the cable ends they call it the anchorage From the top of this we could look along the iron street that stretched away in a slight up grade toward the tower We were on a level with the roadway of the bridge and far below us spread the housetops of Brooklyn Between our stone precipice and the iron street end yawned a gulf that we drew back from with water in its deepest bottom Here the cables would be buried some day sealed and cemented piled over with masonry to hold for centuries Standing in the lee of a block that kept off the wind we looked across at the bridge and planned how presently we might reach it by skirting the moat walls and drawing ourselves up at yonder corner where the end span rested Somehow seen from here the iron street looked delicate not massive its sides were trellis work its top frames gently slanting and one could fancy the whole thing beautifully grown over with vines a graceful arbor way suspended in mid air And down the length of this came the strangest sounds one would say a company of woodpeckers of some giant sort making riot in an echoing forest Br r r ip ip ip ip br r r r up up up br r r ap ap ap ap ap What was it Now from this side up up up br r r up up and ending abruptly Then straightway from near the top on the other side ap ap ap br r r r ap ap ap Then fainter from half way down the street and then from all points at once a chorus of hammer birds making the bridge resound in call and in answer hammer birds with strokes as swift as the roll of a drum What is it And look Those points of fire that glow forth here and there and vanish as the eye perceives them tiny red lights tiny yellow lights that flash from far down the iron street and are gone that flash from all along the iron street and are gone What are they What strange work is doing here Illustration THE IRON STREET LOOKED DELICATE NOT MASSIVE It was the riveters driving the endless red hot bolts that hold the bridge together driving them with hammers that you work with a trigger and aim like a fireman s hose hammers with rubber pipes dragging behind that feed in compressed air from an engine Long past are the days when bolts were driven by brawny arms and the slow swing of a sledge Now the workman leaning his stomach against an iron club touches a spring and presto the hard kicking pent up air inside drives the darting club head back and forth back and forth quick as a snake strikes br r r r r ip ip ip ip against whatever the steering arms may press it Driving rivets nowadays is something like handling a rapid fire gun And how your body aches from the bruise of that recoil We must get nearer to those fellows said the artist and presently after some mild hazards we were safely over on the span quite as near as was desirable to a gang of riveters dangling twenty feet above us on a swing For presently with a sputter of white sparks a piece of red hot iron struck the girder we were straddling and then went bounding down down Nice hospitable place this remarked the artist as we edged under cover of a wide steel beam Crouching here we watched another gang of riveters on the structure opposite where we had a better view watched the forge man pass along the glowing rivets and the buffer man slip them through ready holes and the hammer man flatten the flaming ends into smooth burnished heads And presently a riveter in black cap and faded blue jersey climbed down from the swing overhead and explained things to us He did this out of sheer good nature I think although he may have been curious to know what two men with derby hats and kodaks were doing up there We watched his descent in wonder and alarm for it involved some lively gymnastics that he entered upon however with complete indifference First he swung across from the scaffolding to a girder the highest rail of the bridge and along this walked as coolly as a boy on a wide fence top only this happened to be a fence one hundred and fifty feet high Then he bent over and caught one of the slanting side supports and down this worked his way as a mountain climber would work down a precipice Presently he stepped off at our level never having taken the pipe from his mouth Illustration WARMING THEIR LUNCHES AT THE BOILER FIRE Illustration A STRANGE WAY TO GO TO MEALS When we asked how he dared go about so carelessly over a reeling abyss he said they all did it they all got used to it or else got killed Why when the whistle blew we d see men swinging and sliding and twisting their way down like a lot of circus performers That s how they came to dinner that s how they got back aloft No sir they couldn t use life lines they moved about too much Besides what good would a life line be to a man if the falls started at him with a ten ton load yes or a twenty ton load That man has got to skip along pretty lively sir or he ll get hurt Did he mean skip along over this web of boards and girders I inquired He certainly did and we d see plenty of it if we stayed up long The artist and I shook our heads as we looked down that skeleton roadway gaping open everywhere between girders and planks in little gulfs ten feet wide five feet wide two feet wide quite wide enough to make the picture of a man skipping over them a very solemn thing Our friend went on to tell us how the riveters often get into tight places say on the tower where there is so little room for the forge man to heat his bolts that he has to throw them up to the hammer man twenty or thirty feet What exclaimed the artist Throw red hot bolts twenty or thirty feet up the tower That s what they do and we ve got boys who are pretty slick at it They ll grab a bolt out of the fire with long handled nippers and give her a swing and a twist and away she goes sizzling through the air straight at the man above and say they don t miss him once in a hundred times and what s more they never touch a truss or girder If they did there d be a piece of red hot iron sailing down on the lads below and that wouldn t be good for their health How does the hammer man catch these red hot bolts I asked In a bucket Catches em every time That s a thing you want to see too There were so many things we wanted to see in this strange region And presently we set forth down the iron street keeping in mind a parting caution of the riveter not to look at our feet but at the way before us and never to look down As we edged ahead cautiously no skipping along for us thanks but pausing often and holding fast to whatever offered support we saw that all the bridge men come over the girders eyes straight ahead in a shuffling flat footed way without much bend in the knees Look there comes one of them in from the end of a long black arm that pushes out like a bowsprit over the gulf He has been hanging out there painting the iron In the pose of his body he is a tight rope walker in the hitch of his legs he is a convict in the blank stare of his face he is a somnambulist Really he is nothing so complicated but an every day bridge man earning a hard living and his wife would be torn with fears could she see him now Presently we came to the busiest scene on the structure down where the covered part ended and the iron roadway reached on bare of framework to the tower Here the traveler was working with a double gang of men raising a skeleton of sides and cross beams that were pushing on pushing on day by day and would finally stretch across the river Once on the traveler s deck we breathed easier for here we were safe from fearsome crevasses safe on a great wide raft of iron and timber set on double railroad tracks a lumbering steam giant that goes resounding along when the need is with its weight of four locomotives its three story derricks swinging out great booms at the corners its thumping niggerhead engines two of them for the hoisting its coal bins its water tanks its coils of rope its pile of lumber and its mascot kitten curled up there by the ash box in a workman s coat They say the bridge has to wait when that kitten wants her dinner and woe to the man who would treat the little thing unkindly This traveler with its gangs is a sort of gigantic sewing machine that stitches the bridge together it lifts all the parts into place and binds them fast as it were with basting threads of temporary iron to hold until the riveters arrive for the permanent sewing Five or six tons is the weight of ordinary pieces handled by the traveler but some pieces weigh twenty tons and on a pinch forty tons could be managed the weight of six elephants like Jumbo Of course when I say that the traveler stitches these pieces together I really mean that the traveler gangs do this for the big brute booms can only lift things and swing things the bolt driving and end fitting must be done by little men Illustration ITS MASCOT KITTEN CURLED UP THERE BY THE ASH BOX When we arrived the traveler was bringing to one spot the massive parts of a cross section in our arbor way It was a stretched out iron W flattened down between girders across top and bottom This we learned was a strut and it weighed sixteen tons and it would presently be lifted bodily overhead to span the roadway We waited a full hour to see this thing done to watch another stitch taken in the bridge and it seems to me as I think of it that I can recall no hour when I saw so many perils faced with such indifference First the booms would drop down their clanking jaws and grip the chain bound girders from little delivery cars then swing them around to the lifting place at the farther end of the traveler Now we understood what our friend down the way meant by skipping along lively when the falls come at you He meant this boom tackle and its load as they sweep over the structure in blind merciless force And indeed they did skip along the bridge men as the traveler turned its arms this way and that and several times I saw a man slip as he hurried and barely save himself A single misstep might mean the crush of a ten ton mass or a plunge into space or both It seemed a pretty shivery choice One of our boys got hit this morning said a man Hit by the falls Yes he tried to dodge but his foot caught somehow and he got it hard right here He touched his thigh It flattened him out just over there where that man s making fast the load Was he badly hurt Pretty bad I guess He couldn t get up and we lowered him in a coal box with a runner that s a single line You see it s very easy to take a wrong step Illustration RIDING UP ON AN EIGHTEEN TON COLUMN Presently somebody yelled something and this man moved away to his task but we were joined almost immediately by another bridge man who told us how they ride the big steel columns from the ground clear to the cap of the tower Two men usually ride on a column their duty being to keep her from bumping against the structure as she lifts and then bolt her fast when she reaches the top Of course as a tower grows in height these rides become more and more terrifying so that some of the men who are equal to anything else draw back from riding up a column These fears were justified just at the last on the New York tower and a man named Jack McGreggor had an experience that might well have blanched his hair They had reached the three hundred twenty five foot level and were placing the last lengths of column but one and McGreggor was riding up one of these lengths alone It was a huge mass twenty five feet long square in section and large enough to admit a winding ladder inside It weighed eighteen tons As the overhead boom lifted the pendent length with McGreggor astride and swung it clear of the column it was to rest on the foreman watching there like a hawk wiggled his thumb to the signal man on a platform below who pulled four strokes on the bell which meant boom up to the engine man So up came the boom and in came the column hanging now in true perpendicular with McGreggor ready to slide down from his straddling seat for the bolting Now the foreman flapped his hand palm down and the signal man was just about to jerk two bells which means lower your load when rip smash tear Far down below a terrible thing had happened the frame of the engine had snapped right over the bearing and out pulled the cable drum that was holding the strain of that eighteen ton column and down came the falls It was just like an elevator breaking loose at the top of its shaft The column started to fall there was nothing to stop it and then and then a miracle was worked it must have been a miracle it is so extraordinary That falling column struck squarely end to end on the solid column beneath it rocked a little righted itself and stayed there Which was more than Jack McGreggor did for he came sliding down so fast he came with a wild white face that he all but knocked the foreman over and the foreman was white himself And what that eighteen ton column would have done to the bridge and the boys on it had it crashed down those three hundred and twenty five feet is still a subject of awed discussion All this time a dozen men have been swarming over the strut hammering bolts tightening nuts hitching fast the falls making sure that all parts are rigid and everything ready for the lifting At the front of the traveler two foremen pushers they are called yell without ceasing Hey Gus Hey Hey Jimmie Put that winch in Slack away them falls What the mischief are you doing Hey Hey And they shake their hands and dance on their toes for all the world like a pair of mad auctioneers The men work faster under this vigorous coaching Four or five are stretched flat on their stomachs along the top girder as many more cling to steep slanting braces and some hang fast to the uprights with legs twisted around them like Japanese pole climbers No matter what his position every man plies a tool of some sort wrench chisel or sledge and presently all is ready Now the niggerheads start with a pounding and sputtering that make the bridge quiver The big spools haul fast on the ropes the falls stiffen the booms creak and with shouts from every one the strut heaves and lifts and hangs suspended The pushers yell at the niggerheads to stop The men swarm over the load studying every joint then wave that all is well and come sliding twisting down just as the engines start again all but two men who sit at the ends and ride along with the hoist Meantime the others are racing up the side frames from slant to slant to the top of the truss where they wait eagerly yelling the while at the points on either side where presently the strut ends must be adjusted and then bolted fast It seems like some mad school boy game of romps Now we ll all swing over this precipice Whoop la Now we ll all run across this gulf Wow wow wow Every man in that scrambling crew is facing two deaths or three deaths and doing hard work besides Look There comes the strut up to its place and nearly crushes Jimmie Dunn with its sharp edge as a strut did crush another lad not so long ago And see that man hang out in a noose of a rope hang out over nothing and drive in bolts And see this fellow kick off on the free pulley block and come sliding down Hoooo And there are the others jumping at the falls after him and coming down with a rush laughing Risking their lives One would say they never thought of it Why that s nothing said one of them we used to slide down the falls from the top of the tower But you ve got to know the trick or the ropes ll burn through your trousers It s a great slide though Aren t you ever afraid of falling I asked a serious faced young man who was running one of the niggerheads Illustration ON THE TRAVELER HOISTING A STRUT I ll tell you how it is said he we re not afraid when a lot of us do a thing together but each one might be afraid to do it alone In our hearts I guess we re all afraid Ever have an accident yourself No he said but He hesitated and then explained that he had been standing near the day Chick Chandler fell from the Brooklyn tower It hadn t been a nice thing to see and Finally I got the story Chandler it seems was the first man killed on the bridge and he died for a jest He was working that day on the one hundred and ten foot level he was an experienced man and counted sure of foot It had begun to sprinkle and the men were looking about for their rain coats when Chandler in a spirit of mischief started across a girder for an oil skin that belonged to a comrade And so interested was he in this little prank that he forgot prudence perhaps forgot where he was and the next second he was falling and presently there was the shock of impact far below and then a red No one was branded on the ugly black bridge III WHICH TELLS OF MEN WHO HAVE FALLEN FROM GREAT HEIGHTS THERE is this to note about falls from bridges that the very short ones often kill as surely as the long ones They told me of one case where a man fell eight feet and broke his neck while other men have fallen from great heights and escaped A workman of the Berlin Bridge Company for instance fell from a structure in New Hampshire one hundred and twenty feet and lived And I myself saw Harry Fleager on the East River Bridge New York and from his own lips heard his remarkable experience Fleager is to day a sturdy active young man and when I saw him he was running a thumping niggerhead engine on the end span Nevertheless it was only a few months since he had fallen ninety seven feet smash down to a pile of bricks It happened this way said he One of the big booms broke under its load just over where I was standing and the tackle block swung around and caught me back of the head That knocked me off the false work and I went straight down to the ground Just to show you the force of my fall sir I struck a timber about thirty feet before I landed it was eight inches wide and four inches thick and I snapped it off without hardly slowing up After that I lay for a week in the hospital with bruises but there wasn t a bone broken and I ve been at work ever since Several times while I was seeking permission to go up on the structure I was treated to stories like this and to mild dissuasion It was too dangerous a thing they said for a man to undertake lightly And I did not succeed until I met the engineer in charge Charles E Bedell a forceful quiet mannered man who after some talk granted my request He did not dwell so much on the danger as the others had although he did say Of course you take all the risks Do you think they are very great I asked Not if you use ordinary caution and are not afraid Fear was the fatal thing he said and he told me of men who simply cannot endure such heights Every day or two some new hand would start down the ladders almost before he had reached the top and come into the office saying he couldn t stand the job But you go ahead said mister Bedell you ll come through all right Just take it easy and be careful Then he handed me a permit Illustration Handwritten South Kent saint Kent Ave Permit mister Moffett to visit the work at any time until further notice Charles E Bedell We have seen how I fared on the bridge let me show now what befell this brilliant young engineer a couple of months later and observe how his own case illustrates the paralyzing effect of fear upon a man For months he had gone over the structure daily as sure of himself at those giddy heights as on the ground He never took chances and he never felt afraid But one day a workman fell from far above him and was crushed to death right before his eyes and this was more of a shock to him than he realized How much of a shock it had been was shown weeks later when the hour of peril came It was a pleasant day in September and the bridge was singing its busy song in the morning sunshine The engineer in charge had made his round of inspection and was standing idly on the false work under the end span He was just over the street and could look down upon his own office a hundred feet or so below Every timber and girder here was familiar to him Rumbling along on the trestle track came the big traveler its four booms groaning under their iron loads The traveler came on slowly as befits a huge thing weighing one hundred and fifty tons The engineer was whittling a stick The traveler came nearer with one of its booms swinging toward Bedell but lazily He had plenty of time to step aside One step to the right one step to the left one step forward was all he need take Of course he would not think of taking a step backward for there was destruction there yawned the gulf It was inconceivable to the man on the traveler that his chief who knew all about everything would take a step backward Still the engineer in charge did not move The boom swung nearer Still he whittled at his stick His thoughts were far away The man on the traveler shouted and Bedell looked up Now he saw and the sudden fear he had never known surged in his heart He had still time to step aside but his mind could not act The boom was on him Up went his right arm to clutch it and back reeled his body His right hand missed his left hand caught the stringer as he fell caught its sharp edge and held there by the fingers the left hand fingers for five six seven seconds or so legs swinging in the void Down sprang the man on the traveler and leaped along the ties to his relief and reached the spot to find the fingers gone to see far below on the stones a broken huddled heap that lay still So died the man who had been kind to me as they say he was kind to every one and who had warned me to take it easy and be careful Despite the constant peril of their days the nights of bridge builders are often spent in gaiety The habit of excitement holds them even in their leisure and many a sturdy riveter has danced away the small hours and been on his swing at the tower top betimes the next morning They are whole souled frank spoken young fellows there are few old bridge men and to spend an evening at their club on West Thirty second Street is a thing worth doing On the street floor is a cafe not to say saloon where the walls are hung with churches and bridges and towering structures monuments to the skill of the builders who have passed this way And if you will join a group at one of these tables and speak them fair you may hear enough tales of the lads who work aloft for many a writing And up and down the stairs move lines of bridge men all restless one would say and some pass on crutches and some with arms in slings there is a story in every cripple and you hear that New York has half a dozen one legged bridge men still fairly active in service It s once a bridge man always a bridge man for the life has its fascination like the circus As I sat in a corner one evening with Zimmer and Jimmie Dunn and some of the others there came down from overhead a racket that almost drowned our buzz of talk and the frequent ting of the bar register The bridge men were in vigorous debate over the question whether or not the interests of the craft call for more flooring on dangerous structures Some said yes some no and said it with vehemence More flooring meant less danger That was all right but less danger meant more competition and less pay So there you are and the majority favored danger with a generous wage What kind of men make bridge men I inquired All kinds said one of the group who was drinking birch beer Some come out of machine shops some out of locomotive works I was a shanty jack Lots of em come from farms added another I know one fellow tried it who d been a tailor Said he changed for his health This struck the company as highly amusing There s lots of em try it and quit remarked Jimmie Dunn who is one of the oldest and also one of the youngest men in the guild I had seen him nearly killed a few days before by the sudden up swing of a sixteen ton strut I knew a telegraph pole climber who said he didn t mind any old kind of a tower he d go up it all right and work there Well he got all he wanted the first morning Came down white as that paper Said he wouldn t stay up half an hour longer if they d give him the whole blamed bridge Why it gets us fellows dizzy once in a while I ll bet it does agreed the shanty jack man I saw an old hand once start to ride up a barrel of water one hundred and seventy feet on a bridge over the saint Lawrence The barrel was swung on a single runner and you ought to have seen it spin with his weight tipping it lopsided Ain t any bridge man going could have kept his head there Twas a fool thing to do and the only way this fellow got up alive was by dropping plumb into the barrel of water and shutting his eyes Talking about close calls spoke up Zimmer I can beat that It was out in Illinois We were riveting on a high building where the roof came up in a steep slant from each side to a ridge at the top There were about twenty of us on this roof and the way we d work was in pairs one man on one side and his partner on the other side with a rope between em reaching over the ridge and the two men hung at the two ends each one balancing the other like two buckets down a well We had to get up some scheme like that or we couldn t have stuck on the roof it was too steep Well that was all right as long as both men kept their weight on the rope but you can see where one would be if the other happened to let go He d be chasing down a nice little hill of corrugated iron on a sixty degree slant and then over the eaves for a hundred and ten foot drop It wasn t any merry jest you d better believe but we didn t think much about it and riveted away until one morning a fellow on my side got his foot out of the noose somehow and began to slide down Say he was about as cool a man as I ever heard of I ll never forget how he sort of winked at me as he started and what he said Going to blazes I reckon said he Those were his very words And down he went couldn t stop himself and we couldn t help him it all happened so quick He got to the eaves his feet went over he was just plunging into space when his overalls caught on a rivet that somebody had left sticking up there And there he stuck Then he said with just the same comical look Saved by a miracle by thunder Illustration WALKING A GIRDER TWO HUNDRED FEET IN AIR Must have been a double miracle for the man on the other side started to drop too when the rope slacked and he d have been killed sure if a knot in the rope hadn t happened to catch under a piece of loose iron on the ridge Say it s that kind of business whitens out a man s hair It s a bridge man s fate settles these things friends commented another member of the group And he instanced a case where this fate had followed in cruel pursuit of two brothers named Johnson Michael and Dan good men both on the girders Dan it seems had been crushed by a swinging load on a West Virginia bridge and lay crippled in the hospital only the wreck of a man whereupon Michael zealous in his brother s cause had followed the work over into Kentucky where a bridge was building across the river at Covington His purpose was to bring suit against the company for the injury done to Dan And here came the fateful part of it for scarcely had Michael set foot upon the structure he had certainly not been ten minutes upon it when the false work gave way and two iron spans unsupported now tipped slowly then smashed down into the river carrying with them ruin and death In this catastrophe were numbered some dozens of wounded and killed and among the latter was Michael Johnson found under the river standing upright in a tangle of wreckage caught and held by the bridge man s fate Then another man told the story of a falling bridge that thrilled me more than this one although there was in it no loss of life I always feel that a man who faces death unflinchingly for a fairly long time shows greater heroism even though death be driven back than another man who suffers some sudden taking off with no choice left him This bridge was building at White River Junction Vermont over the upper waters of the Connecticut There was a single iron span reaching two hundred feet between piers of masonry and everything was ready to swing her off the false work except the driving of a few iron pins And a bridge swung is a bridge practically finished so it was merely a matter of hours to put the contractors at ease of mind against any dangers of the torrent Meantime the dangers were there for heavy rains had fallen and angered the river with a gorge of mountain streams At five o clock of an afternoon the engineer in charge saw that a crisis was approaching The waters were sweeping down runaway logs in fiercer and fiercer bombardment and it was a question if the false work could hold against them And for the time being until morning surely the false work must carry the span If the false work went the span would go and the bridge would be destroyed So the chief engineer ordered all hands down on scows and rafts which were straightway jammed close against the false work by the current Down on these lurching platforms went seventeen bridge men and set to work with iron shod pike poles spearing the plunging logs as they came by and swinging them out through the bents of false work down roaring lanes of water twenty feet wide between the legs of scaffolding If these could be protected from the logs the bridge might be saved if they could not be protected the bridge was doomed It was the strength and skill of the pike pole lads against the fury of the river For nine hours the battle lasted and all this time the bridge men worked wonders down in the black night with rain beating on them in torrents and the logs coming faster and harder as the hours passed Every man in the crew realized that the false work might give way at any moment for the whole structure was groaning and shivering as they swung against it and they knew that if it went at all it would go as one piece without a moment s warning And that would mean sudden death in the river under the crush of a broken bridge Yet no man shirked his duty and long after midnight they were there on the scows still fighting the logs with bridge men s grit and the comfort of steaming hot coffee well we may call it coffee But it was a hopeless fight now the engineer saw this and at two o clock ordered all hands off the scows and back to the shore There is a point beyond which you cannot allow men to go on offering their lives And scarcely five minutes later indeed the last man was barely off the structure so our friend declared and he was one of the seventeen the false work ripped loose and was swept away and the iron span crashed down into the furious flood After this Zimmer described his sensations in a fall of one hundred and thirty five feet from the eighth story of a skyscraper they were putting up out West He was sitting on an upright column of the steel skeleton waiting to pin fast a cross beam when a girder swung over from the other side and struck him It weighed a matter of six tons Down went Zimmer and as he dropped he caught at a granite block resting loose there and toppled it over with him And the thought in his mind as he fell was that here was an interesting illustration of what he had learned at school about a heavy body falling faster than a light one for although he had a start of eight feet on the granite block it passed him one story down and smashed ahead through a staging that might have saved him Then as the stone sheered off he estimated did Zimmer falling still that its weight was about fifteen hundred pounds Then he himself smashed through two stagings and caught at a rope which burned through his gloves and the next thing he knew was days later at the hospital where somebody was bending over him saying Will you please tell me about your sensations coming down And there was a newspaper reporter trying to interview me said Zimmer which is what you might call rushing things Tell ye a fall that stirred us boys all right said another man It was in the big shaft at Niagara Falls You know where they send electricity all over the State The shaft was a hundred and eighty feet deep and they used to lower us down in a boat swung from an iron cable Well one day the drum slipped and let the whole business fall free with five of us in the boat We went clear down one hundred and seventy feet and the boat fell away under us just like that granite block of Zimmer s and there we were hanging fast to the corner chains and every man of us expecting to die But somehow the engineer got his brakes on just as we were ten feet above bottom and blamed if we didn t land fairly easy without a man hurt Just the same we d looked over our lives pretty well in those few seconds After this came tragic memories from other men One recalled the terrible wreck of the Cornwall bridge over the saint Lawrence Another the disaster at Louisville when two great iron spans reaching a thousand feet went down into the Ohio with false work traveler and sixty five men of whom only four escaped And one of the four sir was on the traveler two hundred feet above the water when she went down Never had a scratch So the talk ran on and I came away with mingled feelings of wonder and admiration and sadness Here are men who leave their families every morning with full knowledge that before nightfall disaster may smite them as they have seen it smite their comrades Why one asks do they keep to such a career And if they believe as apparently they do that bridge men are fated to violent death why do they not leave this work and seek a safer calling I suppose the same reason holds them to the bridge that holds the diver to his suit the climber to his steeple each one of us to his particular path it is so hard to find another And then there is the lash of pressing need the home to keep and no time for experiment Yet there are the hard facts always that no insurance company will take a risk upon these lives that bridge contractors are not philanthropists nor issuers of pensions and that if a man fall from the structure say at eleven point fifty A M his pay stops short not at twelve o clock but at ten minutes before twelve Which is probably excellent business although it seems poor humanity THE FIREMAN I WHEREIN WE SEE A SLEEPING VILLAGE SWEPT BY A RIVER OF FIRE AND THE BURNING OF A FAMOUS HOTEL I WILL first tell a story fresh in my memory about a New Jersey village lost in the hills back of Lake Hopatcong a charming sleepy little village that reaches along a stream fringed with butterball trees and looks contentedly out of its valley up the steep wooded hill that rises before it Nobody in Glen Gardner cares much what there is in the world beyond that hill The general attitude of Glen Gardner toward progress is shown well enough by this that the village could never see the use of a fire department They never had one and never proposed to other people s houses might get on fire theirs never did As a matter of fact nobody could remember when there had been a fire in Glen Gardner unless it was Aunt Ann Fritts who was eighty eight years old and remembered back farther than was necessary Illustration BURNING OIL TANKS This was the case on a certain drizzling Sunday in March of the new century year when at six point thirty A M the world beyond the hill intruded itself upon Glen Gardner s peacefulness in such strange and sudden fashion that old missus Bergstresser collapsed from the shock What made it worse was the fact that there had been a dance the night before at Farmer Apgar s and half past six found most of the village dozing comfortably There was really nothing to do before church time So they all thought at least little suspecting that even now as they slept a long oil train was puffing up the steep grade from Easton bringing sixty cars loaded with crude petroleum and trouble On came the oil train its front engine panting as the drivers slipped and the pusher back of the caboose shouldering up the load with snorts of impatience Ouf The front of the train climbs over the ridge at Hampton Junction half a mile back of Glen Gardner where the Jersey Central tracks reach their highest point Now they are all right There is a long down grade ahead for three miles The pusher gives a final shove at the rear end and cuts loose glad to be rid of the job The men in the caboose wave good by to the fireman and engineer as they drop away Hello What s that jerk They look out and see the last oil car just clearing the divide It s nothing they re over now they re running faster Queer place this There s a spring here with two streams that part in the middle like a woman s hair one goes down the east side the other down the west side What Broken in two The caboose crew start to run forward a brakeman on the front half starts to run back Thirty seven cars behind the engine a coupling has snapped and the train is taking the down grade in two sections twenty three loaded oil cars are running away and a million gallons of oil are chasing two million gallons down a mountain side Everything now depends upon the brakeman on the forward section He is the only man who can judge the danger and signal the engineer what to do The engineer does not even know that anything is wrong It is plainly the brakeman s business to keep the front half of the train out of the way of the rear half They must go faster faster as the runaway cars gain on them Any one can see that it is undesirable to have two million gallons of oil struck by a million gallons coming at forty miles an hour Yet the brakeman does the wrong thing no man can be sure how he will act in imminent peril the brakeman signals the engineer to stop Perhaps he planned a gradual slow up to block the flying section gently perhaps he did not realize how fast the runaway was coming Most likely he lost his head entirely as better men have done in less serious crises At any rate the front section presently drew up with grinding brakes on the ledge of track that stretches along the cheek of the mountain just over the slope where the slumbering village lay not five feet from Carling s warehouse beyond which were the coal yards and the wooden houses of Glen Gardner the post office the hardware store and the main street Of all places for that train to stop this was the worst Illustration SNYDER WHITE AS A GHOST RACED AHEAD OF THE FIRE It was a matter of seconds now until the crash came and on this followed a shattering blast that shook the valley and hill and brought the village to its feet in a daze of fear Four oil cars were smashed in the wreck and hurled across the tracks for the rear cars to pile up on And straightway there was a gushing oil well here out of which in the first ten seconds came an explosion with the noise of cannon that showered burning oil over fields and trees and shingled housetops while a fire column shot up fifty feet in the air and began its fierce feeding on the broken tanks And out of this fire fountain came a smoking fire river that rolled down the hill toward the village At this moment Joe Snyder who had not gone to the dance the night before and was doomed now to the early worm s fate had just put his key in the door of the butcher shop He never turned the key nor saw it again nor saw the butcher shop again What he did see was a roaring torrent of oil sweeping down the street and blazing fifteen feet high as it came And the picture next presented when Snyder white as a ghost raced down the sidewalk ahead of the fire will stay long in the memory of those who saw it from their windows But this was no time for looking at pictures out of windows there were other things to be done and done quickly Never did fire descend so swiftly upon a village Even as the startled sleepers stared in fright houses all about them burst into flames like candles on a Christmas tree Now the warehouse is burning and the sheds across the tracks and there goes the hardware store and there goes the carpenter s shop and now the fire stream rolls through Main Street and licks up the Reeves house on one corner and Vliet s store on the other Then the drug store goes and Carling s store and Rinehart s restaurant Trees are burning fences are burning the very streets are burning and men see fire rolling across their front yards like drifting snow Illustration THE VERY STREETS ARE BURNING I do not purpose to follow the incidents of this fire and the several explosions nor show how the village fought against it vainly damming up fiery oil streams and turning their courses toiling at bucket lines and spreading blistering walls with soaked carpets The point is that these efforts alone would never have availed and Glen Gardner would speedily have lain in ashes had not fire engines from Sommerville and Washington been hurried to the spot And even as it was a section of the village was wiped away in clean licked ruins which stood for many a day as a grim reminder that the only safety against fires in these times lies in being able to fight fires well Which brings me of course to the modern fire department and the men who risk their lives as a matter of daily routine to protect their fellow men I will begin with some incidents of one particular fire that happened in New York on saint Patrick s Day eighteen ninety nine It was a pleasant afternoon and Fifth Avenue was crowded with people gathered to watch the parade A gayer pleasanter scene it would have been hard to find at three o clock or a sadder one at four The Ancient Order of Hibernians coming along with bands and banners were nearing Forty sixth Street when suddenly there sounded hoarse shouts and the angry clang of fire gongs and down Forty seventh Street came Hook and Ladder four on a dead run and swung into Fifth Avenue straight at the pompous Hibernians who immediately became badly scared Irishmen and took to their heels But the big ladders went no farther They were needed here oh so badly needed for the Windsor Hotel was on fire the famous Windsor Hotel at Fifth Avenue and Forty seventh Street It was on fire far gone with fire before ever the engines were called and the reason was that everybody supposed that of course somebody had sent the alarm And so they all watched the fire and waited for the engines ten fifteen minutes and by that time a great column of flame was roaring up the elevator shaft and people on the roof in their madness were jumping down to the street Then some sane citizen went to a fire box and rang the call and within ninety seconds Engine sixty five was on the ground And after her came Engines fifty four and twenty one But there was no making up that lost fifteen minutes The fire had things in its teeth now and three four five alarms went out in quick succession Twenty three engines had their streams on that fire in almost as many minutes And the big fire tower came from Thirty sixth Street and Ninth Avenue and six hook and ladder companies came Let us watch Hook and Ladder twenty one for a moment She was the mate of the fire tower and the rush of her galloping horses was echoing up the avenue just as Battalion Chief John Binns made out a woman in a seventh story window on the Forty sixth Street side where the fire was raging fiercely The woman was holding a little dog in her arms and it looked as if she was going to jump The chief waved her to stay where she was and running toward twenty one as she plunged along motioned toward Forty sixth Street Whereupon the tiller man at his back wheel did a pretty piece of steering and even as they swung the long truck in the turn the crew began hoisting the big ladder Such a thing is never done for the swaying of that ten ton mass might easily upset the truck but every second counted here and they took the chance As they drew along the curb Fireman McDermott sprang up the slowly rising ladder and two men came behind with scaling ladders for they saw that the main ladder would never reach the woman Five stories is what it did reach and then McDermott standing on the top round smashed one of the scaling ladders through a sixth story window and climbed on smashed the second scaling ladder through a seventh story window and five seconds later had the woman in his arms Illustration USE OF THE SCALING LADDERS To carry a woman down the front of a burning building on scaling ladders is a matter of regular routine for a fireman like jumping from a fourth story down to a net or making a bridge of his body It is part of the business But to have one foot in the air reaching for the lower rung of a swaying flimsy thing and to feel another rung break under you and your struggling burden and to fall two feet and catch safely that is a thing not every fireman could do but McDermott did it and he brought the woman unharmed to the ground and the dog too Almost at the same moment the crowd on Forty seventh Street thrilled in admiration of a rescue feat even more perilous On the roof screaming in terror was Kate Flannigan a servant swaying over the cornice on the point of throwing herself down Then out of a top floor window crept a little fireman and stood on the fire escape gasping for air Then he reached in and dragged out an unconscious woman and lowered her to others and was just starting down himself when yells from the street made him look up and he saw Kate Flannigan She was ten feet above him and he had no means of reaching her The crowd watched anxiously and saw the little fireman lean back over the fire escape saw him motion and shout something to the woman And then she crept over the cornice edge hung by her hands for a second and dropped into the fireman s arms It isn t every big strong man who could catch a sizable woman in a fall like that and hold her but this stripling did it because he had the nerve and knew how And that made another life saved By this time flames were breaking out of every story from street to roof It seemed impossible to go on with the rescue work yet the men persisted even on the Fifth Avenue front bare of fire escapes They used the long extension ladders as far as they could and then scaled it from window to window Here it was that William Clark of Hook and Ladder seven made the rescues that gave him the Bennett medal took three women out of seventh story windows when it was like climbing over furnace mouths to get there And one of these women he reached only by working his way along narrow stone ledges for three windows and back the same way to his ladder with the woman on his shoulders Even so it is likely he would have failed in this last effort had not Edward Ford come part way along the ledges to meet and help him Meantime Fireman Kennedy of Engine twenty three had rescued an old lady from the sixth floor and Joseph Kratchovil of Hook and Ladder two had carried out missus Leland wife of the proprietor from deadly peril on the fifth floor and Frank Tissier of Hook and Ladder four had found a family named Wells father mother and daughter in a blazing room and borne them out with his own clothes burning to the arms of Brennan and Sweeney who were waiting for him in a fury of fire at the top of the eighty five foot extension ladder And Andrew Fitzgerald also of Hook and Ladder four but off on sick leave with pneumonia had shown the true fireman spirit as he came from the doctors His instructions were to go home and stay there He was not on duty at all He was scarcely strong enough to be out of bed but when he heard that there were lives in peril down the avenue he forgot everything and ran to the place of danger There was need of him here and sick leave or not pneumonia or not he would do what he could What he did was to carry out the last ones taken alive from the ill fated hotel three women whom he bore in his arms from the fourth floor through roaring hallways then up a fire escape then back into the building with the flames singeing him and a shattering blast of exploding gas pursuing him and finally out on a balcony whence with the help of Policeman Harrigan he got them over safely to an adjoining housetop No wonder the Bonner medal was awarded him later for conspicuous courage II WHAT BILL BROWN DID IN THE GREAT TARRANT FIRE THE great test for Fire engine twenty nine and her crew the test of life or death that firemen wait years for to see what stuff is in them came of a mild autumn afternoon not soon to be forgotten by men who lunch down City Hall way by men who swarm in the stone hives of Chambers Street and Greenwich Street and Washington Street This was the day when innocent wholesome chlorate of potash excellent for colds showed what it can do when you take it by the ton with a pinch of fire This was the day of the great explosions when it rained red hot stones and blazing timbers when whole blocks of lower Manhattan shivered with the concussion This was Tarrant s day October twenty nine nineteen hundred It all started smoothly enough with brass gongs tapping out deliberate sixty two s at which the big horses in most engine houses stamped their displeasure for sixty two meant nothing to them at least not on the first call But it was great business for Harry and Nigger and Baby the two blacks and the gray that pull old twenty nine and there they were at the first tap breasting the rubber bound stall chains as if to hurry up laggard electricity which presently shot its sparks and loosed their fastenings Now down drop the stall chains and the horses pounding over the tiles crowd up three abreast ahead of the engine Down drop the crew silently swiftly sliding from ceiling to floor like so many blue shirted ghosts And click click its traces up and collars off the frames and snap snap until the last hook holds H m says Baby as the thick wheels start six seconds might have been worse We ll strike the curb in eight and a half snorts Nigger as the doors swing wide and they bang into Chambers Street Out into Chambers Street they go with Johnnie Marks driving and Bill Brown jamming blazing waste into her fire box where wood and oil do the rest On the back steps rides Captain Devanny steadying himself by the coal box scowling under his helmet and jerking fast on the alarm cord as they swing into Greenwich Street There is the fire just ahead corner of Warren Street nasty black smoke choking back the crowd And here comes the hose wagon clanging and rumbling at their heels It s first water for us Bill said Devanny There s drugs and stuff in there said Bill Then they fell to work as firemen do When the first explosion came said Captain Devanny telling the story weeks afterward I was inside the building up one flight at the bottom of a well of fire McArthur and Buckley were with me playing a stiff stream to protect the back windows There s where people in the building had to run to men and girls we could see em crowding on the balconies over Bishop s Alley and we wanted to give em a chance on the fire escapes You see a red hot ladder isn t much use to anybody Illustration A HOT PLACE Well they got down every soul of em but by that time big chunks of fire were dropping all around us and our helmets were crumpling and our clothes were burning Besides that we kept hearing little explosions overhead louder than the fire crackle louder than pistol shots and when you hear those in a drug house you don t feel any too good I went to the front and saw fire breaking out everywhere on the fourth and fifth floors Then I knew it was all up and ran back to order the boys out On the stairs I met Gillon and was just yelling Save yourselves when the crash came It was like cannon sir and sounded bzzzzzzzz in my ears for a long time as I lay in the wreck with tongues of blue flames licking down over me I d been blown clean off the second floor landing and dropped in the hallway twenty feet back from the door McArthur and Gillon were down the elevator shaft where they d jumped Nobody dared lift a head for a cyclone of fire was all over us It is not my purpose to detail the sufferings and final rescue of these flame bound men They had some vivid glimpses of death and some cruel burns but firemen count these nothing nor is McArthur s act in turning back through fire to save a fallen comrade Merron more than ordinary fireman s pluck nor is Devanny s experience when caught in the second explosion and blown through a shop on Washington Street more than an ordinary hazard of the business Indeed this Tarrant fire should have but little of my attention were there not something in it beyond noise and house smashing There was this thing in it overlooked by newspaper reports yet vastly important the behavior of Bill Brown to whom as a representative one may say of engine crew twenty nine came the great test I spoke of the rare test which nothing but the highest courage can satisfy All firemen have courage but it cannot be known until the test how many have this particular kind Bill Brown s kind And the odd part of it is that what he did seems a little thing and it took only a minute to do and it saved no life and made no difference whatever in the outcome of the fire yet to the few who know or care it stands in the memories of the department as a fine and unusual bit of heroism What happened was this Engine twenty nine pumping and pounding her prettiest stood at the northwest corner of Greenwich and Warren streets so close to the blazing drug house that Driver Marks thought it wasn t safe there for the three horses and led them away That was fortunate but it left Brown alone right against the cheek of the fire watching his boiler stoking in coal keeping his steam gage at seventy five As the fire gained chunks of red hot sandstone began to smash down on the engine Brown ran his pressure up to eighty and watched the door anxiously where the boys had gone in Then the explosion came and a blue flame wide as a house curled its tongues half way across the street enwrapping engine and man setting fire to the elevated railway station overhead or such wreck of it as the shock had left Bill Brown stood by his engine with a wall of fire before him and a sheet of fire above him He heard quick footsteps on the pavements and voices that grew fainter and fainter crying Run for your lives He heard the hose wagon horses somewhere back in the smoke go plunging away mad with fright and their burns He was alone with the fire and the skin was hanging in shreds on his hands face and neck Only a fireman knows how one blast of flame can shrivel up a man and the pain over the bared surfaces was well there is no pain worse than that of fire scorching in upon the quick flesh seared by fire Here I think was a crisis to make a very brave man quail Bill Brown knew perfectly well why every one was running there was going to be another explosion in a couple of minutes maybe sooner out of this hell in front of him And the order had come for every man to save himself and every man had done it except the lads inside And the question was Should he run or should he stay and die It was tolerably certain that he would die if he stayed On the other hand the boys of old twenty nine were in there Devanny and McArthur and Gillon and Merron his friends his chums he d seen them drag the hose in through that door there it was now a long throbbing snake of it and they hadn t come out Perhaps they were dead Yes but perhaps they weren t If they were alive they needed water now more than they ever needed anything before And they couldn t get water if he quit his engine Bill Brown pondered this a long time perhaps four seconds then he fell to stoking in coal and he screwed her up another notch and he eased her running parts with the oiler Explosion or not pain or not alone or not he was going to stay and make that engine hum He had done the greatest thing a man can do had offered his life for his friends It is pleasant to know that this sacrifice was averted A quarter of a minute or so before the second and terrible explosion Devanny and his men came staggering from the building Then it was that Merron fell and McArthur checked his flight to save him Then it was but not until then that Bill Brown left Engine twenty nine to her fate she was crushed by the falling walls and ran for his life with his comrades He had waited for them he had stood the great test It were easy to multiply stories of the firemen stories of the captains stories of the chiefs there is no end to them However many may be told or written they are but fragments of fragments New York has one hundred and thirty six engine companies forty hook and ladder companies besides the volunteers on Staten Island and there is not one of these but has its proud record of courage and self sacrifice Other lives show bravery for gain bravery for show bravery for sport these show bravery for the public good and for no other reason unselfish bravery Think what the firemen do They give up regular sleep they give up home life they bear every exposure they face death in many forms as a matter of daily routine they never refuse an order lead where it may such a case is practically unknown and they do all this for modest pay and scant glory Three or four dollars a day will cover their earnings and as for the glory what is it For some a medal a tattered paper with roll of honor mention a picture in the newspapers for most of them nothing Yet they are cheerful happy men Why I have wondered about this Shall we think of firemen as braver than other men as finer or more devoted No and yes I should say that most of them to start with had no such superiority but came into the department usually by opportunity or drift out of unpromising conditions came in quite as selfish and timorous quite as human as the ordinary citizens And the life did the rest The life changed them made them braver and better Why Because it is a brave unselfish life and no man can resist it Put a convict in the fire department and he will become an honest man or leave It s like changing scamps into heroes on the battle field only these battles of hose and ax are all righteous battles to save life to avert loss and suffering In the whole business of fighting fires there is no place for a mean or a base motive and can be none Therefore meanness and baseness go out of fashion just as whining goes out of fashion on a football team It s the fashion among firemen to do fine things Let me give a further instance to show what this fire department fashion does for men at the very top for battalion chiefs and deputy chiefs and the chief himself It swings them into line like men in the ranks With the chance to work less they find themselves working harder With orders to take from no one they assume voluntarily a severer duty than any man would put upon them And this even if power has come through the way of politics through influence or scheming Let the most spoils soaked veteran become chief of a city fire department and I believe we should see him in spite of himself forgetting his pocket stuffing principles and seeking the heroic goal though it kill him Which it probably would As a matter of fact New York has never had a chief who did not work harder than his men and spare himself less than he spared his men Take our present chief Edward F Croker the youngest man who ever held this place Let me run over his twenty four hours from eight in the evening when he goes on night duty at the Great Jones Street engine house From now until daylight he will cover personally some two hundred stations on the first alarm that is everything from Twenty third Street to the Battery the region of greatest danger And on the second or third alarm he will cover the whole of Manhattan Island That means answering every night from two to a dozen calls scattered over a great area It means a pair of horses Dan and John usually and driver clean worn out when morning comes And it means to the chief besides physical fatigue an exhausting responsibility in quickly judging each fire and outlining the way of fighting it Almost a day s work this one would say but it is only a beginning However broken his rest the chief is up at seven in the morning and note that what sleep he gets three four five hours is at an engine house not at his home and by nine he is at headquarters in Sixty seventh Street ready for a hard morning transacting business for the department doing as much work as a merchant in his counting room This until one o clock Then no luncheon all fire chiefs are two meal men but off for a four hours spin behind Kitty and Belle his daylight team driving from station to station for the work of inspection holding the reins himself for arm exercise seeing with his own eyes how the work is going holding every man to his duty Studying the city too as he goes about noting its growth and changes from the view point of a fire expert detecting weak points bad streets defective structures fixing in mind the danger spots here oil there lumber yonder paint or chemicals and planning always for the defense After this inspection tour comes the only time in the day when the chief is not on duty an hour and a half or two hours when he gets a glimpse of his family and eats his dinner Even then the fire buggy waits outside and many a time this brief home stay is cut short and off goes the chief dropping knife and fork to answer a third alarm There is some perversity about fires so his wife and children think that makes more of them start between six and eight in the evening this is really a fact than at any other period of the day Illustration A FALLING WALL So here we have a chief who actually holds himself ready for hardest service twenty two hours in every twenty four who seldom knows a night s unbroken rest who never takes a day off not even Sundays or holidays but uses these for longer inspection tours driving forty or fifty miles of a Christmas day over Long Island or out into Queens County or up through the Westchester region And he is never ill and he never complains To watch the chief at a big fire is a thing worth doing though not easy to do for he moves about constantly up stairs and down stairs from roof to roof from engine to engine in danger like his men not sending his orders merely but following after to observe their execution I expect each of my captains he told me one day to know the location and general condition of every alleyway every stairway every hydrant every fire escape in his section When I get to a fire the captain must tell me what I want to know and do it quick Will we find water in there behind the smoke Is there a back door at the end of that passage How about the balconies Where does this lane between the houses come out And a dozen other things If you want to fight fires well you must know the ground as if you lived on it III HERE WE VISIT AN ENGINE HOUSE AT NIGHT AND CHAT WITH THE DRIVER 
5118-40477-0000	train-other-500	THERE is something strange and solemn about an engine house at night like the stillness of a church or the hush of a drowsing menagerie You are filled with a sense of impending danger
5118-40477-0001	train-other-500	which is symbolized everywhere in the boots ranged at bunk sides of sighing sleepers in the brass columns smooth as glass that reach up through manholes in the floor
5118-40477-0002	train-other-500	and at which the fire crew leap half drunk with fatigue in the engine purring at the double doors steam always at twenty five in the boiler with tongues and harness lifted for the spring
5118-40477-0003	train-other-500	in the big gong which watches under the clock and the clock watches too a tireless yellow eye that seems to be ever saying Shall I strike Shall I strike And the clock
5118-40477-0004	train-other-500	ticks back Wait wait or Now now That is what you feel chiefly in an engine house at night the intense
none	none	 quiet watchfulness Even the horses seem to be watching with the corner of an eye as they munch their feed Illustration A RESCUE FROM A FIFTH STORY I counsel a man perhaps a woman weary of the old evening things the stupid show the trivial talk the laughter without mirth the suppers without nourishment to try an hour or two at an engine house making friends with the fireman on guard 
5118-40477-0005	train-other-500	it may be the driver of a chief as happened to me and see if he doesn t walk back home with a gladder heart and a better opinion of his fellows I fancy some of our reformers even
5118-40477-0006	train-other-500	might visit an engine house with profit and learn to dwell occasionally on the good that is in our cities and learn something about fighting without bluster and without ever letting up
5118-40477-0007	train-other-500	It was a tall loose jointed fellow I met at the Elm Street station a typical down easter
none	none	 who had wandered over the world and finally settled down as driver of the nervous little wagon that carries Chief Ahearn 
5118-40477-0008	train-other-500	a daring man and famous in his dashes from fire to fire over the city In these days of idol breaking it is good to see such hero worship as one finds here for all men who deserve it whether in humble station or near the top
none	none	 like this wiry little chief 
5118-40477-0009	train-other-500	asleep now up stairs against the night s emergencies Ask any fireman in New York to tell you about Ahearn and you ll find there is one business where jealousy doesn t rule Ahearn
none	none	 What do they think of Ahearn 
5118-40477-0010	train-other-500	Why he s a wonder sir he s the dandiest man Say did ye ever hear how he crawled under that blazing naphtha tank and got a man out who was in there unconscious They gave him the Bennett medal for that
5118-40477-0011	train-other-500	And d ye know about the rescue he made up in Williamsbridge when that barrel of kerosene exploded
none	none	 Oh but the prettiest thing Ahearn ever did was 
5118-40477-0012	train-other-500	Then each man will tell you a different thing The driver s favorite story
none	none	 was of the night when Ahearn ran back into a burning tenement on Delancey Street 
5118-40477-0013	train-other-500	where nobody had any business to go sir the fire was that fierce It was fine to see his face light up as he told what his chief did on this occasion and the whole quiet engine house seemed to throb with pride
5118-40477-0014	train-other-500	You see he went on
none	none	 there was a half crazy mother screaming around 
5118-40477-0015	train-other-500	that her baby was in the building As a matter of fact the baby was all right some neighbors had it but the mother didn t know that and the chief didn t know it either
none	none	 He was chief of the fourth Battalion then now he s deputy chief been promoted y know Chief or not didn t cut any ice with him and he just wrapped a coat around his head 
5118-40477-0016	train-other-500	and went in He got to the room all right where the woman said her baby was and it was like a furnace so he did the only thing a man can do got down low on his hands and knees and worked along toward the bed with his mouth against the floor sucking in air
5118-40477-0017	train-other-500	He went through fire sir that nearly burned his head off it did burn off the rims of his ears but he got to that bed somehow and then he found he d done it all for nothing There wasn t any baby there to save
5118-40477-0018	train-other-500	But there was a chief to save now He was about gone when he got back to the door
none	none	 and there he found that a spring lock had snapped shut on him 
5118-40477-0019	train-other-500	and he was a prisoner sir a prisoner in a stove He didn t have any strength left poor old chief he couldn t breathe let alone batter down doors and we d had some choice mourning around here inside of a minute
none	none	 if the lads of Hook and Ladder eighteen hadn t smashed in after him They thought he d looked for that baby about long enough The last thing he did was to kick his foot through a panel and they found him there unconscious with his rubber boot sticking out into the hall 
5118-40477-0020	train-other-500	Tell ye another thing the chief did continued the driver
none	none	 He rescued a husband and wife in the Hotel Jefferson out of a seventh story window when the whole business was roaring with fire That s only about a month ago 
5118-40477-0021	train-other-500	it was a mighty sad case We had three people to save if we could and two of em sick
none	none	 the husband and wife and the third was a trained nurse taking care of em Shows how people get rattled in a fire Why if they d only kept their hall door shut well they didn t and there they were all three at the window without hardly any clothes on and the flames close behind em We got up on the top floor of the Union Square Hotel the chief and I 
5118-40477-0022	train-other-500	about ten feet away along the same wall and by leaning out of our windows we could tell em what to do It was a case of ropes and swing across to us but it isn t every man can make a rope fast right when a fire is hurrying him
5118-40477-0023	train-other-500	especially a sick man or mebbe it was a poor rope he had Anyhow when the nurse came out of that window you might say tumbled out you see they made her go first
none	none	 she just fell like that much dead weight scared you know 
5118-40477-0024	train-other-500	and when the rope tightened it snapped and down she went seven stories killed her bang The chief saw that would never do so we went up on the roof and threw over more rope
5118-40477-0025	train-other-500	It was clothes line the only thing handy but I doubled it to make sure And with that we got the husband and wife across all safe for now you see we could lift em out easy without such a terrible jerk on the rope
5118-40477-0026	train-other-500	That was the chief s idea Yes said I but you helped What s your name
none	none	 No no he smiled 
5118-40477-0027	train-other-500	never mind me I m nobody Let the chief have it all And then he went on with the story which interested me mainly as showing the kind of loyalty one finds among these firemen Each man will tell of another man s achievements not of his own
5118-40477-0028	train-other-500	You could never find out what Bill Brown did from Brown himself The clock ticked on some service calls rang on the telephone
none	none	 and once the driver bounded up in the middle of a word and stood with coat half off in strained attention 
5118-40477-0029	train-other-500	counting the strokes of the gong No it wasn t for them They d go though on the second call Second calls usually came within twenty minutes of the first so we d soon see Meantime
5118-40477-0030	train-other-500	he told me about a fireman known as Crazy Banta Talk about daredevils said he this man Banta beat the town
none	none	 Why I ve known him to go up on 
5118-40477-0031	train-other-500	a house with a line of men where they had to cross the ridge of a slate roof you know where the two sides slant up to a point Well the other men would straddle along careful one leg on each side but when Banta came
5118-40477-0032	train-other-500	he d walk across straight up just like he was down on the street That s why we called him Crazy he d do such crazy things And funny Well sir he d swaller quarters as fast as you d give em to him
5118-40477-0033	train-other-500	and let you punch him in the stomach and hear em rattle around Then he d light a match
none	none	 open his mouth put the match way inside 
5118-40477-0034	train-other-500	and let you watch the quarters come up again Had a double stomach or something He could swaller canes too same as a circus man Said he d learned all his tricks over in India but some of the boys thought he lied
5118-40477-0035	train-other-500	They said he d prob ly traveled with some show
none	none	 He used to tell us how he could speak Burmese and Siamese and Hindu all those lingoes just perfect 
5118-40477-0036	train-other-500	so one day a battalion chief called his bluff
none	none	 when there were a lot of emigrants from those parts down at the Battery 
5118-40477-0037	train-other-500	and blamed if Banta didn t chin away to the whole crowd of em you d thought he was their long lost brother Was he a foreigner No sir
none	none	 he was born in Hohokus N J But the time Banta fixed his reputation all right was at a fire in Pell Street 
5118-40477-0038	train-other-500	some factory After that he might have told us he could fly or eat glass or any old thing and we d have believed him Tell ye what he did This factory all smashed in after she d burned a while
5118-40477-0039	train-other-500	and one of the boys Dave Soden got wedged under the second floor with all the other floors piled on top of him It was a great big criss cross of timbers with Dave at the bottom
none	none	 and the flames eating in fast We could see the whole thing was going to make a fine bonfire in about three minutes and it looked as if Dave would be in it Illustration AT FULL SPEED You understand we didn t dare pry up the timbers for that would have brought the whole factory down on Dave and killed him plumb 
5118-40477-0040	train-other-500	And we couldn t begin at the top and throw off the timbers for there wasn t any time We didn t know what to do but Banta he did He grabbed up a saw and said he d crawl in and get Dave out
5118-40477-0041	train-other-500	And by thunder he did He just wriggled in and out like a snake through those timbers and when he got to Dave he sawed off the end of a beam that held him and then dragged him out He took big chances for you see if he d sawed off the wrong beam
none	none	 it might have brought down the whole business on both of them But Banta he knew how to do it Oh he was a wonder 
5118-40477-0042	train-other-500	They gave him the medal for that and promoted him Say you d never guess how he ended up How I asked Got hit by a cable car yes sir Hurt so bad they retired him
none	none	 What d ye think of that Not afraid of the devil and done up by a measly cable car IV FAMOUS RESCUES BY NEW YORK FIRE BOATS FROM RED HOT OCEAN LINERS AFTER all has been said that may be about our admirable fire engines and endless stories have been told of gallant fights made by the engine lads for life and property there remains this fact that New York possesses a far more formidable weapon against fires than the plucky little steamers that go clanging and tooting about our streets The fire boat is as much superior to the familiar fire engine as a rapid fire cannon is superior to a rifle A single fire boat like the New Yorker will throw as much water in a given time as twenty ordinary fire engines it will throw twelve thousand gallons in a minute that is fifty tons or if we imagine this great quantity of water changed into a rope of ice say an inch thick it would reach twenty miles Suppose we go aboard her now this admirable New Yorker and look about a little People come a long way to see her for she s the largest and finest fire boat in the world Pretty isn t she All brass and hard wood and electric lights everything shining like a pleasure yacht Looks like a gunboat with rows of cannon all around her queer stumpy little cannon that have wheels above their mouths Those are hose connections like hydrants in a city where they screw fast the rubber lines She has twenty one on a side that makes forty two gates as the engineer calls them without counting four monitors aloft those things on the pilot house that look like telescopes with long red tails It was the monitors especially Big Daddy that did such great work against those North German Lloyders in their drift down the river in nineteen hundred with decks ablaze and red hot iron hulls We shall hear all about that day if we sit us down quietly in the fire quarters ashore and get the crew started Stepping over side again here we are in the home of the fire boat crew It s more like a club than an engine house No horses stamping about no stable but pictures on the walls and men playing cribbage or reading and nobody in a hurry Plenty of time for tales of adventure unless that gong takes to tapping And here comes Gallagher sliding down yonder brass column from the sleeping rooms He s the lad who did fine things in that great fire at the Mallory pier saved a man s life and made the roll of honor by it We ll never get the story from him but the other boys will tell us Illustration INTO THIS STREET OF FIRE BETWEEN THE TWO PIERS STEAMED THE BIG FIRE BOAT STRAIGHT IN WITH FOUR STREAMS PLAYING TO PORT AND FOUR TO STARBOARD ALL DOING THEIR PRETTIEST If ever fire boats proved their value it was that night in May nineteen hundred when Pier nineteen East River caught fire with all its length of inflammable freight Close to three o clock in the morning it was and a hurricane from the northeast was driving the flames toward land Before the engines could start a fire wave had leaped across South Street and was raging down the block And another fire wave had leaped across the dock between Pier nineteen and Pier twenty setting fire to a dozen barges and lighters moored there and to the steamship Neuces of the Mallory line And presently all these were blazing some with cargoes of cotton and oil blazing until the lower end of the island looked out of the night in ghastly illumination a terrible picture in red and black They say it was bright enough that night half a mile away for a man to pick up a pin There is no harder problem for the engines than these fierce driven water front fires that sweep in suddenly shoreward for they must be taken head on with all the smoke in the firemen s faces and water often lacking strange to say although the river is so near For the fire boats however the advantage is the other way they attack from the rear where they see what they are doing and can pump from a whole ocean Besides that they attack with so formidable a battery that no hook and ladder corps is needed to break open for them The three inch stream from Big Daddy alone will tear off roofs and rip out beams like the play of artillery and if that is not sufficient the boys have only to hitch on the four and a half inch nozzle and set the two pumps feeding it five thousand gallons a minute or twenty tons of water Under that shock there is no wall built of brick and mortar that will not crumble When the New Yorker came up on this memorable night the fifth alarm had sounded and things were looking serious Piers nineteen and twenty were in full flame and every floating thing between them Into this street of fire steamed the big fire boat straight in with four streams playing to port and four to starboard all doing their prettiest She went ahead slowly fighting back the flames foot by foot on pier and steamship and kindling small craft that drifted by in fiery procession And the air in the men s faces was like the breath of a furnace Illustration GALLAGHER S RESCUE OF A SWEDE FROM THE BURNING BARGE Here it was that Gallagher won his place on the roll of honor in this wise For some time they had heard shouts that were lost in the din of conflagration but presently they made them out as a warning from somebody somewhere that a man was on a burning barge just passing them It seemed incredible that a man could be there alive and silent but with the spirit of his trade Gallagher determined to see if it were true he would board the barge anyhow and as the New Yorker swung close alongside he sprang down to her deck where things were a good deal warmer than is necessary for a man s health And as he leaped John Kerrigan at the steering wheel of Big Daddy turned its mighty stream against the barge keeping it just over Gallagher s head so that the spray drenched down upon him while the stream itself smote a path ahead through the fire Down this path went Gallagher searching for a man avoiding pitfalls of smoke and treacherous timbers confident that Kerrigan would hold the flames back yet see to it that the terrible battering ram of water did not strike him for to be struck with the full force of Big Daddy s stream is like being pounded by a trip hammer Gallagher reached the cabin door found it locked put his back against it and smashed it in Then he went on groping choking feeling his way searching for his man And at last on one of the bunks he found him stretched out in a stupor of sleep or drowsed by the stifle of gases The man was a Swede named Thomas Bund and he came out of that cabin on Gallagher s back came off that burning barge on Gallagher s back and if he does not bless the name of Gallagher all his days then there is no gratitude in Sweden Here we see the kind of service the fire boats render On this night they saved the situation and a million dollars besides they worked against a blazing steamship against blazing piers against blazing runaways worked for eleven hours until the last smolder of fire had been drowned under thirty thousand tons of water And not a year passes but they do something of like sort Now it is a steamship say the ill starred Leona that comes up the bay with a cargo of cotton burning between decks The New Yorker makes short work of her Again it is a blazing lumber district along the river like the great McClave yards where the fire boats fought for eight days and nights before they gained the victory But they did gain it Or it may be a fire back from the river like the Tarrant horror where the land engines sore pressed welcome far carried streams from the fire boats as help that may turn the balance Why this fire boat s only ten years old sir said Captain Braisted and she s saved more than she cost every year we ve had her Then he added as his eyes dwelt proudly on the trim craft purring at her dock side And she cost a tidy sum too Let us come now to that placid summer afternoon to that terrible Saturday June thirty nineteen hundred when tug boats in the North River looked upon a fire the like of which the river had never known and may not know again They looked from a distance we may be sure these tug boats for when a great liner swings down stream a roaring red hot furnace it is time for wooden deck craft to scurry out of the way And here were three liners in such case the Bremen the Saale and the Main all burning furiously and beyond human help one would say for their iron hulls were vast fire traps with port holes too small for rescue and the decks swept with flame It was hard to know that back of those steep sides were men in anguish held like prisoners in a fortress of glowing steel that sizzled as it drifted three fortresses of glowing steel Then up steamed the New Yorker and the Van Wyck with men behind fire shields against the blistering scorch and glare with monitors and rail pipes spurting out all that the pumps could send The New Yorker took the Bremen the Van Wyck took the Saale and there they lay for hours close on the edge of the fire like a pair of salamanders engines throbbing pumps pounding pilots at the wheel watching every movement of the liners following foot by foot drawing in closer when they gained on the fire holding away a shade when the fire gained on them fighting every minute It s queer said Captain Braisted but when you play a broadside of heavy streams on a vessel s side say at fifty feet there s a strong recoil that keeps driving the fire boat back It s as if you were pushing off all the time with poles instead of water And you have to keep closing in with the engines How near did you get to the Bremen I asked Oh we finally got right up against her say after forty five minutes You can cool off a lot of red hot iron in forty five minutes when you ve got forty five tons of water a minute to do it with It was just as they came alongside that one of the crew made out a human shape in the coal chute some ten feet up the Bremen s side And presently they saw others there blackened faces fierce and fearful eyes And above the fire crackle and the crash of water they heard men s cries Straightway a ladder was brought and three of the crew Breen Kerrigan and Hartmann lifted it on their shoulders until the top rung came up level with the coal chute But this instead of bringing relief to the fire bound company brought madness for now they fought and struggled so each one wishing to go first that none were able to go at all They were like wild beasts said one of the crew In this crisis Gallagher sprang up the ladder to the top where he could look in through the hole the one hole in all the vessel s sides that was large enough for a man s body to pass And reaching in here he grabbed what was nearest arm leg or shock of hair and hauled it out and lowered it down the ladder to Captain Braisted who stood below him and passed the bundle on Then Gallagher grabbed again and again pulling forth by sheer strength one man at a time taking them as they came Germans or Italians officers or coal handlers anything that was alive Down came the tumbling mass yelling praying fighting a miserable human stream and when it was all over and the count was taken they had saved thirty two lives Now one of the rescued men spoke up in broken English and said that there were others still on the Bremen down in the engine room And Gallagher volunteered to go aboard for the rescue if one of the men who knew the vessel would come along to guide him But no man offered this service It was too hazardous a thing they said where the fire was not raging there was smoke and darkness and the engine room was far down in the vessel They had groped about themselves for half an hour in despair searching for the way out and now that they had found it they were not fools enough to go in again But you say there are others in there alive insisted Gallagher The rescued ones shook their heads blankly at this in their minds the law of self preservation rode over all other things at this moment Poor men they were half dazed by their sufferings and the shock Illustration SAVING THE MEN OF THE BREMEN All right cried Gallagher I ll go in and find em without any guide Hold the ladder boys And up he went I m with you Ned called Captain Braisted and without more words these two climbed in through the coal chute and started down the black hot stifling ways for the engine room And somehow they got there safely and found eight men still alive all Germans engineers and their assistants But when the firemen called to them to hurry out for their lives they refused to move Their duty was with their engines said they they had to run the engines they were much obliged to the American gentlemen but they could not leave their post Gallagher and Braisted could scarcely believe their ears But you will die they urged The Germans thought it very likely still they could not leave But it won t do any good the vessel is past hope you will be burned to death The Germans understood perfectly they would be burned to death at their engines and as they were all of this mind and not to be shaken the firemen could only say good by and set forth sadly on the return journey And this time they nearly lost themselves but at last their good star prevailed and they came without harm to their comrades who listened in wonder to the news they brought It seemed such utter folly the decision of that unhappy engine room crew yet there was something almost splendid in their stubborn devotion to duty Quietly they had looked death in the face a horrible lingering death and had not flinched and days later when the steamer had burned herself out and lay grounded in the mud cold and black the wreckers found these faithful though mistaken men still at their posts still by their engines where they had waited in spite of everything where they had perished All this time the Van Wyck had been working on the Saale but in a harder fight for the flames raged here as fiercely as on the Bremen while the smaller fire boat could throw against them only twenty five tons of water a minute which was not enough So now when all had been done that could be for the Bremen orders came that the New Yorker too turn her streams against the Saale and a little later the two fire boats were in massed attack upon the unhappy liner which swung down the bay like a blazing island and presently grounded by the bow on the Communipaw mud flats and rested there for the last agony The story of those tragic hours is not for telling now There were more heroic rescues There were brave attempts at rescue that availed nothing The fire lads stood on the hurricane deck with flames roaring about them and water up to their knees surging past like a mill race it was the return torrent from their own nozzles Foot by foot the stern settled and the water crept nearer nearer to the open port holes In a large stateroom aft fourteen men and one woman gave a noble picture of resignation in the face of an awful death Hemmed in there between fire and water they prayed quietly and thanked the fire lads for cups of water passed in through the port hole and waved good by as the stern gave a final lurch and went down Illustration FIRE BOATS WORKING ON THE BREMEN AND THE SAALE Nor does this end the record of that day for there was still the Main to fight for and at eleven o clock that night the New Yorker steamed up the river and caught the third liner as the flood tide bore her stern first toward the flats of Weehawken She had been blazing for eight hours and was red hot now from the water line up It seemed incredible that there could be a living thing aboard her yet they went to work in the old way and within an hour had dragged out through the coal hole a blackened and frightened company more than a score of boiler cleaners and coal handlers who had somehow lived through those fearful hours by burrowing down in the deepest bunkers far below the water level After this the fire boats did other things THE AERIAL ACROBAT I SHOWING THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN MUSCLE AND SKILL TO WORK ON THE HIGH BARS A FEW years ago I had the pleasure of traveling for ten days with a great circus and in this way came to know some very interesting people elephant keepers lion tamers trapeze performers bareback riders not to mention the bearded lady the dog faced boy and other side show celebrities who used to eat with us in the cook tent there was one gentleman appareled in blue velvet who ate with his feet for the reason that he had no arms and would reach across for salt or butter with an easy knee and ankle movement that was a perpetual surprise What strange things one sees traveling with a circus Every night there is a mile of trains to be loaded every morning a tented city to be built Such hard work for everybody Two performances a day besides the street procession And what a busy time in the tents Leapers getting ready double somersault men getting ready clowns stuffing out false stomachs and chalking their faces kings of the air buckling on their spangles Ouf How glad we all were when five o clock came and the concert was over and the big top with its spreading amphitheater and its four great center poles stood silent and empty It was at this five o clock hour one day that I first saw little Nelson the ten year old trapeze performer and that picture remains among the pleasantest of my circus memories I can recall more exciting things like the fight between two jealous wrestlers or the mystery of the lost Chinese giant or the story of a wrecked train when the wild animals escaped and the fat lady was rescued with difficulty from a burning car And I can recall sad things the case of that poor trapeze girl two weeks a widow who nevertheless went through her act twice a day and tripped away kissing her hands to the crowd while her heart was breaking And saddest of all was the case of beautiful Zazel once the much advertised human cannonball then suddenly a helpless cripple after a fall from the dome of the tent Her husband one of the circus men told me how she lived for more than a year in a plaster case swung down from the ceiling and of her sweetness and patience through it all And she finally recovered I am glad to say so that she could walk a pale weak image of this once splendid circus queen But let me come to Nelson This sturdy little fellow was one of the circus children born on the sawdust brought up to regard lion cages as the proper background for a nursery and thinking of father and mother in connection with the flying bars and bareback feats It was Nelson s ambition to follow in his father s steps and become a great artist on the trapeze Indeed at this time he felt himself already an artist and at the hour of rest would walk forth into the middle ring all alone and with greatest dignity go through his practice He would not be treated as a child and scorned any suggestion that he go out and play Play He had work to do Look here Do you know any man who can throw a prettier row of flip flaps than this And wait Here s a forward somersault Is it well done or not Did he come over with a good lift Like his father you think Ah I can still see his chest swell with pride Nelson was not a regular member of the show he was a child and merely came along with his parents the circus being his only home but occasionally after much teasing or as a reward for good behavior his father would lead the boy forth before a real audience And how they would applaud as the trim little figure in black and yellow tights rose slowly to the tent top feet together body arched back teeth set on the thong of the pulley line that his father held anxiously And how the women would catch their breath when Nelson hanging by his knees in the long swing would suddenly pretend to slip seem to fall then catch the bar cleverly by his heels and sweep far out over the spread of faces arms folded head back and a look that said plainly Don t you people see what an artist I am This boy possessed the two great requisites in a trapeze performer absolute fearlessness and a longing to perform in the air which longing made him willing to take endless pains in learning It would seem that acrobats differ from divers steeple climbers lion tamers and the rest in this that from their early years they have been strongly drawn to the career before them to leaping turning in the air and difficult tricks on the trapeze and horizontal bars The acrobat must be born an acrobat not so much because his feats might not be learned by an ordinary man but because the particular kind of courage needed to make an acrobat is not found in the ordinary man In other words to be an aerial leaper or an artist on the flying bars is quite as much a matter of heart as of agility and muscle There are men who know how to do these things but can t In illustration of this let me present three of my circus friends Weitzel and Zorella and Danny Ryan trapeze professionals whose daring and skill are justly celebrated Zorella s real name I may say is Nagel and so far from being a dashing foreigner he is a quiet spoken young man from Grand Rapids Michigan where he learned his first somersaults tumbling about on sawdust piles And at sixteen he was the only boy in the region who could do the giant swing Whereupon along came a circus with an acrobat who needed a brother and Nagel got the job Two days later he began performing in the ring and since then that was ten years ago he hasn t missed a circus day Illustration AS THEY SHOOT TOWARD THE MAN HANGING FOR THE CATCH FROM THE LAST BAR The act that has given these three their fame includes a swing a leap and a catch which seems simple enough until one learns the length and drop of that swing and how the leapers turn in the air and what momentum their bodies have as they shoot toward the man hanging for the catch from the last bar It is Weitzel who catches the other two He was understander in a brother act before he learned the trapeze and the man who earns his living by holding two or three men on his head and shoulders while they do tricks of balancing is pretty sure to build up a strong body And Weitzel needs all his strength when Danny springs from the pedestal over there at the tent top fifty two feet away and swinging through a half circle thirty six feet across comes the last sixteen feet flying free and turning twice as he comes For all his brawny arms Weitzel would be torn away by the clutch of that hurling mass were not the strain eased by the stretch of fourteen thongs of rubber seven on a side that support his bar cords And sometimes as the leapers catch the bar sags full four feet and then as they snap off down to the net springs nine feet up so that Weitzel s head has many a time bumped the top support The catcher man must hold himself ready for a dozen different leaps must watch for the safety clutch where the four hands grip first at the elbows then slide down the forearms to the wrists and hold there where the tight bound handkerchiefs jam he must know how to seize Zorella by the ankles when he shoots at him feet up after a backward double he must know how to land Danny when he comes turning swiftly with eyes blindfolded and body bound in a sack All these feats are hard enough to do yet still harder one might say is the mere starting to do them There are scores of acrobats well skilled in doubles and shoots and twisters who would not for their lives go up on the pedestal whence Ryan and Zorella make their spring and simply take the first long swing hanging from the trapeze Nothing else simply take the swing The fact is there is an enormous difference between working on horizontal bars say ten feet above ground and on the same bars thirty feet above ground or between a trapeze act with leaps after a moderate swing and the same act with leaps after a long swing Often I have watched Ryan and Zorella poised on the pedestal just before the swing and holding the trapeze bar drawn so far over to one side that its supporting wires come up almost horizontal and even on the ground it has made me dizzy to see them lean forward for the bar which falls short of the pedestal so that they can barely catch it with the left hand fingers while the right hand clings to the pedestal brace They need the send of that initial spring to give them speed but Well there was a very powerful and active man in Columbus Ohio a kind of local athlete who agreed on a wager to swing off from the pedestal as Danny and Zorella did And one day a small company gathered at the practice hour to see him do it He said it was easy enough His friends chaffed him and vowed he couldn t do it in a hundred years The big man climbed up the swinging ladder to the starting place and stood there looking down When you stand on the pedestal the ground seems a long way below you and there is little comfort in the net The big man said nothing but began to get pale He had the trapeze bar all right with one hand the thing was to let go with the other For ten minutes the big man stood there He said he wasn t in a hurry His friends continued to joke him One man urged him to come down The professionals told him he d better not try it if he was afraid at which the others laughed and that settled it for the big man was afraid but he was stubborn too and rising on his toes he threw his right arm forward and started He caught the bar safely with his right hand swept down like a great pendulum and at the lowest point of the swing was ripped away from the bar with the jerk of his two hundred pounds and went skating along the length of the net on his face until he was a sorry looking big man with the scratch of the meshes Not one athlete in twenty they say without special training could hold that bar after such a drop Zorella cited a case in point where a first class acrobat was offered a much larger salary by a rival circus to become the partner of an expert on the high bars This man was crazy to accept said Zorella and everything was practically settled The two did their act together on the low bars in great shape Then they tried it on the high bars and the new man stuck right at the go off Queerest thing you ever saw He had to start on the end bar with a giant swing that gives em their send you know then do a backward single to the middle bar then a shoot on to the last bar and from there drop with somersaults down to the net All this was easy for him on the low bars but when he got up high well he hadn t the nerve to let go of the first bar after the giant swing He kept going round and round and just stuck there Seemed as if his hands were nailed fast to that bar We talked to him and reasoned with him and he tried over and over again but it was no use He could drop from the last bar he could shoot from the middle bar but to save his life he couldn t let go of the first bar I don t know whether he was afraid or what but he couldn t do it and the end of it was he had to give up the offer although it nearly broke his heart And even acrobats accustomed to working at heights feel uneasy in the early spring when they begin practising for a new season The old tricks have always in a measure to be learned over again and they work gradually from simple things to harder ones a straight leap then one somersault then two And foot by foot the pedestal is lifted until the body overcomes its shrinking Even so I saw Zorella one day scratched and bruised from many failures in the trick where Weitzel catches him by the ankles Here after the long swing he must shoot ahead feet first as if for a backward somersault and then changing suddenly do a turn and a half forward and dive past Weitzel with body whirling so as to bring his legs over just right for the catch And every time they missed of course he fell and risked striking the net on his forehead which is the most dangerous thing an acrobat can do To save his neck he must squirm around as a cat turns and land on his back which is not so easy in the fraction of a second especially if you happen to be dazed by a glancing blow of the catcher man s arm II ABOUT DOUBLE AND TRIPLE SOMERSAULTS AND THE DANGER OF LOSING HEART IN talking with my circus friends I was surprised to learn that a trapeze performer in perfect practice say in mid season may suddenly without knowing why begin to hesitate or blunder in a certain trick that he has done without a slip for years This happened to Danny Ryan in the fall of nineteen hundred when he found himself growing more and more uncertain of his difficult pirouette leap a feat invented by himself in eighteen ninety six and never done by another performer Danny did it first when he used to play the clown with the spring board leapers who do graceful somersaults over elephants and horses With them would come Danny made up as a fat man and do a backward somersault and a full twister at the same time the effect being a queer corkscrew turn that made the people laugh They little suspected that this awkward looking leap was one of the most difficult feats in the air ever attempted or that it had cost Ryan weeks of patient practice and many a hard knock before he mastered it And then one day after doing it hundreds of times with absolute ease he did it badly then he did it worse then he fell and finally began to be afraid of it and left it out of the act Acrobats shake their heads when you ask for an explanation of a thing like that They don t know the explanation but they dread the thing When a man feels that way about a trick he s got to quit it for a while said Ryan or he ll get hurt Most all the accidents happen where a performer forces himself against something inside him that says stop Sometimes an acrobat has to give up his work entirely Now there s Dunham you ve heard of him the greatest performer in the world on high bars They ll give him any salary he wants to ask Graceful Well you ought to see him let go from his giant swing and do a back somersault clean over the middle bar and catch the third And now they say he s gone out of the business Somebody told me it was religion Don t you believe it He s had a feeling it s something like fear but it isn t fear that he s worked on high bars long enough He s had bad luck with his partners too remarked Weitzel Couple of em missed the turn somehow and got killed Say that takes a man s nerve as much as anything to have his partner hurt I don t wonder Dunham wants to quit Tell you where it s hard on an acrobat put in Zorella that s where he can t quit on account of his family where he needs the money I remember a young fellow joined the show out west to leap over elephants He got along well enough over two elephants but when it came to three why we could all see he was shaky Some of the boys told him he d better stop but he said he d try to learn and he was such a nice modest fellow and worked so hard that everybody wished him luck But it wasn t any use One day he tackled a double over three elephants and came down all in sections with his right foot on the mattress and his left foot on the ground That was his last leap poor fellow for the ankle bones snapped as his left foot struck and a few hours later he lay in the dressing room tent pretty white with the doctors over him I ll never forget the way he looked up at us when we came in He was game all right but his eyes were awful pathetic Well boys said he here I am I did the best I could Turned out he d done it for a sick wife and a little baby Pretty tough wasn t it Speaking of leaps over elephants brings to my mind an afternoon when I watched a circus rehearsal in the open air That is a thing better worth seeing to my mind than the regular performance the acrobats and riders in their every day clothes are more like ordinary men and women and their feats seem the more difficult for occasional slips and failures Here for instance are a mother and daughter in shirt waists watching the trick monkey ride a pony when suddenly a whistle sounds and off goes the mother to drive three plunging horses in a chariot race while the daughter hurries to her part in an equestrian quadrille And now these children playing near the drilling elephants trot into the ring and do wonderful things on bicycles And yonder sleepy looking man is a lion tamer and those three are the famous Potters aerial leapers and this thick set fellow in his shirt sleeves is Artressi the best jumper in the circus He s going to practise now see they are putting up the spring board and the long downward run that leads to it These other men are jumpers too but Artressi is the star he draws the big salary Illustration FOUR ELEPHANTS WAS ENOUGH FOR ANY MAN TO LEAP OVER Now they start and spring off rather clumsily one after another in straight leaps to the mattress They won t work into good form for some days yet Here they come again a little faster and two of them try singles Here comes Artressi Ah a double forward and prettily taken The crowd applauds Now a tall man tries a double Gradually the practice gets hotter until every man is doing his best There will be stiff joints here in the morning but never mind In a resting spell I sat down by Artressi and talked with him about leaping It was hard he said going off a spring board into empty air Didn t know how it was but he could always do better with something to leap over say elephants or horses He could judge the mattress easier wasn t so apt to miss it What was his biggest leap Well four elephants and three camels was about his best with a pyramid of men on top He d cleared that twice a day for weeks some years ago but he wouldn t do it now No sir four elephants was enough for any man to leap over if he had a wife and child That made a flight of thirty feet anyhow from the spring board to the ground Oh yes he turned two somersaults on the way forward somersaults It wasn t possible for anybody to clear four elephants and turn backward somersaults I asked Artressi his real name is Artress about a leap with three somersaults and found him positive that such a feat will never become part of a regular circus program A man can turn the three somersaults all right but he loses control of himself and doesn t know whether he is coming down right or wrong In fact he is sure to come down wrong if he does it often Then he mentioned the one case where he himself had made a leap with three somersaults It was down in Kentucky at the home of his boyhood Years had passed since he had seen the town and in that time he had risen from nothing to a blaze of circus glory He had become the Great Artressi instead of little Joe Artress and now he was to appear before the people who knew him It was perhaps the most exciting moment of his life and as he came down the run toward the spring board he nerved himself to so fine an effort that instead of doing two somersaults over the horses and elephants as he intended he did three and by a miracle of fortune landed safely That was his first and last triple he wasn t taking chances of a broken neck or a twisted spine which had been the end of more than one ambitious leaper No sir he would stick to doubles where a man knows exactly what he s doing In talking with acrobats I came upon an interesting phenomenon that seems almost like a violation of the laws of gravitation It appears that the movements of a performer on the bars or trapeze are affected in a marked degree by the slope of the ground underneath In other words although bars and trapeze may rest on supports that are perfectly level yet the swing of an acrobat s body will be accelerated over a downward slope or retarded over an upward slope So true is this that the trapeze performer swinging over an upward slope will often require all his strength to reach a given point while over a downward slope he must hold back lest he reach it too easily and suffer a collision Nevertheless the swing in both cases is precisely the same with rigging and bars fixed to a true level On this point there have been endless arguments and many persons have contended that acrobats must imagine all this since the upward or downward slope of the ground under a trapeze can in no way affect the movement of that trapeze I fancy the wisdom of such people is like that of the professors who proved some years ago that it is a physical impossibility for a ball player to pitch a curve There is no doubt that trapeze performers are obliged to take serious account of the ground s slope in their daily work to note carefully the amount of slope and the direction of slope and to take their precautions accordingly If they did not they would fail in their feats Those are the facts to which all acrobats bear witness let scientists explain them as they may Suppose the ground slopes to one side or the other under your trapeze I asked Ryan one day How does that affect you It draws you down the slope and makes your bar swing that way What do you do about it Sometimes I pull the bar over a little in starting so as to balance the pull of the hill but that s uncertain It s better to fix the rigging so that the bar is a little higher on the downhill side Ryan said that a straight ahead downhill slope is the worst for a man because he is apt to hold back too hard being afraid of bumping into his partner and so he doesn t get send enough and falls short of his mark But all slopes are bad for us he said and we try hard to get our things put up over level ground This is but one instance of the jealous care shown by acrobats for their bars and rigging These things belong not to the circus but to the individual performers who put every brace and knot to the severest test For the high bars a particular kind of hickory is used with a core of steel inside Every mesh of the net must resist a certain strain The bars themselves must be neither too dry nor too moist The light must come in a certain way and a dozen other things Many an accident has come through the failure of some little thing This much is certain that acrobats often suffer without serious injury falls that would put an end to ordinary men Like bareback riders they know how to fall this art consisting chiefly in tucking up into a ball and hardening the muscles so that the shock is eased Also they have by practice acquired the power of deciding instantly how to make the body protect itself in an emergency Now said Ryan I ll give you a case where two of us did some quick thinking and it helped a lot We were with a circus in Australia making a night run It was somewhere in New South Wales and every man was asleep in his bunk First thing we knew bang rip tear a drowsy engineer had smashed into us and taken the rear truck of our sleeper clean off and there were the floor timbers of our car bumping along over the ties We had the last car Our engineer never slowed up and our floor was going into kindling wood fast It was as dark as pitch and nobody said a word Fred Reynolds and I Reynolds was a clown acrobat had lower berths right at the end next to the negro porter and I don t say we escaped because we were acrobats but well this is what we did Fred gave one mighty leap just like going over elephants and cleared the whole trail of wreckage that was pounding along behind the car and landed safe on the track It was a crazy thing to do in my opinion but it worked I made a spring for the chandelier and hung there until the train stopped And afterward I found my trousers back on the road bed with the legs cut clean off and I guess my own legs would have gone the same way if they d been there What did the porter do Oh he did nothing and and he was killed III IN WHICH THE AUTHOR TRIES HIS HAND WITH PROFESSIONAL TRAPEZE PERFORMERS ON this particular morning it was a damp day in February I had been watching the Potter family familiar on circus posters in tights and spangles at their practice of aerial leaps when Henry Potter who is husband father and brother of the others and chief of the act suggested that if I wanted a vivid idea of what it was to work on the flying trapeze I might come up and take his place on the cradle and let Tom chuck the kid across to me and see if I could catch him The kid was Roy Potter sometimes Royetta when presented in feminine trappings a slender lad of seventeen who had just been doing doubles and twisters and half turns leaping with shoot and graceful curve from brother to brother up there in mid air under the rafters of this moldering old skating rink Go ahead he urged it s easy enough All you ve got to do is hang by your knees and it can t hurt the boy for he ll drop in the net if you miss him Besides we ll put the mechanic on him The mechanic is an arrangement of waist straps and trailing pulley ropes that guard a gymnast while he is learning some new feat Doubtless I should have declined this amiable offer had I taken time to consider for there was no particular appropriateness in a man who knew nothing about the trapeze except such rudiments as boys of twelve get in their own back yards taking part offhand in a leaping performance thirty feet above ground with the phenomenal and fearless Potters I quote the circus signs greatest of all great acrobatic aerials Yet he put it so plausibly I certainly would get a better idea of the thing and he made it out so simple anybody can hang by his knees that I said all right I would go up on the cradle and catch the kid This cradle is composed of two steel bars about a foot apart that are held rigid by tackle and wire braces You climb to it after emptying your pockets by a swinging ladder none too secure and seated here look down as from the dome of a circus tent On a line with you are other cradles where your partners are coolly preparing to do things You glance across at them anxiously then down at the net which seems a long way beneath Better put some rosin on your hands sings out Potter from the ground where he is arranging the mechanic lines It s in that little bag on the wire calls the boy from his perch Rub it along your wrists too we ll ketch better H m We will eh I do as I am told and realize that even the trifling movement to get this rosin bag involves a certain peril Now lean back comes the word catch one bar in the crotch of your knees and brace your feet under the other That s right Hang way down Stretch your arms out and when I say Now pull up and reach for the kid you ll see him coming Sure enough although the blood was in my head I could see over there Tom Potter s red shirt and the boy s blue one as they poised for the swing Then Tom s body dropped back and he swept the lad at full arm s length through a half circle and let him go head first cutting the air straight at me Now cried Harry and I reached out as best I could only to see the boy a second later floundering in the net below me And they all were laughing In trying to reach one way I had actually reached the other and withdrawn my arms instead of extending them which made me understand better than an hour of words that a man hanging head down at a height finds his muscles as hard to control as a penman writing with his left hand for the first time He cannot even see straight until his eyes learn to gage distances and the relation of things presented upside down With some pains and an awkward clutching at the braces I got myself back into a sitting position while Roy climbed again good naturedly to his starting cradle A trapeze performer must have infinite patience Again we tried the trick and this time as I hung expectant I felt my wrists clutched tight and there was the agile leaper swinging back pendulum fashion from my arms then forward then back while the bar strained under my knees Now throw him called Harry Stiffen out and chuck him back to Tom Now Alas I made a bungle of it I could not give him send enough and the boy falling short of Tom s arms dangled from the mechanic lines half way down to the net It was quite plain that more than good intentions are needed to chuck young gentlemen through flights of eighteen feet I was feeling decidedly queer by this time a sort of half way over the Channel faintness and could imagine what it must be to work up here right at the peak of a big top tent under the scorch of an August sun with the stifle of a great audience coming up from below I expressed a readiness to descend Try a drop into the net suggested Tom Potter See hang by your hands like this Keep your legs together and lift em out stiff Then Down he went and landed easily on his shoulders Better put the mechanic on him said Harry and presently young Roy was beside me on the cradle securing me to the drop lines with a double hitch You want to be sure to lift yer legs he remarked I knew a feller that struck the net straight on his feet and broke his knees Don t you worry said Harry if you don t fall right I ll hold you with the mechanic Of course when a man has started at this sort of thing he must see it through so I hung obediently by my hands lifted my legs and Now cried Harry and instantly before I had time to think or note sensations I was on my back in the net And I understood what a terrible problem it is for a gymnast falling with such swiftness to turn two or three somersaults in the air and land with the body at just the angle of safety for a shade too much one way may mean a broken leg and a shade too much the other way an injured spine For some time after my aerial experience I sat around rather limp and white giving but indifferent attention to the breaking in of young Clarence Potter baby of the family now in his first fortnight s practising He certainly showed a game spirit this little fellow When his father said Jump he jumped and when the call came for a forward somersault across and a half turn he went at it like a veteran though his wrists must have burned with red chafes where they caught him Of course he had the mechanic on all the time We have to handle him very careful said his father he s so limber It wouldn t take much to break his back But he ll harden up soon People have an idea that gymnasts are supple jointed That s all nonsense A gymnast won t bend as much as an ordinary business man There are too many bunches of muscles all over him that keep him stiff See feel along here He prodded my hand into his back and sides Not big muscles mind but lots of small ones Say it s a fine thing to have your body trained I don t believe there s a healthier Hey there Keep those legs together Easy now Good boy The little fellow had made a pretty turn and drop to the net and was striding along its meshes beaming at the praise He ll make a gymnast said Potter because he s got a head on him and can fix his mind on what he s doing Oh it takes more than body to make a great acrobat It takes brains for one thing and heart I believe I ll be able to train that boy so he can do a triple I mean do it not get through it in a Lord help me way Most people say a triple can t be done for a regular act because it s too uncertain and too dangerous But they used to say that of a double It s all a matter of taking time enough in the practice That s the thing practice Why look at us We don t open for months yet but we re up here every morning all through the winter getting our act down so fine and the time so perfect that when summer comes we can t fail How do you mean getting the time perfect Why in trapeze work everything depends on judging time Just now when you were hanging from the cradle you couldn t see much could you Well we can t either We have to know when to do things by feeling the time they take Say it s a long double swing where the men cross and change bars Each man grabs or lets go at the second or part of a second when the watch inside him says it s time to grab or let go That s the only watch he has and it s the only one he needs And he dives by the sense of time That s right And does triple somersaults by the sense of time Certainly he does He can t see What could you see falling and whirling A gymnast has no different eyes from any other man He s got to feel how long he must keep on turning And it s good by gymnast if his feeling is a quarter of a second out of the way Do you mean that literally mister Potter smiled I ll give you a case and you can judge for yourself There was a fellow named Johnnie Howard in the Barnum show He was doing trapeze work with the famous Dunham family and was very ambitious to equal Dunham in all his feats which was a large contract for Dunham is about the finest gymnast in the world What a pretty triple he can do clean down from the top of the tent and land right every time Well Howard he kept trying triples and sometimes he got em about right and sometimes he didn t Dunham told him he d better stick to doubles until he d had more practice but Howard wouldn t have it and he kept right on Prob ly he thought Dunham was jealous of him Anyhow he tried a triple one night at Chicago in the Coliseum and that was the last triple he ever did try He misjudged his time by a quarter of a turn that is he turned three somersaults and a quarter instead of just three and struck the net so that he twisted his spinal column and he died a few weeks later That last quarter of a turn killed him and it probably didn t take over a tenth of a second Here was something to think about Precision of movement to tenths of a second with no guidance but a man s own intuition of time and a life depending on it Can a man regulate the speed of his turning while he is in the air Certainly he can That s the first thing you learn If you want to turn faster you tuck up your knees and bend your head so the chin almost touches your breast If you want to turn slower you stretch out your legs and straighten up your head The main thing is your head Whichever way you point that your body will follow In our act we do a long drop from the top of the tent where you shoot straight down head first for fifty or sixty feet and never move a muscle until you are two feet over the net Then you duck your head everlastingly quick and land on your shoulders I asked mister Potter how long a drop would be possible for a gymnast He thought a hundred feet might be done by a man of unusual nerve but he pointed out that the peril increases enormously with every twenty feet you add say to a drop of forty feet When you have dropped sixty feet you are falling thirty five miles an hour when you have dropped eighty feet you are falling nearly sixty miles an hour And so on It seemed incredible that a man shooting down head first at such velocity would wait before turning until only two feet separated him from the net Illustration CIRCUS PROFESSIONALS PRACTISING A FEAT OF BALANCING It can t be said I that in one of these straight drops a gymnast is guided only by his sense of time Potter hesitated a moment You mean that he uses his eyes to know when to turn I guess he does a little although it is mostly sense of time You wouldn t get a man to do it blindfolded I suggested Not a straight drop no but a drop with somersaults yes What two somersaults down to the net blindfolded Yes sir that would be easy I tell you a man s eyes don t help him when he s turning in the air Why Tom and I would throw that boy of mine Royetta across from one to the other he turning doubles just the same whether he was blindfolded or not It wouldn t make any difference I ll tell you another thing he continued that may surprise you It s possible for a fine gymnast to swing from a bar say sixty feet above the net turn a back somersault what we call a cast somersault then shoot straight down head first for thirty feet and then tuck up and turn a forward somersault landing on his shoulders I couldn t do it myself ever since I got hurt down in Mexico but Tom Hanlon could I mention this to show what control a man can get over his body in the air He can make it turn one way then go straight and then turn the other way After proper expression of wonder at this statement I asked mister Potter if something might not go wrong with this wonderful automatic time machine that a gymnast carries within himself Of course there might he said and that is why there is such need of practice Let a man neglect his trapeze for a couple of months and he would be almost like a beginner And even the best gymnasts he admitted men in the pink of training are liable to sudden and unaccountable disturbances of mind or heart that make them for the moment unequal to their most familiar feats I ll tell you what accounts for the death of most gymnasts he went on It s changing their minds while they re in the air That s what we call it but it s only a name Nobody knows just what happens when a gymnast changes his mind I mean what happens inside him What happens outside is that he s usually killed Now there was Billy Batcheller He was a fine leaper and could do his two somersaults over four elephants or eight horses with the prettiest lift you ever saw He could do it easy But one day we were showing out west with the Reynolds circus as he came down the leaping run he struck the board wrong somehow and in the turn he changed his mind instead of doing a double he did one and a half and shot over the last horse straight for the ground head first One second more and he was a dead man he would have broken his neck sure but I saw him coming and caught him so with my right arm took all the skin off under his chin and left the print of my hand on his breast for weeks But it saved him And the queer thing was he never could explain it none of them ever can he just changed his mind So did Ladell who used to do doubles from high bars down to a pedestal He made his leap one night just as usual it was at Toronto in eighteen ninety six I think and as he turned he changed his mind and I forget how he landed but it killed him all right Did you ever have an experience of this kind yourself I asked Not exactly he answered and I m thankful I haven t but I came near it once in Chicago It was the night after Howard got hurt and I guess fear just plain every day fear was at the bottom of my feeling My wife and I were doing an act sixty feet above the ground and without a net I would hang by my hands from a couple of loops at the top of the Coliseum and she would hang head down from my feet her ankles locked across mine just a natural locking of the feet with no fastenings and only ordinary performing shoes When I had her that way a man below would pull a drag rope and get us swinging higher and higher until finally we would come right up to a horizontal I tell you it was a hair raising thing to see but until this night I had never thought much about the danger I thought of it now though as I remembered Howard s fall and I got so nervous for my wife that I felt sure something terrible was going to happen I was just about in the state where a man starts his act and can t go through with it where he changes his mind And you ll be surprised to hear what gave me heart to go on What was it It was the music sir and ever since that night I ve understood why some generals send their soldiers into battle with bands playing As we stood by the dressing room entrance waiting to go on it seemed as if I couldn t do it but when I heard the crash of that circus band calling us and came out into the glare of light and heard the applause just roars of it why I forgot everything except the pride of my business and up we went net or no net and we never did our toe swing better than that night Just the same I d had my warning and I soon got another act instead of that one and He hesitated Well sir to day I wouldn t take my wife up and do that toe swing the way we used to not for a million dollars And yet she s crazy to do it IV SOME REMARKABLE FALLS AND NARROW ESCAPES OF FAMOUS ATHLETES AS we finished our talk mister Potter asked me to call some evening at their rooms on Tenth Street and see a family of trapeze performers in private life I was glad to accept this invitation and looked in upon them a day or two later Like the other figures in these studies of thrilling lives they presented a modest simple picture in their home circle There is nothing in the externals of lion tamers steeple climbers divers balloonists or gymnasts to betray their unusual calling Nor is there any heroic sign in eye or voice or bearing They are plain unpretentious folk for the most part who do these things and say little about them In one room were Tom and Royetta playing checkers while Clarence the kid weary no doubt from the morning s practice lay on a bed storing up resistance against the next day s shoots and twisters In a room adjoining were mister Potter himself and missus Potter enjoying the call of a lady acrobat one of the famed Livingstons trick bicyclists As soon as was fitting I put the old question to mister Potter the question that always interests me how it happened that he became a gymnast and he went back to his Western boyhood and the early longings that possessed him to be a performer in the air Plainly he was born with the gymnast instinct and he ran away from home to follow his heart s desire Then he told us how at seventeen he was traveling with a ten cent show doing a single trapeze act in the ring and an out of door free exhibition of tight rope walking from canvas top to ground Once he went at a difficult feat so eagerly he was always his own teacher that he fell clean off a trapeze sixty feet above ground and by some kind providence that watches over boys escaped serious injury Illustration It s queer about falls said mister Potter It s often the little ones that kill Now there I fell sixty feet and you might say it didn t hurt me at all Another time showing in Yucatan I fell only forty feet and smashed two ribs And the worst fall I ever had was fifteen feet at the Olympia in London I was driving four horses in a tandem race and was thrown straight on my head That time I nearly broke my neck Twenty five feet is my best fall put in missus Potter smiling I was doing an act on the flying rings and one of em broke Remember that Harry His face showed how well he remembered it Perhaps you won t believe this he said but when I saw her falling I couldn t move I was tending her in the ring and wasn t ten feet from where she struck I could have caught her and saved her if my legs would only have moved But there they were frozen sir and I just had to stand still and see my wife come down smash on her head Pretty tough wasn t it She lay unconscious for two days that was at Monette Missouri Oh yes I remember it I asked missus Potter if she had ever been afraid and she shook her head Never once not even at Chicago in the perilous toe swing when even the other gymnasts told her she would certainly be killed She knew her husband would hold her safe and she really enjoyed that toe swing more than any act they ever did I ll tell you this though she admitted I would be afraid to do these things with any one except my husband Yes and I d be afraid to have her added Potter Why down in Mexico when I broke my ribs there was a man a fine gymnast too who offered to take my place so we wouldn t lose our salary but every time I saw him practice with my wife it made me so nervous I called it off and let the salary go In spite of these manifest hazards Potter insists that there is no healthier life than a gymnast leads We never are ill he said we never take cold we travel through all sorts of fever stricken countries and never catch anything and we always feel good Look at that boy of mine He s seventeen years old and he s got a chest on him like a man Thirty eight inches is what it measures Why I can t find a coat that ll fit him He went on to point out some plain advantages in addition to health that ordinary citizens might derive from a moderate knowledge of trapeze work In a fire for instance a man so trained would have little difficulty in saving himself and others by climbing and swinging And firemen themselves would double their efficiency by regular practice on high bars Again in case of a runaway a man familiar with the trapeze knows how and when to spring for the bridle of a plunging horse Or should he find himself almost under the wheels of a trolley car he could leap for the platform rail and swing up to safety I ll give you a case said Potter where the training we get helped a good deal It was a season when I was working with the Barnum outfit we were showing in the East and during the hippodrome races a little girl got away from her people somehow and the first thing anybody knew there she was out on the track with three four horse chariots not a hundred feet off and coming on a dead run As the crowd saw the child they gave a great Uff in fear and lots of women screamed It wasn t in human power to stop those horses and it seemed as if the little tot must be killed She was about half way across the track when I started for her Lots of men would have started just as I did but very few would have gone at just the right angle to save her Most men would have tried to run straight across but I was sure the horses would trample me and the child too if I tried that So I took her on a slant running across and away from the horses and I caught her little body as a gymnast knows how didn t waste any time at it and then hoo we were over with the breath of those horses on our necks If it hadn t been for the practice I ve had judging time and distance we d both have been killed that trip I come now to another occasion when I spent two profitable hours with the saint Belmos husband and wife who for years past and in many parts of the world have appeared in a trapeze act that calls for the greatest nerve and precision of movement As a climax to this act saint Belmo makes a leap and swing of forty feet over his audience springing head first through a circle of knives and fire that barely lets his body pass then catching a suspended trapeze that breaks away at his touch and carries him on in a long sweep then leaping again feet first from this flying bar through a paper balloon where he holds by his arms and drops swiftly thirty five feet to the ground I was surprised to find the hero of this perilous feat rather the reverse of athletic in appearance saint Belmo struck me as a pale thin almost sickly man Yet I judge it would fare ill with any one who tried to impose upon him as an invalid Over that spare form are hard tireless muscles and for years to come saint Belmo feels equal to leaping this obstacle of blades and flame Most people I suppose in watching this act would imagine the knives to be of wood and tinsel but I saw that they were of steel and sharp heavy double edged knives a foot long murderous weapons made by saint Belmo himself out of old saws And fifteen of these with points turned inward form the heart through which this gaunt yet rather genial gymnast shoots his way Illustration THROUGH A PAPER BALLOON AT THE END OF A GREAT FEAT I asked saint Belmo about the accidents that he had suffered Had he ever struck the knives when leaping through Yes again and again He had torn his clothes to tatters on them and lined his body with scars But that was years ago when he was learning Now he never touched the knives He could leap through them eyes shut as surely as a man puts a spoon in his mouth without striking his teeth How about falls in the air Well he remembered two in particular one at Syracuse where he missed the trapeze because some one was careless in fastening a snap hook that held it and when he came through the blades and flames head first and reached for the bar the bar had swung away and he plunged on smash down to the ground and broke both legs Didn t you look for the bar before you made the leap I questioned He shook his head I never see the bar for the dazzle of fire I know where it must be and leap for that place If it isn t there why He pointed down to his legs and smiled ruefully He had another fall at Seattle where he came down thirty five feet and put both his knees out of joint all because he was thinking of something else as he shot toward the balloon and forgot to throw out his arms and catch in the hoop It was exactly the case of a man who might walk over the edge of a housetop through absent mindedness Ever have a feeling of fear I asked I don t know as you d call it fear exactly he began Yes it was fear too put in his wife teasing I ve seen your knees shake so up on the pedestal that you almost tumbled off No wonder my knees shook protested saint Belmo they ve been out of joint times enough Naturally after an accident you feel a little queer for a while but I ll own up there was once I felt afraid and it wasn t long ago either I know said his wife up at the Twenty second Regiment Armory That s right it was in December Remember when that bicycle diver was killed His name was Stark Poor chap He was a friend of ours and we were there when it happened You know he got too much speed on the incline and struck the far edge of the tank instead of the water That was in the afternoon and the same night we had to go on and do our act I looked at that tank and then I said Boys I m leary about this but I m going to do my act I ll come down somehow boys you watch me Honest I thought I was going to be killed but I got through all right Then he explained that the greatest danger in his act is neither at the knives nor at the balloon but in the swift drop after the balloon with the hoop under his arms This hoop as it goes down winds up a spring overhead that acts as a break on the fall though a very slight one Just before saint Belmo reaches the floor he lifts his arms above the hoop and drops through it to the ground but he must do that at precisely the right moment or he will suffer accident If he drops through too soon he will strike too hard and may break his legs If he does not drop through soon enough the hoop may jerk his arms out of the sockets And in spite of this formidable alternative saint Belmo assured me that for more than a dozen years now he has made this drop continually and never failed once Think of a calling that requires a man to steer perpetually by the closest fraction of a shave between a pair of broken legs and a pair of dislocated arms Fancy such an alternative as part of the regular after dinner routine And then consider what marvelous precision must be in these bodies and minds of ours when a man can face such a hazard for years and never come to grief THE WILD BEAST TAMER I WE VISIT A QUEER RESORT FOR CIRCUS PEOPLE AND TALK WITH A TRAINER OF ELEPHANTS WELL down on Fourth Avenue below the bird fanciers the rat catchers the antique shops and the dingy hotels where lion tamers put up is Billy s place the great rendezvous of the country for circus folk and here any afternoon or evening especially in the dull winter time you may find heroes of the flying trapeze bereft of show ring trappings playing monotonous euchre with keepers of the cages or sitting in convivial and reminiscent groups that include everything from the high salaried star down to some humble tooter in the band at present looking for a job All kinds of acrobats come to Billy s all kinds of animal men everybody who has to do with a show barring the owners If a Norwegian wrestler wants to get track of an Egyptian giant he goes to Billy s If an elephant trainer needs a new helper he goes to Billy s It is at once a club a haven a post office and a general intelligence bureau for members of this wandering and fascinating profession It was my fortune recently to spend an evening at Billy s and I had as companion a veteran circus man able to explain things After taking in the externals which were commonplace enough save for big top celebrities ranged along the walls in tiers of photographs we sat us down where a man in a blue shirt was telling how a lioness and three cubs got out of a cage somewhere one afternoon just after the performance It seems one of the cubs had been playing with a loose bolt and the first thing anybody knew there they were all four of them skipping about free in the menagerie tent The story detailed various efforts to get the lioness back into her cage prodding lassoing shouting and the total failure of these because she would neither leave her cubs nor let them be taken from her Finally the situation grew serious for the evening performance was coming on and it was quite sure there would be no audience with an uncaged lioness on the premises So it became a matter of business in this wise a lioness worth a few hundred dollars against an audience worth a couple of thousand Word was sent to the head of the show and back came the order Kill her In vain the keeper pleaded for one more trial he would risk a hand to hand struggle with hot irons The head of the show said No the lioness was desperate and he wouldn t have his men expose their lives It was a case of Shoot her and do it quick Of course that settled it they did shoot her and as the blue shirted man described the execution I was impressed by his tenderness in speaking of that poor defiant mother and then of the three little cubs that howled for her a whole month sir and looked so sad it made us boys feel like murderers blamed if it didn t Illustration HOW THE LIONESS WAS CAPTURED ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE Another man with steely gray eyes and a stubble of beard ventured the opinion that they must have had a pretty poor quality of gumption in that outfit or somebody would have got the lioness into her cage He was mighty sure George Conklin would have done it George was over in Europe now handling big cats for the Barnum show There wasn t anything George didn t know about lions Why I ll give you a case said he We were showing out in Kansas and one night a cage fell off the circus train became unlashed or something as she swung round a curve and when we stuck our heads out of the sleeper there were a pair of greenish burning eyes coming down the side of the track and we could hear a ruh ruh r r r ruh something between a bark and a roar that didn t cheer us up any you d better believe Then George Conklin yelled By the Lord it s Mary Come on boys we must get her and out we went Mary was a full grown lioness and she was loose there in the darkness out on a bare prairie without a house or a fence anywhere for miles Hold on said I how did your circus train happen to stop when the cage fell off With indulgent smile he explained that a circus train running at night always has guards on the watch who wave quick lanterns to the engineer in any emergency Well continued the man George Conklin had that cage fixed up and the lioness safe inside within forty minutes by the clock Do Why it was easy enough We unrolled about a hundred yards of side wall wall tenting and carried it toward the lioness It was a line of men holding up a length of canvas so that it formed a long moving fence And every man carried a flaming kerosene torch There was a picture to remember that line of heads over the canvas wall and the flaring lights gradually circling around the lioness who backed growling and switching her tail backed away from the fire until presently as we closed in we had her in the mouth of a funnel of canvas with torches everywhere except just at her back where the open cage was Then Conklin spoke sharp to her just as if they were in the ring and snapped his whip and the next thing Miss Mary was safe behind the bars It was a pretty neat job I can tell you During this talk a broad shouldered man had joined the group and my companion whispered that he was Bill Newman the famous elephant trainer mister Newman at once showed an interest in the discussion and agreed that there are times when you can do nothing with an animal but kill it Now there was old Albert said he a fine ten foot tusker that I d seen grow up from a baby and I was fond of him too but I had to kill him It was in eighty five and we were showing in New Hampshire Albert had been cranky for a long time never with me but with the other men and in Nashua he slammed a keeper against the ground so hard that he died the next morning just as we were coming into Keene That settled it and at the afternoon performance mister Hutchinson announced in the ring that we had an elephant on our hands under sentence of death and he was willing to turn this elephant over to the local rifle corps if they felt equal to the execution You see he had heard there was a company of sharpshooters in Keene and it struck him this was a good way to be rid of a bad elephant and get some advertising at the same time Well those Keene riflemen weren t going to be bluffed by a showman They said to bring on the elephant and they d take care of him So after the performance I led old Albert back to a piece of woods behind the tents and we hitched tackle to his four legs and stretched him out between four trees so he couldn t move and then the rifle corps lined up about twelve paces off ready to shoot That elephant knew he was going to die yes sir he knew it perfectly well but he was a lot cooler than some of those riflemen Why there was one fellow on the end of the line shaking so he could hardly aim You see they were afraid old Albert would break loose and come at em if they only wounded him Do you men know where to shoot I called out We re going to shoot at his head answered the captain All right said I you d better send for lanterns and more ammunition You re liable to be shooting here all night Then where shall we shoot asked the captain That depends I answered If you can send your bullets straight into his eye at a forty five degree up slant you ll fix him all right But if you don t hit his eye you can shoot the rest of his head full of holes and he won t care You ve got to reach his brain and that s a little thing in where I m telling you This made the captain do some thinking for Albert looked awful big and his eye looked awful small and they didn t want to bungle the job Well said he is there any other place we can aim at except his eye Aim here I told him and I drew a circle with a piece of chalk just back of his left foreleg a circle about as big as your hand When a man has cut up as many elephants as I have he knows where the heart is But most men don t After this there was a hush while the whole crowd held its breath and old Albert looked at me out of his little eyes as much as to say So you re going to let em do me after all are you and then came the sharp command Ready fire and thirty two rifle balls started for that chalk mark And how many do you think got there Five out of thirty two I counted em but five did the business Poor old Albert dropped without a sound or a struggle Newman sighed at the memory Isn t there some exaggeration I asked in what you said about shooting an elephant full of holes without killing him Exaggeration answered Newman Not a bit of it Why there was an elephant named Samson with the Cole show and he got loose once in a town out in Idaho and ran through the streets crazy mad killing horses smashing into houses ripping the whole place wide open Well sir they shot at him with Winchesters revolvers shot guns every darned thing they had until that elephant was full of lead but he went off all right the next day and never seemed any the worse for it up to the day when he was burned to death with the Barnum show at Bridgeport The mention of this catastrophe reminded me of reports that wild beasts in a burning menagerie are silent before the flames and I asked mister Newman if he believed it No sir said he it isn t true I was in Bridgeport when the Barnum show burned up and I never heard such roaring and screaming It was awful Even the rhinoceros which can t make much noise was running around the yard grunting and squealing with flames four feet high shooting up from his back and sides You see a rhinoceros is almost solid fat and as soon as he caught fire he burned like an oil tank Didn t you save any lions or tigers He shook his head Wasn t any use trying They d have been shot by policemen as fast as we could get em out Besides we couldn t get em out We concentrated on elephants and saved all the herd but five There were free elephants all over Bridgeport that night and a queer thing was we had to look sharp that some of the elephants we d saved didn t run back into the fire You know how horses will go back into a burning stable Well elephants are just the same That s how we lost the white elephant She walked straight into the blaze when she might just as well have walked out through the open door By this time most of the company at Billy s had gathered about to listen for Newman was a veteran among veterans and was now in the full swing of reminiscence He went back to his earliest days back to Putnam County New York where young men might well be drawn to the circus life so many famous showmen has this region produced Jim Kelly and Seth B Howes and Langway and the Baileys I started with Langway the old lion tamer said Newman and he was one of the best I ll never forget what he told me once when he was breaking in a den of lions and tigers there were three lions and two tigers all full grown and fresh from the jungle Bill said he I m an old man and this here is my last den I won t break in no more big cats but I ll break this den in so they ll never work for another man after I m gone It ll look easy what I do and folks ll want you to tackle em Bill but don t you never do it for if you do these cats ll chew ye up sure Illustration MAN IN CAGE WITH LIONS Well he worked that den in great shape for a year or so and then he died and I minded his words I let those lions and tigers alone They hired a lion tamer named Davis to work em and sure enough he got chewed up bad just as the old man said he would and the end of it was that nobody ever did work that den again it couldn t be done although they d been like kittens with Langway What he did to em s always been a mystery Newman paused as impressive story tellers do and then drawing once more upon his memories he told how a terrible death came to poor Patsy Meagher as he was drilling a herd of elephants once in winter quarters at Columbus Ohio It was the day before Thanksgiving he said I ll never forget it and a big bull elephant named Syd took the order wrong went right face instead of left face or something and Patsy got mad and hooked him pretty hard Some think it was Patsy s fault because he gave the wrong order by mistake and Syd did what he said while the other elephants did the thing he meant to say Anyhow Syd turned on Patsy and let him have both tusks brass balls and all right through the body Killed him in half a minute Why sir they took Patsy s watch out through his back That s the sort of thing you re liable to run up against Did they kill Syd I asked No they gave him the benefit of the doubt You see it ain t square to blame an elephant for obeying orders Then came the story of how they killed bad old Pilot at the Madison Square Garden back in eighteen eighty three fought his hard spirit all night long with clubs and pitchforks and prods and hot irons one hundred men flaying and jabbing in relays against a poor bound animal that died rather than yield died without a sound as day was breaking Yes sir said Newman he never squealed he wouldn t squeal and three minutes before he died he nearly killed me with a swing of his trunk Oh he was game all right Pilot was Newman came back to the difficulty of working animals broken in by another tamer but he declared that the thing can be done in some cases if the new tamer has in him that unknown something to which all wild beasts submit His own wife for example after a dozen years of peaceful married life determined one day that she would make a herd of eight big Asiatic elephants obey her a thing no woman had ever attempted And within three weeks she did it and drilled the herd in public for years afterward in fact became a greater star than her husband All of which was most unusual and due entirely to her exceptional nerve and physical power Why sir said Newman proudly she was six feet tall and built like an athlete She she only died a few years ago and and That gulp and the catch in his voice told the whole story This was no longer a dauntless elephant trainer but a stricken heart broken man What now were glories of the ring to him his wife was dead II METHODS OF LION TAMERS AND THE STORY OF BRUTUS S ATTACK ON mister BOSTOCK THE wild beast tamer as generally pictured is a mysterious person who stalks about sternly in high boots and possesses a remarkable power of the eye that makes lions and tigers quail at his look and shrink away He rules by fear and the crack of his whip is supposed to bring memories of torturing points and red hot irons Such is the story book lion tamer and I may as well say at once that outside of story books he has small existence There is scarcely any truth in this theory of hate for hate and conquest by fear It is no more fear that makes a lion walk on a ball than it is fear that makes a horse pull a wagon It is habit The lion is perfectly willing to walk on the ball and he has reached that mind not by cruel treatment but by force of his trainer s patience and kindness and superior intelligence Illustration BEGINNING THE TRAINING Of course a wild beast tamer should have a quick eye and a delicate sense of hearing so that he may be warned of a sudden spring at him or a rush from behind and it is important that he be a sober man for alcohol breaks the nerve or gives a false courage worse than folly but the quality on which he must chiefly rely and which alone can make him a great tamer not a second rate bungler is a genuine fondness for his animals This does not mean that the animals will necessarily be fond of the tamer some will be fond of him some will be indifferent to him some will fear and hate him Nor will the tamer s fondness protect him from fang and claw We shall see that there is danger always accident often but without the fondness there would be greater danger and more frequent accident A fondness for lions and tigers gives sympathy for them sympathy gives understanding of them and understanding gives mastery of them or as much mastery as is possible What but this fondness would keep a tamer constantly with his animals not only in the public show the easiest part but in the dens and treacherous runway in the strange night hours in the early morning romp when no one is looking when there is no reason for being with them except the tamer s own joy in it I do not purpose now to present in detail the methods of taming wild beasts rather what happens after they are tamed but I may say that a lion tamer always begins by spending weeks or months in gaining a new animal s confidence Day after day he will stand for a long time outside the cage merely looking at the lion talking to him impressing upon the beast a general familiarity with his voice and person And each time as he goes away he is careful to toss in a piece of meat as a pleasant memento of his visit Illustration COMING TO CLOSE QUARTERS Later he ventures inside the bars carrying some simple weapon a whip a rod perhaps a broom which is more formidable than might be supposed through the jab of its sharp bristles One tamer used a common chair with much success against unbroken lions If the creature came at him there were the four legs in his face and soon the chair came to represent boundless power to that ignorant lion He feared it and hated it as was seen on one occasion when the tamer left it in the cage and the lion promptly tore it into splinters Illustration THE LION DESTROYS THE CHAIR Days may pass before the lion will let his tamer do more than merely stay inside the cage at a distance Very well the tamer stays there He waits hour after hour week after week until a time comes when the lion will let him move nearer will permit the touch of his hand will come forward for a piece of meat and at last treat him like a friend so that finally he may sit there quite at ease and even read his newspaper as one man did Lastly begins the practice of tricks the lion must spring to a pedestal and be fed he must jump from one pedestal to another and be fed must keep a certain pose and be fed A bit of meat is always the final argument and the tamer wins if he wins at all for sometimes he fails by patience and kindness There is no use getting angry with a lion said a well known tamer to me and there is no use in carrying a revolver If you shoot a lion or injure him with any weapon it is your loss for you must buy another lion and the chances are that he will kill you anyway if he starts to do it The thing is to keep him from starting I once had a talk with the lion tamer Philadelphia on the subject of breaking lions and heard from him what need a tamer has of patience I have sat in a lion s cage said Philadelphia two or three hours every day for weeks yes for months waiting for him to come out of his sulky corner and take a piece of meat from me And that was only a start toward the mastery Wouldn t he attack you Philadelphia smiled He did at first but that was soon settled It isn t hard to best a lion if you go at it right I usually carry a pair of clubs Some men prefer a broom because the bristles do great work in a lion s face without injuring him But the finest weapon you can use against a fighting lion is a hose of water That stops his fight only you mustn t have the water too cold or he may get pneumonia You mightn t think it but lions are very delicate In using the clubs you must be careful not to strike em hard across the back You d be surprised to know how easy it is to break a lion s backbone especially if it s a young lion Illustration THE TAMER S TRIUMPH READING HIS NEWSPAPER IN THE LION S CAGE In support of this statement that lions are delicate I remember hearing old John Smith director of the Central Park Menagerie set forth a list of lions ailments and the coddling and doctoring they require Lion medicine is usually administered in the food or drink but there are cases requiring more heroic measures and then the animal must be bound down before the doctors can treat him It should be remembered that lions in city menageries are more dangerous than circus lions since they are either wild ones brought straight from the jungle and never tamed or rebellious ones anarchist lions that have turned against their tamers perhaps killed them and have finally been sold to any zooelogical garden that would take them When we have to rope a lion down to doctor him said Smith we drop nooses through the top bars and catch his four legs and let down one around his body Then we haul these fast and there you are You can feel his pulse or give him stuff or pull out one of his teeth or anything It must be pretty hard to pull a lion s tooth I remarked Not very Here s the forceps I use you see it isn t very big This is for the upper jaw and that other one is for the lower jaw I made some remark meant to be facetious about not giving lions gas but the old man took me up sharply Certainly we give em gas How else in the world do you think we operate on em They get chloroform same as a person I have a bag for it that fits over a lion s head and pulls up tight with a string In the bag is a sponge saturated with chloroform and the first you know off goes mister Lion into quiet sleep and you can do what you like with him But you have to be mighty careful not to give him too much and look sharp at his heart action or you ll have a dead lion on your hands Say I ve found out one thing chloroforming lions that lots of doctors don t know It s this that if a lion comes back hard to consciousness after you ve put him to sleep you can help things along by catching hold of his tail and heaving him up on his head That sends the blood down to his brain where you want it and pretty soon you ll see his muscles begin to twitch and back he comes I told a doctor about this once and he said he d done the very same thing with patients Coming again to the need of patience let me quote my friend Bill Newman Why said he I ve spent weeks and weeks teaching an elephant to ring a bell just that one thing You have to sit by him hour after hour giving him the bell in his trunk and giving it to him again when he drops it and then again and again for a whole morning and then for many mornings until he gets the idea and rings it right It s the same way teaching an elephant to fan himself or teaching tricks to a clown elephant you have to wait and wait and never give up Once an elephant understands what you want he ll do it but it s awful hard sometimes making em understand How do you teach them to stand on their heads and on their hind legs I asked With the same kind of patience and with tackle Just heave em up or roll em over the way they re supposed to go and then keep at it Some learn quicker than others Once in a while you get a mean one and then look out An instance of the affection felt for wild beasts by their tamers is offered in the case of Madame Bianca the French tamer who in the winter of nineteen hundred was with the Bostock Wild Animal Show giving daily exhibitions in Baltimore where her skill and daring with lions and tigers earned wide admiration It will be remembered how fire descended suddenly on this menagerie one night and destroyed the animals amid fearful scenes And in the morning Bianca stood in the ruins and looked upon the charred bodies of her pets Had she lost her dearest friends she could scarcely have shown deeper grief She was in despair and declared that she would never tame another group she would leave the show business And when the menagerie was stocked afresh with lions and tigers Bianca would not go near their cages These were lions indeed but not her lions and she shook her head and mourned for Bowzer the handsomest lioness in captivity and Spitfire and Juliette and the black maned Brutus This recalls a story that mister Bostock told me showing how Bianca s fondness for her lions persisted even in the face of fierce attack It was in Kansas City and for some days Spitfire had been working badly so that on this particular afternoon Bianca had spent two hours in the big exhibition cage trying to get the lioness into good form But Spitfire remained sullen and refused to do one perfectly easy thing a jump over a pedestal Ask mister Bostock to please come here called Bianca finally quite at her wit s end with the performance hour approaching and hers the chief act To go on with Spitfire in rebellion would never do for the spirit of mischief spreads among lions and tigers exactly as it spreads among children Spitfire must jump over that pedestal mister Bostock arrived presently and at once entered the cage carrying two whips as is the custom There is something in this man that impresses animals and tamers alike It is not only that he is big and strong and loves his animals and does not fear them that would scarcely account for his extraordinary prestige which is his rather because he knows lions and tigers as only a man can who has literally spent his life with them From father and grandfather he has inherited precious and unusual lore of the cages He was born in a menagerie he married the daughter of a menagerie owner he sleeps always within a few feet of the dens he eats with roars of lions in his ears And his principle is and always has been that he will enter any cage at any time if a real need calls him which has led to many a situation like that created now by Spitfire s disobedience There were many groups in the menagerie at this time each with its regular tamer and while Bostock as owner and director watched over all of them it often happened that months would pass without his putting foot inside this or that particular cage And in the present case he was practically a stranger to the four lions and the tiger now ranged around on their pedestals in a semi circle thirty feet in diameter with big Brutus in the middle and snarling Spitfire at one end Well said mister Bostock explaining what happened I saw that Bianca had made a mistake in handling Spitfire from too great a distance She had stood about seven feet away so I stepped three feet closer and lifted one of my whips There were just two things Spitfire could do she could spring at me and have trouble or she could jump over the pedestal and have no trouble She growled a little looked at me and then she jumped over that pedestal like a lady I had called her bluff Illustration BIANCA RESCUES BOSTOCK FROM BRUTUS The rest was easy I put her through some other tricks circled her around the cage a couple of times and brought her back to her corner Then as she crouched there and snarled at me I played a tattoo with my whip handle on the floor just in front of her It was just a sort of flourish to finish off with and it was one thing too much for in doing this I turned quite away from the rest of the group and made Brutus think that I meant to hurt the lioness He said to himself Hullo Here s a stranger in our cage taking a whip to Spitfire I ll just settle him And before I could move he sprang twenty feet off his pedestal set his fangs in my thigh and dragged me over to Bianca as if to prove his gallantry Then the Frenchwoman did a clever thing she clasped her arms around his big neck drew his head up and fired her revolver close to his ear Of course she fired only a blank cartridge but it brought Brutus to obedience for that was Bianca s regular signal in the act for the lions to take their pedestals and the habit of his work was so strong in the old fellow that he dropped me and jumped back to his place There wasn t any more to it except that I lay five weeks in bed with my wounds But this will show you how Bianca loved those lions she wouldn t let me lift a hand to punish Brutus Of course I called for irons as soon as I got up and wounded or not I would have taught mister Brutus a few things before I left that cage if I could have had my way But Bianca pleaded for him so hard why she actually cried that I hadn t the heart to go against her She said it was partly my own fault for turning my back which was true and that Brutus was a good lion and had only tried to defend his mate and a lot more with tears and teasing until I let him off although I knew I could never enter Brutus s cage again after leaving it without showing myself master That s always the way with lions if you once lose the upper hand you can never get it back III BONAVITA DESCRIBES HIS FIGHT WITH SEVEN LIONS AND GEORGE ARSTINGSTALL TELLS HOW HE CONQUERED A MAD ELEPHANT IN the course of days spent with mister Bostock and his menagerie I observed many little instances of the tamer s affection for his animals I could see it in the constant fondling of the big cats by Bostock himself and by Bonavita his chief tamer and even by the cage grooms And no matter how great the crush of business there was always time for visiting a sick lioness out in the stable who would never be better poor thing but should have all possible comforts for her last days And late one afternoon I stood by while Bonavita led a powerful yellow maned lion into the arena cage and held him as a mother might hold a suffering child while the doctor reaching cautiously through the bars cut away a growth from the beast s left eye It is true they used a local anesthetic but even so it hurt the lion and Bonavita s position as he knelt and stroked the big head and spoke soothing words seemed to me as far as possible from secure Yet it was plain that his only thought was to ease the lion s pain I couldn t have done that with all my lions Bonavita said to me after the operation but this one is specially trained You know he lets me put my head in his mouth Bonavita is a handsome slender man with dark hair and eyes quite the type of a Spanish gentleman and I liked him not only for his mastery of twenty odd lions but because he had a gentle manner and was modest about his work According to mister Bostock Bonavita has but two strong affections one for his old mother and one for his lions Occasionally I could get him aside for a talk and that was a thing worth doing People ask me such foolish questions about wild beasts he said one day For instance they want to know which would win in a fight a lion or a tiger I tell them that is like asking which would win in a fight an Irishman or a Scotchman It all depends on the particular tiger you have and the particular lion Animals are just as different as men some are good some bad some you can trust and some you can t trust Which is the most dangerous lion you have I inquired Well said he that s one of those questions I don t know how to answer If you ask which lion has been the most dangerous so far I should say Denver because he tore my right arm one day so badly that they nearly had to cut it off Still I think Ingomar is my most dangerous lion although he hasn t got his teeth in me yet he s tried but missed me It doesn t matter though what I think for it may be one of these lazy innocent looking lions that will really kill me They seem tame as kittens but you can t tell what s underneath Suppose I turn my back and one of them springs why it s all off Another day he said A man gets more confidence every time he faces an angry lion and comes out all right Finally he gets so sure of his power that he does strange things I have seen a lion coming at me and have never moved and the lion has stopped I have had a lion strike at me and the blow has just grazed my head and have stood still with my whip lifted and the lion has gone off afraid One day in the ring a lion caught my left arm in his teeth as I passed between two pedestals I didn t pull away but stamped my foot and cried out Baltimore what do you mean The stamp of my foot was the lion s cue to get off the pedestal and Baltimore loosed his jaws and jumped down His habit of routine was stronger than his desire to bite me Again Bonavita explained that there is some strange virtue in carrying in the left hand a whip which is never used The tamer strikes with his right hand whip when it is necessary but only lifts his left hand whip and holds it as a menace over the lion And it is likely Bonavita thinks that to strike with that reserve whip would be to dispel the lion s idea that it stands for some mysterious force beyond his daring You see lions aren t very intelligent said he they don t understand what men are or what they want That is our hardest work to make a lion understand what we want As soon as he knows that he is expected to sit on a pedestal he is willing enough to do it especially if he gets some meat but it often takes weeks before he finds out what we are driving at You can see what slow brains lions have or tigers either by watching them fight for a stick or a tin cup They couldn t get more excited over a piece of meat One of the worst wounds I ever got came from going into a lion s den after an overcoat that he had dragged away from a foolish spectator who was poking it at him Illustration BONAVITA S FIGHT WITH SEVEN LIONS IN THE RUNWAY I finally got Bonavita to tell me about the time when the lion Denver attacked him It was during a performance at Indianapolis in the fall of nineteen hundred and the trouble came at the runway end where the two circular passages from the cages open on an iron bridge that leads to the show ring Bonavita had just driven seven lions into this narrow space and was waiting for the attendants to open the iron barred door when Denver sprang at him and set his teeth in his right arm This stirred the other lions and they all turned on Bonavita but fortunately only two could reach him for the crush of bodies Here was a tamer in sorest need for the weight of the lions kept the iron doors from opening and barred out the rescuers In the audience was wildest panic and the building resounded with shouts and screams and the roars of angry lions Women fainted men rushed forward brandishing revolvers but dared not shoot and for a few moments it seemed as if the tamer was doomed But Bonavita s steady nerve saved him As Denver opened his jaws to seize a more vital spot the tamer drove his whip handle far down into his red throat and then with a cudgel passed in to him beat the brute back The other lions followed and this freed the iron door which the grooms straightway opened and in a moment the seven lions were leaping toward the ring as if nothing had happened And last of the seven came Denver driven by Bonavita white faced and suffering but the master now and greeted with cheers and roars of applause No one realized how badly he was hurt for his face gave no sign He bowed to the audience cracked his whip and began the act as usual As he went on he grew weaker but stuck to it until he had put the lions through four of their tricks and then he staggered out of the ring into the arms of the doctors who found him torn with ugly wounds that kept him for weeks in the hospital That I think is an instance of the very finest lion tamer spirit Among various meetings with tamers of animals I recall with particular pleasure one afternoon when my friend Newman brought to see me a tamer famous in his day George Arstingstall I knew that Arstingstall was the first man in this country to work lions tigers leopards elephants sheep monkeys and various other beasts all in a great circular cage Also that his fame had spread across Europe and his daring feats been shown from London to Moscow but I did not know what a simple modest man he was nor realize until then the charm of listening to a couple of circus veterans comrades for years talking of the old stirring days Here were two men getting on to sixty yet talking with the eagerness of boys about their exploits and perils under fang and claw It was Say Bill do you remember when that bull pup caught Topsy by the trunk and stampeded the Stampeded the whole business Do I remember George Up in Boston Bing bang over the Common and the Old Man wild Well I guess But say George that wasn t as bad as the stampede in Troy when those four elephants cleaned out the rolling mill Oh what a night Let s see There was Nan and And Tip Yes poor old Tip I strangled him at Bridgeport You remember George he wouldn t take the poison Oh he was no fool Tip wasn t and I told the Old Man we d have to put nooses on him and cut off his wind I know Bill the Old Man said it wasn t possible to strangle an elephant And say George I had his wind shut off inside of three minutes after the boys began to haul Oh you can t beat three sheave blocks George for finishing off a bad tusker Well this night in Troy those four elephants went sailing through this rolling mill trumpeting like mad right over the hot iron scaring those Irishmen blue and then smashed down a steep refuse bank into the mud Oh what looking elephants Nan had her legs all burned and I know and say Bill do you remember where I found Tip Three miles out of Troy standing up in a corn field sound asleep and two little boys on a rail fence looking at him He d knocked over a shanty and smashed open a barrel of whisky a whole barrel Bill and there he was sound asleep When I saw those little boys I made up my mind I d found Tip What ye lookin at little boys I sung out El phunt mister says one of the boys sort of careless like just as if it was a common thing in Troy for elephants to be asleep in corn fields I know that s the way little boys act remarked Newman sagaciously Say George tell about the time you took that car load of animals over the Alleghanies After some preliminaries mister Arstingstall responded to the invitation and I heard a story that Victor Hugo might have turned into a masterpiece of description It was back in the winter of eighteen seventy four and circus trains were not fitted up as completely then as they are to day Arstingstall was in charge of a car packed with a medley of animals lions and tigers in cages some camels some boxes of monkeys some hyenas a sacred bull from Tibet and a young male elephant recently brought from Africa and as yet untrained All these were on their way to Wisconsin where the show was to make its spring opening in a couple of weeks during which Arstingstall was expected to break the young elephant for driving in a chariot race At one end of the car was a stove against the bitter weather but the elephant was chained at the other end and as they came into the mountain region Arstingstall noticed that the elephant was suffering from cold and at the first stop sent a man out for half a bucket of whisky which he filled up with water and gave to the shivering animal There is no use giving an elephant whisky unless you give him enough Now came a run of an hour and a half without stop and during this time Arstingstall was alone in the animal car and about as busy as he ever expects to be on this earth The trouble began when he unloosed the elephant s chains to lead him nearer the stove for it looked as if his ears might freeze as happens Indeed an elephant s ears will sometimes freeze so hard that big pieces drop off while a frozen tail has been known to drop off entirely Against such chances Arstingstall wished to take precautions so he led the elephant down the car through the jumble of animals and cages all the less prepared for mischief as this was rather a smallish elephant not over six feet at the shoulder and showing only half grown tusks But they were sharp Whether it was the whisky taking violent effect or some sudden hatred for his keeper at any rate that elephant long before he reached the stove set forth upon a murderous campaign the like of which Arstingstall had never known Before he realized the danger he felt the creature s trunk twisting around his neck and he was hurled violently to the floor There he lay helpless while the elephant hesitated one might fancy whether to kneel on him and crush the life out or run him through with his tusks In that moment s pause Arstingstall made a last despairing effort did the only thing he could do sunk his teeth into the fleshy finger that curls around the end of an elephant s trunk and covers the opening so that no invading mouse may enter and work destruction In all an elephant s great body there is no spot so sensitive as this finger and with a scream of pain the animal loosed his hold whereupon Arstingstall sprang behind one of the cages But the elephant was after him in a moment swinging his trunk and trumpeting black murder Arstingstall dodged behind the camels behind the sacred bull behind the stove The elephant followed him everywhere profiting by his smallness and where he could not go himself he sent his curling trunk Arstingstall out of breath climbed on top of the lion s cage thinking to find some respite but the red ended trunk pursued him Once more he tried biting tactics and as the reaching finger swept along the cage top he seized it again in his teeth and this time took a piece clean out of it which was not pleasant for him and less so for the elephant Now came a truce of some minutes during which the elephant put forth screaming challenges but kept at a distance and allowed Arstingstall to reach the bunks beside the monkeys cages From the topmost bunk opened a trap door in the car roof the only exit as the sliding side doors were bolted He might escape here to the back of the train but that would leave a mad elephant in possession of the car a thing not to be thought of Thus far the elephant s rage had been directed solely against his keeper but the keeper gone he might turn to destroying the other animals might kill the sacred bull or smash open the lions cages there was no telling what he might do Arstingstall saw that his duty lay in that car Whatever came he must Crash came the elephant again and the lower berth was a wreck And now the din became infernal with the roaring and bellowing and chattering of the other animals Arstingstall did some quick thinking There was sure death before him unless he could somehow conquer this frenzied creature whose rushes coming harder and harder must soon batter down the car for all its stout oak timbers Oh for a weapon a prod of some sort a like a flash the thought came down at the other end was the pitchfork used for throwing fodder There was his chance he must get that pitchfork For the next hour it was a fight man against elephant for the winning and holding of that pitchfork There was the whole story and some day I hope to give its details the moves and counter moves the strategy of brute against human the conflict of brain against crude force Arstingstall won but by what patience and quiet nerve he alone knows Foot by foot cage by cage he worked his way down the length of that car the elephant now on the defensive one would say as if he realized what was planning the man watching resolute biding his time ready for a sudden rush forced now and again to use his teeth upon that murderous trunk Finally he got the pitchfork and for a moment what a moment that was held four prongs of flashing steel before the elephant s eyes red burning unsubmissive It was all over now the battle was won the animal knew and stood still awaiting the blow Down came the weapon and right through the trunk went those four sharp points down into the timbers under foot Then Arstingstall braced the handle under a wall beam so that the elephant was nailed fast to the floor nose down And then the brute squealed his submission Three weeks later Arstingstall drove that elephant perfectly broken in a chariot race and for years after there was not a better little bull in the herd than he IV WE SEE mister BOSTOCK MATCHED AGAINST A WILD LION AND HEAR ABOUT THE TIGER RAJAH WHENEVER I made the round of cages with mister Bostock I was struck by the fierce behavior of a certain male lion with brown and yellow mane Young Wallace they called him who would set up a horrible snarling as soon as we came near and rush at the bars as if to tear them down And no matter how great the crowd his wicked yellow eyes would always follow Bostock and his deep purring roar would continue and break into furious barks if the tamer approached the bars Then his jaws would open and the red muzzle curl back from his tusks and again and again he would strike the floor with blows that would crush a horse Doesn t love me does he said Bostock one day What s the matter with him I asked Why nothing only he s a wild lion never been tamed you know and I took him in the ring one day He hasn t forgotten it have you old boy Hah Bostock stamped his foot suddenly and Young Wallace crouched back snarling still a picture of hatred and fear Yes went on Bostock he s wild enough You see after the fire I had to get animals from pretty much everywhere and get em quick Did some lively cabling I can tell you and pretty soon there were lions and tigers and leopards and oh everything from sacred bulls down to snakes chasing across the ocean and more than half of them had been loose in the jungle six months ago It was a case of hustle and we took what they sent us Then we had fun breaking em in Ask Madame Morelli if we didn t She s in the hospital now from the claws of that fellow He pointed to a sleepy looking jaguar Tell you how I came to take this wild lion into the ring I had a press agent who had been announcing out West what a wonder I was with wild beasts and how I wasn t afraid of anything on legs and so on That was all very well while I was in Baltimore but when I joined my other show after the fire of course I had to live up to my reputation And when they got up a traveling men s benefit out in Indianapolis and asked me to go into the ring with Young Wallace why there wasn t anything to do but go in It wasn t quite so funny though as it seemed for I might as well have taken a lion fresh from the wilds of Africa mister Bostock smiled at the memory Well I did the thing and got through all right Young Wallace hasn t forgotten what happened to him I got the best of him by a trick had a little shelter cage placed inside the big arena cage and at first I stood in the small one and let the lion come at me Oh you d better believe he came I thought sure he d jump clean over the thing and land on me for there was no roof to my cage only sides of wire netting He didn t quite do it though and as soon as I saw he was getting rattled I stepped out quick and went at him hard with whip and club And I drove him all over the ring and the people went crazy for he was the maddest lion you ever saw That was all right as far as it went but the people wanted more They got to be out and out bloodthirsty there in Indianapolis Wanted me to go in the ring with Rajah that big tiger See over there Come up Rajah Beauty isn t he Doesn t pay any special attention to me does he Nearly killed me just the same Look He lifted his cap and showed wide strips of plaster on his head Point about Rajah was that he d killed one of my keepers a couple of weeks before Poor fellow got in his cage by mistake And now these Indianapolis folks wanted to see me handle him Between you and me this keeper wasn t the first man Rajah had killed and I didn t care much for the job As for my wife well you can imagine how she felt when she heard I was going in with Rajah On the morning of the performance I decided to have a rehearsal and called on a few picked men to help me I knew by the way he had killed his keeper that Rajah would go at my head if he attacked me at all so I rigged up a mask of iron wire and wore this strapped over my head like a little barrel Then I drove him into the arena and began while the others looked on anxiously It s queer sir but that tiger went through his tricks as nice as you please back and forth up on his pedestal and down again everything just as he used to do in the old days before he went bad Never balked never turned on me just as good as gold Illustration RAJAH S ATTACK UPON BONAVITA IN THE RUNWAY Soon as I was satisfied I drove him across the bridge and down the runway toward his den I came about a dozen feet behind him carrying a long wooden shield as we generally do in a narrow space Rajah reached his cage all right and went in You see he couldn t go down the runway any farther for the door opening outward barred the passage Behind that door I had stationed a keeper with orders to close it as soon as Rajah was inside but Rajah went in so silently that the keeper didn t know it the peep holes in the door being too high for him to see very well The result was that the cage door stood open for a few seconds after the tiger had gone in It seems a little thing but it nearly cost me my life for when I came up Rajah s head was right back of the open door and when I reached out my hand to close the door he sprang at me and in a second had me down with his teeth in my arm and his claws digging into my head through openings in the mask Then you d better believe there was a fight in that runway The keepers rushed in Bonavita rushed in They shot at him with revolvers they jabbed him with irons they pounded at him with clubs and one of the blows that Rajah dodged knocked me senseless Well they got me out finally I guess the mask saved my life But I didn t take Rajah into the ring that evening and Rajah won t be seen in the ring any more He s made trouble enough Why the things I could tell you about that tiger would fill a book Some of these things he did tell me for I brought the talk back to Rajah whenever the chance offered I well remember for instance the occasion when I heard how Rajah once got out of his cage and chased a quagga one of those queer little animals that are half zebra and half mule It was late at night and we had entered the runway mister Bostock and I after the performance for he wanted me to realize the perils of this narrow boarded lane that circles all the dens and leads the lions to the ring It is indeed a terrifying place a low dimly lighted passage curving constantly so that you see ahead scarcely twenty feet and are always turning a slow corner always peering ahead uneasily and listening What is that A soft tread The glow of greenish eyeballs Who can tell when a bolt may slip or a board give way So many things have happened in these runways Of course a lion has no business to be out of his den but but suppose he is Suppose you meet him now there Well it was here that I heard the story Bonavita it appears was standing on the bridge one morning when there arose a fearful racket in the runway and looking in he saw the quagga tearing along toward him He concluded that some one had unfastened the door and was just preparing to check the animal when around the curve came Rajah in full pursuit Bonavita stepped back drew his revolver and as the tiger rushed past fired a blank cartridge thinking thus to divert him from the quagga But Rajah paid not the slightest heed and in long bounds came out into the arena hard after the terrified quadruped which was galloping now with the speed of despair A keeper who was sweeping clambered up the iron sides and anxiously watched the race from the top Bonavita powerless to interfere watched from the bridge Illustration THE TIGER RAJAH KICKED BY THE QUAGGA Of all races ever run in a circus this was the most remarkable It was a race for life as the quagga knew and the tiger intended Five times they circled the arena Rajah gaining always but never enough for a spring In the sixth turn however he judged the distance right and straightway a black and yellow body shot through the air in true aim at the prey Whereupon the quagga did the only thing a quagga could do let out both hind legs in one straight tremendous kick and they do say that a quagga can kick the eyes out of a fly At any rate in this case a pair of nervous little heels caught the descending tiger squarely under the lower jaw and put him to sleep like a nice little lullaby And that was the end of it The quagga trotted back to its cage Bonavita put up his revolver the frightened sweeper climbed down from the bars and Rajah was hauled back ignominiously to his den Here we have three instances showing the extreme importance of little things in a menagerie A keeper opens door No thirteen instead of door No fourteen and is straightway killed A screw is loose in a bolt fastening and presto a tiger is at large A watcher at a peep hole looks away for a moment and a life goes into jeopardy It is always so and I will let mister Bostock tell how a little thing gave Rajah his first longing to kill It was several years ago said he when I was running a wagon show in England I remember we were about a mile and a half out of a certain town when this thing happened For some reason Rajah had been transferred to a bear wagon and we ought to have examined it more carefully for bears are the worst fellows in the world to damage a cage by ripping up the timbers it seems as if nothing can resist their claws and teeth And this particular cage was in such bad shape that Rajah managed to get out of it I knew something must be wrong when I saw the big elephant wagon that headed the procession go tearing away with its six horses on a dead run under the driver s lash No wonder the driver was scared for he had turned his head and seen the two draft horses that followed him down on the ground with Rajah tearing at one of them and the other one dead It wasn t a pretty sight when we got there and it wasn t an easy job either capturing Rajah I don t know what we should have done if it hadn t been for a long haired fellow in the show called Mustang Ned who came up with a coil of rope and lassoed the tiger Then we tangled him up in netting and finally got him into one of the shifting cages But after that he was never the same tiger You wouldn t think there was a time when Rajah used to ride around the tent on an elephant s back with only a little black boy to guard him What outside the iron ring Yes sir right among the women and children He did that twice a day for over a year Might be doing it yet if the black boy hadn t been so careful of his white trousers His white trousers That s right You see this boy rode on the elephant behind Rajah and he wore long black boots and a fine white suit Made quite a picture Only he didn t like to rub his trousers against the tiger for an animal s back is naturally oily so he used to tuck his legs under a lion s skin that Rajah rode on and wrap it around him like a carriage robe Well one day as they were going around the nigger lost his balance and tumbled off the elephant pulling the lion s skin with him and of course that dragged Rajah along too The first thing we knew there was a big tiger on the ground and people running about and screaming Pleasant wasn t it Illustration PUTTING THE TIGER RAJAH AGAIN UPON THE ELEPHANT S BACK In another minute we d have had a panic but by good luck I was there and caught Rajah quickly around the neck and held him until the others got a rope on him Then we had a time getting him back on the elephant First I tried to make him spring up from a high pedestal but he wouldn t spring Next I had them work a ladder under Rajah so that he sat on it and then with two men at one end and me at the other we lifted him slowly level with our shoulders level with our heads and just there the tiger gave a vicious growl and the two men lowered their end That made him work up toward my end and in a second I had Rajah s face close to my face and both my hands occupied with the ladder I couldn t do a thing and the only question was what he would do He looked at me looked at the elephant and then struck out hard and quick missing me only by a hair in fact he didn t miss me entirely for one of his claws just reached the corner of my eye see I have the scar still But he jumped on the elephant and we kept the mastery that day Still it was bad business and I saw we couldn t take such chances again That was Rajah s last ride V WE SPEND A NIGHT AMONG WILD BEASTS AND SEE THE DANGEROUS LION BLACK PRINCE THE general opinion among wild beast tamers is that the tiger is more to be feared than the lion The one will kill a man as easily as the other but the lion gives fair warning of his murderous intention by rushing at his victim with a roar whereas the tiger true representative of the cat tribe sneaks up with semblance of affectionate purr only to set his fangs suddenly into the very life of his victim The lion has somewhat greater muscular power than the tiger but the latter has greater quickness The tamer Philadelphia told me once that he had seen a lion fasten his fangs in the shoulder of a dead horse and drag the carcass weighing perhaps a thousand pounds a distance of twenty feet If a lion and a strong horse were to pull in opposite directions the horse would drag the lion backward with comparative ease but if the lion were hitched behind the horse facing in the same direction and were allowed to exert his strength in backing he could easily pull the horse down upon his haunches so much greater is his strength when exerted backward from the hind legs than in forward pulling A lion springing through the air from a distance of six feet would knock down a horse or bullock with a single blow of his forearm backed by the momentum of his three hundred pounds weight and a full grown lion in the jungles will jump twenty five or thirty feet on the level from a running start In captivity the same lion would clear a distance about half as great A lion can jump over a fence eight or ten feet high but not at a bound He catches first with his forelegs and drags his body after him Tigers will jump a trifle higher than lions But of all wild animals the leopards are the greatest jumpers being able to hurl their lithe and beautiful bodies curled up almost into a ball to extraordinary heights They bound with ease for instance from the floor of the cage so as to touch a ceiling twelve feet high For a short distance a lion or a tiger will outrun a man and can equal the speed of a fast horse but they lose their wind at the end of half a mile at the most They have little endurance and are remarkably weak in lung power Their strength is the kind which is capable of a terrific effort for a short time It would take six men for instance to hold a lion down in his first struggles even after his legs were tied One day Philadelphia wishing to test the affection popularly supposed to exist between a lion and a mouse put a mouse in the cage of a full grown Nubian lion The lion saw the mouse before it was fairly through the bars and was after him instantly Away went the little fellow scurrying across the floor and squealing in fright When he had gone about ten feet the lion sprang lighting a little in front of him The mouse turned and the lion sprang again This was repeated several times the mouse traversing a shorter distance after each spring of the lion It was demonstrated that a lion is too quick for a mouse at least in a large cage Finally the mouse stood still trembling while the lion studied it with interest Presently he shot out his big paw and brought it down directly on the mouse but so gently that the little fellow was not injured in the least though held fast between the claws Then the lion played with him in the most extraordinary way now lifting his paw and letting the mouse run a few inches now stopping him as before Suddenly the mouse changed his tactics and instead of running when the lion lifted his paw sprang into the air straight at the lion s head The lion terrified gave a great leap back striking the bars with all his weight and shaking the whole floor Then he opened his great jaws and roared and roared again while the little mouse still squealing made his escape Of the two the lion was the more frightened Speaking of Philadelphia I used to wonder as I watched him manage Black Prince on horseback whether the lion was really in earnest as he struck and roared with such apparent viciousness or whether he had simply been trained to play a part Certainly the lion looked as if his one desire was to kill the little man who teased him so with rod and whip smiling all the time under his yellow mustache One night Black Prince sprang ten feet through the air straight at Philadelphia who saved his life by dodging but did not escape the sweep of the lion s forearm No one knew that however for the tamer showed no sign of injury but brought his heavy whip down with a stinging cut over the lion s head and went through the act holding a handkerchief to his face now and then but smiling as before When he left the ring it was found that one of the lion s claws had laid his cheek open almost from eye to lip He meant to kill me that trip said Philadelphia as they bound up his face We will never show that lion again declared the manager much excited Oh yes we will answered the wounded tamer I will make him work to morrow as usual And he did teasing and prodding him that day as never before as if daring him to do his worst The climax was reached one night in January when Black Prince came within an ace of killing this daring tamer and certainly would have done so had not his attention been diverted just at the critical moment by the horse he was riding He paused in the very act of springing as if undecided whether to destroy the man or the horse and that pause put the tamer on his guard while the watchful grooms rushed in through the iron gates and drove Black Prince from the ring Speaking to me afterward of that night Philadelphia said I knew the critical moment had come and that it would not do to push matters any farther If I had made Black Prince do his jump when he balked and turned on me he would have sprung at my throat caught me between his fore paws and fastened his fangs in my neck or breast It would have been impossible for ten men to have dragged him off and I should have been killed there in the sight of the spectators just as my nephew Albert Krone was killed in Germany some years ago by a Russian bear In conclusion let me recall a night that I spent among the wild beasts of the famous Hagenbeck menagerie That by the way is a thing worth doing if one values strange sensations It is two hours after midnight The snow lies crisp under foot the stars and electric lights shine quietly in the still night Before me rises a big building its walls pictured with springing lions and pyramids of tigers As I enter a long roar from within tells me that the animals are not all asleep The roar a lion s comes three times with increasing volume and at the fourth is answered by another of equal volume then two lions roar together the sounds coming quicker and quicker with an increasing staccato that ends finally in hoarse barks Taking a little alarm clock that the night watchman loans me I go back among the cages where I am to keep strange vigil A small wooden door at the right takes me into an open space ranged with cages and wagons the former containing some barking dogs From here I pass into a circular shed where are more wagons and dogs and at the farther end by the wet sticky looking seals I reach a small door leading into a low passage beyond which are the wild beasts I push aside a curtain covering the entrance against drafts and see before me a picture never dreamed of by humdrum New Yorkers sleeping within stone s throw The cages ranged in double row form an alleyway divided at intervals by gas stoves on which water is heating In front of the big group of lions and tigers sleeps one of the grooms stretched on a cot bed He wears a pink shirt and blue drawers and his bare feet are turned to the gas stove which burns night and day Another groom sleeps farther on beside the Tibet goats and still another near the ponies opposite the small cage of the lioness Mignon They sleep so soundly that a riot would scarcely waken them yet by some subtle sense they would be on the alert in an instant if anything were wrong in the cages Three animals rouse themselves as I step into the darkness which shrouds the big cage the lion Yellow Prince is one of them and as I approach the bars three pairs of burning eyes glare at me through the shadows I venture to turn on the electric light and peer into the cage Here are three leopards the three royal Bengal tigers and a full grown lion making no more noise between them than a sleeping child I return to the farther end of the shed where the five year old lioness Helena alone in her cage is walking back and forth drowsily as if on the point of dropping off for her night s rest Indeed she does this presently turning on her side and stretching her legs out perfectly straight with no bend at the joints It was Helena who in a fit of nervous fright a year or two ago sprang upon Betty Stuckart the famous prize beauty and nearly killed her Since then she has lived in solitary confinement The stillness now would be absolute but for a very curious sound which comes out of the gloom beyond the big cage of leopards and tigers It is the elephant Topsy sleeping There is no stranger sight in a menagerie than that of an elephant asleep The huge legs are bent to right angles at the knees the trunk is curled into the mouth and the whole suggests a shapeless mound of mud or clay or a half inflated balloon Head and tail are alike the ears lie flat the eyes are quite concealed in wrinkled flesh but from somewhere within this seemingly dead mass comes a long hissing sound like the exhaust from a steam pipe This sound continues for several seconds and then stops to be repeated after an interval of silence Illustration A ROYAL BENGAL TIGER So complete is the illusion of the sleeping elephant s not being alive at all but only a mound of dead matter that abstractedly I set the alarm clock down upon the flat bone of the forehead No sooner have I done so than I spring back startled leaving the clock ticking on the elephant s head There has been no noise or movement no indication of displeasure no effort to do me harm But suddenly in the middle of the huge mud colored mass there has appeared a round red circle about two inches in diameter The elephant has simply opened his eye The eye does not roll or move or wink It merely remains open on me for a few seconds a round staring circle and then disappears as suddenly as it came Leaving Topsy I resume my wanderings among the cages The whole place is asleep and I am seized with intense desire to awaken something I take a long straw and tickle Black Prince on his black nose His eyes open instantly and the heavy paw swings round like the working beam of an engine only more quickly to crush the straw for its impertinence I tickle him again and again he strikes with force enough to knock down a horse As I continue his blows grow quicker and heavier and his big tusks snap at the troublesome straw Finally in desperation he starts up and throwing back his magnificent head looks at me out of his brown wicked eyes lifts his chin curls down his lower lip a little and bellows forth a low plaintive sound more like the mooing of a cow than the roar of a lion Then apparently ashamed of this uninspiring sound he shakes his mane and roars in genuine lion fashion So the hours of the night pass and at last having seen everything and grown weary of experiments I seat myself on a trunk near Black Prince s cage and am soon buried in my meditations The tips of the tigers noses begin to change from red to green and then back again the leopards tails are no longer straight but end in snake heads with forked tongues darting out I overhear curious conversations among the lions and presently men in blue shirts and pink drawers come marching past each carrying an alarm clock Then a curious thing happens with a sweep of her trunk the elephant Topsy lifts Jocko the monkey out of his red box You must unlock the cages says Topsy All right says Jocko And he does Then all the lions tigers leopards boar hounds Tibet goats bears ponies and wild boars join in the procession while the alarm clocks beat time Black Prince walks first and presently wheeling the line toward me lifts his fore paw and says Mein Herr it is six o clock THE DYNAMITE WORKER I THE STORY OF SOME MILLIONAIRE HEROES AND THE WORLD S GREATEST POWDER EXPLOSION THERE is illustrated in this career of the explosive maker a splendid fact touching courage that once a man has begun to practise it the habit holds him with stronger and stronger grip so that he must be brave whether he will or no I think a fireman for instance who for years had jumped at the tap of a bell into any peril would show the same fine courage all alone let us say in some crisis on a desert island He couldn t turn coward if he tried It is good to know too that these fearless qualities may be transmitted from father to son so that we have whole families born as it were to be brave and we see the son of a pilot facing the seasick torture for twenty odd years as his father faced it before him for thirty Nor is it possible to be in close relations with a very brave man without yielding in some measure to his personality heroes produce heroes through a sort of neighborhood influence just as surely as thieves produce their kind Thus the brother in law of a lion tamer though previously a mild enough man takes to taming lions and does it well And wives of acrobats find themselves one day quietly facing perils of the air that would surely have blanched their cheeks had they married let us say photographers All of which brings me to a remarkable family of explosive makers the Duponts of Wilmington who for generations now have had practical monopoly in this country of the powder making business including dynamite and nitroglycerin In this enterprise a great fortune has accumulated so that the Duponts of to day are very rich men far beyond any need of working in the mills themselves and have been for years Yet work in the mills they do all of them practically and direct in detail every process of manufacture and face continually in their own persons the same terrible dangers that the humblest mixer faces There has grown in their hearts through the century along with riches a great pride of courage like that of the officer who leads his men into battle a pride far stronger than any longing for idleness or pleasure And they cannot if they would leave these slow grinding mills where any day a spark may bring catastrophe to make the whole land shudder as it has shuddered many times after the fury of these giant magazines There came a day for instance this was a long time ago when a swift flame swept through one of the mixing rooms nearly empty of powder at the time yet so permeated with the stuff in floor and walls that instantly the building was burning fiercely No man can say what started it The cause of trouble at a powder mill is seldom known it comes too quickly and usually leaves no witness A nail overlooked in a workman s heel may have done the harm by striking a stone though of course there is an imperative rule that all footgear made with nails be left outside the walls or a heavy box slid along the wooden floor may have brought a flash out of the dry timbers At any rate the flash came and the blaze followed on it so swiftly that the building was wrapped in fire before men inside could reach the door and they presently burst out blazing themselves for their clothing as it must be was sifted through with explosive dust Indeed it is always true in fires at powder mills that the workmen themselves are a serious menace to the buildings by reason of their own inflammability So the next thing was a plunge into the placid Brandywine which winds across the yards between willow hung banks In went the men in went young Alexis Dupont and with a little hiss their flaming garments were extinguished Then as they struck out into the stream they looked back and saw that the wind was carrying a shower of sparks from the burning building to the roof of a cutting mill near by where tons of powder lay For one of the sparks to reach the tiniest powder train would mean the blowing up of this mill and almost certainly the blowing up of another and another by the concussion for it is in vain that they try to protect powder mills by scattering them over wide yards in many little buildings When one explodes the great shock usually sets off others as a falling rock turns loose an avalanche All this young Dupont realized in a single glance There would be an awful disaster presently with many lives imperiled unless those falling firebrands could somehow be kept off that roof To know this was to act Millionaire or not peril or not it was his plain duty as a Dupont to fight those sparks and without a moment s wavering he turned back and scrambled up the bank Illustration YOUNG DUPONT WORKING TO SAVE THE POWDER MILL Come on boys he cried start the bucket line and a moment later he was climbing to the roof of the threatened mill where he did all that a brave man can do stamped out the falling embers dashed water again and again upon the kindling fire as the men passed up full buckets and for a time seemed to conquer But presently the fire flamed hotter the sparks came faster and the water came not fast enough He saw he must have seen that the struggle was hopeless that the mill beneath him was doomed that the explosion must come soon From the ground they shouted calling on him to save himself He shouted back an order that they pass up more water and keep passing water There was only one thing in the world he wanted water The men below did their best but it was a vain effort for in those days the roofs of powder mills were made of pitch and cement not of iron as to day and by this time the fire had eaten its way nearly through Alexis Dupont working desperately stood there with flames spreading all around him It was plain to every one that the minutes of his life were numbered Again they shouted and The explosion came like an execution and out of the wreck of it they bore away his crushed and broken body The last thing he knew was that he had played the game out fairly to the end he died like a Dupont said the men Such was the spirit of the second generation Alexis Dupont was a son of old Eleuthere founder of the line and later we find the same courage in the third generation as on March twenty nine eighteen eighty four when La Motte Dupont one of the grandchildren took his stand inside the dynamite mill his mill when it was threatened by fire and stayed there after every man had left it struggling with hand and brain against the danger until the explosion coming like a thousand cannon crashed his body deep into a sand heap and left it with the life gone out I suppose this is only an instance of nature s tendency to furnish always what is needed to raise up a hero for each emergency but it is encouraging to know that the very finest kind of courage may be thus developed by the mere pressure of moral responsibility in a man under no master but free to be a craven if he will We have seen something like this in the splendid devotion of fire department chiefs who often outshine all their men simply because they cannot resist the gallant spirit in their own hearts Now for the exception to this rule of persisting courage an exception sometimes presented in the lives of explosive makers and in the other lives too and showing that in certain cases courage may suddenly and strangely disappear A man may be brave for years and then cease to be brave The wild beast tamer may awaken some morning and discover himself afraid of his lions The steeple climber who has never flinched at any height may shrink at last The pilot in the rapids the acrobat on his swing the diver sinking to a wreck may feel a quaking of heart unknown before Here is apparent contradiction for how can courage be made by habit and then unmade I don t know I merely give the facts as I have found them and it is quite certain that a sturdy Irishman who has shoveled powder all his life and waded in it knee deep as if it were so much coal dust may for no reason he can put finger on find himself lying awake of nights reflecting on what would happen if a spark should strike under one of the big rollers he feeds so carelessly or remembering uneasily that dream of his wife s about a white horse every powder man knows the close relation between dreams and explosions and well they will all tell you this that the only thing for a man to do when his heart feels the cold touch of fear is to quit his job If he doesn t his knell is sounded he is marked for sacrifice his tigers will rend him the deep waters will overwhelm him a swift fall will crush him he will surely die Illustration EFFECTS OF DYNAMITE EXPLODED UNDER WATER The greatest catastrophe in the records of powder making came because a man ignored such plain warning of his own fear At least the workmen at the Dupont mills will tell you this if you can get them to break through their usual reserve The man was William Green and whatever his fault he paid the fullest price for it Green was stationed in one of the magazines with the responsibility of sealing up hexagonal powder a very powerful kind used by the government in heavy guns This powder comes pressed into little six sided cakes of reddish color which are packed in large wooden boxes lined with tin and it was Green s duty to solder the tin covers tight with a hot iron In each box there was enough of this powder to blow up a fortress and it is no wonder the occupation finally told on Green s nerves He said to his wife that sooner or later a speck of grit would touch his iron and make a spark and then The theory is that a spark is required to explode powder which will only burn harmlessly at the touch of a hot iron or a flame However this may be and I should add that the theory is disputed Green felt that he was in danger and by that fact say the powder men if for no other reason he was in danger And one day it was October seven eighteen ninety the spark came surely that was a most important spark for it caused the explosion of one hundred and fifty tons of gunpowder the instant death of thirteen men and one woman and the serious or fatal injury of twenty two men and nine women Only an earthquake could have wrought such terrible destruction The city of Wilmington was shaken to its foundations Great chasms were rent in the solid rock under the exploding magazines Trees were torn up by the roots Iron castings weighing tons were hurled clean across the Brandywine Iron columns thick as a man s waist were twisted and bent like copper wire Horses outside the yards were found with legs missing men were found stripped clean of their clothes and this curious fact was developed that a man or a horse in the region of explosion would have shoes blown from the feet iron shoes or leather shoes if the legs were on the ground at the moment of shock but would keep shoes on if the legs were lifted Thus poor Green was found with both feet shod and so identified although his body had no other stitch of covering and the explanation was that he probably saw the spark in time to spring away and was actually in the air when the explosion came In my investigations I have heard various stories showing what uncertainty there is as to the behavior of dynamite in the presence of fire Workmen who handle it constantly in blasting operations say you can put fire to a stick of dynamite without danger and it will simply burn away in bluish flame On the other hand they admit that in every fifty or a hundred sticks there may be one where the touch of fire will bring explosion Illustration THE EXPLOSION IN THE NEW YORK CITY TUNNEL It is quite certain this was the case in New York s recent tunnel accident near One Hundred and Eightieth Street and I have some facts of interest here obtained from a workman who was in the main gallery at the time This man heard a shout of warning and looking down the rock street saw a puddle of blazing oil from one of the lamps lapping at the side of a heavy wooden box He knew that the box was full of dynamite and as he looked he saw the yellow oil flame turn to blue That was enough for him and he started to run for his life But the explosion caught him in the first step lifted him from the ground and bore him on while his legs kept up the motions of running He was running on the air As he was thus hurled along his knee struck a large stone between the siding and the north heading and he fell on his face half dazed The air was thick with strangling fumes there was a frightful din about him yells and crashing stones Every lamp had been blown out and in the utter darkness he could see the glaring eyeballs of fleeing negroes who cursed in awful oaths as they ran He pressed his mouth close to the ground and found he could breathe better He felt some one step over him and seized a leg The leg kicked itself free and went on He groped about with his hands and touched an iron rail it was the little track for hauling the dumping cars He crept along this painfully to the siding then down the siding to the shaft where in the blackness he found a frantic company negroes mad with fright Italians screaming and praying Irishmen keeping fairly cool but wondering why oh why the elevator did not come and several men stretched on the ground quite still or groaning quietly Time lacks for the rest of the story they took out men dressed in a collar and shirt band only everything else blown off and some whose faces were mottled with fragments of stone a kind of dynamite tattooing and some grievously injured There are no limits to the fury of dynamite once it sets out to be cruel II WE VISIT A DYNAMITE FACTORY AND MEET A MAN WHO THINKS COURAGE IS AN ACCIDENT ON a certain pleasant morning in June I set forth to visit a dynamite factory and see with my own eyes if might be some of the men who follow this strange and hazardous business As the train rushed along I thought of the power for good and evil that is in this wonderful agent dynamite piercing mountains dynamite threatening armies and blowing up great ships a teacupful of dynamite shattering a fortress a teaspoonful of the essence of dynamite that is nitroglycerin tearing a man to atoms What kind of fellows must they be who spend their lives making dynamite In due course I found myself back in the hill land of northern New Jersey where everything is green and quiet a lovely summer s retreat with nothing in external signs to suggest an industry of violence Stop here is a sign though it doesn t seem much two sleepy wagons lumbering along the road between these cool woods and the waving fields Farm produce Lumber No The first is loaded with a sort of yellow meal and trails the way with yellow sprinklings That is sulphur They use it at the works The second is piled up with crates out of which come thick glass necks like the heads of imprisoned turkeys These are carboys of nitric acid hundreds of gallons of that terrible stuff which is so truly liquid fire that a single drop of it on a piece of board will set the wood in flames This nitric acid mixed with innocent sweet glycerin it comes along the road in barrels makes nitroglycerin and the proper mixing of these two is the chief business of a dynamite factory Farther down the road I came to a railroad track where a long freight train was standing on a siding Some men were busy here loading a car with clean looking wooden boxes that might have held starch or soap but did hold dynamite neatly packed in long fat sticks like huge fire crackers Each box bore this inscription in red letters HIGH EXPLOSIVES DANGEROUS I looked along the train and saw that there were several cars closed and sealed with a sign nailed on the outside POWDER HANDLE CAREFULLY In this case powder means dynamite for the product of a dynamite factory is always called powder I think the men feel more comfortable when they use that milder name There was powder enough on this train to wreck a city but nobody seemed to mind The horses switched their tails The men laughed and loitered They might have been laying bricks for any interest they showed I asked one of them if it is considered safe to haul car loads of dynamite about the country He said that some people consider it safe and some do not some railroads will carry dynamite while others refuse it Suppose a man were to shoot a rifle ball into one of these cars I asked do you think it would explode This led to an argument One of the group was positive it would explode Concussion he declared is the thing that sets off dynamite Another knew of experiments at the works where they had fired rifle balls into quantities of dynamite and found that sometimes it exploded and sometimes it didn t Then a third man spoke up with an air of authority You ve got to have a red spark said he to set off dynamite I ve handled it long enough to know Here s an experiment that s been tried They took an old flat car and loaded it with rocks then they fastened a box of dynamite to the bumper and let the car run down a steep grade bang into another car anchored at the bottom And they found that the dynamite never exploded unless the bumpers were faced with iron It didn t matter how much concussion they got with wooden bumpers the dynamite was like that much putty but as soon as a red spark jumped into it out of the iron why off she d go Then he instanced various cases where powder cars had gone through railroad wrecks without exploding although boxes of dynamite had been smashed open and scattered about How about that car of ours the other day up in central New York said the first man Everything blown to pieces and six lads killed He smiled grimly but the other persisted That collision only proves what I say There was a red hot locomotive plowing through a car of dynamite and of course she went up But it wasn t the concussion did it it was the sparks You say that it takes a red spark I observed to set off dynamite Do you mean that a white spark wouldn t do it That s what I mean said he It seems queer but it s a fact Put a white hot poker into a box of dynamite and it will only burn but let the poker cool down until it s only red hot and the dynamite will explode Illustration EVERYTHING WAS BLOWN TO PIECES Pondering this remarkable statement I continued on my way and presently not seeing any big building asked a farmer where the Atlantic Dynamite Works were He swept the horizon with his arm and said they were all about us they covered hundreds of acres little low buildings placed far apart so that if one exploded it wouldn t set off the rest The dynamite magazines are along the hillside yonder he said If they went up I guess there wouldn t be much left of the town What town said I Why Kenvil That s where the dynamite mixers live It s over there Quickest way is across this field and over the fence I followed his advice and presently passed near a number of small brick buildings so very innocent looking that I found myself saying What this blow up or that little sputtering shanty wreck a town It seemed ridiculous I learned afterward that I had walked through the most dangerous part of the works it isn t size here that counts I paused at several open doors and got a whiff of chemicals that made me understand the dynamite sickness of which I had heard No man can breathe the strangling fumes of nitric acid and nitrated glycerin without discomfort and every man here must breathe them They rise from vats and troughs like brownish yellow smoke they are in the mixing rooms in the packing rooms in the freezing house in the separating house everywhere and they take men in the throat and make their hearts pound strangely and set their heads splitting with pain Not a workman escapes the dynamite headache new hands are wretched with it for a fortnight and even the well seasoned men get a touch of it on Monday mornings after the Sunday rest In walking about the works I noticed that the several buildings representing different steps in the manufacture of explosives are united by long troughs or pipes sufficiently inclined to allow the nitroglycerin to flow by its own weight from one building to another so that you watch the first operations in dynamite making at the top of a slope and the last ones at the bottom Of course this transportation by flow is possible for nitroglycerin only while it is a liquid and not after it has been absorbed by porous earth and given the name of dynamite and the look of moist sawdust As dynamite it is transported between buildings on little railroads with horses to haul the cars I noted also that most of the buildings are built against a hillside or surrounded by heavy mounds of earth so that if one of them blows up the others may be protected against the flight of debris Without such barricade the shattered walls and rocks would be hurled in all directions with the energy of cannonballs and a single explosion would probably mean the destruction of the entire works At one place I saw a triangular frame of timbers and iron supporting a five hundred pound swinging mortar that hung down like a great gipsy kettle under its tripod In front of this mortar was a sand heap and here I learned were made the tests of dynamite a certain quantity of this lot or that being exploded against the sand heap and the mortar s swing back from the recoil giving a measure of its force The more nitroglycerin there is in a given lot of dynamite the farther back the mortar will swing It should be understood that there are many different grades of dynamite the strength of these depending upon how much nitroglycerin has been absorbed by a certain kind of porous earth In a little white house beyond the laboratory I found the superintendent of the works a man of few words accustomed to give brief orders and have them obeyed He did not care to talk about dynamite they never do He did not think there was much to say anyhow except that people have silly notions about the danger He had been working with dynamite now for twenty five years and never had an accident that is himself Oh yes some men had been killed in his time but not so many as in other occupations not nearly so many as in railroading Of course there was danger in dealing with any great force the thing would run away with you now and then but on the whole he regarded dynamite as a very well behaved commodity and much slandered Then you think dynamite workers have no great need of courage I suggested No more than others Why should they They work along for years and nothing happens They might as well be shoveling coal And if anything does happen it s over so quick that courage isn t much use Having said this he hesitated a moment and then as if in a spirit of fairness told of a certain man at the head of a nitroglycerin mill who on one occasion did do a little thing that some people called brave He wouldn t give the name of this certain man but I fancied I could guess it Illustration HE WENT TO WORK THROWING WATER ON THE BURNING BOXES This nitroglycerin mill it seems was on the Pacific coast whence they used to ship the dynamite on vessels that loaded right alongside the yards One day a mixing house exploded and hurled burning timbers over a vessel lying near that had just received a fresh cargo Her decks were piled with boxes of explosives wooden boxes which at once took fire When this certain man rushed down to the dock the situation was as bad as could be There were tons of dynamite ready to explode and a hot fire was eating deeper into the wood with every second And all the workmen had run for their lives Well said the superintendent what this man did was to grab a bucket and line and jump on the deck Yes it was burning everything was burning But he went to work lowering the bucket overside and throwing water on the flaming boxes After a while he put em out and the dynamite didn t explode at all but it would have exploded in a mighty short time if he had kept away for the wood was about burned through in several places I know that s a true story because well because I know it Don t you call that man brave I asked The superintendent shook his head He was brave in that particular instance but he might not have been brave at another time You never can tell what a man will do in danger It depends on how he feels or on how a thing happens to strike him A man might act like a hero one day and like a coward another day with exactly the same danger in both cases There s a lot of chance in it If that man I m telling you about had been up late the night before or had eaten a tough piece of steak for breakfast the chances are he would have run like the rest III HOW JOSHUA PLUMSTEAD STUCK TO HIS NITROGLYCERIN VAT IN AN EXPLOSION AND SAVED THE WORKS I DROVE over from the works to Kenvil under the escort of a red nosed man who discoursed on local matters particularly on the prospects of his youngest son who was eighteen years old and earned three dollars a day What does he do I asked He s a packer said the red nosed man What does he pack Dynamite Guess there ain t no other stuff he c d pack an get them wages Jest the same I wish he d quit specially sence the big blow up t other day Why what blew up I inquired Freezing house did with an all fired big lot of nitroglycerin Nobody knows what set her off Reg lar miracle there wa n t a lot killed Man in charge feller named Ball he went out to look at a water pipe Hadn t been out the door a minute when off she went Say you d oughter seen the boys run They tell me some of em jumped clean through the winders sashes an all If ye want to know more about it there s my boy now he was right near the house when it happened We drew up at the Kenvil hotel where a young man was sitting Here was the modern dynamite worker and not at all as I had pictured him He looked like a summer boarder who liked to take things easy and wear good clothes Wondering much I sat down and talked to this young man a skilful dynamite packer it appears who happened at the time to be taking a day off They put me at machine packing a few days ago he said and it s made my wrist lame Going to rest until Monday After some preliminaries I asked him about the process of packing dynamite and he explained how the freshly mixed explosive is delivered at the various packing houses in little tubs a hundred pounds to a tub and how they dig into it with shovels and mold it into shape on the benches like so much butter and ram it into funnels and finally with the busy tamping of rubber shod sticks squeeze it down into the paper shells that form the cartridges One would say they play with concentrated death as children play with sawdust dolls but he declared it safe enough How large are the cartridges I asked Oh different sizes The smallest are about eight inches long and the largest thirty And they vary from one inch thick up to two and a half I know a man who carried a thirty inch cartridge all the way to Morristown in an ordinary passenger car He had it wrapped in a newspaper under his arm like a big loaf of bread But say he took chances all right At this another man informed us that people often carry nitroglycerin about with them and take no risk by simply pouring it into a big bottle of alcohol Then it can do no harm and when they want to use the explosive they have only to evaporate the alcohol The talk turned to precautions taken against accidents In all powder mills the workmen are required to change their clothes before entering the buildings and to put on rubber soled shoes There must be no bit of metal about a man s person no iron nail or buckle nothing that could strike fire and of course the workman who would bring a match on the premises would be counted worse than an assassin Just the same though matches get into the works once in a while remarked the young packer I found a piece of a match one day in a tub of dynamite it had the head on too Say it s bad enough to find buttons and pebbles but when I saw that match head well it made me weak in the knees This brought back the old question When does dynamite explode and when does it not explode I mentioned the red spark theory I think that s correct agreed the packer I ve watched em burn old dynamite boxes and if there are iron nails in the boxes they explode as soon as the nails get red hot if there are no nails they don t explode You mean empty boxes I asked Certainly but there s nitroglycerin in the wood lots of it It oozes out of the dynamite especially on a hot day and soaks into everything Why I suppose there s enough nitroglycerin in the overalls I wear to blow a man into well I wouldn t want to lay em on an anvil and give em a whack with a sledge There was a certain novelty to me in the thought of a pair of old overalls exploding but I was soon to hear of stranger things By this time other workmen had drawn up chairs and were ready now with modest contributions from their own experience Tell ye a queer thing said one man In that explosion the other day I mean the freezing house a car loaded with powder dynamite had just passed not a minute before the explosion Lucky for the three men with the car wasn t it But what gets me is how the blast when it came blew the harness off the horse Yes sir that s what it did clean off and away he went galloping after the men as hard as he could leg it Nobody touched a buckle or a strap It was dynamite unhitched that animal Dynamite did another trick that day put in a tall man It caught a bird on the wing Dunno whether twas a robin or a swaller but twas a bird all right Caught it in a sheet of tin blowed off the roof an jest twisted that little bird all up as it sailed along and when it struck the ground there was the bird fast in a cage made in the air out of a tin roof Alive Yes sir alive and that shows how fast dynamite does business So the talk ran on with many little details of explosions The expert explained that the air waves of a great concussion move along with crests and troughs like water waves and the shattering effect comes only at the crests so that all the windows might be broken in a house say half a mile from an explosion and no windows be broken in a house two hundred yards nearer The first house would have been smitten by a destructive wave crest the second passed over by a harmless wave trough And by the way when windows are broken by these blasts of concussion it appears that they are usually broken outward not inward and that the fragments are found on the ground outside the house not on the floors inside The reason of this is that the concussion waves leave behind them a partial vacuum and windows are broken by the air inside houses rushing out How about thunder storms I asked There is always danger said the expert and all hands hurry out of the works as soon as the lightning begins to play If a bolt struck a lot of dynamite it would set it off Then he explained that the policy of dynamite manufacturers is to handle explosives in small quantities say a ton at a time each lot being finished and hauled away in wagons before another lot is started This is possible because of the short time occupied in making dynamite He assured me for instance that if there were only raw materials at the works on a certain morning when the seven o clock whistle blew it would be perfectly possible to have a ton of dynamite cartridges finished packed in boxes and loaded on freight cars by nine o clock After this some one told of a thrilling happening in the mixing house by the great vat wherein nitroglycerin is mixed with porous earth called dope and becomes dynamite Over this vat four men work continually two with rakes two with hoes kneading half a ton or more of explosive dough to the proper consistency One day a powder car loaded with heavy stone got loose on its track a quarter of a mile up the slope and started down the steep grade The tracks ran straight into the mixing house The switch was open and the first thing these men knew there was an angry clang at the switch and then a swift heavy car was plunging toward the open door with every chance that it would set off twelve hundred pounds of dynamite there Workmen outside shouted and then stared in horror Not a man in the mixing house moved All four kept their places around the vat held tight to their rakes and hoes while the car just missing the dynamite hurled its mass of two tons through the back wall of the building and spent its force against a tree trunk There was no explosion and nothing happened which was something of a miracle but what impressed me was that these four men stood still not from courage but because they were frozen with fear Illustration A SWIFT HEAVY CAR WAS PLUNGING TOWARD THE OPEN DOOR While there is danger in every step of dynamite manufacture it appears that the center of peril is in the nitrating house where the fresh glycerin is mixed with nitric acid or more correctly is nitrated by it This operation takes place in a great covered vat about which are many pipes and stop cocks A man stands here like an engineer at the throttle watching his thermometer and letting in fresh glycerin These are his two duties and upon the right performance of them depends the safety of the works Every hour he must let in some seven hundred pounds of glycerin upon the deadly acid and every hour he must draw off some fifteen hundred pounds of nitroglycerin and let it go splashing away in a yellowish stream down the long uncovered trough that leads to the separating house yonder From this separating house runs another trough to the freezing house and a third to the distant mixing house These three troughs inclose an oblong space at the corners of which stand the nitrating house the separating house and the freezing house In each one of these at any hour of the day is a wagon load of pure nitroglycerin while in the three troughs are little rivers of nitroglycerin always flowing The arrangement of buildings in this part of the works makes clearer what was done at the nitrating house by a certain Joshua Plumstead in the recent explosion Joshua is a veteran at dynamite making He has worked at the nitrating vat for twenty five years and has probably made more nitroglycerin than any one man in the world He has been through all the great explosions he has seen many men killed he has stood by time and again when his own nitrating vat has taken fire and yet he always comes through safely They say there is no man like Joshua for nerve and judgment when the demons of gas and fire begin to play This explosion took place at the freezing house which is the one place in all the works where dynamite is never expected to explode Yet it did explode now with a smashing of air and a horrible grinding underfoot that stifled all things in men but a mad desire to flee Joshua Plumstead was in the nitrating house alone His helper had fled The roof timbers were crashing down about him He heard the hiss of fire and the shouts of workmen running He knew that a second explosion might come at any moment There was danger from fire brands and flying masses of stone and iron danger from the open troughs danger from the near by houses A shock a spark anywhere here might mean the end Plumstead kept his eyes on the long thermometer that reached up from the furious smoking mass of oil and acid The mercury had crept up from eighty five to ninety and was rising still At ninety five he knew the nitroglycerin would take fire probably explode and nothing could save it The vat was seething with a full charge Ninety one He shut off the inflow of glycerin Ninety two Something might be wrong with the coils of ice cold water that chill the vat down to safety He opened the cocks full Crash came a beam from overhead and narrowly missed the gearing of the agitating blades Were they to stop but for a single second the nitroglycerin would explode He eased the bearings turned on compressed air watched the thermometer and waited Illustration HE KNEW THAT A SECOND EXPLOSION MIGHT COME AT ANY MOMENT There was no other man but Plumstead who did wait that day there was none but he whose waiting could avail anything He had to fight it out alone with that ton of nitroglycerin or run and let an explosion come far worse than the other He fought it out he waited and he won Gradually the thermometer dropped to eighty five to eighty and the danger was passed But well even the superintendent admitted that Joshua did a rather fine thing here while the workmen themselves and the people of Kenvil shake their heads solemnly and vow that he saved the works THE LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER I HOW IT FEELS TO RIDE AT NIGHT ON A LOCOMOTIVE GOING NINETY MILES AN HOUR IT is eight point thirty P M any night you please and for miles through the yards of East Chicago lights are swinging semaphore arms are moving men in clicking signal towers are juggling with electric buttons and pneumatic levers target lights on a hundred switches are changing from red to green from green to red everything is clear everything is all right the Lake Shore Mail is coming with eighty tons of letters and papers in its pouches Relays of engines and engineers have brought these messages this news of the world thus far on their journey Up the Hudson they have come and across the Empire State and along the shores of Lake Michigan nearly a thousand miles in twenty four hours which is not so bad although the hottest maddest rush is yet to come It is a fine thing to know the men who drive the engines on these trains just to see them is something and to make them talk if you can do it is better business than interviewing most celebrities you have heard about To this end I set out one evening early in January for the great round house of the Northwestern road that lies on the outskirts of Chicago A strange place surely is this to one who approaches it unprepared a place where yellow eyes glare out of deep shadows where fire dragons rush at you with crunchings and snortings where the air hisses and roars It might be some demon menagerie there in the darkness To this place of fears and pitfalls I came an hour or so before starting time and here I found Dan White one of the Northwestern crack a jacks giving the last careful touches to locomotive nine hundred eight before the night s hard run In almost our first words my heart was won by something White said I had mentioned Frank Bullard of the Burlington road a rival by all rights and immediately this bluff broad shouldered man exclaimed Ah he s a fine fellow Bullard is and he knows how to run an engine White would fight Bullard at the throttle to any finish but would speak only good words of him Tell me said I about the great run you made the other night From a dozen lips I had heard of White s tremendous dash from Chicago to Clinton Iowa Oh it wasn t much we had to make the time up and we did it Didn t we Fred This to the fireman who nodded in assent but said nothing You made a record didn t you Well we went one hundred and thirty eight miles in one hundred and forty three minutes that included three stops and two slow downs I don t know as anybody has beat that much Illustration A PLACE WHERE YELLOW EYES GLARE OUT OF DEEP SHADOWS By dint of questioning I drew from this modest man some details of his achievement The curve bent stretch of seventeen miles between Franklin Grove and Nelson they did in fourteen minutes and a part of this beyond Nachusa they took at an eighty mile pace They covered five miles between Clarence and Stanwood in three minutes and a half and they made two miles beyond Dennison at over a hundred miles an hour As the mail rushed west word was flashed ahead and crowds gathered at the stations to cheer and marvel There must have been five hundred people on the platform at Dixon said White telling the story and they looked to me like a swarm of ants just a black wriggling mass and then they were gone We came on to a bridge there after a big reverse curve with a down grade and I guess no one will ever know how fast we were going as we slammed her around one way and then slammed her around the other way It was every bit of ninety miles an hour You got all you wanted didn t you Fred The fireman looked up torch in hand and remarked in a dry monotone Goin through Dixon I said my prayers and hung on stretched out flat That s what I done Fred and I continued White both got letters about the run from the superintendent Here s mine if you d like to read it The pleasure of these two blackened men over this graciousness of the superintendent was a thing to see For such a bit of paper crumpled and smeared with oil I believe they would have taken the Mississippi at a jump engine train and all Superintendent s orders superintendent s praise there is the beginning and end of all things for them My first long ride on one of these splendid locomotives was with the Burlington night mail no passengers five hundred ninety pulling her and Frank Bullard at the throttle It is said that the Baldwin Locomotive Works never turned out a faster engine than this five hundred ninety The man must be a giant whose head will top her drivers and for all her seventy tons there is speed in every line of her She is a young engine too only four years old and Bullard swears he will back her in the matter of getting over rails to do anything that steel and steam can do She s willing and gentle sir and easy running You ll see in a minute These words from Bullard first class engine driver of the C B Q a long loosely jointed man with the eye and build of a scout As he spoke they were coupling us to the mail cars in preparation for the start In overalls and sweater I had come with type written authority to make the run that night This was in the first week in January the second time Bullard had drawn the throttle for Burlington on the new fast schedule Burlington lay off there in Iowa on the Mississippi with all the night and all the State of Illinois between us Now the train stands ready three mail cars and the engine not a stick besides No Pullman comforts here no bunks for sleeping no man aboard who has the right to sleep Everything is hustle and business Already the mail clerks are swarming at the pouches like printers on a rush edition See those last bags swung in through the panel doors Not even the president of the road may ride here without a permit from the government Bullard takes up a red smoking torch and looks five hundred ninety over He fills her cups and prods a two foot oiler into her rods and bearings Dan Cleary the fireman looks out of his window on the left and chews complacently Down the track beside him locomotive thirteen oh nine backs up a first class engine she but five hundred ninety bulks over her as the king of a herd might over some good ordinary working elephant As she stands here now purring through her black iron throat five hundred ninety measures sixteen feet three inches from rails to stack top Both engines blow out steam that rolls up in silver clouds to the electric lights Bullard climbs to his place at the right and a hiss of air tells that he is testing the brakes Under each car sixteen iron shoes close against sixteen wheels and stay there Down the length of the train goes the repair man with his kit and makes sure that every contact is right then pulls a rope four times at the rear whereupon four hissing signals answer in the cab Bullard shuts off the air It s all there is to stop her with says he so we take no chances with it She s got high speed brakes on her five hundred ninety has one hundred and ten pounds to the inch Twenty four Dan he adds and snaps his watch We start at thirty Dan chews on Bad wind to night he says reg lar gale Bullard nods I know it we re fifteen minutes late too Make Burlington on time Got to you hit it up and I ll skin her Twenty six Dan Four minutes to wait Two station officials come up with polite inquiries The thermometer is falling they say and we shall have it bitter cold over the plains They reach up with cordial hand shakes I pull my cap down and take my stand behind Bullard Our side of the cab is quite cut off from the fireman s side by a swelling girth of boiler which leaves an alleyway at right and left wide enough for a man s body and no wider Bullard and I are in the right hand alleyway Bullard s back and black cap just before me Dan with his shovel is out on a shaky steel shelf behind that bridges the space between engine and tender That is where he works poor lad We are breathing coal dust and torch smoke and warm oil F s s s s s comes the signal and instantly we are moving Lights flash about us everywhere green lights white lights red lights a phantasmagoria of drug store bottles The tracks shine yellow far ahead A steady pounding and jarring begins and grows like the roar of battle Our cab heaves with the tugging of a captive balloon Our speed increases amazingly We seem constantly on the point of running straight through blocks of houses and escape only by sudden and disconcerting swayings around curves that all lead one will vow straight into black chasms under the dazzle Whoever rides here for the first time feels that he is ticketed for sure destruction understands that this plunging engine must necessarily go off the rails in two or three minutes say five at the latest for what guidance he reasons can any man get from a million crazy lights and who that is human can avoid a snarl in such a tangle of bumping switches I am free to confess for my own part that I found the first half hour of my ride on five hundred ninety absolutely terrifying Thus at break neck speed we come out of Chicago all slow going city ordinances to the contrary notwithstanding We are chasing a transcontinental record schedule and have fifteen minutes to make up I breathe more freely as we get into open country We are going like the wind but the track is straighter and the darkness comfortable I begin to notice things with better understanding As the lurches come I brace myself against the boiler side without fear of burning that is something learned I find out later that I owe this protection to a two inch layer of asbestos I catch a faint sound of the engine bell and discover to my surprise that it has been ringing from the start indeed it rings without ceasing all the way to Burlington the rope pulled by a steam jerking contrivance but the roar of the engine drowns it Deep shadows inwrap the cab all the deeper for the glare that flashes through them every minute or two as Dan back there on his iron shelf stokes coal in at the red hot door Two faint lights burn for the gages a jumping water column in front a pair of wavering needles on the boiler These Bullard watches coolly and from time to time reaches back past me to turn the injector cock whereupon steam hisses by my head For the most part he is quite still like an Indian pilot head forward at the lookout window right hand down by the air brake valve left hand across the throttle lever with only a second s jump to the reversing lever that rises up from the floor straight before him As we race into towns and roar through them he sounds the chime whistle making its deep voice challenge the darkness At curves he eases her with the brakes And for grades and level stretches and bridges he notches the throttle up or down as the need is Watch his big strong grip on the polished handles Think of the hours he spends here all alone this man who holds life and death in his quick sure judgment Now he catches the window frame and slides it open A blast sweeps in like an arctic hurricane Bullard leans out into the night and seems to listen Try it he cries but his voice is faint I put my head out and come into a rush of air billows that strangle like breakers Illustration AT THE THROTTLE Greggs Hill three miles long Let her go soon He closes the window And now as we clear the grade begins a burst of speed that makes the rest of small account Faster and faster we go until the very iron seems alive and straining underneath us I am tossed about in hard pitches The glow of the furnace lights up continuously There is no sense of fear any longer It is too splendid what we are doing Of course it means instant death if anything breaks Let the massive side rod that holds the two drivers snap and a half ton knife sweeping seventy miles an hour will slice off our cab and us with it like a cut of cheese Did not an engineer go to his death that way only last week on the Union Pacific run After all why not this death as well as any other Have we not valves and tubes in our bodies that may snap at any moment How fast I call out Eighty miles an hour says Bullard close to my ear and a moment later pulls the rope for a grade crossing Ooooo ooooo oo oo answers the deep iron voice two long and two short calls as the code requires Year ago killed two men here he shouts as we whiz over the road Struck buggy threw men sixty feet I wonder how far we would throw them now In the two hundred and six miles run to the Mississippi we stop only twice for water at Mendota and at Galesburg nine minutes wasted for the two and the gale blowing harder Our schedule makes allowance for no stops every moment from our actual going is so much dead time that must be fought for second by second and made up Drive her as he will with all the cunning of his hand Bullard can score but small gains against the wind And some of these he loses At Mendota we have made up seven minutes but we pull out thirteen minutes late At Princeton we are fifteen minutes late at Galva fourteen minutes at Galesburg eight minutes but we pull out twelve minutes late Then we make the last forty three miles including bridges towns grades and curves in forty four minutes and draw into Burlington at one point twenty two A M on time to the dot This because Bullard had sworn to do it also because the road beyond Galesburg runs west instead of southwest and it is easier for a train to bore straight through a gale head on than to take it from the quarter We took the big steady curve at Princeton a down grade helping us at a hundred miles an hour so Bullard declares and what he says about engine driving I believe Indeed these great bursts can be measured only by the subtle senses of an expert since no registering instrument has been devised to make reliable record Across the twin high bridges that span the Bureau creeks we shot with a rush that left the reverberations far back in the night like two short barks And just as we rounded a curve before these bridges I saw a black face peering down from the boiler top while a voice called out Wahr wahr wahr wahr To which startling apparition Bullard undisturbed replied Wahr wahr wahr wahr Then the head disappeared Dan from his side was telling Bullard that he had seen the safety light for the bridges and Bullard was answering something about hitting it up harder How these men understand each other in such tumult is a mystery to one with ordinary hearing but somehow they manage it Half way between Kewanee and Galva a white light came suddenly into view far ahead I knew it for the headlight of a locomotive coming toward us on the parallel track Already we had met two or three trains and swept past them with a smashing of sound and air But this headlight seemed different from the others paler in its luster not so steady in its glare The ordinary locomotive comes at you with a calm staring yellow eye that grows until it gets to be a huge full moon But it comes gradually without much jumping or wavering This light danced and flashed like a great white diamond I watched it with a certain fascination and as it came nearer and nearer realized that here was a train of different kind from the others coming down on us at terrific speed And Bullard shouted Number eight with the mail Then added as the train passed like the gleam of a knife She s going too II WE PICK UP SOME ENGINE LORE AND HEAR ABOUT THE DEATH OF GIDDINGS THE next day with comfortable rocking chairs to sit in and a row of hotel windows before us Bullard and I found time for engine chat and I was well content First I asked him about putting his head out of the cab window there at Greggs Hill and elsewhere Was it to see better said I No said Bullard it was to hear better and to smell better Hear what Smell what Hear the noises of the engine If any little thing was working wrong I d hear it If there was any wear on the bearings I d hear it Why if a mouse squeaked somewhere inside of five hundred ninety I guess I d hear it Then he went on to explain that the ordinary roar of the engine which drowned everything for me was to him an unimportant background of sound that made little impression and left his ears free for other sounds I get so accustomed to listening to an engine he added that often up home talking with my wife and child I find myself trying to hear sounds from the round house And after a run I talk to people as if they were deaf You spoke about smelling better That s right I can smell a hot box in a minute or oil burning All engineers can Why there was This led to the story of poor Giddings killed on five hundred ninety three years before through this very necessity of putting his head out of the cab window Giddings had Bullard s place and was one of the most trusted men in the Burlington employ You saw last night said Bullard how the boiler in five hundred ninety shuts off the engineer from the fireman And prob ly you noticed those posts along the road that hold the tell tale strings They re to warn crews on freight car tops when it is time to duck for bridges Well Giddings was coming along one night between Biggsville and Gladstone that s about ten miles before you get to the Mississippi He was driving her fast to make up time sixty miles an hour easy and he put his head out to hear and to smell the way I ve explained it There must have been a post set too near the track and anyway five hundred ninety s cab is extra wide so the first thing he knew and he didn t know that his head was knocked clean off or as good as that and there was five hundred ninety her throttle wide open tearing along with a fireman stoking for all he was worth and a dead engineer hanging out the window So they ran for eight miles and Billy Maine he was firing never suspected anything wrong for of course he couldn t see until they struck the Mississippi bridge at full speed You remember crossing the bridge just before we pulled in here It s twenty two hundred feet long and we always give a long whistle before we get to it and then slow down That s the law he added smiling and besides there s a draw to look out for When he heard no whistle this time Billy Maine jumped around quick to where Giddings was and then he saw he had a corpse for a partner Illustration THEY STRUCK THE MISSISSIPPI BRIDGE AT FULL SPEED Another question I asked was about stopping a train at great speed for an emergency how quickly could they do it I ve stopped said Bullard in nine hundred and fifty feet pulling five cars that were making about sixty two miles an hour I don t know what I could do with this new train only three cars and going eighty or ninety miles an hour That s a hard proposition Would you reverse her No sir All engineers who know their business will agree on that I d shut the throttle off and put the brakes on full But I wouldn t reverse her If I did the wheels would lock in a second and the whole business would skate ahead as if you d put her on ice Then we talked about the nerve it takes to run an engine and how a man can lose his nerve It s like a lion tamer who wakes up some morning and finds that he s afraid Then his time has come to quit taming lions for the beasts will know it if he doesn t and kill him There are men who can stand these high speed runs for ten years but few go beyond that term or past the forty five year point Slow going passenger trains will do for them after that Others break down after five years Many engineers skilled men too would rather throw up their jobs than take the run Bullard makes Not that they feel the danger to be so much greater in pushing the speed up to seventy eighty or ninety miles an hour but they simply cannot stand the strain of doing the thing This doubling up is what breaks my heart said Bullard Since they ve put on their new schedule I have to divide five hundred ninety with another fellow John Kelly takes her on the fast run East while I wait here and rest And so I ve lost my sweetheart and I don t feel near as much interest in her as I did You see she ain t mine any more And between you and me he added confidentially I don t think five hundred ninety likes it much herself you see engines are a good deal like girls after all The next night in workman s garb again I made my way to a gloomy round house ready for the run to Omaha I was to ride the second relay as far as Creston on locomotive twelve oh one with Jake Myers in the cab so I had been informed Being hours ahead of time I saw something of round house life First I followed a gaunt black faced Swede with stubby beard through his duties as locomotive hostler saw him take the tired engines in hand as they came in one after another from hard runs and care for them as stable hostlers care for horses There were fires to be dropped in the clinker pit coal and wood to be loaded in from the chutes water tanks to be filled sand boxes looked after and finally there was the hitching fast of the weary monsters in empty stalls whither they were led from the lumbering turn table with the last head of steam left over dead fire boxes And now spoke the Swede Dem big passenger engines can werry easy climb over dem blocks and go through the brick wall and he pointed to a great semicircle of cold engine noses ranged along not two feet from the round house wall Later on in the dimly lighted locker room I listened to round house men swapping yarns about accidents and to threats of a fireman touching a certain yardmaster set apart by general consent for a licking Finally an Irishman came in James Byron and for all his good natured face he seemed in ill humor It turned out that he had just received a hurry order to take twelve oh one out in Myers s place Jake is sick he said and they ve sent for me But I m sick too Was in bed with the grip Just took ten grains of quinine Say I ain t any more fit to run an engine than I am to run a Sunday school Then he began pulling on his overalls while the others laughed at him told him he was scared of the fast run and said good by with mock seriousness But Byron showed himself a good soldier and soon was working over twelve oh one with a will inspecting every inch of her torch in hand and he assured me he would take her through all right grip or no grip And take her through he did At one point sixteen A M my old friend locomotive five hundred ninety brought the flier up from Chicago six minutes ahead of the schedule Kelly had done himself proud this time And six minutes later on time to the minute we drew out behind twelve oh one with Byron handling her and seventy tons of mail following after Our fireman was named Bellamy He wore isinglass goggles against the heat and in his way he was a humorist as I discovered presently when he came close to me we were running at a sixty mile gait and grinning like a Dante demon remarked slowly Say if we go in the ditch will you come along The first feature of this run was some trouble with a feed pipe from the tank which brought us to a sudden standstill in the open night with a great hissing of steam What is it I asked of Bellamy while Byron grumbling maledictions hammered under the truck Check valve stuck water can t get into the boiler How did he know it Water gage What if he hadn t noticed it Bellamy smiled in half contempt Say if he hadn t noticed it for fifteen minutes we d have been sailing over them trees about this time in pieces She d have bust her boiler Five minutes lost here and we were off again running presently into a thick fog then into rain and finally into a snow storm Never shall I forget the illusion due to our great speed that the flakes were rushing at us horizontally shooting upward in sharp curves over the engine s headlight And as we swept on the shadow of twelve oh one advanced beside us on the stretch of white snow as smoothly and silently as the tail of an eclipse The engine itself was a noisy hurrying affair but the engine s shadow was as calm and quiet as a cloud And I recall that the swiftness of our rush this night caused in me neither fear nor any particular emotion although this was practically the same experience that had stirred me so the night before on five hundred ninety And I realized that riding on a swift locomotive may become a matter of course like other strange things III SOME MEMORIES OF THE GREAT RECORD BREAKING RUN FROM CHICAGO TO BUFFALO THERE is a place in New York the very last place one would think of where stories without end may be heard about locomotives and the men who drive them it is not a place of grime and steam but a quiet and luxurious club spreading over the top floor of a very tall building on Forty second Street and here every day at luncheon time railroad officials gather superintendents managers and various heads of departments men who may have grown prosperous and portly but are always proud to talk about the boys at the throttle and recall experiences of their own in certain exciting runs In the wide hall near the entrance of this Transportation Club is a driving wheel green painted from the De Witt Clinton the first locomotive that drew a passenger train in the State of New York It is scarcely larger than a wagon wheel though made of iron and an inscription sets forth how it made the historic run from Albany to Schenectady on August nine eighteen thirty one The walls show many pictures famous locomotives scenes of accidents and there are thrilling memories here in abundance if one have with him some veteran of the road to recall them It s not always the most serious accidents that frighten a man most remarked a high official on the New York Central one day while the rest of us listened One of the worst scares I ever had was on a freight train when there really wasn t anything to be scared about We had just pulled out of Ottumwa Iowa one dark night with a caboose full of passengers when rump ump bang rip You never heard such a racket First one end of the car was lifted up off the rails and slammed down again and then the other end was treated the same way up and down we went bump bump bump and smash went the window and out went the lights Now what do you suppose it was Hog under the wheels suggested one of the group More likely a mule said another There s nothing so tough as the hind leg of a mule Isn t a car wheel made that ll cut through one It wasn t a mule or a hog and it wasn t anything alive but it got us into a panic all right We waved a lantern like fury to the engineer ahead but he didn t see it for a good while and we just bumped along expecting every second to be split into kindling wood We stopped at last and found it was a beer keg yes sir an empty beer keg that had got caught under the caboose between the rear axle and the bolster of the truck and had rolled along over the ties with the car balanced on it like a man riding a rail Wasn t broken either no sir not a bit and we had to chisel through every blamed hoop before we could get it out Talk about making things strong that beer keg was a wonder I had a more exciting experience than that said another official he was in the freight handling department It was a long time ago yes back in sixty three I remember getting out at a station near Cincinnati to look at some soldiers and before I knew it the train started I was up by the engine and as the drivers began to turn I jumped on the cow catcher You see I had often ridden there being a railroad man and the engineer knew me Illustration AS THE DRIVERS BEGAN TO TURN I JUMPED ON THE COW CATCHER Everything went well for a few miles and I sat on the bumper enjoying the rush of air for it was a hot summer s day but presently as we swung around a curve the engine gave a fearful shriek and just ahead I saw a farmer s wagon crossing the track There were two old men on the seat and an old white horse in the shafts The men were so busy talking they never heard the whistle or perhaps they were deaf Anyhow we were right on them before they looked up and then they were too dazed to do anything One of them made a grab for the reins but I saw it was too late and I drew my legs up off the bumper and leaned back against the end of the boiler I must have made a picture as I crouched there and the next second Well said somebody Well I guess you wouldn t care to hear how things looked the next second We struck the white horse just back of his forelegs and I had him on my lap for a hundred yards or so No it didn t hurt me but it wasn t pleasant The two old men I don t think they felt anything it was so sudden they just passed out No I didn t see them but I can tell you this I ve never ridden on the cow catcher of a locomotive since that day There followed some talk about fast runs and all agreed that for out and out excitement there is nothing in railroading to equal a man s sensations in one of those mad bursts of speed that are ventured upon now and then by locomotives in record breaking trials The heart never pounds with apprehension in a real accident as it does through imminent fear of an accident And so great is the nerve strain and brain strain upon the men who drive our ordinary fliers that three hours at a stretch is as much as the stanchest engineer can endure running at fifty or sixty miles an hour So you see said one of the officials the problem of higher speeds than we have at present involves more than boiler power and strength of machinery and the swiftness of turning wheels it involves the question of human endurance We can build engines that will run a hundred and fifty miles an hour but where shall we find the men to drive them Already we have nearly reached the limit of what eyes and nerves can endure I guess we ll have to find a new race of men to handle these locomotives of the future that they talk so much about He went on to consider the chance of color blindness in an engineer and told how the men s eyes are regularly tested by experts who put before them skeins of various colored yarns and make them pick out green from red and so on It is not pleasant to think what might happen if an engineer s eyes should suddenly fail him and he should mistake the danger light for safety and go ahead at some critical moment instead of stopping Nor does one like to fancy what might happen if an engineer should go mad at his post I know one case where an engineer did go mad remarked a superintendent He was one of our most experienced men and had held the throttle for years on the fastest trains Then one Sunday for no reason at all he went to the round house got out the pony locomotive that s the one fixed up with a little parlor over the boiler and easy chairs and polished wood it makes a pretty observation car for big officials Well he got her out and started lickety split up the main line running wild and without orders He stopped at Mott Haven and told the men he wanted the pony rebuilt and silver plated crazy as a loon you see Yes he s in the asylum now poor fellow that was his last run After this one of the group gave his memories of the famous speed trial on the Lake Shore road when five locomotives in relays driven by picked men set out to beat all records in a run of five hundred ten miles from Chicago to Buffalo This was in October eighteen ninety five and I suppose such elaborate preparations for a dash over the rails were never made All traffic was suspended for the passage of this racing special every railroad crossing between Chicago and Buffalo was patrolled by a section man that alone meant thirteen hundred guards and every switch was spiked half an hour before the train was due The chief officials of the Lake Shore road proposed to ride this race in person and if possible smash the New York Central s then recent world s record of sixty three point sixty one miles an hour including all stops over the four thousand three hundred sixty one two miles between New York and Buffalo They had before them a longer run than that and hoped to score a greater average speed per mile but they wished to come through alive and were taking no chances It was half past three in the morning and frosty weather when the train started from Chicago with Mark Floyd at the throttle and various important people general managers superintendents editors et cetera on the cars behind There were two parlor coaches weighing ninety two thousand five hundred pounds each and a millionaire s private car one of the finest and heaviest in the country weighing one hundred nineteen thousand five hundred pounds which made a total load counting engine and train of something over two hundred tons The first relay was eighty seven miles to Elkhart Indiana and the schedule they hoped to follow required that they cover this distance in seventy eight minutes including nine slow downs Eighty seven miles in seventy eight minutes was well enough but the superintendent of the Western Division had set his heart on doing it in seventy five minutes and had promised Mark Floyd two hundred good cigars for every quarter of a minute he could cut under that time But alas for human plans Between up grades and the darkness they pulled into Elkhart at five minutes to five which was eighty five minutes for the eighty seven miles not bad going but it left them seven minutes behind the schedule and left Mark to console himself with his old clay pipe Illustration A RECORD BREAKING RUN One hundred and thirty one seconds were lost at Elkhart in changing locomotives and it was three minutes to five when big five hundred ninety nine with Dave Luce in the cab turned her nose toward the dawning day and started for Toledo one hundred thirty three miles away Great things were expected in this relay for about half of it was straight as a bird s flight and down grade too so that hopes were high of making up lost time especially as Luce had the reputation of stopping at nothing when it was a question of getting there He certainly did wonders and five minutes after the start he had the train at a sixty two mile gait and ten minutes later at a sixty seven mile gait Then they struck frost on the rails and the speed dropped while the time takers studied their stopwatches with serious faces At ten minutes to six they reached Waterloo and the long straight stretch As they whizzed past the station Dave pulled open his throttle to the last notch and yelled to his fireman Here was where they had to do things Butler was seventy one two miles away the first town in the down grade and they made it in six minutes and forty seconds nearly sixty eight miles an hour In the next seven miles Dave pushed her up to seventy an hour then to seven hundred twenty one two and let her out in a great burst which made the passengers sit up and showed for several miles a top notch rate of eighty seven miles an hour Nevertheless taking account of frost and slow downs they barely finished the relay on schedule time so that for the whole run they were still seven minutes behind time the schedule they had set themselves called for such tremendous speed that it seemed almost impossible to make up a single lost minute The third relay was one hundred eight miles to Cleveland and they did it in one hundred four minutes including many slow downs and a heart breaking loss of four minutes when a section hand red flagged the train and brought it to a dead stop from a seventy mile gait because he had found a broken rail The officials were in such a state of tension that they would almost have preferred chancing it on the rail to losing those four minutes There is a point of eagerness in railroad racing where it seems nothing to risk one s life The train drew out of Cleveland nineteen minutes behind the time they should have made for a world s record Every man had done his best every locomotive had worked its hardest but fate seemed against them and hopes of beating the Central s fast run were fading rapidly The fourth relay was to Erie nine hundred fifty one two miles and some said that Jake Gardner with five hundred ninety eight might pull them out of the hole but the others shook their heads At any rate Jake did better than those who had preceded him and he danced that train along at seventy five eighty eighty four miles an hour so the watches said and averaged sixty seven miles an hour for the whole relay It s the kind of thing that makes you taste your heart and packs a week into ten minutes said the superintendent telling about it You may take one ride smashing around curves at eighty miles an hour but you ll never take another Still in spite of these brave efforts they pulled out of Erie fifteen minutes late and started on the last relay with gloomy faces It was eighty six miles to Buffalo the end of the race and they must be there by eleven thirty one to win which called for an average speed of over seventy miles an hour including slow downs No train in the world had ever approached such an average and their own racing average since leaving Chicago was much below it So what hope was there There was hope in a tall sparely built man named Bill Tunkey whom nobody knew much about except that he was a good engineer with a rather clumsy ten wheel locomotive not considered very desirable in a race All the other locomotives had been eight wheelers Still the new engine had one advantage that she carried water enough in her tank for the whole run and need not slow up to refill as the others had done She had another advantage that she carried Tunkey one of those men who rise up in sudden emergencies and do things whether they are possible or not It was not possible everybody vowed to reach Buffalo Creek by eleven thirty one All right said Tunkey quietly and then Within forty rods of the start he had his engine going thirty miles an hour and he pressed her harder and harder until eleven miles out of Erie she struck an eighty mile pace and held it as far as Brockton when she put forth all her strength and did a burst of five miles in thirty one two minutes one of these miles at the rate of nine hundred twenty one four miles an hour as the watches showed And I never want any more of that in mine said the superintendent The next town was Dunkirk where a local ordinance put a ten mile limit on the speed of trains Tunkey smiled as they roared past the station at more than eighty A crowd lined the tracks here for the telegraph had carried ahead the news of a hair raising run That crowd was only a blur to staring frightened eyes at the car windows The officials were beginning to realize what kind of an engineer they had ahead this time Whizzzzz How they did run Wahr Wahr barked the little bridges and were left behind H o o o bellowed a tunnel And rip whrrr as they slammed around a double reverse curve with a vicious swing that made the bolts rattle in the last car Men put their mouths to other men s ears and tried to say that perhaps mister Tunkey was getting a little overzealous Much good that did mister Tunkey had the bit in his teeth now and was playing the game alone At eleven six they swept past Silver Creek with twenty nine miles to go and twenty five minutes to make it in Hurrah They had made up time enough to save them At eleven twenty they passed Lake View Twelve miles more and eleven minutes yelled somebody waving his hat Toboggan slide all the way yelled somebody else We ll do it easy Hooray They passed Athol Springs at eleven twenty four all mad with excitement They had seven minutes left for eight miles and were cheering already We ll make it with half a minute to spare said the only man in the private car who was reasonably cool He was six seconds out of the way for they crossed the line twenty six seconds before eleven thirty one and won the race by less than half a minute beating the New York Central s record per mile on the whole run by the fraction of a second and beating the whole world s record in the last relay by several minutes the figures standing Tunkey s figures eighty six miles from Erie to Buffalo in seventy minutes and forty six seconds or an average speed of seventy two point ninety one miles an hour Do said the official What did we do Why we we He paused helplessly and then added with a grin Well we didn t do a thing to Tunkey IV WE HEAR SOME THRILLING STORIES AT A ROUNDHOUSE AND REACH THE END OF THE BOOK IT was in the round house at Forty fifth Street a place of drip and steam and oil smears that I listened to Bronson and Lewis two good men at the throttle as they held forth on the subject of killing people with an engine After all it s an easy death said Bronson I know said Lewis but I don t like it just the same I mean killing em Last one I killed observed Bronson was a woman wife of a congressman they said all done up in furs Member her Up by New Rochelle Yes sir there at the platform end where they ve made a path over the tracks Too lazy to follow the road those folks are Take a short cut and get killed Well this congressman s wife she sauntered across just as I came through with the express Never turned her head Never heard the whistle Queer about women ain t it Lewis nodded Had four minutes to make up and we were going good fifty five an hour easy Slammed the brakes on but pshaw Congressman s wife she stopped the last second and that settled it If she d taken one more step I d have scraped by her but she stopped Had to kill her What s a man to do Why did she stop I asked Oh some idea Prob ly forgot where she was Nice lady Makes a man sick Tell ye what I think said Lewis I think there s women start across a track to take a chance If they get hit it s all right and if they don t it s all right Same as girls pull leaves off a flower to see if some fellow loves em There was She didn t do that put in Bronson I don t say she did but some might There was a woman up at Larchmont walked across in front of me the other day Had a baby too in her arms Now why should a woman start over four tracks just as I was coming and walk slow if she didn t want to take a chance Mind you I was on the far side and she had to cross three tracks before she got to mine And all the time I had the whistle wide open Why a dog would have heard that whistle and got out o the way Did you I began Hit her I didn t know at the time it was such a close call Thought I had but I found out afterward she got past by the skin of her teeth Bet you she d had some trouble Thought she might as well quit the game and take the baby along Then mebbe she was glad when she got across safe Can t tell reflected Bronson I b lieve there s such a thing as people getting drawn to a train I don t mean by the suction but drawn by the idea of its going so blamed fast and being so strong especially people sick or down on their luck Now last year I was coming through Rye one morning and as I struck the bridge after that reverse curve I saw two young fellows running along the No three track away from me I was on No one track so they were all right but as I came up they both swung over to No one and I cut em all to bits Turned out they were a couple of lads that had tramped it down from Boston goin to enlist They were weak and hungry and I think they just gave up to the train because they couldn t help it Might be said Bronson Tell ye who was the nerviest man I ever killed went on Lewis Fellow in West Haven Say but we were coming that night Northampton express ye know and a down grade over the salt meadows First thing I knew a man was standing at the side of the track fairly close but not where he d get hit I thought he was some friend of mine in West Haven trying to make me whistle But when I got near him say a hundred feet away he stepped out between the rails and stood there a few seconds with his arms lifted and a smile on his face quite a pretty smile Then just as I was on him he turned and knelt between the rails I got the brakes on quick as I could emergency and everything but I couldn t stop her in less than a length and a half and well I guess you don t want to know what that engine looked like when I went over her I know said Bronson they scatter something terrible Say I ve noticed that sort of pleasant look in their faces too Once I was waiting on a siding and a man came up and spoke to me very polite and wanted to know if I d please give him a drink of water I told him the water in my tank was too warm to drink but I let him have my cup and showed him where there was a spring right near He thanked me and walked over to it and I watched him bend down and take two good drinks then he brought the cup back and thanked me again Illustration DRAWN BY THE IDEA OF ITS GOING SO BLAMED FAST AND BEING SO STRONG Any train along here soon he asked Which way said I Don t matter which way said he There s an up train due now said I she s the one I m waiting for Is she a fast train he asked Fair said I bout fifty an hour along here That s good said he and I wondered what he meant He seemed like a nice man Pretty soon along came the up train and I saw him run down the track to meet her Then he stopped faced sideways and let himself fall square across the rails Say I was mighty glad I d fixed it so he had that drink of water That was his last drink Queer how they like to be hit by a fast express reflected Lewis when a slow freight would do just as well Now that man at West Haven the one who took it kneeling down he d waited around the tracks all day the section gang saw him and he wasn t doing a thing but picking out a train fast enough for him He d stand ready for one but when she d turn out to be an accommodation or something slow he d step away Didn t propose to shake hands with anything under fifty an hour Mine was the first one suited him Do you ever think of their faces I asked ever see them at night the way they looked when you struck them No said Bronson can t say I ever do Neither did Lewis And I judge that engine drivers are not deeply affected by these sad occurrences Which is fortunate for few escape them Indeed in going about from engine to engine I found the following dialogue repeated over and over again Ever in a collision No sir Ever go off the track No sir Ever kill anybody Oh yes Why only last week I struck a Then would follow a story of sudden death And they all spoke in a kindly but matter of fact way as if these swift executions were part of their business And I have it from a veteran that any engine driver would sooner hit a man than a hog for a hog is very apt to wreck the train a hog is worse than a horse whereas a man makes no trouble he simply gets killed Near the roaring round house at Mott Haven is another interesting place the Young Men s Christian Association Car which is not a car at all but a dingy shed built of four cars and serving as lunch room wash room reading room and sleeping room for men of the trains This is a homely refuge spot where any morning we may meet engineers resting after a hard night s run or making ready to go out again Let us drop in and join one of the groups Here is a man telling about the mad run Big Arthur made the other night down from Albany We get just the tail of the story So the superintendent he ripped around about how they were twenty seven minutes late and Big Arthur he sat in the cab and never said a word Now says the superintendent rather sarcastic I suppose you know this is the Empire State Express you re running Yep says Big Arthur Well do you know what time she s supposed to pull into the Grand Central Yep says Big Arthur again and that s all he did say but holy smoke how they went Had those porters on the private car scared green A hundred miles an hour some o the way and they came in on time to the dot Oh you can t beat these new engines with the fire box over the trailer but say wasn t that great when Big Arthur snapped out Yep to the old man I asked if I might see Big Arthur and one of the engineers said he d be along pretty soon and in the meantime he told me about the individuality of locomotives how one is good tempered and willing while another is cranky how the same locomotive will act differently at different times just as people have whims and how some locomotives are fated to ill luck so that nobody wants to drive them Take these ten new engines the company s just put on They re the finest and strongest made a whole lot better than the ones we ve thought were wonders on the Empire State They re beauties and all exactly alike measurements all the same but every one of em has its own points good and bad One will go faster than another with just the same steam One will pull a heavier load with less coal And very likely there ll be some kind of a hoodoo on one of em Takes time though to find out these things It s like getting acquainted with a man Other men came in now and the talk changed to accidents I asked if an engineer plans ahead what he will do in a collision It seemed reasonable that a man always under such menace would have settled his mind on some prospective action But they laughed at the idea and declared that an engineer can no more tell how he will act in an emergency than the ordinary citizen can say what he would do in a fire or how he would meet a burglar One engineer would jump another would stick to his throttle and the chances of being killed were as good one way as the other Illustration CONVICTS HAD REVOLVERS ALL RIGHT THAT TRIP AND DENNY THREW UP HIS HANDS The mention of a burglar led one of the new comers to tell of William Powell s adventure with some Sing Sing convicts Powell was the oldest engineer on the New York Central He died a year ago and this thing happened back in the seventies It seems there was a trestle over the track about half a mile below the Sing Sing station and on this trestle some convicts working in the quarry used to run little cars loaded with stone and dump them into the larger cars underneath Of course they worked under the surveillance of well armed guards On one occasion however four or five convicts out witted the guards by dropping from the trestle upon the tender of a moving locomotive and the first thing the engineer knew he was set upon by a band of desperate men who covered him and his fireman with revolvers At the same moment half a dozen shots rang out and bullets came crashing through the cab sides from the guards firing at random after the fleeing engine Altogether it was quite the reverse of pleasant for William Powell Out you go now quick said the convicts we ll run this engine ourselves The engine was No one hundred five Powell s pride and pet and he could not bear to have unregenerate hands laid upon her so he spoke up very politely Let me run her for you gentlemen I ll go wherever you say They agreed to this and some distance down the line left the engine and departed into the woods And the joke of it was concluded the narrator that the revolvers those convicts had were made of wood painted black and couldn t shoot any more than the end of a broom It was a big bluff but it worked Wasn t any bluff when Denny Cassin got held up at Sing Sing said another engineer Convicts had revolvers all right that trip and Denny threw up his hands same as any man would That was twenty years ago on old engine eighty nine It was right at the Sing Sing station and three of em jumped into the cab all of a sudden and told Denny to open her up and you bet he did Then they told him to jump and he jumped but first he managed to fix her tank valves so she d pump herself full of water and stop before she d gone far That was Denny s great scheme and he walked along laughing to think how mad those convicts would be in a few minutes It turned out though that Denny spoiled a nice trap they d laid up at Tarrytown to catch those fellows when they got there You see the telegraph operator wired up the line that a runaway locomotive was coming with three escaped convicts on her and the train despatcher at Tarrytown just set the switch so the locomotive would sail plump over a twelve foot stone embankment down into the Hudson River That s what would have happened to those convicts if Denny had left his tank valves alone but of course eighty nine got water logged long before she reached Tarrytown she just kicked out her cylinder ends a few miles up the track and stopped Then the convicts climbed down and skipped away Two of em got caught afterward but there was one they never caught Presently somebody reported that Big Arthur was out in the round house getting twenty nine ninety four ready to take out the Empire State It was clear enough that Big Arthur was an important figure in the eyes of these begrimed men and setting forth across the yards I came upon him presently torch in hand looking over his deep purring locomotive against the dangers of the run Another engineer by the fire box was discussing a theory of some of the boys that a man can run his locomotive by his sense of time as well as by a watch Denny Cassin says he d agree to take the Empire State from Albany to New York and keep her right on the dot all the way and bring her in on the minute just by feeling What d ye think of that That s possible said Big Arthur A man can feel how fast he s going He s got to judge big speed by feeling for there ain t any speed recorder that s much good say above ninety miles an hour At the first opportunity I explained to Big Arthur and his friend that I would very much like to draw upon their experience for some thrilling incidents in engine driving Tell him about the time you went in the river suggested Big Arthur That was way back in sixty nine said the other when I was firing for Boney Cassin the brother of Denny It was in winter a bitter cold day and the Hudson was so gorged with ice that part of the jam had squeezed over the bank and torn away our tracks So pretty soon when we came along with twenty three cars of a train of merchandise why in we went and the old engine Troy just skated ahead on her side into the river smash through the ice down to the bottom and pulled thirteen cars after her You couldn t see a piece of that engine above water as big as your hand and how I got out alive is more than I know Guess I must have jumped Anyhow there I was on the broken floe and I could hear the old Troy grinding away in the river churning up water and ice like a crazy sea serpent She struggled for nearly a minute before her steam was cold and her strength gone Then she lay still dead I looked around for Boney and at first I didn t see him I thought he d gone down sure and so he had but just as I was looking I saw a big black thing heave up through the ice and I heard a queer cry Well that was Providence sure It seems the engine had ripped her cab clean off as she tore through the ice and here was the cab coming up bottom side first with Boney inside hanging on to a brace and almost dead I hauled him out and then we scrambled ashore over the wrecked cars They were full of flour and the barrels were all busted open so by the time we reached the bank we looked like a twin Santa Claus made of paste and three quarters drowned at that But Boney stuck to his throttle I remarked Yes said the other he stuck to his throttle The boys generally do After this I asked Big Arthur for a story but he assured me he couldn t think of anything special Tell about that woman on Eleventh Avenue said his friend Yes said I tell about her Oh said Big Arthur that wasn t much I was pulling a freight train down Eleventh Avenue one day going slow through the city and at Thirty fifth Street a woman turned down the track ahead of me I whistled but she never heard me She was going marketing and couldn t think of anything else I saw I d strike her sure there wasn t time to stop so I ran along the boiler side to the pilot and got there just as we were on her Another second and she d have been under the wheels I braced myself and made a jump at the woman and struck her back of the neck with a shove that sent her sprawling off the track with me after her You see I had to jump hard or I d have stayed on the track myself and gone under the engine Did it end in a romance I asked Romance nothing exclaimed Big Arthur That woman got up so mad why she called me names and clawed the skin off my face until well I couldn t get shaved for three weeks afterward In about a minute though she cooled off and somebody told her I d saved her life which I had and then sir blamed if she didn t go down on her knees and try to kiss my feet and pray I d forgive her Say that s the only time I ever got prayed to Here Big Arthur s fireman whispered something to him and the engineer nodded That s so that s a good story and then he told how an old lady of seventy five saved a New York Central express some years ago at Underhill Cut about a mile south of Garrisons She s a relative of my fireman so I know the thing s true besides that the company gave her three hundred dollars You see it all happened one winter night and this missus Groves that s her name was the only person near enough to do anything She lived in a little house beside Underhill Cut and about four o clock in the morning she heard a frightful crash and there was a freight train wrecked right in the cut and cars piled up three or four deep over the tracks She knew the express might come along any minute and of course it was a case of everybody killed if they ever struck that smash up So what does she do this little old lady but grab up a red petticoat and a kerosene lamp and run out as fast as she could in her bare feet yes sir and nothing on but her night gown right through the snow That s the kind of a woman she was Well she went down the track until she heard the express coming and then she took her red petticoat and held it up in front of the lamp so as to make a red light And what s more it worked The engineer saw the danger signal slammed on his brakes and stopped the train a few car lengths from the wreck Yes sir only a few car lengths Big Arthur nodded thoughtfully and climbed into the cab It was time to go In ending this chapter now and with it the present series I venture the opinion that the men who follow these Careers of Danger and Daring the divers steeple climbers and the rest are very little different from their fellow men except as they have developed certain faculties by their exercise and established in themselves the habit of courage They were not born with any longing to do these daring acts nor with any particular aptitude for them They have been guided nearly always by the drift of life and by opportunities that presented As to fear they have the same capacity for it that we all have and are serene in their peril only because they feel themselves by their patience and skill well armed against it The steeple climber would be afraid to go down in a diving suit the lion tamer would be afraid to go up in a balloon the pilot would be afraid to swing on the flying bars and so on I will even go further and say that the average good citizen who is sound of body has as great capacity for courage as any of these men He could develop it if he cared to he would develop it if he had to That is the main point after all these men must be brave they must conquer their fear and the only trouble with the average man is that nothing ever occurs to show him and those who know him what fine things he could do if the pressure were put upon him Yet any day the test may come to any one of us pain to bear losses to bear bereavement to bear And then the great test Well perhaps these humble heroes whose lives we have glanced at may give us a bit of their spirit for our own lives the brave and patient spirit that will keep us unflinchingly at the hard thing whatever it be until we have conquered it And perhaps we too may feel impelled to cultivate the habit of courage That would be a fine inspiration indeed and I can only hope that my readers may feel it Transcriber s Notes Obvious punctuation errors repaired Page eighty two that changed to than buoyant than is good Page two hundred sixty six that changed to
