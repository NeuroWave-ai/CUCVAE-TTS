none	none	child I ran He the Wolf pursued me and caught me The words died away in a shuddering silence I understand child Then Then he he stabbed me with his dagger oh blessed saints mercy Suddenly the slim form went limp The man eased her to the earth and touched her brow lightly Dead he muttered Slowly he rose mechanically wiping his hands upon his cloak A dark scowl had settled on his somber brow Yet he made no wild reckless vow swore no oath by saints or devils Men shall die for this he said coldly 
1283_136983_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter two 
1283_136983_000001_000001	train-clean-360	The Lair of the Wolf
none	none	 You are a fool 
1283_136983_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The words came in a cold snarl that curdled the hearer s blood 
none	none	He who had just been named a fool lowered his eyes sullenly without answer You and all the others I lead 
1283_136983_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The speaker leaned forward his fist pounding emphasis on the rude table between them 
1283_136983_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He was a tall rangy built man supple as a leopard and with a lean cruel predatory face 
1283_136983_000004_000003	train-clean-360	His eyes danced and glittered with a kind of reckless mockery 
1283_136983_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The fellow spoken to replied sullenly This Solomon Kane is a demon from Hell I tell you 
1283_136983_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Kane 
none	none	is a demon from Hell 
1283_136983_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I tell you 
1283_136983_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Faugh 
1283_136983_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Dolt 
none	none	He is a man who will die from a pistol ball or a sword thrust So thought Jean Juan and La Costa answered the other grimly Where are they 
1283_136983_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Ask the mountain wolves that tore the flesh from their dead bones 
1283_136983_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Where does this Kane hide 
1283_136983_000007_000003	train-clean-360	We have searched the mountains and the valleys for leagues and we have found no trace 
none	none	I tell you Le Loup he comes up from Hell I knew no good would come from hanging that friar a moon ago 
1283_136983_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Wolf strummed impatiently upon the table 
1283_136983_000008_000001	train-clean-360	His keen face despite lines of wild living and dissipation was the face of a thinker 
1283_136983_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The superstitions of his followers affected him not at all 
none	none	Faugh 
1283_136983_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I say again 
1283_136983_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The fellow has found some cavern or secret vale of which we do not know where he hides in the day 
1283_136983_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 And at night he sallies forth and slays us gloomily commented the other 
none	none	He hunts us down as a wolf hunts deer by God Le Loup you name yourself Wolf but I think you have met at last a fiercer and more crafty wolf than yourself 
1283_136983_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The first we know of this man is when we find Jean the most desperate bandit unhung nailed to a tree with his own dagger through his breast and the letters S L K carved upon his dead cheeks 
none	none	Then the Spaniard Juan is struck down and after we find him he lives long enough to tell us that the slayer is an Englishman Solomon Kane who has sworn to destroy our entire band What then La Costa a swordsman second only to yourself goes forth swearing to meet this Kane 
1283_136983_000010_000005	train-clean-360	By the demons of perdition it seems he met him 
1283_136983_000010_000006	train-clean-360	For we found his sword pierced corpse upon a cliff 
1283_136983_000010_000007	train-clean-360	What now Are we all to fall before this English fiend 
1283_136983_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 True our best men have been done to death by him mused the bandit chief 
1283_136983_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Soon the rest return from that little trip to the hermit s then we shall see 
1283_136983_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Kane can not hide forever 
1283_136983_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Then ha what was that 
1283_136983_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The two turned swiftly as a shadow fell across the table 
1283_136983_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Into the entrance of the cave that formed the bandit lair a man staggered 
1283_136983_000012_000002	train-clean-360	His eyes were wide and staring he reeled on buckling legs and a dark red stain dyed his tunic 
1283_136983_000012_000003	train-clean-360	He came a few tottering steps forward then pitched across the table sliding off onto the floor 
1283_136983_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Hell s devils cursed the Wolf hauling him upright and propping him in a chair 
none	none	Where are the rest curse you Dead 
1283_136983_000014_000001	train-clean-360	All dead 
1283_136983_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 How 
1283_136983_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Satan s curses on you speak 
1283_136983_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The Wolf shook the man savagely the other bandit gazing on in wide eyed horror 
none	none	We reached the hermit s hut just as the moon rose the man muttered
1283_136983_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 I stayed outside to watch the others went in to torture the hermit to make him reveal the hiding place of his gold 
1283_136983_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes 
1283_136983_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Then what 
1283_136983_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The Wolf was raging with impatience 
1283_136983_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Then the world turned red the hut went up in a roar and a red rain flooded the valley through it I saw the hermit and a tall man clad all in black coming from the trees 
1283_136983_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Solomon Kane gasped the bandit 
1283_136983_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I knew it 
1283_136983_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Silence fool snarled the chief 
none	none	Go on
1283_136983_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I fled Kane pursued wounded me but I outran him got here first 
1283_136983_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The man slumped forward on the table 
1283_136983_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Saints and devils raged the Wolf 
1283_136983_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 What does he look like this Kane 
1283_136983_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Like Satan 
1283_136983_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The voice trailed off in silence 
none	none	The dead man slid from the table to lie in a red heap upon the floor
1283_136983_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Like Satan babbled the other bandit 
1283_136983_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I told you 
1283_136983_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 Tis the Horned One himself 
none	none	I tell you 
1283_136983_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He ceased as a frightened face peered in at the cave entrance 
none	none	Kane Aye The Wolf was too much at sea to lie
1283_136983_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Keep close watch La Mon in a moment the Rat and I will join you 
1283_136983_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The face withdrew and Le Loup turned to the other 
none	none	This ends the band said he
1283_136983_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 You I and that thief La Mon are all that are left 
1283_136983_000031_000002	train-clean-360	What would you suggest 
none	none	The Rat s pallid lips barely formed the word Flight
1283_136983_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You are right 
1283_136983_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Let us take the gems and gold from the chests and flee using the secret passageway 
1283_136983_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 And La Mon 
1283_136983_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 He can watch until we are ready to flee 
1283_136983_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Then why divide the treasure three ways 
1283_136983_000036_000000	train-clean-360	A faint smile touched the Rat s malevolent features 
1283_136983_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Then a sudden thought smote him 
1283_136983_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 He indicating the corpse on the floor said I got here first Does that mean Kane was pursuing him here And as the Wolf nodded impatiently the other turned to the chests with chattering haste 
none	none	The flickering candle on the rough table lighted up a strange and wild scene The light uncertain and dancing gleamed redly in the slowly widening lake of blood in which the dead man lay it danced upon the heaps of gems and coins emptied hastily upon the floor from the brass bound chests that ranged the walls and it glittered in the eyes of the Wolf with the same gleam which sparkled from his sheathed dagger 
1283_136983_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The chests were empty their treasure lying in a shimmering mass upon the bloodstained floor 
1283_136983_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The Wolf stopped and listened 
1283_136983_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Outside was silence 
1283_136983_000039_000003	train-clean-360	There was no moon and Le Loup s keen imagination pictured the dark slayer Solomon Kane gliding through the blackness a shadow among shadows 
1283_136983_000039_000004	train-clean-360	He grinned crookedly this time the Englishman would be foiled 
1283_136983_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 There is a chest yet unopened said he pointing 
1283_136983_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The Rat with a muttered exclamation of surprize bent over the chest indicated 
1283_136983_000041_000001	train-clean-360	With a single catlike motion the Wolf sprang upon him sheathing his dagger to the hilt in the Rat s back between the shoulders 
1283_136983_000041_000002	train-clean-360	The Rat sagged to the floor without a sound 
1283_136983_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Why divide the treasure two ways murmured Le Loup wiping his blade upon the dead man s doublet 
1283_136983_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Now for La Mon 
1283_136983_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He stepped toward the door then stopped and shrank back 
none	none	At first he thought that it was the shadow of a man who stood in the entrance then he saw that it was a man himself though so dark and still he stood that a fantastic semblance of shadow was lent him by the guttering candle 
1283_136983_000045_000000	train-clean-360	A tall man as tall as Le Loup he was clad in black from head to foot in plain close fitting garments that somehow suited the somber face 
1283_136983_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Long arms and broad shoulders betokened the swordsman as plainly as the long rapier in his hand 
none	none	The features of the man were saturnine and gloomy 
1283_136983_000045_000003	train-clean-360	A kind of dark pallor lent him a ghostly appearance in the uncertain light an effect heightened by the satanic darkness of his lowering brows 
1283_136983_000045_000004	train-clean-360	Eyes large deep set and unblinking fixed their gaze upon the bandit and looking into them Le Loup was unable to decide what color they were 
1283_136983_000045_000005	train-clean-360	Strangely the mephistophelean trend of the lower features was offset by a high broad forehead though this was partly hidden by a featherless hat 
1283_136983_000046_000000	train-clean-360	That forehead marked the dreamer the idealist the introvert just as the eyes and the thin straight nose betrayed the fanatic 
1283_136983_000046_000001	train-clean-360	An observer would have been struck by the eyes of the two men who stood there facing each other 
1283_136983_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Eyes of both betokened untold deeps of power but there the resemblance ceased 
none	none	The eyes of the bandit were hard almost opaque with a curious scintillant shallowness that reflected a thousand changing lights and gleams like some strange gem there was mockery in those eyes cruelty and recklessness 
1283_136983_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The eyes of the man in black on the other hand deep set and staring from under prominent brows were cold but deep gazing into them one had the impression of looking into countless fathoms of ice 
1283_136983_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Now the eyes clashed and the Wolf who was used to being feared felt a strange coolness on his spine 
1283_136983_000049_000001	train-clean-360	The sensation was new to him a new thrill to one who lived for thrills and he laughed suddenly 
none	none	You are Solomon Kane I suppose he asked managing to make his question sound politely incurious
1283_136983_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I am Solomon Kane The voice was resonant and powerful 
1283_136983_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you prepared to meet your God 
none	none	Why Monsieur Le Loup answered bowing I assure you I am as ready as I ever will be I might ask Monsieur the same question
1283_136983_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No doubt I stated my inquiry wrongly Kane said grimly 
1283_136983_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 I will change it Are you prepared to meet your master the Devil 
none	none	As to that Monsieur Le Loup examined his finger nails with elaborate unconcern I must say that I can at present render a most satisfactory account to his Horned Excellency though really I have no intention of so doing for a while at least Le Loup did not wonder as to the fate of La Mon Kane s presence in the cave was sufficient answer that did not need the trace of blood on his rapier to verify it What I wish to know Monsieur said the bandit is why in the Devil s name have you harassed my band as you have and how did you destroy that last set of fools
1283_136983_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Your last question is easily answered sir Kane replied 
1283_136983_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 I myself had the tale spread that the hermit possessed a store of gold knowing that would draw your scum as carrion draws vultures 
1283_136983_000057_000002	train-clean-360	For days and nights I have watched the hut and tonight when I saw your villains coming I warned the hermit and together we went among the trees back of the hut 
1283_136983_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Then when the rogues were inside I struck flint and steel to the train I had laid and flame ran through the trees like a red snake until it reached the powder I had placed beneath the hut floor 
1283_136983_000057_000004	train-clean-360	Then the hut and thirteen sinners went to Hell in a great roar of flame and smoke 
1283_136983_000057_000005	train-clean-360	True one escaped but him I had slain in the forest had not I stumbled and fallen upon a broken root which gave him time to elude me 
none	none	Monsieur said Le Loup with another low bow I grant you the admiration I must needs bestow on a brave and shrewd foeman 
1283_136983_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Yet tell me this Why have you followed me as a wolf follows deer 
none	none	Some moons ago said Kane his frown becoming more menacing you and your fiends raided a small village down the valley 
1283_136983_000059_000001	train-clean-360	You know the details better than I There was a girl there a mere child who hoping to escape your lust fled up the valley but you you jackal of Hell you caught her and left her violated and dying 
1283_136983_000059_000002	train-clean-360	I found her there and above her dead form I made up my mind to hunt you down and kill you 
none	none	H m mused the Wolf
1283_136983_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes I remember the wench 
none	none	Mon Dieu so the softer sentiments enter into the affair Monsieur I had not thought you an amorous man be not jealous good fellow there are many more wenches
1283_136983_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Le Loup take care Kane exclaimed a terrible menace in his voice I have never yet done a man to death by torture but by God sir you tempt me 
1283_136983_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The tone and more especially the unexpected oath coming as it did from Kane slightly sobered Le Loup his eyes narrowed and his hand moved toward his rapier 
1283_136983_000062_000001	train-clean-360	The air was tense for an instant then the Wolf relaxed elaborately 
1283_136983_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was the girl he asked idly 
1283_136983_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Your wife 
none	none	I never saw her before answered Kane Nom d un nom swore the bandit What sort of a man are you Monsieur who takes up a feud of this sort merely to avenge a wench unknown to you
1283_136983_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 That sir is my own affair it is sufficient that I do so 
1283_136983_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Kane could not have explained even to himself nor did he ever seek an explanation within himself 
1283_136983_000067_000001	train-clean-360	A true fanatic his promptings were reasons enough for his actions 
none	none	You are right Monsieur Le Loup was sparring now for time casually he edged backward inch by inch with such consummate acting skill that he aroused no suspicion even in the hawk who watched him Monsieur said he possibly you will say that you are merely a noble cavalier wandering about like a true Galahad protecting the weaker but you and I know different 
1283_136983_000068_000001	train-clean-360	There on the floor is the equivalent to an emperor s ransom 
none	none	Let us divide it peaceably then if you like not my company why nom d un nom we can go our separate ways 
1283_136983_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Kane leaned forward a terrible brooding threat growing in his cold eyes 
1283_136983_000069_000001	train-clean-360	He seemed like a great condor about to launch himself upon his victim 
1283_136983_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir do you assume me to be as great a villain as yourself 
1283_136983_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly Le Loup threw back his head his eyes dancing and leaping with a wild mockery and a kind of insane recklessness 
1283_136983_000071_000001	train-clean-360	His shout of laughter sent the echoes flying 
none	none	Gods of Hell 
1283_136983_000072_000001	train-clean-360	No you fool I do not class you with myself

1283_136983_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Shall I waste time in parleying with this base scoundrel Kane snarled in a voice suddenly blood thirsting and his lean frame flashed forward like a bent bow suddenly released

1283_136983_000076_000001	train-clean-360	The taunt came from somewhere in front of him but Kane plunging toward the sound with the savage fury of baffled wrath caromed against a blank wall that did not yield to his blow

none	none	Kane whirled eyes fixed on the dimly outlined entrance thinking his foe would try to slip past him and out of the cave but no form bulked there and when his groping hands found the candle and lighted it the cave was empty save for himself and the dead men on the floor Chapter three The Chant of the Drums Across the dusky waters the whisper came boom boom boom a sullen reiteration Far away and more faintly sounded a whisper of different timbre thrum throom thrum Back and forth went the vibrations as the throbbing drums spoke to each other What tales did they carry What monstrous secrets whispered across the sullen shadowy reaches of the unmapped jungle This you are sure is the bay where the Spanish ship put in Yes Senhor the Negro swears this is the bay where the white man left the ship alone and went into the jungle Kane nodded grimly Then put me ashore here alone Wait seven days then if I have not returned and if you have no word of me set sail wherever you will Yes Senhor The waves slapped lazily against the sides of the boat that carried Kane ashore The village that he sought was on the river bank but set back from the bay shore the jungle hiding it from sight of the ship Kane had adopted what seemed the most hazardous course that of going ashore by night for the reason that he knew if the man he sought were in the village he would never reach it by day As it was he was taking a most desperate chance in daring the nighttime jungle but all his life he had been used to taking desperate chances Now he gambled his life upon the slim chance of gaining the Negro village under cover of darkness and unknown to the villagers At the beach he left the boat with a few muttered commands and as the rowers put back to the ship which lay anchored some distance out in the bay he turned and engulfed himself in the blackness of the jungle Sword in one hand dagger in the other he stole forward seeking to keep pointed in the direction from which the drums still muttered and grumbled He went with the stealth and easy movement of a leopard feeling his way cautiously every nerve alert and straining but the way was not easy Vines tripped him and slapped him in the face impeding his progress he was forced to grope his way between the huge boles of towering trees and all through the underbrush about him sounded vague and menacing rustlings and shadows of movement Thrice his foot touched something that moved beneath it and writhed away and once he glimpsed the baleful glimmer of feline eyes among the trees They vanished however as he advanced Thrum thrum thrum came the ceaseless monotone of the drums war and death they said blood and lust human sacrifice and human feast The soul of Africa said the drums the spirit of the jungle the chant of the gods of outer darkness the gods that roar and gibber the gods men knew when dawns were young beast eyed gaping mouthed huge bellied bloody handed the Black Gods sang the drums All this and more the drums roared and bellowed to Kane as he worked his way through the forest Somewhere in his soul a responsive chord was smitten and answered You too are of the night sang the drums there is the strength of darkness the strength of the primitive in you come back down the ages let us teach you let us teach you chanted the drums Kane stepped out of the thick jungle and came upon a plainly defined trail Beyond through the trees came the gleam of the village fires flames glowing through the palisades Kane walked down the trail swiftly He went silently and warily sword extended in front of him eyes straining to catch any hint of movement in the darkness ahead for the trees loomed like sullen giants on each hand sometimes their great branches intertwined above the trail and he could see only a slight way ahead of him Like a dark ghost he moved along the shadowed trail alertly he stared and harkened yet no warning came first to him as a great vague bulk rose up out of the shadows and struck him down silently Chapter four The Black God Thrum thrum thrum Somewhere with deadening monotony a cadence was repeated over and over bearing out the same theme Fool fool fool Now it was far away now he could stretch out his hand and almost reach it Now it merged with the throbbing in his head until the two vibrations were as one Fool fool fool fool The fogs faded and vanished Kane sought to raise his hand to his head but found that he was bound hand and foot He lay on the floor of a hut alone He twisted about to view the place No two eyes glimmered at him from the darkness Now a form took shape and Kane still mazed believed that he looked on the man who had struck him unconscious Yet no this man could never strike such a blow He was lean withered and wrinkled The only thing that seemed alive about him were his eyes and they seemed like the eyes of a snake The man squatted on the floor of the hut near the doorway naked save for a loin cloth and the usual paraphernalia of bracelets anklets and armlets Weird fetishes of ivory bone and hide animal and human adorned his arms and legs Suddenly and unexpectedly he spoke in English Ha you wake white man Why you come here eh Kane asked the inevitable question following the habit of the Caucasian You speak my language how is that The black man grinned I slave long time me boy Me N Longa ju ju man me great fetish No black man like me You white man you hunt brother Kane snarled I Brother I seek a man yes The Negro nodded Maybe so you find um eh He dies Again the Negro grinned Me pow rful ju ju man he announced apropos of nothing He bent closer White man you hunt eyes like a leopard eh Yes Ha ha ha ha Listen white man man with eyes of a leopard he and Chief Songa make pow rful palaver they blood brothers now Say nothing I help you you help me eh Why should you help me asked Kane suspiciously The ju ju man bent closer and whispered White man Songa s right hand man Songa more pow rful than N Longa White man mighty ju ju N Longa s white brother kill man with eyes of a leopard be blood brother to N Longa N Longa be more pow rful than Songa palaver set And like a dusky ghost he floated out of the hut so swiftly that Kane was not sure but that the whole affair was a dream Without Kane could see the flare of fires The drums were still booming but close at hand the tones merged and mingled and the impulse producing vibrations were lost All seemed a barbaric clamor without rhyme or reason yet there was an undertone of mockery there savage and gloating Lies thought Kane his mind still swimming jungle lies like jungle women that lure a man to his doom Two warriors entered the hut black giants hideous with paint and armed with crude spears They lifted the white man and carried him out of the hut They bore him across an open space leaned him upright against a post and bound him there About him behind him and to the side a great semicircle of black faces leered and faded in the firelight as the flames leaped and sank There in front of him loomed a shape hideous and obscene a black formless thing a grotesque parody of the human Still brooding bloodstained like the formless soul of Africa the horror the Black God And in front and to each side upon roughly carven thrones of teakwood sat two men He who sat upon the right was a black man huge ungainly a gigantic and unlovely mass of dusky flesh and muscles Small hoglike eyes blinked out over sin marked cheeks huge flabby red lips pursed in fleshly haughtiness The other Ah Monsieur we meet again The speaker was far from being the debonair villain who had taunted Kane in the cavern among the mountains His clothes were rags there were more lines in his face he had sunk lower in the years that had passed Yet his eyes still gleamed and danced with their old recklessness and his voice held the same mocking timbre The last time I heard that accursed voice said Kane calmly was in a cave in darkness whence you fled like a hunted rat Aye under different conditions answered Le Loup imperturbably What did you do after blundering about like an elephant in the dark Kane hesitated then I left the mountain By the front entrance Yes I might have known you were too stupid to find the secret door Hoofs of the Devil had you thrust against the chest with the golden lock which stood against the wall the door had opened to you and revealed the secret passageway through which I went I traced you to the nearest port and there took ship and followed you to Italy where I found you had gone Aye by the saints you nearly cornered me in Florence Ho ho ho I was climbing through a back window while Monsieur Galahad was battering down the front door of the tavern And had your horse not gone lame you would have caught up with me on the road to Rome Again the ship on which I left Spain had barely put out to sea when Monsieur Galahad rides up to the wharfs Why have you followed me like this I do not understand Because you are a rogue whom it is my destiny to kill answered Kane coldly He did not understand All his life he had roamed about the world aiding the weak and fighting oppression he neither knew nor questioned why That was his obsession his driving force of life Cruelty and tyranny to the weak sent a red blaze of fury fierce and lasting through his soul When the full flame of his hatred was wakened and loosed there was no rest for him until his vengeance had been fulfilled to the uttermost If he thought of it at all he considered himself a fulfiller of God s judgment a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous Yet in the full sense of the word Solomon Kane was not wholly a Puritan though he thought of himself as such Le Loup shrugged his shoulders I could understand had I wronged you personally Mon Dieu I too would follow an enemy across the world but though I would have joyfully slain and robbed you I never heard of you until you declared war on me Kane was silent his still fury overcoming him Though he did not realize it the Wolf was more than merely an enemy to him the bandit symbolized to Kane all the things against which the Puritan had fought all his life cruelty outrage oppression and tyranny Le Loup broke in on his vengeful meditations What did you do with the treasure which gods of Hades took me years to accumulate Devil take it I had time only to snatch a handful of coins and trinkets as I ran I took such as I needed to hunt you down The rest I gave to the villages which you had looted Saints and the devil swore Le Loup Monsieur you are the greatest fool I have yet met To throw that vast treasure by Satan I rage to think of it in the hands of base peasants vile villagers Yet ho ho ho ho they will steal and kill each other for it That is human nature Yes damn you flamed Kane suddenly showing that his conscience had not been at rest Doubtless they will being fools Yet what could I do Had I left it there people might have starved and gone naked for lack of it More it would have been found and theft and slaughter would have followed anyway You are to blame for had this treasure been left with its rightful owners no such trouble would have ensued The Wolf grinned without reply Kane not being a profane man his rare curses had double effect and always startled his hearers no matter how vicious or hardened they might be It was Kane who spoke next Why have you fled from me across the world You do not really fear me No you are right Really I do not know perhaps flight is a habit which is difficult to break I made my mistake when I did not kill you that night in the mountains I am sure I could kill you in a fair fight yet I have never even ere now sought to ambush you Somehow I have not had a liking to meet you Monsieur a whim of mine a mere whim Then mon Dieu mayhap I have enjoyed a new sensation and I had thought that I had exhausted the thrills of life And then a man must either be the hunter or the hunted Until now Monsieur I was the hunted but I grew weary of the role I thought I had thrown you off the trail A Negro slave brought from this vicinity told a Portugal ship captain of a white man who landed from a Spanish ship and went into the jungle I heard of it and hired the ship paying the captain to bring me here Monsieur I admire you for your attempt but you must admire me too Alone I came into this village and alone among savages and cannibals I with some slight knowledge of the language learned from a slave aboard ship I gained the confidence of King Songa and supplanted that mummer N Longa I am a braver man than you Monsieur for I had no ship to retreat to and a ship is waiting for you I admire your courage said Kane but you are content to rule amongst cannibals you the blackest soul of them all I intend to return to my own people when I have slain you Your confidence would be admirable were it not amusing Ho Gulka A giant Negro stalked into the space between them He was the hugest man that Kane had ever seen though he moved with catlike ease and suppleness His arms and legs were like trees and the great sinuous muscles rippled with each motion His apelike head was set squarely between gigantic shoulders His great dusky hands were like the talons of an ape and his brow slanted back from above bestial eyes Flat nose and great thick red lips completed this picture of primitive lustful savagery That is Gulka the gorilla slayer said Le Loup He it was who lay in wait beside the trail and smote you down You are like a wolf yourself Monsieur Kane but since your ship hove in sight you have been watched by many eyes and had you had all the powers of a leopard you had not seen Gulka nor heard him He hunts the most terrible and crafty of all beasts in their native forests far to the north the beasts who walk like men as that one whom he slew some days since Kane following Le Loup s fingers made out a curious manlike thing dangling from a roof pole of a hut A jagged end thrust through the thing s body held it there Kane could scarcely distinguish its characteristics by the firelight but there was a weird humanlike semblance about the hideous hairy thing A female gorilla that Gulka slew and brought to the village said Le Loup The giant black slouched close to Kane and stared into the white man s eyes Kane returned his gaze somberly and presently the Negro s eyes dropped sullenly and he slouched back a few paces The look in the Puritan s grim eyes had pierced the primitive hazes of the gorilla slayer s soul and for the first time in his life he felt fear To throw this off he tossed a challenging look about then with unexpected animalness he struck his huge chest resoundingly grinned cavernously and flexed his mighty arms No one spoke Primordial bestiality had the stage and the more highly developed types looked on with various feelings of amusement tolerance or contempt Gulka glanced furtively at Kane to see if the white man was watching him then with a sudden beastly roar plunged forward and dragged a man from the semicircle While the trembling victim screeched for mercy the giant hurled him upon the crude altar before the shadowy idol A spear rose and flashed and the screeching ceased The Black God looked on his monstrous features seeming to leer in the flickering firelight He had drunk was the Black God pleased with the draft with the sacrifice Gulka stalked back and stopping before Kane flourished the bloody spear before the white man s face Le Loup laughed Then suddenly N Longa appeared He came from nowhere in particular suddenly he was standing there beside the post to which Kane was bound A lifetime of study of the art of illusion had given the ju ju man a highly technical knowledge of appearing and disappearing which after all consisted only in timing the audience s attention He waved Gulka aside with a grand gesture and the gorilla man slunk back apparently to get out of N Longa s gaze then with incredible swiftness he turned and struck the ju ju man a terrific blow upon the side of the head with his open hand N Longa went down like a felled ox and in an instant he had been seized and bound to a post close to Kane An uncertain murmuring rose from the Negroes which died out as King Songa stared angrily toward them Le Loup leaned back upon his throne and laughed uproariously The trail ends here Monsieur Galahad That ancient fool thought I did not know of his plotting I was hiding outside the hut and heard the interesting conversation you two had Ha ha ha ha The Black God must drink Monsieur but I have persuaded Songa to have you two burnt that will be much more enjoyable though we shall have to forego the usual feast I fear For after the fires are lit about your feet the devil himself could not keep your carcasses from becoming charred frames of bone Songa shouted something imperiously and blacks came bearing wood which they piled about the feet of N Longa and Kane The ju ju man had recovered consciousness and he now shouted something in his native language Again the murmuring arose among the shadowy throng Songa snarled something in reply Kane gazed at the scene almost impersonally Again somewhere in his soul dim primal deeps were stirring age old thought memories veiled in the fogs of lost eons He had been here before thought Kane he knew all this of old the lurid flames beating back the sullen night the bestial faces leering expectantly and the god the Black God there in the shadows Always the Black God brooding back in the shadows He had known the shouts the frenzied chant of the worshipers back there in the gray dawn of the world the speech of the bellowing drums the singing priests the repellent inflaming all pervading scent of freshly spilt blood All this have I known somewhere sometime thought Kane now I am the main actor He became aware that someone was speaking to him through the roar of the drums he had not realized that the drums had begun to boom again The speaker was N Longa Me pow rful ju ju man Watch now I work mighty magic Songa His voice rose in a screech that drowned out the wildly clamoring drums Songa grinned at the words N Longa screamed at him The chant of the drums now had dropped to a low sinister monotone and Kane plainly heard Le Loup when he spoke N Longa says that he will now work that magic which it is death to speak even Never before has it been worked in the sight of living men it is the nameless ju ju magic Watch closely Monsieur possibly we shall be further amused The Wolf laughed lightly and sardonically A black man stooped applying a torch to the wood about Kane s feet Tiny jets of flame began to leap up and catch Another bent to do the same with N Longa then hesitated The ju ju man sagged in his bonds his head drooped upon his chest He seemed dying Le Loup leaned forward cursing Feet of the Devil Is the scoundrel about to cheat us of our pleasure of seeing him writhe in the flames The warrior gingerly touched the wizard and said something in his own language Le Loup laughed He died of fright A great wizard by the His voice trailed off suddenly The drums stopped as if the drummers had fallen dead simultaneously Silence dropped like a fog upon the village and in the stillness Kane heard only the sharp crackle of the flames whose heat he was beginning to feel All eyes were turned upon the dead man upon the altar for the corpse had begun to move First a twitching of a hand then an aimless motion of an arm a motion which gradually spread over the body and limbs Slowly with blind uncertain gestures the dead man turned upon his side the trailing limbs found the earth Then horribly like something being born like some frightful reptilian thing bursting the shell of non existence the corpse tottered and reared upright standing on legs wide apart and stiffly braced arms still making useless infantile motions Utter silence save somewhere a man s quick breath sounded loud in the stillness Kane stared for the first time in his life smitten speechless and thoughtless To his Puritan mind this was Satan s hand manifested Le Loup sat on his throne eyes wide and staring hand still half raised in the careless gesture he was making when frozen into silence by the unbelievable sight Songa sat beside him mouth and eyes wide open fingers making curious jerky motions upon the carved arms of the throne Now the corpse was upright swaying on stiltlike legs body tilting far back until the sightless eyes seemed to stare straight into the red moon that was just rising over the black jungle The thing tottered uncertainly in a wide erratic half circle arms flung out grotesquely as if in balance then swayed about to face the two thrones and the Black God A burning twig at Kane s feet cracked like the crash of a cannon in the tense silence The horror thrust forth a black foot it took a wavering step another Then with stiff jerky and automatonlike steps legs straddled far apart the dead man came toward the two who sat in speechless horror to each side of the Black God Ah h h from somewhere came the explosive sigh from that shadowy semicircle where crouched the terror fascinated worshipers Straight on stalked the grim specter Now it was within three strides of the thrones and Le Loup faced by fear for the first time in his bloody life cringed back in his chair while Songa with a superhuman effort breaking the chains of horror that held him helpless shattered the night with a wild scream and springing to his feet lifted a spear shrieking and gibbering in wild menace Then as the ghastly thing halted not its frightful advance he hurled the spear with all the power of his great black muscles and the spear tore through the dead man s breast with a rending of flesh and bone Not an instant halted the thing for the dead die not and Songa the king stood frozen arms outstretched as if to fend off the terror An instant they stood so leaping firelight and eery moonlight etching the scene forever in the minds of the beholders The changeless staring eyes of the corpse looked full into the bulging eyes of Songa where were reflected all the hells of horror Then with a jerky motion the arms of the thing went out and up The dead hands fell on Songa s shoulders At the first touch the king seemed to shrink and shrivel and with a scream that was to haunt the dreams of every watcher through all the rest of time Songa crumpled and fell and the dead man reeled stiffly and fell with him Motionless lay the two at the feet of the Black God and to Kane s dazed mind it seemed that the idol s great inhuman eyes were fixed upon them with terrible still laughter At the instant of the king s fall a great shout went up from the blacks and Kane with a clarity lent his subconscious mind by the depths of his hate looked for Le Loup and saw him spring from his throne and vanish in the darkness Then vision was blurred by a rush of black figures who swept into the space before the god Feet knocked aside the blazing brands whose heat Kane had forgotten and dusky hands freed him others loosed the wizard s body and laid it upon the earth Kane dimly understood that the blacks believed this thing to be the work of N Longa and that they connected the vengeance of the wizard with himself He bent laid a hand on the ju ju man s shoulder No doubt of it he was dead the flesh was already cold He glanced at the other corpses Songa was dead too and the thing that had slain him lay now without movement Kane started to rise then halted Was he dreaming or did he really feel a sudden warmth in the dead flesh he touched Mind reeling he again bent over the wizard s body and slowly he felt warmness steal over the limbs and the blood begin to flow sluggishly through the veins again Then N Longa opened his eyes and stared up into Kane s with the blank expression of a new born babe Kane watched flesh crawling and saw the knowing reptilian glitter come back saw the wizard s thick lips part in a wide grin N Longa sat up and a strange chant arose from the Negroes Kane looked about The blacks were all kneeling swaying their bodies to and fro and in their shouts Kane caught the word N Longa repeated over and over in a kind of fearsomely ecstatic refrain of terror and worship As the wizard rose they all fell prostrate N Longa nodded as if in satisfaction Great ju ju great fetish me he announced to Kane You see My ghost go out kill Songa come back to me Great magic Great fetish me Kane glanced at the Black God looming back in the shadows at N Longa who now flung out his arms toward the idol as if in invocation I am everlasting Kane thought the Black God said I drink no matter who rules chiefs slayers wizards they pass like the ghosts of dead men through the gray jungle I stand I rule I am the soul of the jungle said the Black God Suddenly Kane came back from the illusory mists in which he had been wandering The white man Which way did he flee N Longa shouted something A score of dusky hands pointed from somewhere Kane s rapier was thrust out to him The fogs faded and vanished again he was the avenger the scourge of the unrighteous with the sudden volcanic speed of a tiger he snatched the sword and was gone Chapter five The End of the Red Trail Limbs and vines slapped against Kane s face The oppressive steam of the tropic night rose like mist about him The moon now floating high above the jungle limned the black shadows in its white glow and patterned the jungle floor in grotesque designs Kane knew not if the man he sought was ahead of him but broken limbs and trampled underbrush showed that some man had gone that way some man who fled in haste nor halted to pick his way Kane followed these signs unswervingly Believing in the justice of his vengeance he did not doubt that the dim beings who rule men s destinies would finally bring him face to face with Le Loup Behind him the drums boomed and muttered What a tale they had to tell this night of the triumph of N Longa the death of the black king the overthrow of the white man with eyes like a leopard and a more darksome tale a tale to be whispered in low muttering vibrations the nameless ju ju Was he dreaming Kane wondered as he hurried on Was all this part of some foul magic He had seen a dead man rise and slay and die again he had seen a man die and come to life again Did N Longa in truth send his ghost his soul his life essence forth into the void dominating a corpse to do his will Aye N Longa died a real death there bound to the torture stake and he who lay dead on the altar rose and did as N Longa would have done had he been free Then the unseen force animating the dead man fading N Longa had lived again Yes Kane thought he must admit it as a fact Somewhere in the darksome reaches of jungle and river N Longa had stumbled upon the Secret the Secret of controlling life and death of overcoming the shackles and limitations of the flesh How had this dark wisdom born in the black and blood stained shadows of this grim land been given to the wizard What sacrifice had been so pleasing to the Black Gods what ritual so monstrous as to make them give up the knowledge of this magic And what thoughtless timeless journeys had N Longa taken when he chose to send his ego his ghost through the far misty countries reached only by death There is wisdom in the shadows brooded the drums wisdom and magic go into the darkness for wisdom ancient magic shuns the light we remember the lost ages whispered the drums ere man became wise and foolish we remember the beast gods the serpent gods and the ape gods and the nameless the Black Gods they who drank blood and whose voices roared through the shadowy hills who feasted and lusted The secrets of life and of death are theirs we remember we remember sang the drums Kane heard them as he hastened on The tale they told to the feathered black warriors farther up the river he could not translate but they spoke to him in their own way and that language was deeper more basic The moon high in the dark blue skies lighted his way and gave him a clear vision as he came out at last into a glade and saw Le Loup standing there The Wolf s naked blade was a long gleam of silver in the moon and he stood with shoulders thrown back the old defiant smile still on his face A long trail Monsieur said he It began in the mountains of France it ends in an African jungle I have wearied of the game at last Monsieur and you die I had not fled from the village even save that I admit it freely that damnable witchcraft of N Longa s shook my nerves More I saw that the whole tribe would turn against me Kane advanced warily wondering what dim forgotten tinge of chivalry in the bandit s soul had caused him thus to take his chance in the open He half suspected treachery but his keen eyes could detect no shadow of movement in the jungle on either side of the glade Monsieur on guard Le Loup s voice was crisp Time that we ended this fool s dance about the world Here we are alone The men were now within reach of each other and Le Loup in the midst of his sentence suddenly plunged forward with the speed of light thrusting viciously A slower man had died there but Kane parried and sent his own blade in a silver streak that slit Le Loup s tunic as the Wolf bounded backward Le Loup admitted the failure of his trick with a wild laugh and came in with the breath taking speed and fury of a tiger his blade making a white fan of steel about him Rapier clashed on rapier as the two swordsmen fought They were fire and ice opposed Le Loup fought wildly but craftily leaving no openings taking advantage of every opportunity He was a living flame bounding back leaping in feinting thrusting warding striking laughing like a wild man taunting and cursing Kane s skill was cold calculating scintillant He made no waste movement no motion not absolutely necessary He seemed to devote more time and effort toward defense than did Le Loup yet there was no hesitancy in his attack and when he thrust his blade shot out with the speed of a striking snake There was little to choose between the men as to height strength and reach Le Loup was the swifter by a scant flashing margin but Kane s skill reached a finer point of perfection The Wolf s fencing was fiery dynamic like the blast from a furnace Kane was more steady less the instinctive more the thinking fighter though he too was a born slayer with the coordination that only a natural fighter possessed Thrust parry a feint a sudden whirl of blades Ha the Wolf sent up a shout of ferocious laughter as the blood started from a cut on Kane s cheek As if the sight drove him to further fury he attacked like the beast men named him Kane was forced back before that blood lusting onslaught but the Puritan s expression did not alter Minutes flew by the clang and clash of steel did not diminish Now they stood squarely in the center of the glade Le Loup untouched Kane s garments red with the blood that oozed from wounds on cheek breast arm and thigh The Wolf grinned savagely and mockingly in the moonlight but he had begun to doubt His breath came hissing fast and his arm began to weary who was this man of steel and ice who never seemed to weaken Le Loup knew that the wounds he had inflicted on Kane were not deep but even so the steady flow of blood should have sapped some of the man s strength and speed by this time But if Kane felt the ebb of his powers it did not show His brooding countenance did not change in expression and he pressed the fight with as much cold fury as at the beginning Le Loup felt his might fading and with one last desperate effort he rallied all his fury and strength into a single plunge A sudden unexpected attack too wild and swift for the eye to follow a dynamic burst of speed and fury no man could have withstood and Solomon Kane reeled for the first time as he felt cold steel tear through his body He reeled back and Le Loup with a wild shout plunged after him his reddened sword free a gasping taunt on his lips Kane s sword backed by the force of desperation met Le Loup s in midair met held and wrenched The Wolf s yell of triumph died on his lips as his sword flew singing from his hand For a fleeting instant he stopped short arms flung wide as a crucifix and Kane heard his wild mocking laughter peal forth for the last time as the Englishman s rapier made a silver line in the moonlight Far away came the mutter of the drums Kane mechanically cleansed his sword on his tattered garments The trail ended here and Kane was conscious of a strange feeling of futility He always felt that after he had killed a foe Somehow it always seemed that no real good had been wrought as if the foe had after all escaped his just vengeance With a shrug of his shoulders Kane turned his attention to his bodily needs Now that the heat of battle had passed he began to feel weak and faint from the loss of blood That last thrust had been close had he not managed to avoid its full point by a twist of his body the blade had transfixed him As it was the sword had struck glancingly plowed along his ribs and sunk deep in the muscles beneath the shoulder blade inflicting a long shallow wound Kane looked about him and saw that a small stream trickled through the glade at the far side Here he made the only mistake of that kind that he ever made in his entire life Mayhap he was dizzy from loss of blood and still mazed from the weird happenings of the night be that as it may he laid down his rapier and crossed weaponless to the stream There he laved his wounds and bandaged them as best he could with strips torn from his clothing Then he rose and was about to retrace his steps when a motion among the trees on the side of the glade where he first entered caught his eye A huge figure stepped out of the jungle and Kane saw and recognized his doom The man was Gulka the gorilla slayer Kane remembered that he had not seen the black among those doing homage to N Longa How could he know the craft and hatred in that dusky slanting skull that had led the Negro escaping the vengeance of his tribesmen to trail down the only man he had ever feared The Black God had been kind to his neophyte had led him upon his victim helpless and unarmed Now Gulka could kill his man openly and slowly as a leopard kills not smiting him down from ambush as he had planned silently and suddenly A wide grin split the Negro s face and he moistened his lips Kane watching him was coldly and deliberately weighing his chances Gulka had already spied the rapiers He was closer to them than was Kane The Englishman knew that there was no chance of his winning in a sudden race for the swords A slow deadly rage surged in him the fury of helplessness The blood churned in his temples and his eyes smoldered with a terrible light as he eyed the Negro His fingers spread and closed like claws They were strong those hands men had died in their clutch Even Gulka s huge black column of a neck might break like a rotten branch between them a wave of weakness made the futility of these thoughts apparent to an extent that needed not the verification of the moonlight glimmering from the spear in Gulka s black hand Kane could not even have fled had he wished and he had never fled from a single foe The gorilla slayer moved out into the glade Massive terrible he was the personification of the primitive the Stone Age His mouth yawned in a red cavern of a grin he bore himself with the haughty arrogance of savage might Kane tensed himself for the struggle that could end but one way He strove to rally his waning forces Useless he had lost too much blood At least he would meet his death on his feet and somehow he stiffened his buckling knees and held himself erect though the glade shimmered before him in uncertain waves and the moonlight seemed to have become a red fog through which he dimly glimpsed the approaching black man Kane stooped though the effort nearly pitched him on his face he dipped water in his cupped hands and dashed it into his face This revived him and he straightened hoping that Gulka would charge and get it over with before his weakness crumpled him to the earth Gulka was now about the center of the glade moving with the slow easy stride of a great cat stalking a victim He was not at all in a hurry to consummate his purpose He wanted to toy with his victim to see fear come into those grim eyes which had looked him down even when the possessor of those eyes had been bound to the death stake He wanted to slay at last slowly glutting his tigerish blood lust and torture lust to the fullest extent Then suddenly he halted turned swiftly facing another side of the glade Kane wondering followed his glance At first it seemed like a blacker shadow among the jungle shadows At first there was no motion no sound but Kane instinctively knew that some terrible menace lurked there in the darkness that masked and merged the silent trees A sullen horror brooded there and Kane felt as if from that monstrous shadow inhuman eyes seared his very soul Yet simultaneously there came the fantastic sensation that these eyes were not directed on him He looked at the gorilla slayer The black man had apparently forgotten him he stood half crouching spear lifted eyes fixed upon that clump of blackness Kane looked again Now there was motion in the shadows they merged fantastically and moved out into the glade much as Gulka had done Kane blinked was this the illusion that precedes death The shape he looked upon was such as he had visioned dimly in wild nightmares when the wings of sleep bore him back through lost ages He thought at first it was some blasphemous mockery of a man for it went erect and was tall as a tall man But it was inhumanly broad and thick and its gigantic arms hung nearly to its misshapen feet Then the moonlight smote full upon its bestial face and Kane s mazed mind thought that the thing was the Black God coming out of the shadows animated and blood lusting Then he saw that it was covered with hair and he remembered the manlike thing dangling from the roof pole in the native village He looked at Gulka The Negro was facing the gorilla spear at the charge He was not afraid but his sluggish mind was wondering over the miracle that brought this beast so far from his native jungles The mighty ape came out into the moonlight and there was a terrible majesty about his movements He was nearer Kane than Gulka but he did not seem to be aware of the white man His small blazing eyes were fixed on the black man with terrible intensity He advanced with a curious swaying stride Far away the drums whispered through the night like an accompaniment to this grim Stone Age drama The savage crouched in the middle of the glade but the primordial came out of the jungle with eyes bloodshot and blood lusting The Negro was face to face with a thing more primitive than he Again ghosts of memories whispered to Kane you have seen such sights before they murmured back in the dim days the dawn days when beast and beast man battled for supremacy Gulka moved away from the ape in a half circle crouching spear ready With all his craft he was seeking to trick the gorilla to make a swift kill for he had never before met such a monster as this and though he did not fear he had begun to doubt The ape made no attempt to stalk or circle he strode straight forward toward Gulka The black man who faced him and the white man who watched could not know the brutish love the brutish hate that had driven the monster down from the low forest covered hills of the north to follow for leagues the trail of him who was the scourge of his kind the slayer of his mate whose body now hung from the roof pole of the Negro village The end came swiftly almost like a sudden gesture They were close now beast and beast man and suddenly with an earth shaking roar the gorilla charged A great hairy arm smote aside the thrusting spear and the ape closed with the Negro There was a shattering sound as of many branches breaking simultaneously and Gulka slumped silently to the earth to lie with arms legs and body flung in strange unnatural positions The ape towered an instant above him like a statue of the primordial triumphant Far away Kane heard the drums murmur The soul of the jungle the soul of the jungle this phrase surged through his mind with monotonous reiteration The three who had stood in power before the Black God that night where were they Back in the village where the drums rustled lay Songa King Songa once lord of life and death now a shriveled corpse with a face set in a mask of horror Stretched on his back in the middle of the glade lay he whom Kane had followed many a league by land and sea And Gulka the gorilla slayer lay at the feet of his killer broken at last by the savagery which had made him a true son of this grim land which had at last overwhelmed him Yet the Black God still reigned thought Kane dizzily brooding back in the shadows of this dark country bestial blood lusting caring naught who lived or died so that he drank Kane watched the mighty ape wondering how long it would be before the huge simian spied and charged him But the gorilla gave no evidence of having even seen him Some dim impulse of vengeance yet unglutted prompting him he bent and raised the Negro Then he slouched toward the jungle Gulka s limbs trailing limply and grotesquely As he reached the trees the ape halted whirling the giant form high in the air with seemingly no effort and dashed the dead man up among the branches There was a rending sound as a broken projecting limb tore through the body hurled so powerfully against it and the dead gorilla slayer dangled there hideously A moment the clear moon limned the great ape in its glimmer as he stood silently gazing up at his victim then like a dark shadow he melted noiselessly into the jungle Kane walked slowly to the middle of the glade and took up his rapier The blood had ceased to flow from his wounds and some of his strength was returning enough at least for him to reach the coast where his ship awaited him He halted at the edge of the glade for a backward glance at Le Loup s upturned face and still form white in the moonlight and at the dark shadow among the trees that was Gulka left by some bestial whim hanging as the she gorilla hung in the village Afar the drums muttered The wisdom of our land is ancient the wisdom of our land is dark whom we serve we destroy Flee if you would live but you will never forget our chant Never never sang the drums Kane turned to the trail which led to the beach and the ship waiting there THE END pre p img src pga australia jpg width eighty height seventy five alt p p b This site is full of FREE ebooks a href http
