SNOBS By One Of Themselves William Makepeace Thackeray PREFATORY REMARKS The necessity of a work on Snobs demonstrated from History and proved by felicitous illustrations I am the individual destined to write that work My vocation is announced in terms of great eloquence I show that the world has been gradually preparing itself for the WORK and the MAN Snobs are to be studied like other objects of Natural Science and are a part of the Beautiful with a large B They pervade all classes Affecting instance of Colonel Snobley We have all read a statement the authenticity of which I take leave to doubt entirely for upon what calculations I should like to know is it founded we have all I say been favoured by perusing a remark that when the times and necessities of the world call for a Man that individual is found Thus at the French Revolution which the reader will be pleased to have introduced so early when it was requisite to administer a corrective dose to the nation Robespierre was found a most foul and nauseous dose indeed and swallowed eagerly by the patient greatly to the latter s ultimate advantage thus when it became necessary to kick John Bull out of America mister Washington stepped forward and performed that job to satisfaction thus when the Earl of Aldborough was unwell Professor Holloway appeared with his pills and cured his lordship as per advertisement c c Numberless instances might be adduced to show that when a nation is in great want the relief is at hand just as in the Pantomime that microcosm where when CLOWN wants anything a warming pan a pump handle a goose or a lady s tippet a fellow comes sauntering out from behind the side scenes with the very article in question Again when men commence an undertaking they always are prepared to show that the absolute necessities of the world demanded its completion Say it is a railroad the directors begin by stating that A more intimate communication between Bathershins and Derrynane Beg is necessary for the advancement of civilization and demanded by the multitudinous acclamations of the great Irish people Or suppose it is a newspaper the prospectus states that At a time when the Church is in danger threatened from without by savage fanaticism and miscreant unbelief and undermined from within by dangerous Jesuitism and suicidal Schism a Want has been universally felt a suffering people has looked abroad for an Ecclesiastical Champion and Guardian A body of Prelates and Gentlemen have therefore stepped forward in this our hour of danger and determined on establishing the BEADLE newspaper c c One or other of these points at least is incontrovertible the public wants a thing therefore it is supplied with it or the public is supplied with a thing therefore it wants it I have long gone about with a conviction on my mind that I had a work to do a Work if you like with a great W a Purpose to fulfil a chasm to leap into like Curtius horse and foot a Great Social Evil to Discover and to Remedy That Conviction Has Pursued me for Years It has Dogged me in the Busy Street Seated Itself By Me in The Lonely Study Jogged My Elbow as it Lifted the Wine cup at The Festive Board Pursued me through the Maze of Rotten Row Followed me in Far Lands On Brighton s Shingly Beach or Margate s Sand the Voice Outpiped the Roaring of the Sea it Nestles in my Nightcap and It Whispers Wake Slumberer thy Work Is Not Yet Done Last Year By Moonlight in the Colosseum the Little Sedulous Voice Came To Me and Said Smith or Jones The Writer s Name is Neither Here nor There Smith or Jones my fine fellow this is all very well but you ought to be at home writing your great work on SNOBS When a man has this sort of vocation it is all nonsense attempting to elude it He must speak out to the nations he must unbusm himself as Jeames would say or choke and die Mark to yourself I have often mentally exclaimed to your humble servant the gradual way in which you have been prepared for and are now led by an irresistible necessity to enter upon your great labour First the World was made then as a matter of course Snobs they existed for years and years and were no more known than America But presently INGENS PATEBAT TELLUS the people became darkly aware that there was such a race Not above five and twenty years since a name an expressive monosyllable arose to designate that race That name has spread over England like railroads subsequently Snobs are known and recognized throughout an Empire on which I am given to understand the Sun never sets PUNCH appears at the ripe season to chronicle their history and the individual comes forth to write that history in PUNCH I have and for this gift I congratulate myself with Deep and Abiding Thankfulness an eye for a Snob If the Truthful is the Beautiful it is Beautiful to study even the Snobbish to track Snobs through history as certain little dogs in Hampshire hunt out truffles to sink shafts in society and come upon rich veins of Snobore Snobbishness is like Death in a quotation from Horace which I hope you never have heard beating with equal foot at poor men s doors and kicking at the gates of Emperors It is a great mistake to judge of Snobs lightly and think they exist among the lower classes merely An immense percentage of Snobs I believe is to be found in every rank of this mortal life You must not judge hastily or vulgarly of Snobs to do so shows that you are yourself a Snob I myself have been taken for one When I was taking the waters at Bagnigge Wells and living at the Imperial Hotel there there used to sit opposite me at breakfast for a short time a Snob so insufferable that I felt I should never get any benefit of the waters so long as he remained His name was Lieutenant Colonel Snobley of a certain dragoon regiment He wore japanned boots and moustaches he lisped drawled and left the r s out of his words he was always flourishing about and smoothing his lacquered whiskers with a huge flaming bandanna that filled the room with an odour of musk so stifling that I determined to do battle with that Snob and that either he or I should quit the Inn I first began harmless conversations with him frightening him exceedingly for he did not know what to do when so attacked and had never the slightest notion that anybody would take such a liberty with him as to speak first then I handed him the paper then as he would take no notice of these advances I used to look him in the face steadily and and use my fork in the light of a toothpick After two mornings of this practice he could bear it no longer and fairly quitted the place Should the Colonel see this will he remember the Gent who asked him if he thought Publicoaler was a fine writer and drove him from the Hotel with a four pronged fork CHAPTER I THE SNOB PLAYFULLY DEALT WITH There are relative and positive Snobs I mean by positive such persons as are Snobs everywhere in all companies from morning till night from youth to the grave being by Nature endowed with Snobbishness and others who are Snobs only in certain circumstances and relations of life For instance I once knew a man who committed before me an act as atrocious as that which I have indicated in the last chapter as performed by me for the purpose of disgusting Colonel Snobley viz the using the fork in the guise of a toothpick I once I say knew a man who dining in my company at the Europa Coffee house opposite the Grand Opera and as everybody knows the only decent place for dining at Naples ate peas with the assistance of his knife He was a person with whose society I was greatly pleased at first indeed we had met in the crater of Mount Vesuvius and were subsequently robbed and held to ransom by brigands in Calabria which is nothing to the purpose a man of great powers excellent heart and varied information but I had never before seen him with a dish of pease and his conduct in regard to them caused me the deepest pain After having seen him thus publicly comport himself but one course was open to me to cut his acquaintance I commissioned a mutual friend the Honourable Poly Anthus to break the matter to this gentleman as delicately as possible and to say that painful circumstances in nowise affecting mister Marrowfat s honour or my esteem for him had occurred which obliged me to forego my intimacy with him and accordingly we met and gave each other the cut direct that night at the Duchess of Monte Fiasco s ball Everybody at Naples remarked the separation of the Damon and Pythias indeed Marrowfat had saved my life more than once but as an English gentleman what was I to do My dear friend was in this instance the Snob RELATIVE It is not snobbish of persons of rank of any other nation to employ their knife in the manner alluded to I have seen Monte Fiasco clean his trencher with his knife and every Principe in company doing likewise I have seen at the hospitable board of H I H the Grand Duchess Stephanie of Baden who if these humble lines should come under her Imperial eyes is besought to remember graciously the most devoted of her servants I have seen I say the Hereditary Princess of Potztausend Donnerwetter that serenely beautiful woman use her knife in lieu of a fork or spoon I have seen her almost swallow it by Jove like Ramo Samee the Indian juggler And did I blench Did my estimation for the Princess diminish No lovely Amalia One of the truest passions that ever was inspired by woman was raised in this bosom by that lady Beautiful one long long may the knife carry food to those lips the reddest and loveliest in the world The cause of my quarrel with Marrowfat I never breathed to mortal soul for four years We met in the halls of the aristocracy our friends and relatives We jostled each other in the dance or at the board but the estrangement continued and seemed irrevocable until the fourth of June last year We met at Sir George Golloper s We were placed he on the right your humble servant on the left of the admirable Lady G Peas formed part of the banquet ducks and green peas I trembled as I saw Marrowfat helped and turned away sickening lest I should behold the weapon darting down his horrid jaws What was my astonishment what my delight when I saw him use his fork like any other Christian He did not administer the cold steel once Old times rushed back upon me the remembrance of old services his rescuing me from the brigands his gallant conduct in the affair with the Countess Dei Spinachi his lending me the seventeen hundredL I almost burst into tears with joy my voice trembled with emotion George my boy I exclaimed George Marrowfat my dear fellow a glass of wine Blushing deeply moved almost as tremulous as I was myself George answered FRANK SHALL IT BE HOCK OR MADEIRA I could have hugged him to my heart but for the presence of the company Little did Lady Golloper know what was the cause of the emotion which sent the duckling I was carving into her ladyship s pink satin lap The most good natured of women pardoned the error and the butler removed the bird We have been the closest friends over since nor of course has George repeated his odious habit He acquired it at a country school where they cultivated peas and only used two pronged forks and it was only by living on the Continent where the usage of the four prong is general that he lost the horrible custom In this point and in this only I confess myself a member of the Silver Fork School and if this tale but induce one of my readers to pause to examine in his own mind solemnly and ask Do I or do I not eat peas with a knife to see the ruin which may fall upon himself by continuing the practice or his family by beholding the example these lines will not have been written in vain And now whatever other authors may be I flatter myself it will be allowed that I at least am a moral man By the way as some readers are dull of comprehension I may as well say what the moral of this history is The moral is this Society having ordained certain customs men are bound to obey the law of society and conform to its harmless orders If I should go to the British and Foreign Institute and heaven forbid I should go under any pretext or in any costume whatever if I should go to one of the tea parties in a dressing gown and slippers and not in the usual attire of a gentleman viz pumps a gold waistcoat a crush hat a sham frill and a white choker I should be insulting society and EATING PEASE WITH MY KNIFE Let the porters of the Institute hustle out the individual who shall so offend Such an offender is as regards society a most emphatical and refractory Snob It has its code and police as well as governments and he must conform who would profit by the decrees set forth for their common comfort I am naturally averse to egotism and hate selflaudation consumedly but I can t help relating here a circumstance illustrative of the point in question in which I must think I acted with considerable prudence Being at Constantinople a few years since on a delicate mission the Russians were playing a double game between ourselves and it became necessary on our part to employ an EXTRA NEGOTIATOR Leckerbiss Pasha of Roumelia then Chief Galeongee of the Porte gave a diplomatic banquet at his summer palace at Bujukdere I was on the left of the Galeongee and the Russian agent Count de Diddloff on his dexter side Diddloff is a dandy who would die of a rose in aromatic pain he had tried to have me assassinated three times in the course of the negotiation but of course we were friends in public and saluted each other in the most cordial and charming manner The Galeongee is or was alas for a bow string has done for him a staunch supporter of the old school of Turkish politics We dined with our fingers and had flaps of bread for plates the only innovation he admitted was the use of European liquors in which he indulged with great gusto He was an enormous eater Amongst the dishes a very large one was placed before him of a lamb dressed in its wool stuffed with prunes garlic assafoetida capsicums and other condiments the most abominable mixture that ever mortal smelt or tasted The Galeongee ate of this hugely and pursuing the Eastern fashion insisted on helping his friends right and left and when he came to a particularly spicy morsel would push it with his own hands into his guests very mouths I never shall forget the look of poor Diddloff when his Excellency rolling up a large quantity of this into a ball and exclaiming Buk Buk it is very good administered the horrible bolus to Diddloff The Russian s eyes rolled dreadfully as he received it he swallowed it with a grimace that I thought must precede a convulsion and seizing a bottle next him which he thought was Sauterne but which turned out to be French brandy he drank off nearly a pint before he know his error It finished him he was carried away from the dining room almost dead and laid out to cool in a summer house on the Bosphorus When it came to my turn I took down the condiment with a smile said Bismillah licked my lips with easy gratification and when the next dish was served made up a ball myself so dexterously and popped it down the old Galeongee s mouth with so much grace that his heart was won Russia was put out of court at once and THE TREATY of Kabobanople WAS SIGNED As for Diddloff all was over with HIM he was recalled to saint Petersburg and Sir Roderick Murchison saw him under the No three thousand nine hundred sixty seven working in the Ural mines The moral of this tale I need not say is that there are many disagreeable things in society which you are bound to take down and to do so with a smiling face CHAPTER II THE SNOB ROYAL Long since at the commencement of the reign of her present Gracious Majesty it chanced on a fair summer evening as mister James would say that three or four young cavaliers were drinking a cup of wine after dinner at the hostelry called the King s Arms kept by Mistress Anderson in the royal village of Kensington Twas a balmy evening and the wayfarers looked out on a cheerful scene The tall elms of the ancient gardens were in full leaf and countless chariots of the nobility of England whirled by to the neighbouring palace where princely Sussex whose income latterly only allowed him to give tea parties entertained his royal niece at a state banquet When the caroches of the nobles had set down their owners at the banquethall their varlets and servitors came to quaff a flagon of nut brown ale in the King s Arms gardens hard by We watched these fellows from our lattice By Saint Boniface twas a rare sight The tulips in Mynheer Van Dunck s gardens were not more gorgeous than the liveries of these pie coated retainers All the flowers of the field bloomed in their ruffled bosoms all the hues of the rainbow gleamed in their plush breeches and the long caned ones walked up and down the garden with that charming solemnity that delightful quivering swagger of the calves which has always had a frantic fascination for us The walk was not wide enough for them as the shoulder knots strutted up and down it in canary and crimson and light blue Suddenly in the midst of their pride a little bell was rung a side door opened and after setting down their Royal Mistress her Majesty s own crimson footmen with epaulets and black plushes came in It was pitiable to see the other poor Johns slink off at this arrival Not one of the honest private Plushes could stand up before the Royal Flunkeys They left the walk they sneaked into dark holes and drank their beer in silence The Royal Plush kept possession of the garden until the Royal Plush dinner was announced when it retired and we heard from the pavilion where they dined conservative cheers and speeches and Kentish fires The other Flunkeys we never saw more My dear Flunkeys so absurdly conceited at one moment and so abject at the next are but the types of their masters in this world HE WHO MEANLY ADMIRES MEAN THINGS IS A SNOB perhaps that is a safe definition of the character And this is why I have with the utmost respect ventured to place The Snob Royal at the head of my list causing all others to give way before him as the Flunkeys before the royal representative in Kensington Gardens To say of such and such a Gracious Sovereign that he is a Snob is but to say that his Majesty is a man Kings too are men and Snobs In a country where Snobs are in the majority a prime one surely cannot be unfit to govern With us they have succeeded to admiration For instance James I was a Snob and a Scotch Snob than which the world contains no more offensive creature He appears to have had not one of the good qualities of a man neither courage nor generosity nor honesty nor brains but read what the great Divines and Doctors of England said about him Charles II his grandson was a rogue but not a Snob whilst Louis XIV his old squaretoes of a contemporary the great worshipper of Bigwiggery has always struck me as a most undoubted and Royal Snob I will not however take instances from our own country of Royal Snobs but refer to a neighbouring kingdom that of Brentford and its monarch the late great and lamented Gorgius IV With the same humility with which the footmen at the King s Arms gave way before the Plush Royal the aristocracy of the Brentford nation bent down and truckled before Gorgius and proclaimed him the first gentleman in Europe And it s a wonder to think what is the gentlefolks opinion of a gentleman when they gave Gorgius such a title What is it to be a gentleman Is it to be honest to be gentle to be generous to be brave to be wise and possessing all these qualities to exercise them in the most graceful outward manner Ought a gentleman to be a loyal son a true husband and honest father Ought his life to be decent his bills to be paid his tastes to be high and elegant his aims in life lofty and noble In a word ought not the Biography of a First Gentleman in Europe to be of such a nature that it might be read in Young Ladies Schools with advantage and studied with profit in the Seminaries of Young Gentlemen I put this question to all instructors of youth to missus Ellis and the Women of England to all schoolmasters from Doctor Hawtrey down to mister Squeers I conjure up before me an awful tribunal of youth and innocence attended by its venerable instructors like the ten thousand red cheeked charity children in Saint Paul s sitting in judgment and Gorgius pleading his cause in the midst Out of Court out of Court fat old Florizel Beadles turn out that bloated pimple faced man If Gorgius MUST have a statue in the new Palace which the Brentford nation is building it ought to be set up in the Flunkeys Hall He should be represented cutting out a coat in which art he is said to have excelled He also invented Maraschino punch a shoe buckle this was in the vigour of his youth and the prime force of his invention and a Chinese pavilion the most hideous building in the world He could drive a four in hand very nearly as well as the Brighton coachman could fence elegantly and it is said played the fiddle well And he smiled with such irresistible fascination that persons who were introduced into his august presence became his victims body and soul as a rabbit becomes the prey of a great big boa constrictor I would wager that if mister Widdicomb were by a revolution placed on the throne of Brentford people would be equally fascinated by his irresistibly majestic smile and tremble as they knelt down to kiss his hand If he went to Dublin they would erect an obelisk on the spot where he first landed as the Paddylanders did when Gorgius visited them We have all of us read with delight that story of the King s voyage to Haggisland where his presence inspired such a fury of loyalty and where the most famous man of the country the Baron of Bradwardine coming on board the royal yacht and finding a glass out of which Gorgius had drunk put it into his coatpocket as an inestimable relic and went ashore in his boat again But the Baron sat down upon the glass and broke it and cut his coat tails very much and the inestimable relic was lost to the world for ever O noble Bradwardine what old world superstition could set you on your knees before such an idol as that If you want to moralise upon the mutability of human affairs go and see the figure of Gorgius in his real identical robes at the waxwork Admittance one shilling Children and flunkeys sixpence Go and pay sixpence CHAPTER III THE INFLUENCE OF THE ARISTOCRACY ON SNOBS Last Sunday week being at church in this city and the service just ended I heard two Snobs conversing about the Parson One was asking the other who the clergyman was He is mister So and so the second Snob answered domestic chaplain to the Earl of What d ye call im Oh is he said the first Snob with a tone of indescribable satisfaction The Parson s orthodoxy and identity were at once settled in this Snob s mind He knew no more about the Earl than about the Chaplain but he took the latter s character upon the authority of the former and went home quite contented with his Reverence like a little truckling Snob This incident gave me more matter for reflection even than the sermon and wonderment at the extent and prevalence of Lordolatory in this country What could it matter to Snob whether his Reverence were chaplain to his Lordship or not What Peerageworship there is all through this free country How we are all implicated in it and more or less down on our knees And with regard to the great subject on hand I think that the influence of the Peerage upon Snobbishness has been more remarkable than that of any other institution The increase encouragement and maintenance of Snobs are among the priceless services as Lord John Russell says which we owe to the nobility It can t be otherwise A man becomes enormously rich or he jobs successfully in the aid of a Minister or he wins a great battle or executes a treaty or is a clever lawyer who makes a multitude of fees and ascends the bench and the country rewards him for ever with a gold coronet with more or less balls or leaves and a title and a rank as legislator Your merits are so great says the nation that your children shall be allowed to reign over us in a manner It does not in the least matter that your eldest son be a fool we think your services so remarkable that he shall have the reversion of your honours when death vacates your noble shoes If you are poor we will give you such a sum of money as shall enable you and the eldest born of your race for ever to live in fat and splendour It is our wish that there should be a race set apart in this happy country who shall hold the first rank have the first prizes and chances in all government jobs and patronages We cannot make all your dear children Peers that would make Peerage common and crowd the House of Lords uncomfortably but the young ones shall have everything a Government can give they shall get the pick of all the places they shall be Captains and Lieutenant Colonels at nineteen when hoary headed old lieutenants are spending thirty years at drill they shall command ships at one and twenty and veterans who fought before they were born And as we are eminently a free people and in order to encourage all men to do their duty we say to any man of any rank get enormously rich make immense fees as a lawyer or great speeches or distinguish yourself and win battles and you even you shall come into the privileged class and your children shall reign naturally over ours How can we help Snobbishness with such a prodigious national institution erected for its worship How can we help cringing to Lords Flesh and blood can t do otherwise What man can withstand this prodigious temptation Inspired by what is called a noble emulation some people grasp at honours and win them others too weak or mean blindly admire and grovel before those who have gained them others not being able to acquire them furiously hate abuse and envy There are only a few bland and not in the least conceited philosophers who can behold the state of society viz Toadyism organised base Man and Mammon worship instituted by command of law Snobbishness in a word perpetuated and mark the phenomenon calmly And of these calm moralists is there one I wonder whose heart would not throb with pleasure if he could be seen walking arm in arm with a couple of dukes down Pall Mall No it is impossible in our condition of society not to be sometimes a Snob On one hand it encourages the commoner to be snobbishly mean and the noble to be snobbishly arrogant When a noble marchioness writes in her travels about the hard necessity under which steam boat travellers labour of being brought into contact with all sorts and conditions of people implying that a fellowship with God s creatures is disagreeable to to her Ladyship who is their superior when I say the Marchioness of writes in this fashion we must consider that out of her natural heart it would have been impossible for any woman to have had such a sentiment but that the habit of truckling and cringing which all who surround her have adopted towards this beautiful and magnificent lady this proprietor of so many black and other diamonds has really induced her to believe that she is the superior of the world in general and that people are not to associate with her except awfully at a distance I recollect being once at the city of Grand Cairo through which a European Royal Prince was passing India wards One night at the inn there was a great disturbance a man had drowned himself in the well hard by all the inhabitants of the hotel came bustling into the Court and amongst others your humble servant who asked of a certain young man the reason of the disturbance How was I to know that this young gent was a prince He had not his crown and sceptre on he was dressed in a white jacket and felt hat but he looked surprised at anybody speaking to him answered an unintelligible monosyllable and BECKONED HIS AID DE CAMP TO COME AND SPEAK TO ME It is our fault not that of the great that they should fancy themselves so far above us If you WILL fling yourself under the wheels Juggernaut will go over you depend upon it and if you and I my dear friend had Kotow performed before us every day found people whenever we appeared grovelling in slavish adoration we should drop into the airs of superiority quite naturally and accept the greatness with which the world insisted upon endowing us Here is an instance out of Lord L s travels of that calm good natured undoubting way in which a great man accepts the homage of his inferiors After making some profound and ingenious remarks about the town of Brussells his lordship says Staying some day at the Hotel de Belle Vue a greatly overrated establishment and not nearly as comfortable as the Hotel de France I made acquaintance with doctor L the physician of the Mission He was desirous of doing the honours of the place to me and he ordered for us a DINER EN GOURMAND at the chief restaurateur s maintaining it surpassed the Rocher at Paris Six or eight partook of the entertainment and we all agreed it was infinitely inferior to the Paris display and much more extravagant So much for the copy And so much for the gentleman who gave the dinner doctor L desirous to do his lordship the honour of the place feasts him with the best victuals money can procure and my lord finds the entertainment extravagant and inferior Extravagant it was not extravagant to HIM Inferior mister L did his best to satisfy those noble jaws and my lord receives the entertainment and dismisses the giver with a rebuke It is like a three tailed Pasha grumbling about an unsatisfactory backsheesh But how should it be otherwise in a country where Lordolatry is part of our creed and where our children are brought up to respect the Peerage as the Englishman s second Bible CHAPTER IV THE COURT CIRCULAR AND ITS INFLUENCE ON SNOBS Example is the best of precepts so let us begin with a true and authentic story showing how young aristocratic snobs are reared and how early their Snobbishness may be made to bloom A beautiful and fashionable lady pardon gracious madam that your story should be made public but it is so moral that it ought to be known to the universal world told me that in her early youth she had a little acquaintance who is now indeed a beautiful and fashionable lady too In mentioning Miss Snobky daughter of Sir Snobby Snobky whose presentation at Court caused such a sensation need I say more When Miss Snobky was so very young as to be in the nursery regions and to walk off early mornings in saint James s Park protected by a French governess and followed by a huge hirsute flunkey in the canary coloured livery of the Snobkys she used occasionally in these promenades to meet with young Lord Claude Lollipop the Marquis of Sillabub s younger son In the very height of the season from some unexplained cause the Snobkys suddenly determined upon leaving town Miss Snobky spoke to her female friend and confidante What will poor Claude Lollipop say when he hears of my absence asked the tender hearted child Oh perhaps he won t hear of it answers the confidante MY DEAR HE WILL READ IT IN THE PAPERS replied the dear little fashionable rogue of seven years old She knew already her importance and how all the world of England how all the would be genteel people how all the silver fork worshippers how all the tattle mongers how all the grocers ladies the tailors ladies the attorneys and merchants ladies and the people living at Clapham and Brunswick Square who have no more chance of consorting with a Snobky than my beloved reader has of dining with the Emperor of China yet watched the movements of the Snobkys with interest and were glad to know when they came to London and left it Here is the account of Miss Snobky s dress and that of her mother Lady Snobky from the papers MISS SNOBKY Habit de Cour composed of a yellow nankeen illusion dress over a slip of rich pea green corduroy trimmed en tablier with bouquets of Brussels sprouts the body and sleeves handsomely trimmed with calimanco and festooned with a pink train and white radishes Head dress carrots and lappets LADY SNOBKY Costume de Cour composed of a train of the most superb Pekin bandannas elegantly trimmed with spangles tinfoil and red tape Bodice and underdress of sky blue velveteen trimmed with bouffants and noeuds of bell pulls Stomacher a muffin Head dress a bird s nest with a bird of paradise over a rich brass knocker en ferroniere This splendid costume by Madame Crinoline of Regent Street was the object of universal admiration This is what you read Oh missus Ellis Oh mothers daughters aunts grandmothers of England this is the sort of writing which is put in the newspapers for you How can you help being the mothers daughters c of Snobs so long as this balderdash is set before you You stuff the little rosy foot of a Chinese young lady of fashion into a slipper that is about the size of a salt cruet and keep the poor little toes there imprisoned and twisted up so long that the dwarfishness becomes irremediable Later the foot would not expand to the natural size were you to give her a washing tub for a shoe and for all her life she has little feet and is a cripple Oh my dear Miss Wiggins thank your stars that those beautiful feet of yours though I declare when you walk they are so small as to be almost invisible thank your stars that society never so practised upon them but look around and see how many friends of ours in the highest circles have had their BRAINS so prematurely and hopelessly pinched and distorted How can you expect that those poor creatures are to move naturally when the world and their parents have mutilated them so cruelly As long as a COURT CIRCULAR exists how the deuce are people whose names are chronicled in it ever to believe themselves the equals of the cringing race which daily reads that abominable trash I believe that ours is the only country in the world now where the COURT CIRCULAR remains in full flourish where you read This day his Royal Highness Prince Pattypan was taken an airing in his go cart The Princess Pimminy was taken a drive attended by her ladies of honour and accompanied by her doll c We laugh at the solemnity with which Saint Simon announces that SA MAJESTE SE MEDICAMENTE AUJOURD HUI Under our very noses the same folly is daily going on That wonderful and mysterious man the author of the COURT CIRCULAR drops in with his budget at the newspaper offices every night I once asked the editor of a paper to allow me to lie in wait and see him I am told that in a kingdom where there is a German King Consort Portugal it must be for the Queen of that country married a German Prince who is greatly admired and respected by the natives whenever the Consort takes the diversion of shooting among the rabbit warrens of Cintra or the pheasant preserve of Mafra he has a keeper to load his guns as a matter of course and then they are handed to the nobleman his equerry and the nobleman hands them to the Prince who blazes away gives back the discharged gun to the nobleman who gives it to the keeper and so on But the Prince WON T TAKE THE GUN FROM THE HANDS OF THE LOADER As long as this unnatural and monstrous etiquette continues Snobs there must be The three persons engaged in this transaction are for the time being Snobs one The keeper the least Snob of all because he is discharging his daily duty but he appears here as a Snob that is to say in a position of debasement before another human being the Prince with whom he is allowed to communicate through another party A free Portuguese gamekeeper who professes himself to be unworthy to communicate directly with any person confesses himself to be a Snob two The nobleman in waiting is a Snob If it degrades the Prince to receive the gun from the gamekeeper it is degrading to the nobleman in waiting to execute that service He acts as a Snob towards the keeper whom he keeps from communication with the Prince a Snob to the Prince to whom he pays a degrading homage three The King Consort of Portugal is a Snob for insulting fellow men in this way There s no harm in his accepting the services of the keeper directly but indirectly he insults the service performed and the servants who perform it and therefore I say respectfully is a most undoubted though royal Snob And then you read in the DIARIO DO GOBERNO Yesterday his Majesty the King took the diversion of shooting the woods off Cintra attended by Colonel the honourable Whiskerando Sombrero His Majesty returned to the Necessidades to lunch at c c Oh that COURT CIRCULAR once more I exclaim Down with the COURT CIRCULAR that engine and propagator of Snobbishness I promise to subscribe for a year to any daily paper that shall come out without a COURT CIRCULAR were it the MORNING HERALD itself When I read that trash I rise in my wrath I feel myself disloyal a regicide a member of the Calf s Head Club The only COURT CIRCULAR story which ever pleased me was that of the King of Spain who in great part was roasted because there was not time for the Prime Minister to command the Lord Chamberlain to desire the Grand Gold Stick to order the first page in waiting to bid the chief of the flunkeys to request the House maid of Honour to bring up a pail of water to put his Majesty out I am like the Pasha of three tails to whom the Sultan sends HIS COURT CIRCULAR the bowstring It CHOKES me May its usage be abolished for ever CHAPTER V

1492-11251-0001	train-other-500	It is very well for the reader whose fine feelings are disgusted by the assertion that Kings Princes Lords are Snobs to say You are confessedly a Snob yourself In professing to depict Snobs
1492-11251-0002	train-other-500	it is only your own ugly mug which you are copying with a Narcissus like conceit and fatuity But I shall pardon this explosion of ill temper on the part of my constant reader reflecting upon the misfortune of his birth
1492-11251-0003	train-other-500	and country It is impossible for ANY Briton perhaps not to be a Snob in some degree If people can be convinced of this fact an immense point is gained surely
1492-11251-0004	train-other-500	If I have pointed out the disease let us hope that other scientific characters may discover the remedy If you who are a person of the middle ranks of life are a Snob
1492-11251-0005	train-other-500	you whom nobody flatters particularly you who have no toadies you whom no cringing flunkeys or shopmen bow out of doors you whom the policeman tells to move on
1492-11251-0006	train-other-500	you who are jostled in the crowd of this world and amongst the Snobs our brethren consider how much harder it is for a man to escape who has not your advantages
1492-11251-0007	train-other-500	and is all his life long subject to adulation the butt of meanness consider how difficult it is for the Snobs idol not to be a Snob As I was discoursing with my friend Eugenio in this impressive way
1492-11251-0008	train-other-500	Lord Buckram passed us the son of the Marquis of Bagwig and knocked at the door of the family mansion in Red Lion Square His noble father and mother occupied as everybody knows distinguished posts in the Courts of late Sovereigns
1492-11251-0009	train-other-500	The Marquis was Lord of the Pantry and her Ladyship Lady of the Powder Closet to Queen Charlotte Buck as I call him for we are very familiar gave me a nod as he passed
1492-11251-0010	train-other-500	and I proceeded to show Eugenio how it was impossible that this nobleman should not be one of ourselves having been practised upon by Snobs all his life His parents resolved to give him a public education
1492-11251-0011	train-other-500	and sent him to school at the earliest possible period The Reverend Otto Rose D D Principal of the Preparatory Academy for young noblemen and gentlemen Richmond Lodge took this little Lord in hand and fell down and worshipped him
none	none	 He always introduced him to fathers and mothers who came to visit their children at the school He referred with pride and pleasure to the most noble the Marquis of Bagwig as one of the kind friends and patrons of his Seminary He made Lord Buckram a bait for such a multiplicity of pupils that a new wing was built to Richmond Lodge and thirty five new little white dimity beds were added to the establishment Mm Rose used to take out the little Lord in the one horse chaise with her when she paid visits 
1492-11251-0012	train-other-500	until the Rector s lady and the Surgeon s wife almost died with envy His own son and Lord Buckram having been discovered robbing an orchard together the Doctor flogged his own flesh and blood most unmercifully for leading the young Lord astray
1492-11251-0013	train-other-500	He parted from him with tears There was always a letter directed to the Most Noble the Marquis ef Bagwig on the Doctor s study table when any visitors were received by him At Eton
1492-11251-0014	train-other-500	a great deal of Snobbishness was thrashed out of Lord Buckram and he was birched with perfect impartiality Even there however a select band of sucking tuft hunters followed him
none	none	 Young Croesus lent him three and twenty bran new sovereigns out of his father s bank Young Snaily did his exercises for him and tried to know him at home but Young Bull licked him in a fight of fifty five minutes 
1492-11251-0015	train-other-500	and he was caned several times with great advantage for not sufficiently polishing his master Smith s shoes Boys are not ALL toadies in the morning of life But when he went to the University
1492-11251-0016	train-other-500	crowds of toadies sprawled over him The tutors toadied him The fellows in hall paid him great clumsy compliments The Dean never remarked his absence from Chapel or heard any noise issuing from his rooms
1492-11251-0017	train-other-500	A number of respectable young fellows it is among the respectable the Baker Street class that Snobbishness flourishes more than among any set of people in England a number of these clung to him like leeches
none	none	 There was no end now to Croesus s loans of money and Buckram couldn t ride out with the hounds but Snaily a timid creature by nature was in the field and would take any leap at which his friend chose to ride Young Rose came up to the same College 
1492-11251-0018	train-other-500	having been kept back for that express purpose by his father He spent a quarter s allowance in giving Buckram a single dinner but he knew there was always pardon for him for extravagance in such a cause
1492-11251-0019	train-other-500	and a ten pound note always came to him from home when he mentioned Buckram s name in a letter What wild visions entered the brains of missus Podge and Miss Podge the wife and daughter of the Principal of Lord Buckram s College
none	none	 I don t know but that reverend old gentleman was too profound a flunkey by nature ever for one minute to think that a child of his could marry a nobleman He therefore hastened on his daughter s union with Professor Crab 
1492-11251-0020	train-other-500	When Lord Buckram after taking his honorary degree for Alma Mater is a Snob too and truckles to a Lord like the rest when Lord Buckram went abroad to finish his education
1492-11251-0021	train-other-500	you all know what dangers he ran and what numbers of caps were set at him Lady Leach and her daughters followed him from Paris to Rome
none	none	 and from Rome to Baden Baden Miss Leggitt burst into tears before his face when he announced his determination to quit Naples and fainted on the neck of her mamma Captain Macdragon of Macdragonstown County Tipperary called upon him to explene his intintions with respect to his sisther Miss Amalia Macdragon 
1492-11251-0022	train-other-500	of Macdragonstown and proposed to shoot him unless he married that spotless and beautiful young creature who was afterwards led to the altar by mister Muff at Cheltenham
1492-11251-0023	train-other-500	If perseverance and forty thousand pounds down could have tempted him Miss Lydia Croesus would certainly have been Lady Buckram Count Towrowski was glad to take her with half the meney as all the genteel world knows
none	none	 And now perhaps the reader is anxious to know what sort of a man this is who wounded so many ladies hearts 
1492-11251-0024	train-other-500	and who has been such a prodigious favourite with men If we were to describe him it would be personal
none	none	 Besides it really does not matter in the least what sort of a man he is 
1492-11251-0025	train-other-500	or what his personal qualities are Suppose he is a young nobleman of a literary turn and that he published poems ever so foolish and feeble the Snobs would purchase thousands of his volumes the publishers
none	none	 who refused my Passion Flowers and my grand Epic at any price would give him his own Suppose he is a nobleman of a jovial turn and has a fancy for wrenching off knockers frequenting ginshops and 
1492-11251-0026	train-other-500	half murdering policemen the public will sympathize good naturedly with his amusements and say he is a hearty honest fellow Suppose he is fond of play and the turf and has a fancy to be a blackleg
1492-11251-0027	train-other-500	and occasionally condescends to pluck a pigeon at cards the public will pardon him and many honest people will court him as they would court a housebreaker if he happened to be a Lord Suppose he is an idiot
1492-11251-0028	train-other-500	yet by the glorious constitution he is good enough to govern
none	none	 US 
1492-11251-0029	train-other-500	Suppose he is an honest highminded gentleman so much the better for himself But he may be an ass and yet respected or a ruffian and yet be exceedingly popular or a rogue
1492-11251-0030	train-other-500	and yet excuses will be found for him Snobs will still worship him Male Snobs will do him honour and females look kindly upon him
none	none	 however hideous he may be CHAPTER VI ON SOME RESPECTABLE SNOBS Having received a great deal of obloquy for dragging monarchs princes and the respected nobility into the Snob category I trust to please everybody in the present chapter by stating my firm opinion that it is among the RESPECTABLE classes of this vast and happy empire that the greatest profusion of Snobs is to be found I pace down my beloved Baker Street I am engaged on a life of Baker founder of this celebrated street I walk in Harley Street where every other house has a hatchment Wimpole Street that is as cheerful as the Catacombs a dingy Mausoleum of the genteel I rove round Regent s Park where the plaster is patching off the house walls where Methodist preachers are holding forth to three little children in the green inclosures and puffy valetudinarians are cantering in the solitary mud I thread the doubtful ZIG ZAGS of May Fair where missus Kitty Lorimer s Brougham may be seen drawn up next door to old Lady Lollipop s belozenged family coach I roam through Belgravia that pale and polite district where all the inhabitants look prim and correct and the mansions are painted a faint whity brown I lose myself in the new squares and terraces of the brilliant bran new Bayswater and Tyburn Junction line and in one and all of these districts the same truth comes across me I stop before any house at hazard and say O house you are inhabited O knocker you are knocked at O undressed flunkey sunning your lazy calves as you lean against the iron railings you are paid by Snobs It is a tremendous thought that and it is almost sufficient to drive a benevolent mind to madness to think that perhaps there is not one in ten of those houses where the Peerage does not lie on the drawing room table Considering the harm that foolish lying book does I would have all the copies of it burned as the barber burned all Quixote s books of humbugging chivalry Look at this grand house in the middle of the square The Earl of Loughcorrib lives there he has fifty thousand a year A DEJEUNER DANSANT given at his house last week cost who knows how much The mere flowers for the room and bouquets for the ladies cost four hundred pounds That man in drab trousers coming crying down the stops is a dun Lord Loughcorrib has ruined him and won t see him that is his lordship peeping through the blind of his study at him now Go thy ways Loughcorrib thou art a Snob a heartless pretender a hypocrite of hospitality a rogue who passes forged notes upon society but I am growing too eloquent You see that nice house No twenty three where a butcher s boy is ringing the area bell He has three muttonchops in his tray They are for the dinner of a very different and very respectable family for Lady Susan Scraper and her daughters Miss Scraper and Miss Emily Scraper The domestics luckily for them are on board wages two huge footmen in light blue and canary a fat steady coachman who is a Methodist and a butler who would never have stayed in the family but that he was orderly to General Scraper when the General distinguished himself at Walcheren His widow sent his portrait to the United Service Club and it is hung up in one of the back dressing closets there He is represented at a parlour window with red curtains in the distance is a whirlwind in which cannon are firing off and he is pointing to a chart on which are written the words Walcheren Tobago Lady Susan is as everybody knows by referring to the British Bible a daughter of the great and good Earl Bagwig before mentioned She thinks everything belonging to her the greatest and best in the world The first of men naturally are the Buckrams her own race then follow in rank the Scrapers The General was the greatest general his eldest son Scraper Buckram Scraper is at present the greatest and best his second son the next greatest and best and herself the paragon of women Indeed she is a most respectable and honourable lady She goes to church of course she would fancy the Church in danger if she did not She subscribes to Church and parish charities and is a directress of meritorious charitable institutions of Queen Charlotte s Lying in Hospital the Washerwomen s Asylum the British Drummers Daughters Home c She is a model of a matron The tradesman never lived who could say that he was not paid on the quarter day The beggars of her neighbourhood avoid her like a pestilence for while she walks out protected by John that domestic has always two or three mendicity tickets ready for deserving objects Ten guineas a year will pay all her charities There is no respectable lady in all London who gets her name more often printed for such a sum of money Those three mutton chops which you see entering at the kitchen door will be served on the family plate at seven o clock this evening the huge footman being present and the butler in black and the crest and coat of arms of the Scrapers blazing everywhere I pity Miss Emily Scraper she is still young young and hungry Is it a fact that she spends her pocket money in buns Malicious tongues say so but she has very little to spare for buns the poor little hungry soul For the fact is that when the footmen and the ladies maids and the fat coach horses which are jobbed and the six dinner parties in the season and the two great solemn evening parties and the rent of the big house and the journey to an English or foreign watering place for the autumn are paid my lady s income has dwindled away to a very small sum and she is as poor as you or I You would not think it when you saw her big carriage rattling up to the drawing room and caught a glimpse of her plumes lappets and diamonds waving over her ladyship s sandy hair and majestical hooked nose you would not think it when you hear Lady Susan Scraper s carriage bawled out at midnight so as to disturb all Belgravia you would not think it when she comes rustling into church the obsequious John behind with the bag of Prayer books Is it possible you would say that so grand and awful a personage as that can be hard up for money Alas So it is She never heard such a word as Snob I will engage in this wicked and vulgar world And O stars and garters how she would start if she heard that she she as solemn as Minerva she as chaste as Diana without that heathen goddess s unladylike propensity for field sports that she too was a Snob A Snob she is as long as she sets that prodigious value upon herself upon her name upon her outward appearance and indulges in that intolerable pomposity as long as she goes parading abroad like Solomon in all his glory as long as she goes to bed as I believe she does with a turban and a bird of paradise in it and a court train to her night gown as long as she is so insufferably virtuous and condescending as long as she does not cut at least one of those footmen down into mutton chops for the benefit of the young ladies I had my notions of her from my old schoolfellow her son Sydney Scraper a Chancery barrister without any practice the most placid polite and genteel of Snobs who never exceeded his allowance of two hundred a year and who may be seen any evening at the Oxford and Cambridge Club simpering over the QUARTERLY REVIEW in the blameless enjoyment of his half pint of port CHAPTER VII ON SOME RESPECTABLE SNOBS Look at the next house to Lady Susan Scraper s The first mansion with the awning over the door that canopy will be let down this evening for the comfort of the friends of Sir Alured and Lady S de Mogyns whose parties are so much admired by the public and the givers themselves Peach coloured liveries laced with silver and pea green plush inexpressibles render the De Mogyns flunkeys the pride of the ring when they appear in Hyde Park where Lady de Mogyns as she sits upon her satin cushions with her dwarf spaniel in her arms bows to the very selectest of the genteel Times are altered now with Mary Anne or as she calls herself Marian de Mogyns She was the daughter of Captain Flack of the Rathdrum Fencibles who crossed with his regiment over from Ireland to Caermarthenshire ever so many years ago and defended Wales from the Corsican invader The Rathdrums were quartered at Pontydwdlm where Marian wooed and won her De Mogyns a young banker in the place His attentions to Miss Flack at a race ball were such that her father said De Mogyns must either die on the field of honour or become his son in law He preferred marriage His name was Muggins then and his father a flourishing banker army contractor smuggler and general jobber almost disinherited him on account of this connection There is a story that Muggins the Elder was made a baronet for having lent money to a R y l p rs n ge I do not believe it The R y l Family always paid their debts from the Prince of Wales downwards Howbeit to his life s end he remained simple Sir Thomas Muggins representing Pontydwdlm in Parliament for many years after the war The old banker died in course of time and to use the affectionate phrase common on such occasions cut up prodigiously well His son Alfred Smith Mogyns succeeded to the main portion of his wealth and to his titles and the bloody hand of his scutcheon It was not for many years after that he appeared as Sir Alured Mogyns Smyth de Mogyns with a genealogy found out for him by the Editor of Fluke s Peerage and which appears as follows in that work De Mogyns Sir Alured Mogyns Smyth Second Baronet This gentleman is a representative of one of the most ancient families of Wales who trace their descent until it is lost in the mists of antiquity A genealogical tree beginning with Shem is in the possession of the family and is stated by a legend of many thousand years date to have been drawn on papyrus by a grandson of the patriarch himself Be this as it may there can be no doubt of the immense antiquity of the race of Mogyns In the time of Boadicea Hogyn Mogyn of the hundred Beeves was a suitor and a rival of Caractacus for the hand of that Princess He was a person gigantic in stature and was slain by Suetonius in the battle which terminated the liberties of Britain From him descended directly the Princes of Pontydwdlm Mogyn of the Golden Harp see the Mabinogion of Lady Charlotte Guest Bogyn Merodac ap Mogyn the black fiend son of Mogyn and a long list of bards and warriors celebrated both in Wales and Armorica The independent Princes of Mogyn long held out against the ruthless Kings of England until finally Gam Mogyns made his submission to Prince Henry son of Henry IV and under the name of Sir David Gam de Mogyns was distinguished at the battle of Agincourt From him the present Baronet is descended And here the descent follows in order until it comes to Thomas Muggins first Baronet of Pontydwdlm Castle for twenty three years Member of Parliament for that borough who had issue Alured Mogyns Smyth the present Baronet who married Marian daughter of the late general P Flack of Ballyflack in the Kingdom of Ireland of the Counts Flack of the H R Empire Sir Alured has issue Alured Caradoc born eighteen nineteen Marian eighteen eleven Blanche Adeliza Emily Doria Adelaide Obleans Katinka Rostopchin Patrick Flack died eighteen oh nine Arms a mullion garbled gules on a saltire reversed of the second Crest a tom tit rampant regardant Motto UNG ROY UNG MOGYNS It was long before Lady de Mogyns shone as a star in the fashionable world At first poor Muggins was the in the hands of the Flacks the Clancys the Tooles the Shanahans his wife s Irish relations and whilst he was yet but heir apparent his house overflowed with claret and the national nectar for the benefit of Hibernian relatives Tom Tufto absolutely left the street in which they lived in London because he said it was infected with such a confounded smell of whisky from the house of those IWISH people It was abroad that they learned to be genteel They pushed into all foreign courts and elbowed their way into the halls of Ambassadors They pounced upon the stray nobility and seized young lords travelling with their bear leaders They gave parties at Naples Rome and Paris They got a Royal Prince to attend their SOIREES at the latter place and it was here that they first appeared under the name of De Mogyns which they bear with such splendour to this day All sorts of stories are told of the desperate efforts made by the indomitable Lady de Mogyns to gain the place she now occupies and those of my beloved readers who live in middle life and are unacquainted with the frantic struggles the wicked feuds the intrigues cabals and disappointments which as I am given to understand reign in the fashionable world may bless their stars that they at least are not FASHIONABLE Snobs The intrigues set afoot by the De Mogyns to get the Duchess of Buckskin to her parties would strike a Talleyrand with admiration She had a brain fever after being disappointed of an invitation to Lady Aldermanbury s THE DANSANT and would have committed suicide but for a ball at Windsor I have the following story from my noble friend Lady Clapperclaw herself Lady Kathleen O Shaughnessy that was and daughter of the Earl of Turfanthunder When that odious disguised Irishwoman Lady Muggins was struggling to take her place in the world and was bringing out her hidjous daughter Blanche said old Lady Clapperclaw Marian has a hump back and doesn t show but she s the only lady in the family when that wretched Polly Muggins was bringing out Blanche with her radish of a nose and her carrots of ringlets and her turnip for a face she was most anxious as her father had been a cowboy on my father s land to be patronized by us and asked me point blank in the midst of a silence at Count Volauvent s the French Ambassador s dinner why I had not sent her a card for my ball Because my rooms are already too full and your ladyship would be crowded inconveniently says I indeed she takes up as much room as an elephant besides I wouldn t have her and that was flat I thought my answer was a settler to her but the next day she comes weeping to my arms Dear Lady Clapperclaw says she it s not for ME I ask it for my blessed Blanche a young creature in her first season and not at your ball My tender child will pine and die of vexation I don t want to come I will stay at home to nurse Sir Alured in the gout missus Bolster is going I know she will be Blanche s chaperon You wouldn t subscribe for the Rathdrum blanket and potato fund you who come out of the parish says I and whose grandfather honest man kept cows there Will twenty guineas be enough dearest Lady Clapperclaw Twenty guineas is sufficient says I and she paid them so I said Blanche may come but not you mind and she left me with a world of thanks Would you believe it when my ball came the horrid woman made her appearance with her daughter Didn t I tell you not to come said I in a mighty passion What would the world have said cries my Lady Muggins my carriage is gone for Sir Alured to the Club let me stay only ten minutes dearest Lady Clapperclaw Well as you are here madam you may stay and get your supper I answered and so left her and never spoke a word more to her all night And now screamed out old Lady Clapperclaw clapping her hands and speaking with more brogue than ever what do you think after all my kindness to her the wicked vulgar odious impudent upstart of s cowboy s granddaughter has done she cut me yesterday in Hy Park and hasn t sent me a ticket for her ball to night though they say Prince George is to be there Yes such is the fact In the race of fashion the resolute and active De Mogyns has passed the poor old Clapperclaw Her progress in gentility may be traced by the sets of friends whom she has courted and made and cut and left behind her She has struggled so gallantly for polite reputation that she has won it pitilessly kicking down the ladder as she advanced degree by degree Irish relations were first sacrificed she made her father dine in the steward s room to his perfect contentment and would send Sir Alured thither like wise but that he is a peg on which she hopes to hang her future honours and is after all paymaster of her daughter s fortunes He is meek and content He has been so long a gentleman that he is used to it and acts the part of governor very well In the day time he goes from the Union to Arthur s and from Arthur s to the Union He is a dead hand at piquet and loses a very comfortable maintenance to some young fellows at whist at the Travellers His son has taken his father s seat in Parliament and has of course joined Young England He is the only man in the country who believes in the De Mogynses and sighs for the days when a De Mogyns led the van of battle He has written a little volume of spoony puny poems He wears a lock of the hair of Laud the Confessor and Martyr and fainted when he kissed the Pope s toe at Rome He sleeps in white kid gloves and commits dangerous excesses upon green tea

none	none	 There is no disguising the fact that this series of papers is making a prodigious sensation among all classes in this Empire

none	none	We have been called to task for betraying the secrets of three different families of De Mogyns no less than four Lady Scrapers have been discovered and young gentlemen are quite shy of ordering half a pint of port and simpering over the QUARTERLY REVIEW at the Club lest they should be mistaken for Sydney Scraper esquire What CAN be your antipathy to Baker Street asks some fair remonstrant evidently writing from that quarter Why only attack the aristocratic Snobs says one estimable correspondent are not the snobbish Snobs to have their turn Pitch into the University Snobs writes an indignant gentleman who spelt ELEGANT with two I s Show up the Clerical Snob suggests another Being at Meurice s Hotel Paris some time since some wag hints I saw Lord B leaning out of the window with his boots in his hand and bawling out GARCON CIREZ MOI CES BOTTES Oughtn t he to be brought in among the Snobs 
4057_11254_000004_000000	train-clean-360	No far from it 
4057_11254_000004_000001	train-clean-360	If his lordship s boots are dirty it is because he is Lord B and walks 
4057_11254_000004_000002	train-clean-360	There is nothing snobbish in having only one pair of boots or a favourite pair and certainly nothing snobbish in desiring to have them cleaned 
none	none	Lord B in so doing performed a perfectly natural and gentlemanlike action for which I am so pleased with him that I have had him designed in a favourable and elegant attitude and put at the head of this Chapter in the place of honour No we are not personal in these candid remarks As Phidias took the pick of a score of beauties before he completed a Venus so have we to examine perhaps a thousand Snobs before one is expressed upon paper 
4057_11254_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Great City Snobs are the next in the hierarchy and ought to be considered 
4057_11254_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But here is a difficulty 
4057_11254_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The great City Snob is commonly most difficult of access 
4057_11254_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Unless you are a capitalist you cannot visit him in the recesses of his bank parlour in Lombard Street 
4057_11254_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Unless you are a sprig of nobility there is little hope of seeing him at home 
4057_11254_000005_000005	train-clean-360	In a great City Snob firm there is generally one partner whose name is down for charities and who frequents Exeter Hall you may catch a glimpse of another a scientific City Snob at my Lord N s SOIREES or the lectures of the London Institution of a third a City Snob of taste at picture auctions at private views of exhibitions or at the Opera or the Philharmonic 
4057_11254_000005_000006	train-clean-360	But intimacy is impossible in most cases with this grave pompous and awful being 
none	none	A mere gentleman may hope to sit at almost anybody s table to take his place at my lord duke s in the country to dance a quadrille at Buckingham Palace itself beloved Lady Wilhelmina Wagglewiggle do you recollect the sensation we made at the ball of our late adored Sovereign Queen Caroline at Brandenburg House Hammersmith but the City Snob s doors are for the most part closed to him and hence all that one knows of this great class is mostly from hearsay 
4057_11254_000007_000000	train-clean-360	In other countries of Europe the Banking Snob is more expansive and communicative than with us and receives all the world into his circle 
none	none	For instance everybody knows the princely hospitalities of the Scharlaschild family at Paris Naples Frankfort c 
4057_11254_000007_000002	train-clean-360	They entertain all the world even the poor at their FETES 
4057_11254_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Prince Polonia at Rome and his brother the Duke of Strachino are also remarkable for their hospitalities 
4057_11254_000007_000004	train-clean-360	I like the spirit of the first named nobleman 
none	none	Titles not costing much in the Roman territory he has had the head clerk of the banking house made a Marquis and his Lordship will screw a BAJOCCO out of you in exchange as dexterously as any commoner could do 
4057_11254_000007_000006	train-clean-360	It is a comfort to be able to gratify such grandees with a farthing or two it makes the poorest man feel that he can do good 
4057_11254_000007_000007	train-clean-360	 The Polonias have intermarried with the greatest and most ancient families of Rome and you see their heraldic cognizance a mushroom or on an azure field quartered in a hundred places in the city with the arms of the Colonnas and Dorias 
none	none	City Snobs have the same mania for aristocratic marriages 
4057_11254_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I like to see such 
4057_11254_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I am of a savage and envious nature I like to see these two humbugs which dividing as they do the social empire of this kingdom between them hate each other naturally making truce and uniting for the sordid interests of either 
4057_11254_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I like to see an old aristocrat swelling with pride of race the descendant of illustrious Norman robbers whose blood has been pure for centuries and who looks down upon common Englishmen as a free American does on a nigger I like to see old Stiffneck obliged to bow down his head and swallow his infernal pride and drink the cup of humiliation poured out by Pump and Aldgate s butler 
4057_11254_000008_000004	train-clean-360	 Pump and Aldgate says he your grandfather was a bricklayer and his hod is still kept in the bank

4057_11254_000009_000001	train-clean-360	And a comfortable thing it is to think that birth can be bought for money 
4057_11254_000009_000002	train-clean-360	So you learn to value it

none	none	Perhaps the best use of that book the Peerage is to look down the list and see how many have bought and sold birth how poor sprigs of nobility somehow sell themselves to rich City Snobs daughters how rich City Snobs purchase noble ladies and so to admire the double baseness of the bargain

4057_11254_000012_000000	train-clean-360	mister Pump looked exceedingly puzzled and disgusted and after a pause said LADY BLANCHE PUMP is pretty well I thank you

race rules hereditarily over this nation of Snobs CHAPTER IX ON SOME MILITARY SNOBS As no society in the world is more agreeable than that of well bred and well informed military gentlemen so likewise none is more insufferable than that of Military Snobs They are to be found of all grades from the General Officer whose padded old breast twinkles over with a score of stars clasps and decorations to the budding cornet who is shaving for a beard and has just been appointed to the Saxe Coburg Lancers I have always admired that dispensation of rank in our country which sets up this last named little creature who was flogged only last week because he could not spell to command great whiskered warriors who have faced all dangers of climate and battle which because he has money to lodge at the agent s will place him over the heads of men who have a thousand times more experience and desert and which in the course of time will bring him all the honours of his profession when the veteran soldier he commanded has got no other reward for his bravery than a berth in Chelsea Hospital and the veteran officer he superseded has slunk into shabby retirement and ends his disappointed life on a threadbare half pay When I read in the GAZETTE such announcements as Lieutenant and Captain Grig from the Bombardier Guards to be Captain vice Grizzle who retires I know what becomes of the Peninsular Grizzle I follow him in spirit to the humble country town where he takes up his quarters and occupies himself with the most desperate attempts to live like a gentleman on the stipend of half a tailor s foreman and I picture to myself little Grig rising from rank to rank skipping from one regiment to another with an increased grade in each avoiding disagreeable foreign service and ranking as a colonel at thirty all because he has money and Lord Grigsby is his father who had the same luck before him Grig must blush at first to give his orders to old men in every way his betters And as it is very difficult for a spoiled child to escape being selfish and arrogant so it is a very hard task indeed for this spoiled child of fortune not to be a Snob It must have often been a matter of wonder to the candid reader that the army the most enormous job of all our political institutions should yet work so well in the field and we must cheerfully give Grig and his like the credit for courage which they display whenever occasion calls for it The Duke s dandy regiments fought as well as any they said better than any but that is absurd The great Duke himself was a dandy once and jobbed on as Marlborough did before him But this only proves that dandies are brave as well as other Britons as all Britons Let us concede that the high born Grig rode into the entrenchments at Sobraon as gallantly as Corporal Wallop the ex ploughboy The times of war are more favourable to him than the periods of peace Think of Grig s life in the Bombardier Guards or the Jack boot Guards his marches from Windsor to London from London to Windsor from Knightsbridge to Regent s Park the idiotic services he has to perform which consist in inspecting the pipeclay of his company or the horses in the stable or bellowing out Shoulder humps Carry humps all which duties the very smallest intellect that ever belonged to mortal man would suffice to comprehend The professional duties of a footman are quite as difficult and various The red jackets who hold gentlemen s horses in saint James s Street could do the work just as well as those vacuous good natured gentlemanlike rickety little lieutenants who may be seen sauntering about Pall Mall in high heeled little boots or rallying round the standard of their regiment in the Palace Court at eleven o clock when the band plays Did the beloved reader ever see one of the young fellows staggering under the flag or above all going through the operation of saluting it It is worth a walk to the Palace to witness that magnificent piece of tomfoolery I have had the honour of meeting once or twice an old gentleman whom I look upon to be a specimen of army training and who has served in crack regiments or commanded them all his life I allude to Lieutenant General the Honourable Sir George Granby Tufto K C B K T S K H K S W c c His manners are irreproachable generally in society he is a perfect gentleman and a most thorough Snob A man can t help being a fool be he ever so old and Sir George is a greater ass at sixty eight than he was when he first entered the army at fifteen He distinguished himself everywhere his name is mentioned with praise in a score of Gazettes he is the man in fact whose padded breast twinkling over with innumerable decorations has already been introduced to the reader It is difficult to say what virtues this prosperous gentleman possesses He never read a book in his life and with his purple old gouty fingers still writes a schoolboy hand He has reached old age and grey hairs without being the least venerable He dresses like an outrageously young man to the present moment and laces and pads his old carcass as if he were still handsome George Tufto of eighteen hundred He is selfish brutal passionate and a glutton It is curious to mark him at table and see him heaving in his waistband his little bloodshot eyes gloating over his meal He swears considerably in his talk and tells filthy garrison stories after dinner On account of his rank and his services people pay the bestarred and betitled old brute a sort of reverence and he looks down upon you and me and exhibits his contempt for us with a stupid and artless candour which is quite amusing to watch Perhaps had he been bred to another profession he would not have been the disreputable old creature he now is But what other He was fit for none too incorrigibly idle and dull for any trade but this in which he has distinguished himself publicly as a good and gallant officer and privately for riding races drinking port fighting duels and seducing women He believes himself to be one of the most honourable and deserving beings in the world About Waterloo Place of afternoons you may see him tottering in his varnished boots and leering under the bonnets of the women who pass by When he dies of apoplexy THE TIMES will have a quarter of a column about his services and battles four lines of print will be wanted to describe his titles and orders alone and the earth will cover one of the wickedest and dullest old wretches that ever strutted over it Lest it should be imagined that I am of so obstinate a misanthropic nature as to be satisfied with nothing I beg for the comfort of the forces to state my belief that the army is not composed of such persons as the above He has only been selected for the study of civilians and the military as a specimen of a prosperous and bloated Army Snob No when epaulets are not sold when corporal punishments are abolished and Corporal Smith has a chance to have his gallantry rewarded as well as that of Lieutenant Grig when there is no such rank as ensign and lieutenant the existence of which rank is an absurd anomaly and an insult upon all the rest of the army and should there be no war I should not be disinclined to be a major general myself I have a little sheaf of Army Snobs in my portfolio but shall pause in my attack upon the forces till next week CHAPTER X MILITARY SNOBS Walking in the Park yesterday with my young friend Tagg and discoursing with him upon the next number of the Snob at the very nick of time who should pass us but two very good specimens of Military Snobs the Sporting Military Snob captain Rag and the lurking or raffish Military Snob Ensign Famish Indeed you are fully sure to meet them lounging on horseback about five o clock under the trees by the Serpentine examining critically the inmates of the flashy broughams which parade up and down the Lady s Mile Tagg and Rag are very well acquainted and so the former with that candour inseparable from intimate friendship told me his dear friend s history Captain Rag is a small dapper north country man He went when quite a boy into a crack light cavalry regiment and by the time he got his troop had cheated all his brother officers so completely selling them lame horses for sound ones and winning their money by all manner of strange and ingenious contrivances that his Colonel advised him to retire which he did without much reluctance accommodating a youngster who had just entered the regiment with a glandered charger at an uncommonly stiff figure He has since devoted his time to billiards steeple chasing and the turf His head quarters are Rummer s in Conduit Street where he keeps his kit but he is ever on the move in the exercise of his vocation as a gentleman jockey and gentleman leg According to BELL S LIFE he is an invariable attendant at all races and an actor in most of them He rode the winner at Leamington he was left for dead in a ditch a fortnight ago at Harrow and yet there he was last week at the Croix de Berny pale and determined as ever astonishing the BADAUDS of Paris by the elegance of his seat and the neatness of his rig as he took a preliminary gallop on that vicious brute The Disowned before starting for the French Grand National He is a regular attendant at the Corner where he compiles a limited but comfortable libretto During season he rides often in the Park mounted on a clever well bred pony He is to be seen escorting celebrated horsewoman Fanny Highflyer or in confidential converse with Lord Thimblerig the eminent handicapper He carefully avoids decent society and would rather dine off a steak at the One Tun with Sam Snaffle the jockey Captain O Rourke and two or three other notorious turf robbers than with the choicest company in London He likes to announce at Rummer s that he is going to run down and spend his Saturday and Sunday in a friendly way with Hocus the leg at his little box near Epsom where if report speak true many rummish plants are concocted He does not play billiards often and never in public but when he does play he always contrives to get hold of a good flat and never leaves him till he has done him uncommonly brown He has lately been playing a good deal with Famish When he makes his appearance in the drawing room which occasionally happens at a hunt meeting or a race ball he enjoys himself extremely His young friend is Ensign Famish who is not a little pleased to be seen with such a smart fellow as Rag who bows to the best turf company in the Park Rag lets Famish accompany him to Tattersall s and sells him bargains in horse flesh and uses Famish s cab That young gentleman s regiment is in India and he is at home on sick leave He recruits his health by being intoxicated every night and fortifies his lungs which are weak by smoking cigars all day The policemen about the Haymarket know the little creature and the early cabmen salute him The closed doors of fish and lobster shops open after service and vomit out little Famish who is either tipsy and quarrelsome when he wants to fight the cabmen or drunk and helpless when some kind friend in yellow satin takes care of him All the neighbourhood the cabmen the police the early potato men and the friends in yellow satin know the young fellow and he is called Little Bobby by some of the very worst reprobates in Europe His mother Lady Fanny Famish believes devoutly that Robert is in London solely for the benefit of consulting the physician is going to have him exchanged into a dragoon regiment which doesn t go to that odious India and has an idea that his chest is delicate and that he takes gruel every evening when he puts his feet in hot water Her Ladyship resides at Cheltenham and is of a serious turn Bobby frequents the Union Jack Club of course where he breakfasts on pale ale and devilled kidneys at three o clock where beardless young heroes of his own sort congregate and make merry and give each other dinners where you may see half a dozen of young rakes of the fourth or fifth order lounging and smoking on the steps where you behold Slapper s long tailed leggy mare in the custody of a red jacket until the Captain is primed for the Park with a glass of curacoa and where you see Hobby of the Highland Buffs driving up with Dobby of the Madras Fusiliers in the great banging swinging cab which the latter hires from Rumble of Bond Street In fact Military Snobs are of such number and variety that a hundred weeks of PUNCH would not suffice to give an audience to them There is besides the disreputable old Military Snob who has seen service the respectable old Military Snob who has seen none and gives himself the most prodigious Martinet airs There is the Medical Military Snob who is generally more outrageously military in his conversation than the greatest SABREUR in the army There is the Heavy Dragoon Snob whom young ladies admire with his great stupid pink face and yellow moustaches a vacuous solemn foolish but brave and honourable Snob There is the Amateur Military Snob who writes Captain on his card because he is a Lieutenant in the Bungay Militia There is the Lady killing Military Snob and more who need not be named But let no man we repeat charge mister PUNCH with disrespect for the Army in general that gallant and judicious Army every man of which from F M the Duke of Wellington c downwards with the exception of H R H Field Marshal Prince Albert who however can hardly count as a military man reads PUNCH in every quarter of the globe Let those civilians who sneer at the acquirements of the army read Sir Harry Smith s account of the Battle of Aliwal A noble deed was never told in nobler language And you who doubt if chivalry exists or the age of heroism has passed by think of Sir Henry Hardinge with his son dear little Arthur riding in front of the lines at Ferozeshah I hope no English painter will endeavour to illustrate that scene for who is there to do justice to it The history of the world contains no more brilliant and heroic picture No no the men who perform these deeds with such brilliant valour and describe them with such modest manliness SUCH are not Snobs Their country admires them their Sovereign rewards them and PUNCH the universal railer takes off his hat and says Heaven save them CHAPTER XI ON CLERICAL SNOBS After Snobs Military Snobs Clerical suggest themselves quite naturally and it is clear that with every respect for the cloth yet having a regard for truth humanity and the British public such a vast and influential class must not be omitted from our notices of the great Snob world Of these Clerics there are some whose claim to snobbishness is undoubted and yet it cannot be discussed here for the same reason that PUNCH would not set up his show in a Cathedral out of respect for the solemn service celebrated within There are some places where he acknowledges himself not privileged to make a noise and puts away his show and silences his drum and takes off his hat and holds his peace And I know this that if there are some Clerics who do wrong there are straightway a thousand newspapers to haul up those unfortunates and cry Fie upon them fie upon them while though the press is always ready to yell and bellow excommunication against these stray delinquent parsons it somehow takes very little count of the many good ones of the tens of thousands of honest men who lead Christian lives who give to the poor generously who deny themselves rigidly and live and die in their duty without ever a newspaper paragraph in their favour My beloved friend and reader I wish you and I could do the same and let me whisper my belief ENTRE NOUS that of those eminent philosophers who cry out against parsons the loudest there are not many who have got their knowledge of the church by going thither often But you who have ever listened to village bells or walked to church as children on sunny Sabbath mornings you who have ever seen the parson s wife tending the poor man s bedside or the town clergyman threading the dirty stairs of noxious alleys upon his business do not raise a shout when one falls away or yell with the mob that howls after him Every man can do that When old Father Noah was overtaken in his cups there was only one of his sons that dared to make merry at his disaster and he was not the most virtuous of the family Let us too turn away silently nor huzza like a parcel of school boys because some big young rebel suddenly starts up and whops the schoolmaster I confess though if I had by me the names of those seven or eight Irish bishops the probates of whose wills were mentioned in last year s journals and who died leaving behind them some two hundred thousand a piece I would like to put THEM up as patrons of my Clerical Snobs and operate upon them as successfully as I see from the newspapers mister Eisenberg Chiropodist has lately done upon His Grace the Reverend Lord Bishop of Tapioca I confess that when those Right Reverend Prelates come up to the gates of Paradise with their probates of wills in their hands I think that their chance is But the gates of Paradise is a far way to follow their Lordships so let us trip down again lest awkward questions be asked there about our own favourite vices too And don t let us give way to the vulgar prejudice that clergymen are an over paid and luxurious body of men When that eminent ascetic the late Sydney Smith by the way by what law of nature is it that so many Smiths in this world are called Sydney Smith lauded the system of great prizes in the Church without which he said gentlemen would not be induced to follow the clerical profession he admitted most pathetically that the clergy in general were by no means to be envied for their worldly prosperity From reading the works of some modern writers of repute you would fancy that a parson s life was passed in gorging himself with plum pudding and port wine and that his Reverence s fat chaps were always greasy with the crackling of tithe pigs Caricaturists delight to represent him so round short necked pimple faced apoplectic bursting out of waistcoat like a black pudding a shovel hatted fuzz wigged Silenus Whereas if you take the real man the poor fellow s flesh pots are very scantily furnished with meat He labours commonly for a wage that a tailor s foreman would despise he has too such claims upon his dismal income as most philosophers would rather grumble to meet many tithes are levied upon HIS pocket let it be remembered by those who grudge him his means of livelihood He has to dine with the Squire and his wife must dress neatly and he must look like a gentleman as they call it and bring up six great hungry sons as such Add to this if he does his duty he has such temptations to spend his money as no mortal man could withstand Yes you who can t resist purchasing a chest of cigars because they are so good or an ormolu clock at Howell and James s because it is such a bargain or a box at the Opera because Lablache and Grisi are divine in the PURITANI fancy how difficult it is for a parson to resist spending a half crown when John Breakstone s family are without a loaf or standing a bottle of port for poor old Polly Rabbits who has her thirteenth child or treating himself to a suit of corduroys for little Bob Scarecrow whose breeches are sadly out at elbows Think of these temptations brother moralists and philosophers and don t be too hard on the parson But what is this Instead of showing up the parsons are we indulging in maudlin praises of that monstrous black coated race O saintly Francis lying at rest under the turf O Jimmy and Johnny and Willy friends of my youth O noble and dear old Elias how should he who knows you not respect you and your calling May this pen never write a pennyworth again if it ever casts ridicule upon either

3816_11258_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear mister Snob an amiable young correspondent writes who signs himself Snobling ought the clergyman who at the request of a noble Duke lately interrupted a marriage ceremony between two persons perfectly authorised to marry to be ranked or not among the Clerical Snobs 
none	none	This my dear young friend is not a fair question 
3816_11258_000003_000001	train-clean-360	One of the illustrated weekly papers has already seized hold of the clergyman and blackened him most unmercifully by representing him in his cassock performing the marriage service 
3816_11258_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Let that be sufficient punishment and if you please do not press the query 
3816_11258_000004_000000	train-clean-360	It is very likely that if Miss Smith had come with a licence to marry Jones the parson in question not seeing old Smith present would have sent off the beadle in a cab to let the old gentleman know what was going on and would have delayed the service until the arrival of Smith senior 
none	none	He very likely thinks it his duty to ask all marriageable young ladies who come without their papa why their parent is absent and no doubt ALWAYS sends off the beadle for that missing governor Or it is very possible that the Duke of Coeurdelion was mister What d ye call im s most intimate friend and has often said to him What d ye call im my boy my daughter must never marry the Capting If ever they try at your church I beseech you considering the terms of intimacy on which we are to send off Rattan in a hack cab to fetch me 
3816_11258_000006_000000	train-clean-360	In either of which cases you see dear Snobling that though the parson would not have been authorised yet he might have been excused for interfering 
3816_11258_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He has no more right to stop my marriage than to stop my dinner to both of which as a free born Briton I am entitled by law if I can pay for them 
none	none	But consider pastoral solicitude a deep sense of the duties of his office and pardon this inconvenient but genuine zeal 
3816_11258_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But if the clergyman did in the Duke s case what he would NOT do in Smith s if he has no more acquaintance with the Coeurdelion family than I have with the Royal and Serene House of Saxe Coburg Gotha THEN I confess my dear Snobling your question might elicit a disagreeable reply and one which I respectfully decline to give 
3816_11258_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder what Sir George Tufto would say if a sentry left his post because a noble lord not the least connected with the service begged the sentinel not to do his duty 
none	none	Alas that the beadle who canes little boys and drives them out cannot drive worldliness out too what is worldliness but snobbishness When for instance I read in the newspapers that the Right Reverend the Lord Charles James administered the rite of confirmation to a PARTY OF THE JUVENILE NOBILITY at the Chapel Royal as if the Chapel Royal were a sort of ecclesiastical Almack s and young people were to get ready for the next world in little exclusive genteel knots of the aristocracy who were not to be disturbed in their journey thither by the company of the vulgar when I read such a paragraph as that and one or two such generally appear during the present fashionable season it seems to me to be the most odious mean and disgusting part of that odious mean and disgusting publication the COURT CIRCULAR and that snobbishness is therein carried to quite an awful pitch 
3816_11258_000008_000002	train-clean-360	What gentlemen can t we even in the Church acknowledge a republic 
3816_11258_000008_000003	train-clean-360	There at least the Heralds College itself might allow that we all of us have the same pedigree and are direct descendants of Eve and Adam whose inheritance is divided amongst us 
none	none	I hereby call upon all Dukes Earls Baronets and other potentates not to lend themselves to this shameful scandal and error and beseech all Bishops who read this publication to take the matter into consideration and to protest against the continuance of the practice and to declare We WON T confirm or christen Lord Tomnoddy or Sir Carnaby Jenks to the exclusion of any other young Christian the which declaration if their Lordships are induced to make a great LAPIS OFFENSIONIS will be removed and the Snob Papers will not have been written in vain 
3816_11258_000010_000000	train-clean-360	A story is current of a celebrated NOUVEAU RICHE who having had occasion to oblige that excellent prelate the Bishop of Bullocksmithy asked his Lordship in return to confirm his children privately in his Lordship s own chapel which ceremony the grateful prelate accordingly performed 
3816_11258_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Can satire go farther than this 
none	none	Is there even in this most amusing of prints any more NAIVE absurdity 
3816_11258_000010_000003	train-clean-360	It is as if a man wouldn t go to heaven unless he went in a special train or as if he thought as some people think about vaccination Confirmation more effectual when administered at first hand 
none	none	When that eminent person the Begum Sumroo died it is said she left ten thousand pounds to the Pope and ten thousand to the Archbishop of Canterbury so that there should be no mistake so as to make sure of having the ecclesiastical authorities on her side 
3816_11258_000010_000005	train-clean-360	This is only a little more openly and undisguisedly snobbish than the cases before alluded to 
3816_11258_000010_000006	train-clean-360	A well bred Snob is just as secretly proud of his riches and honours as a PARVENU Snob who makes the most ludicrous exhibition of them and a high born Marchioness or Duchess just as vain of herself and her diamonds as Queen Quashyboo who sews a pair of epaulets on to her skirt and turns out in state in a cocked hat and feathers 
none	none	It is not out of disrespect to my Peerage which I love and honour indeed have I not said before that I should be ready to jump out of my skin if two Dukes would walk down Pall Mall with me it is not out of disrespect for the individuals that I wish these titles had never been invented but consider if there were no tree there would be no shadow and how much more honest society would be and how much more serviceable the clergy would be which is our present consideration if these temptations of rank and continual baits of worldliness were not in existence and perpetually thrown out to lead them astray I have seen many examples of their falling away 
3816_11258_000012_000001	train-clean-360	When for instance Tom Sniffle first went into the country as Curate for mister Fuddleston Sir Huddleston Fuddleston s brother who resided on some other living there could not be a more kind hardworking and excellent creature than Tom 
none	none	He had his aunt to live with him 
3816_11258_000012_000003	train-clean-360	His conduct to his poor was admirable 
3816_11258_000012_000004	train-clean-360	He wrote annually reams of the best intentioned and vapid sermons 
3816_11258_000012_000005	train-clean-360	When Lord Brandyball s family came down into the country and invited him to dine at Brandyball Park Sniffle was so agitated that he almost forgot how to say grace and upset a bowl of currant jelly sauce in Lady Fanny Toffy s lap 
none	none	What was the consequence of his intimacy with that noble family 
3816_11258_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He quarrelled with his aunt for dining out every night 
none	none	The wretch forgot his poor altogether and killed his old nag by always riding over to Brandyball where he revelled in the maddest passion for Lady Fanny He ordered the neatest new clothes and ecclesiastical waistcoats from London he appeared with corazza shirts lackered boots and perfumery he bought a blood horse from Bob Toffy was seen at archery meetings public breakfasts actually at cover and I blush to say that I saw him in a stall at the Opera and afterwards riding by Lady Fanny s side in Rotten Row 
3816_11258_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He DOUBLE BARRELLED his name as many poor Snobs do and instead of T Sniffle as formerly came out in a porcelain card as reverend 
none	none	T D Arcy Sniffle Burlington Hotel The end of all this may be imagined when the Earl of Brandyball was made acquainted with the curate s love for Lady Fanny he had that fit of the gout which so nearly carried him off to the inexpressible grief of his son Lord Alicompayne and uttered that remarkable speech to Sniffle which disposed of the claims of the latter If I didn t respect the Church Sir his Lordship said by Jove I d kick you downstairs his Lordship then fell back into the fit aforesaid and Lady Fanny as we all know married General Podager 
3816_11258_000015_000000	train-clean-360	As for poor Tom he was over head and ears in debt as well as in love his creditors came down upon him 
3816_11258_000015_000001	train-clean-360	mister Hemp of Portugal Street proclaimed his name lately as a reverend outlaw and he has been seen at various foreign watering places sometimes doing duty sometimes coaching a stray gentleman s son at Carlsruhe or Kissingen sometimes must we say it lurking about the roulette tables with a tuft to his chin 
3816_11258_000016_000000	train-clean-360	If temptation had not come upon this unhappy fellow in the shape of a Lord Brandyball he might still have been following his profession humbly and worthily 
3816_11258_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He might have married his cousin with four thousand pounds the wine merchant s daughter the old gentleman quarrelled with his nephew for not soliciting wine orders from Lord B for him he might have had seven children and taken private pupils and eked out his income and lived and died a country parson 
3816_11258_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Could he have done better 
none	none	You who want to know how great and good and noble such a character may be read Stanley s Life of Doctor Arnold CHAPTER XIII ON CLERICAL SNOBS Among the varieties of the Snob Clerical the University Snob and the Scholastic Snob ought never to be forgotten they form a very strong battalion in the black coated army The wisdom of our ancestors which I admire more and more every day seemed to have determined that education of youth was so paltry and unimportant a matter that almost any man armed with a birch and regulation cassock and degree might undertake the charge and many an honest country gentleman may be found to the present day who takes very good care to have a character with his butler when he engages him and will not purchase a horse without the warranty and the closest inspection but sends off his son young John Thomas to school without asking any questions about the Schoolmaster and places the lad at Switchester College under Doctor Block because he the good old English gentleman had been at Switchester under Doctor Buzwig forty years ago We have a love for all little boys at school for many scores of thousands of them read and love PUNCH may he never write a word that shall not be honest and fit for them to read He will not have his young friends to be Snobs in the future or to be bullied by Snobs or given over to such to be educated Our connexion with the youth at the Universities is very close and affectionate The candid undergraduate is our friend The pompous old College Don trembles in his common room lest we should attack him and show him up as a Snob When railroads were threatening to invade the land which they have since conquered it may be recollected what a shrieking and outcry the authorities of Oxford and Eton made lest the iron abominations should come near those seats of pure learning and tempt the British youth astray The supplications were in vain the railroad is in upon them and the old world institutions are doomed I felt charmed to read in the papers the other day a most veracious puffing advertisement headed To College and back for Five Shillings The College Gardens it said will be thrown open on this occasion the College youths will perform a regatta the Chapel of King s College will have its celebrated music and all for five shillings The Goths have got into Rome Napoleon Stephenson draws his republican lines round the sacred old cities and the ecclesiastical big wigs who garrison them must prepare to lay down key and crosier before the iron conqueror If you consider dear reader what profound snobbishness the University System produced you will allow that it is time to attack some of those feudal middle age superstitions If you go down for five shillings to look at the College Youths you may see one sneaking down the court without a tassel to his cap another with a gold or silver fringe to his velvet trencher a third lad with a master s gown and hat walking at ease over the sacred College grass plats which common men must not tread on He may do it because he is a nobleman Because a lad is a lord the University gives him a degree at the end of two years which another is seven in acquiring Because he is a lord he has no call to go through an examination Any man who has not been to College and back for five shillings would not believe in such distinctions in a place of education so absurd and monstrous do they seem to be The lads with gold and silver lace are sons of rich gentlemen and called Fellow Commoners they are privileged to feed better than the pensioners and to have wine with their victuals which the latter can only get in their rooms The unlucky boys who have no tassels to their caps are called sizars SERVITORS at Oxford a very pretty and gentlemanlike title A distinction is made in their clothes because they are poor for which reason they wear a badge of poverty and are not allowed to take their meals with their fellow students When this wicked and shameful distinction was set up it was of a piece with all the rest a part of the brutal unchristian blundering feudal system Distinctions of rank were then so strongly insisted upon that it would have been thought blasphemy to doubt them as blasphemous as it is in parts of the United States now for a nigger to set up as the equal of a white man A ruffian like Henry VIII talked as gravely about the divine powers vested in him as if he had been an inspired prophet A wretch like James I not only believed that there was in himself a particular sanctity but other people believed him Government regulated the length of a merchant s shoes as well as meddled with his trade prices exports machinery It thought itself justified in roasting a man for his religion or pulling a Jew s teeth out if he did not pay a contribution or ordered him to dress in a yellow gabardine and locked him in a particular quarter Now a merchant may wear what boots he pleases and has pretty nearly acquired the privilege of buying and selling without the Government laying its paws upon the bargain The stake for heretics is gone the pillory is taken down Bishops are even found lifting up their voices against the remains of persecution and ready to do away with the last Catholic Disabilities Sir Robert Peel though he wished it ever so much has no power over mister Benjamin Disraeli s grinders or any means of violently handling that gentleman s jaw Jews are not called upon to wear badges on the contrary they may live in Piccadilly or the Minories according to fancy they may dress like Christians and do sometimes in a most elegant and fashionable manner Why is the poor College servitor to wear that name and that badge still Because Universities are the last places into which Reform penetrates But now that she can go to College and back for five shillings let her travel down thither CHAPTER XIV ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS All the men of Saint Boniface will recognize Hugby and Crump in these two pictures They were tutors in our time and Crump is since advanced to be President of the College He was formerly and is now a rich specimen of a University Snob At five and twenty Crump invented three new metres and published an edition of an exceedingly improper Greek Comedy with no less than twenty emendations upon the German text of Schnupfenius and Schnapsius These Services to religion instantly pointed him out for advancement in the Church and he is now President of Saint Boniface and very narrowly escaped the bench Crump thinks Saint Boniface the centre of the world and his position as President the highest in England He expects the fellows and tutors to pay him the same sort of service that Cardinals pay to the Pope I am sure Crawler would have no objection to carry his trencher or Page to hold up the skirts of his gown as he stalks into chapel He roars out the responses there as if it were an honour to heaven that the President of Saint Boniface should take a part in the service and in his own lodge and college acknowledges the Sovereign only as his superior When the allied monarchs came down and were made Doctors of the University a breakfast was given at Saint Boniface on which occasion Crump allowed the Emperor Alexander to walk before him but took the PAS himself of the King of Prussia and Prince Blucher He was going to put the Hetman Platoff to breakfast at a side table with the under college tutors but he was induced to relent and merely entertained that distinguished Cossack with a discourse on his own language in which he showed that the Hetman knew nothing about it As for us undergraduates we scarcely knew more about Crump than about the Grand Llama A few favoured youths are asked occasionally to tea at the lodge but they do not speak unless first addressed by the Doctor and if they venture to sit down Crump s follower mister Toady whispers Gentlemen will you have the kindness to get up The President is passing or Gentlemen the President prefers that undergraduates should not sit down or words to a similar effect To do Crump justice he does not cringe now to great people He rather patronizes them than otherwise and in London speaks quite affably to a Duke who has been brought up at his college or holds out a finger to a Marquis He does not disguise his own origin but brags of it with considerable self gratulation I was a Charity boy says he see what I am now the greatest Greek scholar of the greatest College of the greatest University of the greatest Empire in the world The argument being that this is a capital world for beggars because he being a beggar has managed to get on horseback Hugby owes his eminence to patient merit and agreeable perseverance He is a meek mild inoffensive creature with just enough of scholarship to fit him to hold a lecture or set an examination paper He rose by kindness to the aristocracy It was wonderful to see the way in which that poor creature grovelled before a nobleman or a lord s nephew or even some noisy and disreputable commoner the friend of a lord He used to give the young noblemen the most painful and elaborate breakfasts and adopt a jaunty genteel air and talk with them although he was decidedly serious about the opera or the last run with the hounds It was good to watch him in the midst of a circle of young tufts with his mean smiling eager uneasy familiarity He used to write home confidential letters to their parents and made it his duty to call upon them when in town to condole or rejoice with them when a death birth or marriage took place in their family and to feast them whenever they came to the University I recollect a letter lying on a desk in his lecture room for a whole term beginning My Lord Duke It was to show us that he corresponded with such dignities When the late lamented Lord Glenlivat who broke his neck at a hurdle race at the premature age of twenty four was at the University the amiable young fellow passing to his rooms in the early morning and seeing Hugby s boots at his door on the same staircase playfully wadded the insides of the boots with cobbler s wax which caused excruciating pains to the reverend mister Hugby when he came to take them off the same evening before dining with the Master of saint Crispin s Everybody gave the credit of this admirable piece of fun to Lord Glenlivat s friend Bob Tizzy who was famous for such feats and who had already made away with the college pump handle filed saint Boniface s nose smooth with his face carried off four images of nigger boys from the tobacconists painted the senior proctor s horse pea green c c and Bob who was of the party certainly and would not peach was just on the point of incurring expulsion and so losing the family living which was in store for him when Glenlivat nobly stepped forward owned himself to be the author of the delightful JEU D ESPRIT apologized to the tutor and accepted the rustication Hugby cried when Glenlivat apologized if the young nobleman had kicked him round the court I believe the tutor would have been happy so that an apology and a reconciliation might subsequently ensue My lord said he in your conduct on this and all other occasions you have acted as becomes a gentleman you have been an honour to the University as you will be to the peerage I am sure when the amiable vivacity of youth is calmed down and you are called upon to take your proper share in the government of the nation And when his lordship took leave of the University Hugby presented him with a copy of his Sermons to a Nobleman s Family Hugby was once private tutor to the Sons of the Earl of Muffborough which Glenlivat presented in return to mister William Ramm known to the fancy as the Tutbury Pet and the sermons now figure on the boudoir table of missus Ramm behind the bar of her house of entertainment The Game Cock and Spurs near Woodstock Oxon At the beginning of the long vacation Hugby comes to town and puts up in handsome lodgings near saint James s Square rides in the Park in the afternoon and is delighted to read his name in the morning papers among the list of persons present at Muffborough House and the Marquis of Farintosh s evening parties He is a member of Sydney Scraper s Club where however he drinks his pint of claret Sometimes you may see him on Sundays at the hour when tavern doors open whence issue little girls with great jugs of porter when charity boys walk the streets bearing brown dishes of smoking shoulders of mutton and baked taturs when Sheeny and Moses are seen smoking their pipes before their lazy shutters in Seven Dials when a crowd of smiling persons in clean outlandish dresses in monstrous bonnets and flaring printed gowns or in crumpled glossy coats and silks that bear the creases of the drawers where they have lain all the week file down High Street sometimes I say you may see Hugby coming out of the Church of saint Giles in the Fields with a stout gentlewoman leaning on his arm whose old face bears an expression of supreme pride and happiness as she glances round at all the neighbours and who faces the curate himself and marches into Holborn where she pulls the bell of a house over which is inscribed Hugby Haberdasher It is the mother of the reverend F Hugby as proud of her son in his white choker as Cornelia of her jewels at Rome That is old Hugby bringing up the rear with the Prayer books and Betsy Hugby the old maid his daughter old Hugby Haberdasher and Church warden In the front room upstairs where the dinner is laid out there is a picture of Muffborough Castle of the Earl of Muffborough K X Lord Lieutenant for Diddlesex an engraving from an almanac of Saint Boniface College Oxon and a sticking plaster portrait of Hugby when young in a cap and gown A copy of his Sermons to a Nobleman s Family is on the bookshelf by the Whole Duty of Man the Reports of the Missionary Societies and the Oxford University Calendar Old Hugby knows part of this by heart every living belonging to Saint Boniface and the name of every tutor fellow nobleman and undergraduate He used to go to meeting and preach himself until his son took orders but of late the old gentleman has been accused of Puseyism and is quite pitiless against the Dissenters CHAPTER XV ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS I should like to fill several volumes with accounts of various University Snobs so fond are my reminiscences of them and so numerous are they I should like to speak above all of the wives and daughters of some of the Professor Snobs their amusements habits jealousies their innocent artifices to entrap young men their picnics concerts and evening parties I wonder what has become of Emily Blades daughter of Blades the Professor of the Mandingo language I remember her shoulders to this day as she sat in the midst of a crowd of about seventy young gentlemen from Corpus and Catherine Hall entertaining them with ogles and French songs on the guitar Are you married fair Emily of the shoulders What beautiful ringlets those were that used to dribble over them what a waist what a killing sea green shot silk gown what a cameo the size of a muffin There were thirty six young men of the University in love at one time with Emily Blades and no words are sufficient to describe the pity the sorrow the deep deep commiseration the rage fury and uncharitableness in other words with which the Miss Trumps daughter of Trumps the Professor of Phlebotomy regarded her because she DIDN T squint and because she WASN T marked with the small pox As for the young University Snobs I am getting too old now to speak of such very familiarly My recollections of them lie in the far far past almost as far back as Pelham s time We THEN used to consider Snobs raw looking lads who never missed chapel who wore highlows and no straps who walked two hours on the Trumpington road every day of their lives who carried off the college scholarships and who overrated themselves in hall We were premature in pronouncing our verdict of youthful Snobbishness The man without straps fulfilled his destiny and duty He eased his old governor the curate in Westmoreland or helped his sisters to set up the Ladies School He wrote a Dictionary or a Treatise on Conic Sections as his nature and genius prompted He got a fellowship and then took to himself a wife and a living He presides over a parish now and thinks it rather a dashing thing to belong to the Oxford and Cambridge Club and his parishioners love him and snore under his sermons No no HE is not a Snob It is not straps that make the gentleman or highlows that unmake him be they ever so thick My son it is you who are the Snob if you lightly despise a man for doing his duty and refuse to shake an honest man s hand because it wears a Berlin glove We then used to consider it not the least vulgar for a parcel of lads who had been whipped three months previous and were not allowed more than three glasses of port at home to sit down to pineapples and ices at each other s rooms and fuddle themselves with champagne and claret One looks back to what was called a wine party with a sort of wonder Thirty lads round a table covered with bad sweetmeats drinking bad wines telling bad stories singing bad songs over and over again Milk punch smoking ghastly headache frightful spectacle of dessert table next morning and smell of tobacco your guardian the clergyman dropping in in the midst of this expecting to find you deep in Algebra and discovering the Gyp administering soda water There were young men who despised the lads who indulged in the coarse hospitalities of wine parties who prided themselves in giving RECHERCHE little French dinners Both wine party givers and dinner givers were Snobs There were what used to be called dressy Snobs Jimmy who might be seen at five o clock elaborately rigged out with a camellia in his button hole glazed boots and fresh kid gloves twice a day Jessamy who was conspicuous for his jewellery a young donkey glittering all over with chains rings and shirt studs Jacky who rode every day solemnly on the Blenheim Road in pumps and white silk stockings with his hair curled all three of whom flattered themselves they gave laws to the University about dress all three most odious varieties of Snobs Sporting Snobs of course there were and are always those happy beings in whom Nature has implanted a love of slang who loitered about the horsekeeper s stables and drove the London coaches a stage in and out and might be seen swaggering through the courts in pink of early mornings and indulged in dice and blind hookey at nights and never missed a race or a boxing match and rode flat races and kept bull terriers Worse Snobs even than these were poor miserable wretches who did not like hunting at all and could not afford it and were in mortal fear at a two foot ditch but who hunted because Glenlivat and Cinqbars hunted The Billiard Snob and the Boating Snob were varieties of these and are to be found elsewhere than in universities Then there were Philosophical Snobs who used to ape statesmen at the spouting clubs and who believed as a fact that Government always had an eye on the University for the selection of orators for the House of Commons There were audacious young free thinkers who adored nobody or nothing except perhaps Robespierre and the Koran and panted for the day when the pale name of priest should shrink and dwindle away before the indignation of an enlightened world But the worst of all University Snobs are those unfortunates who go to rack and ruin from their desire to ape their betters Smith becomes acquainted with great people at college and is ashamed of his father the tradesman Jones has fine acquaintances and lives after their fashion like a gay free hearted fellow as he is and ruins his father and robs his sister s portion and cripples his younger brother s outset in life for the pleasure of entertaining my lord and riding by the side of Sir John And though it may be very good fun for Robinson to fuddle himself at home as he does at College and to be brought home by the policeman he has just been trying to knock down think what fun it is for the poor old soul his mother the half pay captain s widow who has been pinching herself all her life long in order that that jolly young fellow might have a University education CHAPTER XVI ON LITERARY SNOBS What will he say about Literary Snobs has been a question I make no doubt often asked by the public How can he let off his own profession Will that truculent and unsparing monster who attacks the nobility the clergy the army and the ladies indiscriminately hesitate when the turn comes to EGORGER his own flesh and blood My dear and excellent querist whom does the schoolmaster flog so resolutely as his own son Didn t Brutus chop his offspring s head off You have a very bad opinion indeed of the present state of literature and of literary men if you fancy that any one of us would hesitate to stick a knife into his neighbour penman if the latter s death could do the State any service But the fact is that in the literary profession THERE ARE NO SNOBS Look round at the whole body of British men of letters and I defy you to point out among them a single instance of vulgarity or envy or assumption Men and women as far as I have known them they are all modest in their demeanour elegant in their manners spotless in their lives and honourable in their conduct to the world and to each other You MAY occasionally it is true hear one literary man abusing his brother but why Not in the least out of malice not at all from envy merely from a sense of truth and public duty Suppose for instance I good naturedly point out a blemish in my friend mister PUNCH S person and say mister P has a hump back and his nose and chin are more crooked than those features in the Apollo or Antinous which we are accustomed to consider as our standards of beauty does this argue malice on my part towards mister PUNCH Not in the least It is the critic s duty to point out defects as well as merits and he invariably does his duty with utmost gentleness and candour An intelligent foreigner s testimony about our manners is always worth having and I think in this respect the work of an eminent American mister N P Willis is eminently valuable and impartial In his History of Ernest Clay a crack magazine writer the reader will get an exact account of the life of a popular man of letters in England He is always the lion of society He takes the PAS of dukes and earls all the nobility crowd to see him I forget how many baronesses and duchesses fall in love with him But on this subject let us hold our tongues Modesty forbids that we should reveal the names of the heart broken countesses and dear marchionesses who are pining for every one of the contributors in PUNCH If anybody wants to know how intimately authors are connected with the fashionable world they have but to read the genteel novels What refinement and delicacy pervades the works of missus Barnaby What delightful good company do you meet with in missus Armytage She seldom introduces you to anybody under a marquis I don t know anything more delicious than the pictures of genteel life in Ten Thousand a Year except perhaps the Young Duke and Coningsby There s a modest grace about THEM and an air of easy high fashion which only belongs to blood my dear Sir to true blood And what linguists many of our writers are Lady Bulwer Lady Londonderry Sir Edward himself they write the French language with a luxurious elegance and ease which sets them far above their continental rivals of whom not one except Paul de Kock knows a word of English And what Briton can read without enjoyment the works of James so admirable for terseness and the playful humour and dazzling offhand lightness of Ainsworth Among other humourists one might glance at a Jerrold the chivalrous advocate of Toryism and Church and State an a Beckett with a lightsome pen but a savage earnestness of purpose a Jeames whose pure style and wit unmingled with buffoonery was relished by a congenial public Speaking of critics perhaps there never was a review that has done so much for literature as the admirable QUARTERLY It has its prejudices to be sure as which of us has not It goes out of its way to abuse a great man or lays mercilessly on to such pretenders as Keats and Tennyson but on the other hand it is the friend of all young authors and has marked and nurtured all the rising talent of the country It is loved by everybody There again is BLACKWOOD S MAGAZINE conspicuous for modest elegance and amiable satire that review never passes the bounds of politeness in a joke It is the arbiter of manners and while gently exposing the foibles of Londoners for whom the BEAUX ESPRITS of Edinburgh entertain a justifiable contempt it is never coarse in its fun The fiery enthusiasm of the ATHENAEUM is well known and the bitter wit of the too difficult LITERARY GAZETTE The EXAMINER is perhaps too timid and the SPECTATOR too boisterous in its praise but who can carp at these minor faults No no the critics of England and the authors of England are unrivalled as a body and hence it becomes impossible for us to find fault with them Above all I never knew a man of letters ASHAMED OF HIS PROFESSION Those who know us know what an affectionate and brotherly spirit there is among us all Sometimes one of us rises in the world we never attack him or sneer at him under those circumstances but rejoice to a man at his success If Jones dines with a lord Smith never says Jones is a courtier and cringer Nor on the other hand does Jones who is in the habit of frequenting the society of great people give himself any airs on account of the company he keeps but will leave a duke s arm in Pall Mall to come over and speak to poor Brown the young penny a liner That sense of equality and fraternity amongst authors has always struck me as one of the most amiable characteristics of the class It is because we know and respect each other that the world respects us so much that we hold such a good position in society and demean ourselves so irreproachably when there Literary persons are held in such esteem by the nation that about two of them have been absolutely invited to court during the present reign and it is probable that towards the end of the season one or two will be asked to dinner by Sir Robert Peel They are such favourites with the public that they are continually obliged to have their pictures taken and published and one or two could be pointed out of whom the nation insists upon having a fresh portrait every year Nothing can be more gratifying than this proof of the affectionate regard which the people has for its instructors Literature is held in such honour in England that there is a sum of near twelve hundred pounds per annum set apart to pension deserving persons following that profession And a great compliment this is too to the professors and a proof of their generally prosperous and flourishing condition They are generally so rich and thrifty that scarcely any money is wanted to help them If every word of this is true how I should like to know am I to write about Literary Snobs CHAPTER XVII A LITTLE ABOUT IRISH SNOBS You do not to be sure imagine that there are no other Snobs in Ireland than those of the amiable party who wish to make pikes of iron railroads it s a fine Irish economy and to cut the throats of the Saxon invaders These are of the venomous sort and had they been invented in his time saint Patrick would have banished them out of the kingdom along with the other dangerous reptiles I think it is the Four Masters or else it s Olaus Magnus or else it s certainly O Neill Daunt in the Catechism of Irish History who relates that when Richard the Second came to Ireland and the Irish chiefs did homage to him going down on their knees the poor simple creatures and worshipping and wondering before the English king and the dandies of his court my lords the English noblemen mocked and jeered at their uncouth Irish admirers mimicked their talk and gestures pulled their poor old beards and laughed at the strange fashion of their garments The English Snob rampant always does this to the present day There is no Snob in existence perhaps that has such an indomitable belief in himself that sneers you down all the rest of the world besides and has such an insufferable admirable stupid contempt for all people but his own nay for all sets but his own Gwacious Gad what stories about the Iwish these young dandies accompanying King Richard must have had to tell when they returned to Pall Mall and smoked their cigars upon the steps of White s The Irish snobbishness developes itself not in pride so much as in servility and mean admirations and trumpery imitations of their neighbours And I wonder De Tocqueville and De Beaumont and THE TIMES Commissioner did not explain the Snobbishness of Ireland as contrasted with our own Ours is that of Richard s Norman Knights haughty brutal stupid and perfectly self confident theirs of the poor wondering kneeling simple chieftains They are on their knees still before English fashion these simple wild people and indeed it is hard not to grin at some of their NAIVE exhibitions Some years since when a certain great orator was Lord Mayor of Dublin he used to wear a red gown and a cocked hat the splendour of which delighted him as much as a new curtain ring in her nose or a string of glass beads round her neck charms Queen Quasheeneboo He used to pay visits to people in this dress to appear at meetings hundreds of miles off in the red velvet gown And to hear the people crying Yes me Lard and No me Lard and to read the prodigious accounts of his Lordship in the papers it seemed as if the people and he liked to be taken in by this twopenny splendour Twopenny magnificence indeed exists all over Ireland and may be considered as the great characteristic of the Snobbishness of that country When missus Mulholligan the grocer s lady retires to Kingstown she has Mulholliganville painted over the gate of her villa and receives you at a door that won t shut or gazes at you out of a window that is glazed with an old petticoat Be it ever so shabby and dismal nobody ever owns to keeping a shop A fellow whose stock in trade is a penny roll or a tumbler of lollipops calls his cabin the American Flour Stores or the Depository for Colonial Produce or some such name As for Inns there are none in the country Hotels abound as well furnished as Mulholliganville but again there are no such people as landlords and land ladies the landlord is out with the hounds and my lady in the parlour talking with the Captain or playing the piano If a gentleman has a hundred a year to leave to his family they all become gentlemen all keep a nag ride to hounds and swagger about in the Phaynix and grow tufts to their chins like so many real aristocrats A friend of mine has taken to be a painter and lives out of Ireland where he is considered to have disgraced the family by choosing such a profession His father is a wine merchant and his elder brother an apothecary The number of men one meets in London and on the Continent who have a pretty little property of five and twenty hundred a year in Ireland is prodigious those who WILL have nine thousand a year in land when somebody dies are still more numerous I myself have met as many descendants from Irish kings as would form a brigade And who has not met the Irishman who apes the Englishman and who forgets his country and tries to forget his accent or to smother the taste of it as it were Come dine with me my boy says O Dowd of O Dowdstown you ll FIND US ALL ENGLISH THERE which he tells you with a brogue as broad as from here to Kingstown Pier And did you never hear missus Captain Macmanus talk about I ah land and her account of her fawther s esteet Very few men have rubbed through the world without hearing and witnessing some of these Hibernian phenomena these twopenny splendours And what say you to the summit of society the Castle with a sham king and sham lords in waiting and sham loyalty and a sham Haroun Alraschid to go about in a sham disguise making believe to be affable and splendid That Castle is the pink and pride of Snobbishness A COURT CIRCULAR is bad enough with two columns of print about a little baby that s christened but think of people liking a sham COURT CIRCULAR I think the shams of Ireland are more outrageous than those of any country A fellow shows you a hill and says That s the highest mountain in all Ireland a gentleman tells you he is descended from Brian Boroo and has his five and thirty hundred a year or missus Macmanus describes her fawther s esteet or ould Dan rises and says the Irish women are the loveliest the Irish men the bravest the Irish land the most fertile in the world and nobody believes anybody the latter does not believe his story nor the hearer but they make believe to believe and solemnly do honour to humbug O Ireland O my country for I make little doubt I am descended from Brian Boroo too when will you acknowledge that two and two make four and call a pikestaff a pikestaff that is the very best use you can make of the latter Irish snobs will dwindle away then and we shall never hear tell of Hereditary bondsmen CHAPTER XVIII PARTY GIVING SNOBS Our selection of Snobs has lately been too exclusively of a political character Give us private Snobs cry the dear ladies I have before me the letter of one fair correspondent of the fishing village of Brighthelmstone in Sussex and could her commands ever be disobeyed Tell us more dear mister Snob about your experience of Snobs in society Heaven bless the dear souls they are accustomed to the word now the odious vulgar horrid unpronounceable word slips out of their lips with the prettiest glibness possible I should not wonder if it were used at Court amongst the Maids of Honour In the very best society I know it is And why not Snobbishness is vulgar the mere words are not that which we call a Snob by any other name would still be Snobbish Well then As the season is drawing to a close as many hundreds of kind souls snobbish or otherwise have quitted London as many hospitable carpets are taken up and window blinds are pitilessly papered with the MORNING HERALD and mansions once inhabited by cheerful owners are now consigned to the care of the housekeeper s dreary LOCUM TENENS some mouldy old woman who in reply to the hopeless clanging of the bell peers at you for a moment from the area and then slowly unbolting the great hall door informs you my lady has left town or that the family s in the country or gone up the Rind or what not as the season and parties are over why not consider Party giving Snobs for a while and review the conduct of some of those individuals who have quitted the town for six months Some of those worthy Snobs are making believe to go yachting and dressed in telescopes and pea jackets are passing their time between Cherbourg and Cowes some living higgledy piggledy in dismal little huts in Scotland provisioned with canisters of portable soup and fricandeaux hermetically sealed in tin are passing their days slaughtering grouse upon the moors some are dozing and bathing away the effects of the season at Kissingen or watching the ingenious game of TRENTE ET QUARANTE at Homburg and Ems We can afford to be very bitter upon them now they are all gone Now there are no more parties let us have at the Party giving Snobs The dinner giving the ball giving the DEJEUNER giving the CONVERSAZIONE GIVING Snobs Lord Lord what havoc might have been made amongst them had we attacked them during the plethora of the season I should have been obliged to have a guard to defend me from fiddlers and pastrycooks indignant at the abuse of their patrons Already I m told that from some flippant and unguarded expressions considered derogatory to Baker Street and Harley Street rents have fallen in these respectable quarters and orders have been issued that at least mister Snob shall be asked to parties there no more Well then now they are ALL away let us frisk at our ease and have at everything like the bull in the china shop They mayn t hear of what is going on in their absence and if they do they can t bear malice for six months We will begin to make it up with them about next February and let next year take care of itself We shall have no dinners from the dinner giving Snobs no more from the ball givers no more CONVERSAZIONES thank Mussy as Jeames says from the Conversaziones Snob and what is to prevent us from telling the truth The snobbishness of Conversazione Snobs is very soon disposed of as soon as that cup of washy bohea is handed to you in the tea room or the muddy remnant of ice that you grasp in the suffocating scuffle of the assembly upstairs Good heavens What do people mean by going there What is done there that everybody throngs into those three little rooms Was the Black Hole considered to be an agreeable REUNION that Britons in the dog days here seek to imitate it After being rammed to a jelly in a door way where you feel your feet going through Lady Barbara Macbeth s lace flounces and get a look from that haggard and painted old harpy compared to which the gaze of Ugolino is quite cheerful after withdrawing your elbow out of poor gasping Bob Guttleton s white waistcoat from which cushion it was impossible to remove it though you knew you were squeezing poor Bob into an apoplexy you find yourself at last in the reception room and try to catch the eye of missus Botibol the CONVERSAZIONE giver When you catch her eye you are expected to grin and she smiles too for the four hundredth time that night and if she s very glad to see you waggles her little hand before her face as if to blow you a kiss as the phrase is Why the deuce should missus Botibol blow me a kiss I wouldn t kiss her for the world Why do I grin when I see her as if I was delighted Am I I don t care a straw for missus Botibol I know what she thinks about me I know what she said about my last volume of poems I had it from a dear mutual friend Why I say in a word are we going on ogling and telegraphing each other in this insane way Because we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society whose dictates we all of us obey Well the recognition is over my jaws have returned to their usual English expression of subdued agony and intense gloom and the Botibol is grinning and kissing her fingers to somebody else who is squeezing through the aperture by which we have just entered It is Lady Ann Clutterbuck who has her Friday evenings as Botibol Botty we call her has Wednesdays That is Miss Clementina Clutterbuck the cadaverous young woman in green with florid auburn hair who has published her volume of poems The Death Shriek Damiens The Faggot of Joan of Arc and Translations from the German of course The conversazione women salute each other calling each other My dear Lady Ann and My dear good Eliza and hating each other as women hate who give parties on Wednesdays and Fridays With inexpressible pain dear good Eliza sees Ann go up and coax and wheedle Abou Gosh who has just arrived from Syria and beg him to patronize her Fridays All this while amidst the crowd and the scuffle and a perpetual buzz and chatter and the flare of the wax candles and an intolerable smell of musk what the poor Snobs who write fashionable romances call the gleam of gems the odour of perfumes the blaze of countless lamps a scrubby looking yellow faced foreigner with cleaned gloves is warbling inaudibly in a corner to the accompaniment of another The Great Cacafogo missus Botibol whispers as she passes you by A great creature Thumpenstrumpff is at the instrument the Hetman Platoff s pianist you know To hear this Cacafogo and Thumpenstrumpff a hundred people are gathered together a bevy of dowagers stout or scraggy a faint sprinkling of misses six moody looking lords perfectly meek and solemn wonderful foreign Counts with bushy whiskers and yellow faces and a great deal of dubious jewellery young dandies with slim waists and open necks and self satisfied simpers and flowers in their buttons the old stiff stout bald headed CONVERSAZIONE ROUES whom You meet everywhere who never miss a night of this delicious enjoyment the three last caught lions of the season Higgs the traveller Biggs the novelist and Toffey who has come out so on the sugar question Captain Flash who is invited on account of his pretty wife and Lord Ogleby who goes wherever she goes QUE SCAIS JE Who are the owners of all those showy scarfs and white neckcloths Ask little Tom Prig who is there in all his glory knows everybody has a story about every one and as he trips home to his lodgings in Jermyn Street with his gibus hat and his little glazed pumps thinks he is the fashionablest young fellow in town and that he really has passed a night of exquisite enjoyment You go up with our usual easy elegance of manner and talk to Miss Smith in a corner Oh mister Snob I m afraid you re sadly satirical That s all she says If you say it s fine weather she bursts out laughing or hint that it s very hot she vows you are the drollest wretch Meanwhile missus Botibol is simpering on fresh arrivals the individual at the door is roaring out their names poor Cacafogo is quavering away in the music room under the impression that he will be LANCE in the world by singing inaudibly here And what a blessing it is to squeeze out of the door and into the street where a half hundred of carriages are in waiting and where the link boy with that unnecessary lantern of his pounces upon all who issue out and will insist upon getting your noble honour s lordship s cab And to think that there are people who after having been to Botibol on Wednesday will go to Clutterbuck on Friday CHAPTER XIX DINING OUT SNOBS In England Dinner giving Snobs occupy a very important place in society and the task of describing them is tremendous There was a time in my life when the consciousness of having eaten a man s salt rendered me dumb regarding his demerits and I thought it a wicked act and a breach of hospitality to speak ill of him But why should a saddle of mutton blind you or a turbot and lobster sauce shut your mouth for ever With advancing age men see their duties more clearly I am not to be hoodwinked any longer by a slice of venison be it ever so fat and as for being dumb on account of turbot and lobster sauce of course I am good manners ordain that I should be so until I have swallowed the compound but not afterwards directly the victuals are discussed and John takes away the plate my tongue begins to wag Does not yours if you have a pleasant neighbour a lovely creature say of some five and thirty whose daughters have not yet quite come out they are the best talkers As for your young misses they are only put about the table to look at like the flowers in the centre piece Their blushing youth and natural modesty preclude them from easy confidential conversational ABANDON which forms the delight of the intercourse with their dear mothers It is to these if he would prosper in his profession that the Dining out Snob should address himself Suppose you sit next to one of these how pleasant it is in the intervals of the banquet actually to abuse the victuals and the giver of the entertainment It s twice as PIQUANT to make fun of a man under his very nose What IS a Dinner giving Snob some innocent youth who is not REPANDU in the world may ask or some simple reader who has not the benefits of London experience My dear sir I will show you not all for that is impossible but several kinds of Dinner giving Snobs For instance suppose you in the middle rank of life accustomed to Mutton roast on Tuesday cold on Wednesday hashed on Thursday c with small means and a small establishment choose to waste the former and set the latter topsy turvy by giving entertainments unnaturally costly you come into the Dinner giving Snob class at once Suppose you get in cheap made dishes from the pastrycook s and hire a couple of greengrocers or carpet beaters to figure as footmen dismissing honest Molly who waits on common days and bedizening your table ordinarily ornamented with willow pattern crockery with twopenny halfpenny Birmingham plate Suppose you pretend to be richer and grander than you ought to be you are a Dinner giving Snob And oh I tremble to think how many and many a one will read this A man who entertains in this way and alas how few do not is like a fellow who would borrow his neighbour s coat to make a show in or a lady who flaunts in the diamonds from next door a humbug in a word and amongst the Snobs he must be set down A man who goes out of his natural sphere of society to ask Lords Generals Aldermen and other persons of fashion but is niggardly of his hospitality towards his own equals is a Dinner giving Snob My dear friend Jack Tufthunt for example knows ONE Lord whom he met at a watering place old Lord Mumble who is as toothless as a three months old baby and as mum as an undertaker and as dull as well we will not particularise Tufthunt never has a dinner now but you see this solemn old toothless patrician at the right hand of missus Tufthunt Tufthunt is a Dinner giving Snob Old Livermore old Soy old Chutney the East Indian Director old Cutler the Surgeon c that society of old fogies in fine who give each other dinners round and round and dine for the mere purpose of guttling these again are Dinner giving Snobs Again my friend Lady MacScrew who has three grenadier flunkeys in lace round the table and serves up a scrag of mutton on silver and dribbles you out bad sherry and port by thimblefuls is a Dinner giving Snob of the other sort and I confess for my part I would rather dine with old Livermore or old Soy than with her Ladyship Stinginess is snobbish Ostentation is snobbish Too great profusion is snobbish Tuft hunting is snobbish But I own there are people more snobbish than all those whose defects are above mentioned viz those individuals who can and don t give dinners at all The man without hospitality shall never sit SUB IISDEM TRABIBUS with ME Let the sordid wretch go mumble his bone alone What again is true hospitality Alas my dear friends and brother Snobs how little do we meet of it after all Are the motives PURE which induce your friends to ask you to dinner This has often come across me Does your entertainer want something from you For instance I am not of a suspicious turn but it IS a fact that when Hookey is bringing out a new work he asks the critics all round to dinner that when Walker has got his picture ready for the Exhibition he somehow grows exceedingly hospitable and has his friends of the press to a quiet cutlet and a glass of Sillery Old Hunks the miser who died lately leaving his money to his housekeeper lived many years on the fat of the land by simply taking down at all his friends the names and Christian names OF ALL THE CHILDREN But though you may have your own opinion about the hospitality of your acquaintances and though men who ask you from sordid motives are most decidedly Dinner giving Snobs it is best not to inquire into their motives too keenly Be not too curious about the mouth of a gift horse After all a man does not intend to insult you by asking you to dinner Though for that matter I know some characters about town who actually consider themselves injured and insulted if the dinner or the company is not to their liking There is Guttleton who dines at home off a shilling s worth of beef from the cookshop but if he is asked to dine at a house where there are not pease at the end of May or cucumbers in March along with the turbot thinks himself insulted by being invited Good Ged says he what the deuce do the Forkers mean by asking ME to a family dinner I can get mutton at home or What infernal impertinence it is of the Spooners to get ENTREES from the pastrycook s and fancy that I am to be deceived with their stories about their French cook Then again there is Jack Puddington I saw that honest fellow t other day quite in a rage because as chance would have it Sir John Carver asked him to meet the very same party he had met at Colonel Cramley s the day before and he had not got up a new set of stories to entertain them Poor Dinner giving Snobs you don t know what small thanks you get for all your pains and money How we Dining out Snobs sneer at your cookery and pooh pooh your old hock and are incredulous about your four and six penny champagne and know that the side dishes of to day are RECHAUFFES from the dinner of yesterday and mark how certain dishes are whisked off the table untasted so that they may figure at the banquet tomorrow Whenever for my part I see the head man particularly anxious to ESCAMOTER a fricandeau or a blanc mange I always call out and insist upon massacring it with a spoon All this sort of conduct makes one popular with the Dinner giving Snob One friend of mine I know has made a prodigious sensation in good society by announcing apropos of certain dishes when offered to him that he never eats aspic except at Lord Tittup s and that Lady Jimmy s CHEF is the only man in London who knows how to dress FILET EN SERPENTEAU or SUPREME DE VOLAILLE AUX TRUFFES CHAPTER XX 
243-11266-0000	train-other-500	DINNER GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED If my friends would but follow the present prevailing fashion I think they ought to give me a testimonial for the paper on Dinner giving Snobs which I am now writing
none	none	 What do you say now 
243-11266-0001	train-other-500	to a handsome comfortable dinner service of plate NOT including plates for I hold silver plates to be sheer wantonness and would almost as soon think of silver teacups a couple of neat teapots a coffeepot
none	none	 trays c with a 
243-11266-0002	train-other-500	little inscription to my wife missus Snob and a half score of silver tankards for the little Snoblings to glitter on the homely table where they partake of their quotidian mutton If I had my way
243-11266-0003	train-other-500	and my plans could be carried out dinner giving would increase as much on the one hand as dinner giving Snobbishness would diminish to my mind the most amiable part of the work lately published by my esteemed friend
none	none	 if upon a very brief acquaintance he will allow me to call him so 
243-11266-0004	train-other-500	Alexis Soyer the regenerator what he in his noble style would call the most succulent savoury and elegant passages are those which relate not to the grand banquets and ceremonial dinners but to his dinners at home
none	none	 The dinner at home ought to be the centre of the whole system of dinner giving Your usual style of meal that is plenteous comfortable and in its perfection should be that to which you welcome your friends 
243-11266-0005	train-other-500	as it is that of which you partake yourself For towards what woman in the world do I entertain a higher regard than towards the beloved partner of my existence missus Snob Who should have a greater place in my affections
243-11266-0006	train-other-500	than her six brothers three or four of whom we are pretty sure will favour us with their company at seven o clock or her angelic mother
none	none	 my own valued mother in law 
243-11266-0007	train-other-500	for whom finally would I wish to cater more generously than for your very humble servant the present writer Now nobody supposes that the Birmingham plate is had out the disguised carpet beaters
243-11266-0008	train-other-500	introduced to the exclusion of the neat parlour maid the miserable ENTREES from the pastrycook s ordered in and the children packed off as it is supposed to the nursery but really only to the staircase
243-11266-0009	train-other-500	down which they slide during the dinner time waylaying the dishes as they come out and fingering the round bumps on the jellies and the forced meat balls in the soup nobody I say supposes that a dinner at home is characterized by
243-11266-0010	train-other-500	the horrible ceremony the foolish makeshifts the mean pomp and ostentation which distinguish our banquets on grand field days Such a notion is monstrous I would as soon think of having my dearest Bessy
243-11266-0011	train-other-500	sitting opposite me in a turban and bird of paradise and showing her jolly mottled arms out of blond sleeves in her famous red satin gown ay or of having mister Toole every day in a white waistcoat at my back shouting

none	none	 why not always Why should Jones and I who are in the middle rank alter the modes of our being to assume an ECLAT which does not belong to us to entertain our friends who if we are worth anything and honest fellows at bottom are men of the middle rank too who are not in the least deceived by our temporary splendour and who play off exactly the same absurd trick upon us 
243-11266-0013	train-other-500	when they ask us to dine If it be pleasant to dine with your friends as all persons with good stomachs and kindly hearts will I presume allow it to be it is better to dine twice than to dine once
243-11266-0014	train-other-500	It is impossible for men of small means to be continually spending five and twenty or thirty shillings on each friend who sits down to their table People dine for less I myself have seen at my favourite Club
243-11266-0015	train-other-500	the Senior United Service His Grace the Duke of Wellington quite contented with the joint one and three and half pint of sherry nine and if his Grace why not you and I This rule I have made and found the benefit of
none	none	 Whenever I ask a couple of Dukes and a Marquis or so to dine with me I set them down to a piece of beef or a leg of mutton and trimmings The grandees thank you for this simplicity and appreciate the same My dear Jones ask any of those 
243-11266-0016	train-other-500	whom you have the honour of knowing if such be not the case I am far from wishing that their Graces should treat me in a similar fashion Splendour is a part of their station as decent comfort let us trust of yours and mine
243-11266-0017	train-other-500	Fate has comfortably appointed gold plate for some and has bidden others contentedly to wear the willow pattern And being perfectly contented indeed humbly thankful for look around O Jones
243-11266-0018	train-other-500	and see the myriads who are not so fortunate to wear honest linen while magnificos of the world are adorned with cambric and point lace surely we ought to hold as miserable envious fools
none	none	 those wretched Beaux Tibbs s of society who sport a lace dickey and nothing besides the poor silly jays who trail a peacock s feather behind them and think to simulate the gorgeous bird whose nature it is to strut on palace terraces 
243-11266-0019	train-other-500	and to flaunt his magnificent fan tail in the sunshine The jays with peacocks feathers are the Snobs of this world and never since the days of Aesop were they more numerous in any land
243-11266-0020	train-other-500	than they are at present in this free country How does this most ancient apologue apply to the subject in hand the Dinner giving Snob The imitation of the great is universal in this city from the palaces of Kensingtonia
243-11266-0021	train-other-500	and Belgravia even to the remotest corner of Brunswick Square Peacocks feathers are stuck in the tails of most families Scarce one of us domestic birds but imitates the lanky
none	none	 pavonine strut 
243-11266-0022	train-other-500	and shrill genteel scream O you misguided dinner giving Snobs think how much pleasure you lose and how much mischief you do with your absurd grandeurs and hypocrisies You stuff each other with unnatural forced meats
243-11266-0023	train-other-500	and entertain each other to the ruin of friendship let alone health and the destruction of hospitality and good fellowship you who but for the peacock s tail might chatter away so much at your ease and be so jovial and happy
none	none	 When a man goes into a great set company of dinner giving and dinner receiving Snobs if he has a philosophical turn of mind he will consider what a huge humbug the whole affair is 
243-11266-0024	train-other-500	the dishes and the drink and the servants and the plate and the host and hostess and the conversation and the company the philosopher included The host is smiling and hob nobbing and talking up and down the table
none	none	 but a prey to secret terrors and anxieties lest the wines he has brought up from the cellar should prove insufficient lest a corked bottle should destroy his calculations or our friend the carpet beater by making some BEVUE 
243-11266-0025	train-other-500	should disclose his real quality of greengrocer and show that he is not the family butler The hostess is smiling resolutely through all the courses smiling through her agony though her heart is in the kitchen and she is speculating with terror
243-11266-0026	train-other-500	lest there be any disaster there If the SOUFFLE should collapse or if Wiggins does not send the ices in time she feels as if she would commit suicide that smiling jolly woman The children upstairs are yelling
243-11266-0027	train-other-500	as their maid is crimping their miserable ringlets with hot tongs tearing Miss Emmy s hair out by the roots or scrubbing Miss Polly s dumpy nose
none	none	 with mottled soap till the little wretch screams herself into fits The young males of the family are employed as we have stated in piratical exploits upon the landing place 
243-11266-0028	train-other-500	The servants are not servants but the before mentioned retail tradesmen The plate is not plate but a mere shiny Birmingham lacquer and so is the hospitality and everything else The talk is Birmingham talk The wag of the party
243-11266-0029	train-other-500	with bitterness in his heart having just quitted his laundress who is dunning him for her bill is firing off good stories and the opposition wag is furious that he cannot get an innings Jawkins the great conversationalist
243-11266-0030	train-other-500	is scornful and indignant with the pair of them because he is kept out of court Young Muscadel that cheap dandy is talking Fashion and Almack s out of the MORNING POST and disgusting his neighbour missus Fox
243-11266-0031	train-other-500	who reflects that she has never been there The widow is vexed out of patience because her daughter Maria has got a place beside young Cambric the penniless curate and not by Colonel Goldmore the rich widower from India
243-11266-0032	train-other-500	The Doctor s wife is sulky because she has not been led out before the barrister s lady old Doctor Cork is grumbling at the wine and Guttleton sneering at the cookery And to think that all these people might be so happy
243-11266-0033	train-other-500	and easy and friendly were they brought together in a natural unpretentious way and but for an unhappy passion for peacocks feathers in England Gentle shades of Marat and Robespierre
none	none	 when I see how all the honesty of society is corrupted among us by the miserable fashion worship I feel as angry as missus Fox just mentioned and ready to order a general BATTUE of peacocks CHAPTER XXI SOME CONTINENTAL SNOBS Now that September has come and all our Parliamentary duties are over perhaps no class of Snobs are in such high feather as the Continental Snobs I watch these daily as they commence their migrations from the beach at Folkestone I see shoals of them depart not perhaps without an innate longing too to quit the Island along with those happy Snobs Farewell dear friends I say you little know that the individual who regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and brother I went to day to see our excellent friend Snooks on board the Queen of the French many scores of Snobs were there on the deck of that fine ship marching forth in their pride and bravery They will be at Ostend in four hours they will inundate the Continent next week they will carry into far lands the famous image of the British Snob I shall not see them but am with them in spirit and indeed there is hardly a country in the known and civilized world in which these eyes have not beheld them I have seen Snobs in pink coats and hunting boots scouring over the Campagna of Rome and have heard their oaths and their well known slang in the galleries of the Vatican and under the shadowy arches of the Colosseum I have met a Snob on a dromedary in the desert and picnicking under the Pyramid of Cheops I like to think how many gallant British Snobs there are at this minute of writing pushing their heads out of every window in the courtyard of Meurice s in the Rue de Rivoli or roaring out Garsong du pang Garsong du Yang or swaggering down the Toledo at Naples or even how many will be on the look out for Snooks on Ostend Pier for Snooks and the rest of the Snobs on board the Queen of the French Look at the Marquis of Carabas and his two carriages My Lady Marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other Snobs on deck There she sits and will be ill in private The strawberry leaves on her chariot panels are engraved on her ladyship s heart If she were going to heaven instead of to Ostend I rather think she would expect to have DES PLACES RESERVEES for her and would send to order the best rooms A courier with his money bag of office round his shoulders a huge scowling footman whose dark pepper and salt livery glistens with the heraldic insignia of the Carabases a brazen looking tawdry French FEMME DE CHAMBRE none but a female pen can do justice to that wonderful tawdry toilette of the lady s maid EN VOYAGE and a miserable DAME DE COMPAGNIE are ministering to the wants of her ladyship and her King Charles s spaniel They are rushing to and fro with eau de Cologne pocket handkerchiefs which are all fringe and cipher and popping mysterious cushions behind and before and in every available corner of the carriage The little Marquis her husband is walking about the deck in a bewildered manner with a lean daughter on each arm the carroty tufted hope of the family is already smoking on the foredeck in a travelling costume checked all over and in little lacquer tip pod jean boots and a shirt embroidered with pink boa constrictors What is it that gives travelling Snobs such a marvellous propensity to rush into a costume Why should a man not travel in a coat c but think proper to dress himself like a harlequin in mourning See even young Aldermanbury the tallow merchant who has just stepped on board has got a travelling dress gaping all over with pockets and little Tom Tapeworm the lawyer s clerk out of the City who has but three weeks leave turns out in gaiters and a bran new shooting jacket and must let the moustaches grow on his little sniffy upper lip forsooth Pompey Hicks is giving elaborate directions to his servant and asking loudly Davis where s the dwessing case and Davis you d best take the pistol case into the cabin Little Pompey travels with a dressing case and without a beard whom he is going to shoot with his pistols who on earth can tell and what he is to do with his servant but wait upon him I am at a loss to conjecture Look at honest Nathan Houndsditch and his lady and their little son What a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of those Snobs of Eastern race What a toilette Houndsditch s is What rings and chains what gold headed canes and diamonds what a tuft the rogue has got to his chin the rogue he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment Little Houndsditch has a little cane with a gilt head and little mosaic ornaments altogether an extra air As for the lady she is all the colours of the rainbow she has a pink parasol with a white lining and a yellow bonnet and an emerald green shawl and a shot silk pelisse and drab boots and rhubarb coloured gloves and parti coloured glass buttons expanding from the size of a fourpenny piece to a crown glitter and twiddle all down the front of her gorgeous costume I have said before I like to look at the Peoples on their gala days they are so picturesquely and outrageously splendid and happy Yonder comes Captain Bull spick and span tight and trim who travels for four or six months every year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but I think is as great a Snob as any man on board Bull passes the season in London sponging for dinners and sleeping in a garret near his Club Abroad he has been everywhere he knows the best wine at every inn in every capital in Europe lives with the best English company there has seen every palace and picture gallery from Madrid to Stockholm speaks an abominable little jargon of half a dozen languages and knows nothing nothing Bull hunts tufts on the Continent and is a sort of amateur courier He will scrape acquaintance with old Carabas before they make Ostend and will remind his lordship that he met him at Vienna twenty years ago or gave him a glass of Schnapps up the Righi We have said Bull knows nothing he knows the birth arms and pedigree of all the peerage has poked his little eyes into every one of the carriages on board their panels noted and their crests surveyed he knows all the Continental stories of English scandal how Count Towrowski ran off with Miss Baggs at Naples how VERY thick Lady Smigsmag was with young Cornichon of the French Legation at Florence the exact amount which Jack Deuceace won of Bob Greengoose at Baden what it is that made the Staggs settle on the Continent the sum for which the O Goggarty estates are mortgaged c If he can t catch a lord he will hook on to a baronet or else the old wretch will catch hold of some beardless young stripling of fashion and show him life in various and amiable and inaccessible quarters Faugh the old brute If he has every one of the vices of the most boisterous youth at least he is comforted by having no conscience He is utterly stupid but of a jovial turn He believes himself to be quite a respectable member of society but perhaps the only good action he ever did in his life is the involuntary one of giving an example to be avoided and showing what an odious thing in the social picture is that figure of the debauched old man who passes through life rather a decorous Silenus and dies some day in his garret alone unrepenting and unnoted save by his astonished heirs who find that the dissolute old miser has left money behind him See he is up to old Carabas already I told you he would Yonder you see the old Lady Mary MacScrew and those middle aged young women her daughters they are going to cheapen and haggle in Belgium and up the Rhine until they meet with a boarding house where they can live upon less board wages than her ladyship pays her footmen But she will exact and receive considerable respect from the British Snobs located in the watering place which she selects for her summer residence being the daughter of the Earl of Haggistoun That broad shouldered buck with the great whiskers and the cleaned white kid gloves is mister Phelim Clancy of Poldoodystown he calls himself mister De Clancy he endeavours to disguise his native brogue with the richest superposition of English and if you play at billiards or ECARTE with him the chances are that you will win the first game and he the seven or eight games ensuing That overgrown lady with the four daughters and the young dandy from the University her son is missus Kewsy the eminent barrister s lady who would rather die than not be in the fashion She has the Peerage in her carpet bag you may be sure but she is altogether cut out by missus Quod the attorney s wife whose carriage with the apparatus of rumbles dickeys and imperials scarcely yields in splendour to the Marquis of Carabas s own travelling chariot and whose courier has even bigger whiskers and a larger morocco money bag than the Marquis s own travelling gentleman Remark her well she is talking to mister Spout the new Member for Jawborough who is going out to inspect the operations of the Zollverein and will put some very severe questions to Lord Palmerston next session upon England and her relations with the Prussian blue trade the Naples soap trade the German tinder trade c Spout will patronize King Leopold at Brussels will write letters from abroad to the JAWBOROUGH INDEPENDENT and in his quality of MEMBER DU PARLIAMONG BRITANNIQUE will expect to be invited to a family dinner with every sovereign whose dominions he honours with a visit during his tour The next person is but hark the bell for shore is ringing and shaking Snook s hand cordially we rush on to the pier waving him a farewell as the noble black ship cuts keenly through the sunny azure waters bearing away that cargo of Snobs outward bound CHAPTER XXII CONTINENTAL SNOBBERY CONTINUED We are accustomed to laugh at the French for their braggadocio propensities and intolerable vanity about La France la gloire l Empereur and the like and yet I think in my heart that the British Snob for conceit and self sufficiency and braggartism in his way is without a parallel There is always something uneasy in a Frenchman s conceit He brags with so much fury shrieking and gesticulation yells out so loudly that the Francais is at the head of civilization the centre of thought c that one can t but see the poor fellow has a lurking doubt in his own mind that he is not the wonder he professes to be About the British Snob on the contrary there is commonly no noise no bluster but the calmness of profound conviction We are better than all the world we don t question the opinion at all it s an axiom And when a Frenchman bellows out LA FRANCE MONSIEUR LA FRANCE EST A LA TETE DU MONDE CIVILISE we laugh good naturedly at the frantic poor devil WE are the first chop of the world we know the fact so well in our secret hearts that a claim set up elsewhere is simply ludicrous My dear brother reader say as a man of honour if you are not of this opinion Do you think a Frenchman your equal You don t you gallant British Snob you know you don t no more perhaps does the Snob your humble servant brother And I am inclined to think it is this conviction and the consequent bearing of the Englishman towards the foreigner whom he condescends to visit this confidence of superiority which holds up the head of the owner of every English hat box from Sicily to saint Petersburg that makes us so magnificently hated throughout Europe as we are this more than all our little victories and of which many Frenchmen and Spaniards have never heard this amazing and indomitable insular pride which animates my lord in his travelling carriage as well as John in the rumble If you read the old Chronicles of the French wars you find precisely the same character of the Englishman and Henry V s people behaved with just the cool domineering manner of our gallant veterans of France and the Peninsula Did you never hear Colonel Cutler and Major Slasher talking over the war after dinner or Captain Boarder describing his action with the Indomptable Hang the fellows says Boarder their practice was very good I was beat off three times before I took her Cuss those carabineers of Milhaud s says Slasher what work they made of our light cavalry implying a sort of surprise that the Frenchman should stand up against Britons at all a good natured wonder that the blind mad vain glorious brave poor devils should actually have the courage to resist an Englishman Legions of such Englishmen are patronizing Europe at this moment being kind to the Pope or good natured to the King of Holland or condescending to inspect the Prussian reviews When Nicholas came here who reviews a quarter of a million of pairs of moustaches to his breakfast every morning we took him off to Windsor and showed him two whole regiments of six or eight hundred Britons a piece with an air as much as to say There my boy look at THAT Those are ENGLISHMEN those are and your master whenever you please as the nursery song says The British Snob is long long past scepticism and can afford to laugh quite good humouredly at those conceited Yankees or besotted little Frenchmen who set up as models of mankind THEY forsooth I have been led into these remarks by listening to an old fellow at the Hotel du Nord at Boulogne and who is evidently of the Slasher sort He came down and seated himself at the breakfast table with a surly scowl on his salmon coloured bloodshot face strangling in a tight cross barred cravat his linen and his appointments so perfectly stiff and spotless that everybody at once recognized him as a dear countryman Only our port wine and other admirable institutions could have produced a figure so insolent so stupid so gentleman like After a while our attention was called to him by his roaring out in a voice of plethoric fury O Everybody turned round at the O conceiving the Colonel to be as his countenance denoted him in intense pain but the waiters knew better and instead of being alarmed brought the Colonel the kettle O it appears is the French for hot water The Colonel though he despises it heartily thinks he speaks the language remarkably well Whilst he was inhausting his smoking tea which went rolling and gurgling down his throat and hissing over the hot coppers of that respectable veteran a friend joined him with a wizened face and very black wig evidently a Colonel too The two warriors waggling their old heads at each other presently joined breakfast and fell into conversation and we had the advantage of hearing about the old war and some pleasant conjectures as to the next which they considered imminent They psha d the French fleet they pooh pooh d the French commercial marine they showed how in a war there would be a cordon a cordong by of steamers along our coast and by ready at a minute to land anywhere on the other shore to give the French as good a thrashing as they got in the last war by In fact a rumbling cannonade of oaths was fired by the two veterans during the whole of their conversation There was a Frenchman in the room but as he had not been above ten years in London of course he did not speak the language and lost the benefit of the conversation But O my country said I to myself it s no wonder that you are so beloved If I were a Frenchman how I would hate you That brutal ignorant peevish bully of an Englishman is showing himself in every city of Europe One of the dullest creatures under heaven he goes travelling Europe under foot shouldering his way into galleries and cathedrals and bustling into palaces with his buck ram uniform At church or theatre gala or picture gallery HIS face never varies A thousand delightful sights pass before his bloodshot eyes and don t affect him Countless brilliant scenes of life and manners are shown him but never move him He goes to church and calls the practices there degrading and superstitious as if HIS altar was the only one that was acceptable He goes to picture galleries and is more ignorant about Art than a French shoeblack Art Nature pass and there is no dot of admiration in his stupid eyes nothing moves him except when a very great man comes his way and then the rigid proud self confident inflexible British Snob can be as humble as a flunkey and as supple as a harlequin CHAPTER XXIII ENGLISH SNOBS ON THE CONTINENT WHAT is the use of Lord Rome s telescope my friend Panwiski exclaimed the other day It only enables you to see a few hundred thousands of miles farther What were thought to be mere nebulae turn out to be most perceivable starry systems and beyond these you see other nebulae which a more powerful glass will show to be stars again and so they go on glittering and winking away into eternity With which my friend Pan heaving a great sigh as if confessing his inability to look Infinity in the face sank back resigned and swallowed a large bumper of claret I who like other great men have but one idea thought to myself that as the stars are so are the Snobs the more you gaze upon those luminaries the more you behold now nebulously congregated now faintly distinguishable now brightly defined until they twinkle off in endless blazes and fade into the immeasurable darkness I am but as a child playing on the sea shore Some telescopic philosopher will arise one day some great Snobonomer to find the laws of the great science which we are now merely playing with and to define and settle and classify that which is at present but vague theory and loose though elegant assertion Yes a single eye can but trace a very few and simple varieties of the enormous universe of Snobs I sometimes think of appealing to the public and calling together a congress of SAVANS such as met at Southampton each to bring his contributions and read his paper on the Great Subject For what can a single poor few do even with the subject at present in hand English Snobs on the Continent though they are a hundred thousand times less numerous than on their native island yet even these few are too many One can only fix a stray one here and there The individuals are caught the thousands escape I have noted down but three whom I have met with in my walk this morning through this pleasant marine city of Boulogne There is the English Raff Snob that frequents ESTAMINETS and CABARETS who is heard yelling We won t go home till morning and startling the midnight echoes of quiet Continental towns with shrieks of English slang The boozy unshorn wretch is seen hovering round quays as packets arrive and tippling drains in inn bars where he gets credit He talks French with slang familiarity he and his like quite people the debt prisons on the Continent He plays pool at the billiard houses and may be seen engaged at cards and dominoes of forenoons His signature is to be seen on countless bills of exchange it belonged to an honourable family once very likely for the English Raff most probably began by being a gentleman and has a father over the water who is ashamed to hear his name He has cheated the old governor repeatedly in better days and swindled his sisters of their portions and robbed his younger brothers Now he is living on his wife s jointure she is hidden away in some dismal garret patching shabby finery and cobbling up old clothes for her children the most miserable and slatternly of women Or sometimes the poor woman and her daughters go about timidly giving lessons in English and music or do embroidery and work under hand to purchase the means for the POT AU FEU while Raff is swaggering on the quay or tossing off glasses of cognac at the CAFE The unfortunate creature has a child still every year and her constant hypocrisy is to try and make her girls believe that their father is a respectable man and to huddle him out of the way when the brute comes home drunk Those poor ruined souls get together and have a society of their own the which it is very affecting to watch those tawdry pretences at gentility those flimsy attempts at gaiety those woful sallies that jingling old piano oh it makes the heart sick to see and hear them As missus Raff with her company of pale daughters gives a penny tea to missus Diddler they talk about bygone times and the fine society they kept and they sing feeble songs out of tattered old music books and while engaged in this sort of entertainment in comes Captain Raff with his greasy hat on one side and straightway the whole of the dismal room reeks with a mingled odour of smoke and spirits Has not everybody who has lived abroad met Captain Raff His name is proclaimed every now and then by mister Sheriff s Officer Hemp and about Boulogne and Paris and Brussels there are so many of his sort that I will lay a wager that I shall be accused of gross personality for showing him up Many a less irreclaimable villain is transported many a more honourable man is at present at the treadmill and although we are the noblest greatest most religious and most moral people in the world I would still like to know where except in the United Kingdom debts are a matter of joke and making tradesmen suffer a sport that gentlemen own to It is dishonourable to owe money in France You never hear people in other parts of Europe brag of their swindling or see a prison in a large Continental town which is not more or less peopled with English rogues A still more loathsome and dangerous Snob than the above transparent and passive scamp is frequent on the continent of Europe and my young Snob friends who are travelling thither should be especially warned against him Captain Legg is a gentleman like Raff though perhaps of a better degree He has robbed his family too but of a great deal more and has boldly dishonoured bills for thousands where Raff has been boggling over the clumsy conveyance of a ten pound note Legg is always at the best inn with the finest waistcoats and moustaches or tearing about in the flashest of britzkas while poor Raff is tipsifying himself with spirits and smoking cheap tobacco It is amazing to think that Legg so often shown up and known everywhere is flourishing yet He would sink into utter ruin but for the constant and ardent love of gentility that distinguishes the English Snob There is many a young fellow of the middle classes who must know Legg to be a rogue and a cheat and yet from his desire to be in the fashion and his admiration of tip top swells and from his ambition to air himself by the side of a Lord s son will let Legg make an income out of him content to pay so long as he can enjoy that society Many a worthy father of a family when he hears that his son is riding about with Captain Legg Lord Levant s son is rather pleased that young Hopeful should be in such good company Legg and his friend Major Macer make professional tours through Europe and are to be found at the right places at the right time Last year I heard how my young acquaintance mister Muff from Oxford going to see a little life at a Carnival ball at Paris was accosted by an Englishman who did not know a word of the d language and hearing Muff speak it so admirably begged him to interpret to a waiter with whom there was a dispute about refreshments It was quite a comfort the stranger said to see an honest English face and did Muff know where there was a good place for supper So those two went to supper and who should come in of all men in the world but Major Macer And so Legg introduced Macer and so there came on a little intimacy and three card loo c c Year after year scores of Muffs in various places in the world are victimised by Legg and Macer The story is so stale the trick of seduction so entirely old and clumsy that it is only a wonder people can be taken in any more but the temptations of vice and gentility together are too much for young English Snobs and those simple young victims are caught fresh every day Though it is only to be kicked and cheated by men of fashion your true British Snob will present himself for the honour I need not allude here to that very common British Snob who makes desperate efforts at becoming intimate with the great Continental aristocracy such as old Rolls the baker who has set up his quarters in the Faubourg Saint Germain and will receive none but Carlists and no French gentleman under the rank of a Marquis We can all of us laugh at THAT fellow s pretensions well enough we who tremble before a great man of our own nation But as you say my brave and honest John Bull of a Snob a French Marquis of twenty descents is very different from an English Peer and a pack of beggarly German and Italian Fuersten and Principi awaken the scorn of an honest minded Briton But our aristocracy that s a very different matter They are the real leaders of the world the real old original and no mistake nobility Off with your cap Snob down on your knees Snob and truckle CHAPTER XXIV ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Tired of the town where the sight of the closed shutters of the nobility my friends makes my heart sick in my walks afraid almost to sit in those vast Pall Mall solitudes the Clubs and of annoying the Club waiters who might I thought be going to shoot in the country but for me I determined on a brief tour in the provinces and paying some visits in the country which were long due My first visit was to my friend Major Ponto H P of the Horse Marines in Mangelwurzelshire The Major in his little phaeton was in waiting to take me up at the station The vehicle was not certainly splendid but such a carriage as would accommodate a plain man as Ponto said he was and a numerous family We drove by beautiful fresh fields and green hedges through a cheerful English landscape the high road as smooth and trim as the way in a nobleman s park was charmingly chequered with cool shade and golden sunshine Rustics in snowy smock frocks jerked their hats off smiling as we passed Children with cheeks as red as the apples in the orchards bobbed curtsies to us at the cottage doors Blue church spires rose here and there in the distance and as the buxom gardener s wife opened the white gate at the Major s little ivy covered lodge and we drove through the neat plantations of firs and evergreens up to the house my bosom felt a joy and elation which I thought it was impossible to experience in the smoky atmosphere of a town Here I mentally exclaimed is all peace plenty happiness Here I shall be rid of Snobs There can be none in this charming Arcadian spot Stripes the Major s man formerly corporal in his gallant corps received my portmanteau and an elegant little present which I had brought from town as a peace offering to missus Ponto viz a cod and oysters from Grove s in a hamper about the size of a coffin Ponto s house The Evergreens missus P has christened it is a perfect Paradise of a place It is all over creepers and bow windows and verandahs A wavy lawn tumbles up and down all round it with flower beds of wonderful shapes and zigzag gravel walks and beautiful but damp shrubberies of myrtles and glistening laurustines which have procured it its change of name It was called Little Bullock s Pound in old Doctor Ponto s time I had a view of the pretty grounds and the stable and the adjoining village and church and a great park beyond from the windows of the bedroom whither Ponto conducted me It was the yellow bedroom the freshest and pleasantest of bed chambers the air was fragrant with a large bouquet that was placed on the writing table the linen was fragrant with the lavender in which it had been laid the chintz hangings of the bed and the big sofa were if not fragrant with flowers at least painted all over with them the pen wiper on the table was the imitation of a double dahlia and there was accommodation for my watch in a sun flower on the mantelpiece A scarlet leaved creeper came curling over the windows through which the setting sun was pouring a flood of golden light It was all flowers and freshness Oh how unlike those black chimney pots in saint Alban s Place London on which these weary eyes are accustomed to look It must be all happiness here Ponto said I flinging myself down into the snug BERGERE and inhaling such a delicious draught of country air as all the MILLEFLEURS of mister Atkinson s shop cannot impart to any the most expensive pocket handkerchief Nice place isn t it said Ponto Quiet and unpretending I like everything quiet You ve not brought your valet with you Stripes will arrange your dressing things and that functionary entering at the same time proceeded to gut my portmanteau and to lay out the black kerseymeres the rich cut velvet Genoa waistcoat the white choker and other polite articles of evening costume with great gravity and despatch A great dinner party thinks I to myself seeing these preparations and not perhaps displeased at the idea that some of the best people in the neighbourhood were coming to see me Hark theres the first bell ringing said Ponto moving away and in fact a clamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging from the stable turret and announced the agreeable fact that dinner would appear in half an hour If the dinner is as grand as the dinner bell thought I faith I m in good quarters and had leisure during the half hour s interval not only to advance my own person to the utmost polish of elegance which it is capable of receiving to admire the pedigree of the Pontos hanging over the chimney and the Ponto crest and arms emblazoned on the wash hand basin and jug but to make a thousand reflections on the happiness of a country life upon the innocent friendliness and cordiality of rustic intercourse and to sigh for an opportunity of retiring like Ponto to my own fields to my own vine and fig tree with a placens uxor in my domus and a half score of sweet young pledges of affection sporting round my paternal knee Clang At the end of thirty minutes dinner bell number two pealed from the adjacent turret I hastened downstairs expecting to find a score of healthy country folk in the drawing room There was only one person there a tall and Roman nosed lady glistering over with bugles in deep mourning She rose advanced two steps made a majestic curtsey during which all the bugles in her awful head dress began to twiddle and quiver and then said mister Snob we are very happy to see you at the Evergreens and heaved a great sigh This then was missus Major Ponto to whom making my very best bow I replied that I was very proud to make her acquaintance as also that of so charming a place as the Evergreens Another sigh We are distantly related mister Snob said she shaking her melancholy head Poor dear Lord Rubadub Oh said I not knowing what the deuce missus Major Ponto meant Major Ponto told me that you were of the Leicestershire Snobs a very old family and related to Lord Snobbington who married Laura Rubadub who is a cousin of mine as was her poor dear father for whom we are mourning What a seizure only sixty three and apoplexy quite unknown until now in our family In life we are in death mister Snob Does Lady Snobbington bear the deprivation well Why really ma am I I don t know I replied more and more confused As she was speaking I heard a sort of CLOOP by which well known sound I was aware that somebody was opening a bottle of wine and Ponto entered in a huge white neckcloth and a rather shabby black suit My love missus Major Ponto said to her husband we were talking of our cousin poor dear Lord Rubadub His death has placed some of the first families in England in mourning Does Lady Rubadub keep the house in Hill Street do you know I didn t know but I said I believe she does at a venture and looking down to the drawing room table saw the inevitable abominable maniacal absurd disgusting Peerage open on the table interleaved with annotations and open at the article Snobbington Dinner is served says Stripes flinging open the door and I gave missus Major Ponto my arm CHAPTER XXV A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Of the dinner to which we now sat down I am not going to be a severe critic The mahogany I hold to be inviolable but this I will say that I prefer sherry to marsala when I can get it and the latter was the wine of which I have no doubt I heard the cloop just before dinner Nor was it particularly good of its kind however missus Major Ponto did not evidently know the difference for she called the liquor Amontillado during the whole of the repast and drank but half a glass of it leaving the rest for the Major and his guest Stripes was in the livery of the Ponto family a thought shabby but gorgeous in the extreme lots of magnificent worsted lace and livery buttons of a very notable size The honest fellow s hands I remarked were very large and black and a fine odour of the stable was wafted about the room as he moved to and fro in his ministration I should have preferred a clean maidservant but the sensations of Londoners are too acute perhaps on these subjects and a faithful John after all IS more genteel From the circumstance of the dinner being composed of pig s head mock turtle soup of pig s fry and roast ribs of pork I am led to imagine that one of Ponto s black Hampshires had been sacrificed a short time previous to my visit It was an excellent and comfortable repast only there WAS rather a sameness in it certainly I made a similar remark the next day During the dinner missus Ponto asked me many questions regarding the nobility my relatives When Lady Angelina Skeggs would come out and if the countess her mamma this was said with much archness and he he ing still wore that extraordinary purple hair dye Whether my Lord Guttlebury kept besides his French chef and an English cordonbleu for the roasts an Italian for the confectionery Who attended at Lady Clapperclaw s conversazioni and whether Sir John Champignon s Thursday Mornings were pleasant Was it true that Lady Carabas wanting to pawn her diamonds found that they were paste and that the Marquis had disposed of them beforehand How was it that Snuffin the great tobacco merchant broke off the marriage which was on the tapis between him and their second daughter and was it true that a mulatto lady came over from the Havanna and forbade the match Upon my word Madam I had begun and was going on to say that I didn t know one word about all these matters which seemed so to interest missus Major Ponto when the Major giving me a tread or stamp with his large foot under the table said Come come Snob my boy we are all tiled you know We KNOW you re one of the fashionable people about town we saw your name at Lady Clapperclaw s SOIREES and the Champignon breakfasts and as for the Rubadubs of course as relations Oh of course I dine there twice a week I said and then I remembered that my cousin Humphry Snob of the Middle Temple IS a great frequenter of genteel societies and to have seen his name in the MORNING POST at the tag end of several party lists So taking the hint I am ashamed to say I indulged missus Major Ponto with a deal of information about the first families in England such as would astonish those great personages if they knew it I described to her most accurately the three reigning beauties of last season at Almack s told her in confidence that his Grace the D of W was going to be married the day after his Statue was put up that his Grace the D of D was also about to lead the fourth daughter of the Archduke Stephen to the hymeneal altar and talked to her in a word just in the style of missus Gore s last fashionable novel missus Major was quite fascinated by this brilliant conversation She began to trot out scraps of French just for all the world as they do in the novels and kissed her hand to me quite graciously telling me to come soon to caffy UNG PU DE MUSICK O SALONG with which she tripped off like an elderly fairy Shall I open a bottle of port or do you ever drink such a thing as Hollands and water says Ponto looking ruefully at me This was a very different style of thing to what I had been led to expect from him at our smoking room at the Club where he swaggers about his horses and his cellar and slapping me on the shoulder used to say Come down to Mangelwurzelshire Snob my boy and I ll give you as good a day s shooting and as good a glass of claret as any in the county Well I said I like Hollands much better than port and gin even better than Hollands This was lucky It WAS gin and Stripes brought in hot water on a splendid plated tray The jingling of a harp and piano soon announced that missus Ponto s ung PU DE MUSICK had commenced and the smell of the stable again entering the dining room in the person of Stripes summoned us to CAFFY and the little concert She beckoned me with a winning smile to the sofa on which she made room for me and where we could command a fine view of the backs of the young ladies who were performing the musical entertainment Very broad backs they were too strictly according to the present mode for crinoline or its substitutes is not an expensive luxury and young people in the country can afford to be in the fashion at very trifling charges Miss Emily Ponto at the piano and her sister Maria at that somewhat exploded instrument the harp were in light blue dresses that looked all flounce and spread out like mister Green s balloon when inflated Brilliant touch Emily has what a fine arm Maria s is missus Ponto remarked good naturedly pointing out the merits of her daughters and waving her own arm in such a way as to show that she was not a little satisfied with the beauty of that member I observed she had about nine bracelets and bangles consisting of chains and padlocks the Major s miniature and a variety of brass serpents with fiery ruby or tender turquoise eyes writhing up to her elbow almost in the most profuse contortions You recognize those polkas They were played at Devonshire House on the twenty third of July the day of the grand fete So I said yes I knew em quite intimately and began wagging my head as if in acknowledgment of those old friends When the performance was concluded I had the felicity of a presentation and conversation with the two tall and scraggy Miss Pontos and Miss Wirt the governess sat down to entertain us with variations on Sich a gettin up Stairs They were determined to be in the fashion For the performance of the Gettin up Stairs I have no other name but that it was a STUNNER First Miss Wirt with great deliberation played the original and beautiful melody cutting it as it were out of the instrument and firing off each note so loud clear and sharp that I am sure Stripes must have heard it in the stable What a finger says missus Ponto and indeed it WAS a finger as knotted as a turkey s drumstick and splaying all over the piano When she had banged out the tune slowly she began a different manner of Gettin up Stairs and did so with a fury and swiftness quite incredible She spun up stairs she whirled up stairs she galloped up stairs she rattled up stairs and then having got the tune to the top landing as it were she hurled it down again shrieking to the bottom floor where it sank in a crash as if exhausted by the breathless rapidity of the descent Then Miss Wirt played the Gettin up Stairs with the most pathetic and ravishing solemnity plaintive moans and sobs issued from the keys you wept and trembled as you were gettin up stairs Miss Wirt s hands seemed to faint and wail and die in variations again and she went up with a savage clang and rush of trumpets as if Miss Wirt was storming a breach and although I knew nothing of music as I sat and listened with my mouth open to this wonderful display my CAFFY grew cold and I wondered the windows did not crack and the chandelier start out of the beam at the sound of this earthquake of a piece of music Glorious creature Isn t she said missus Ponto Squirtz s favourite pupil inestimable to have such a creature Lady Carabas would give her eyes for her A prodigy of accomplishments Thank you Miss Wirt and the young ladies gave a heave and a gasp of admiration a deep breathing gushing sound such as you hear at church when the sermon comes to a full stop Miss Wirt put her two great double knuckled hands round a waist of her two pupils and said My dear children I hope you will be able to play it soon as well as your poor little governess When I lived with the Dunsinanes it was the dear Duchess s favourite and Lady Barbara and Lady Jane McBeth learned it It was while hearing Jane play that I remember that dear Lord Castletoddy first fell in love with her and though he is but an Irish Peer with not more than fifteen thousand a year I persuaded Jane to have him Do you know Castletoddy mister Snob round towers sweet place County Mayo Old Lord Castletoddy the present Lord was then Lord Inishowan was a most eccentric old man they say he was mad I heard his Royal Highness the poor dear Duke of Sussex SUCH a man my dears but alas addicted to smoking I heard his Royal Highness say to the Marquis of Anglesey I am sure Castletoddy is mad but Inishowan wasn t in marrying my sweet Jane though the dear child had but her ten thousand pounds POUR TOUT POTAGE Most invaluable person whispered missus Major Ponto to me Has lived in the very highest society and I who have been accustomed to see governesses bullied in the world was delighted to find this one ruling the roast and to think that even the majestic missus Ponto bent before her As for my pipe so to speak it went out at once I hadn t a word to say against a woman who was intimate with every Duchess in the Red Book She wasn t the rosebud but she had been near it She had rubbed shoulders with the great and about these we talked all the evening incessantly and about the fashions and about the Court until bed time came And are there Snobs in this Elysium I exclaimed jumping into the lavender perfumed bed Ponto s snoring boomed from the neighbouring bed room in reply CHAPTER XXVI ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Something like a journal of the proceedings at the Evergreens may be interesting to those foreign readers of PUNCH who want to know the customs of an English gentleman s family and household There s plenty of time to keep the Journal Piano strumming begins at six o clock in the morning it lasts till breakfast with but a minute s intermission when the instrument changes hands and Miss Emily practises in place of her sister Miss Maria In fact the confounded instrument never stops when the young ladies are at their lessons Miss Wirt hammers away at those stunning variations and keeps her magnificent finger in exercise I asked this great creature in what other branches of education she instructed her pupils The modern languages says she modestly French German Spanish and Italian Latin and the rudiments of Greek if desired English of course the practice of Elocution Geography and Astronomy and the Use of the Globes Algebra but only as far as quadratic equations for a poor ignorant female you know mister Snob cannot be expected to know everything Ancient and Modern History no young woman can be without and of these I make my beloved pupils PERFECT MISTRESSES Botany Geology and Mineralogy I consider as amusements And with these I assure you we manage to pass the days at the Evergreens not unpleasantly Only these thought I what an education But I looked in one of Miss Ponto s manuscript song books and found five faults of French in four words and in a waggish mood asking Miss Wirt whether Dante Algiery was so called because he was born at Algiers received a smiling answer in the affirmative which made me rather doubt about the accuracy of Miss Wirt s knowledge When the above little morning occupations are concluded these unfortunate young women perform what they call Calisthenic Exercises in the garden I saw them to day without any crinoline pulling the garden roller Dear missus Ponto was in the garden too and as limp as her daughters in a faded bandeau of hair in a battered bonnet in a holland pinafore in pattens on a broken chair snipping leaves off a vine missus Ponto measures many yards about in an evening Ye heavens what a guy she is in that skeleton morning costume Besides Stripes they keep a boy called Thomas or Tummus Tummus works in the garden or about the pigsty and stable Thomas wears a page s costume of eruptive buttons When anybody calls and Stripes is out of the way Tummus flings himself like mad into Thomas s clothes and comes out metamorphosed like Harlequin in the pantomime To day as missus P was cutting the grapevine as the young ladies were at the roller down comes Tummus like a roaring whirlwind with Missus Missus there s company coomin Away skurry the young ladies from the roller down comes missus P from the old chair off flies Tummus to change his clothes and in an incredibly short space of time Sir John Hawbuck my Lady Hawbuck and Master Hugh Hawbuck are introduced into the garden with brazen effrontery by Thomas who says Please Sir Jan and my Lady to walk this year way I KNOW Missus is in the rose garden And there sure enough she was In a pretty little garden bonnet with beautiful curling ringlets with the smartest of aprons and the freshest of pearl coloured gloves this amazing woman was in the arms of her dearest Lady Hawbuck Dearest Lady Hawbuck how good of you Always among my flowers can t live away from them Sweets to the sweet hum a ha haw says Sir John Hawbuck who piques himself on his gallantry and says nothing without a hum a ha a haw Whereth yaw pinnafaw cries Master Hugh WE thaw you in it over the wall didn t we Pa Hum a ha a haw burst out Sir John dreadfully alarmed Where s Ponto Why wasn t he at Quarter Sessions How are his birds this year missus Ponto have those Carabas pheasants done any harm to your wheat a hum a ha a haw and all this while he was making the most ferocious and desperate signals to his youthful heir Well she WATH in her pinnafaw wathn t she Ma says Hugh quite unabashed which question Lady Hawbuck turned away with a sudden query regarding her dear darling daughters and the ENFANT TERRIBLE was removed by his father I hope you weren t disturbed by the music Ponto says My girls you know practise four hours a day you know must do it you know absolutely necessary As for me you know I m an early man and in my farm every morning at five no no laziness for ME The facts are these Ponto goes to sleep directly after dinner on entering the drawing room and wakes up when the ladies leave off practice at ten From seven till ten from ten till five is a very fair allowance of slumber for a man who says he s NOT a lazy man It is my private opinion that when Ponto retires to what is called his Study he sleeps too He locks himself up there daily two hours with the newspaper I saw the HAWBUCK scene out of the Study which commands the garden It s a curious object that Study Ponto s library mostly consists of boots He and Stripes have important interviews here of mornings when the potatoes are discussed or the fate of the calf ordained or sentence passed on the pig c All the Major s bills are docketed on the Study table and displayed like a lawyer s briefs Here too lie displayed his hooks knives and other gardening irons his whistles and strings of spare buttons He has a drawer of endless brown paper for parcels and another containing a prodigious and never failing supply of string What a man can want with so many gig whips I can never conceive These and fishing rods and landing nets and spurs and boot trees and balls for horses and surgical implements for the same and favourite pots of shiny blacking with which he paints his own shoes in the most elegant manner and buckskin gloves stretched out on their trees and his gorget sash and sabre of the Horse Marines with his boot hooks underneath in atrophy and the family medicine chest and in a corner the very rod with which he used to whip his son Wellesley Ponto when a boy Wellesley never entered the Study but for that awful purpose all these with Mogg s Road Book the GARDENERS CHRONICLE and a backgammon board form the Major s library Under the trophy there s a picture of missus Ponto in a light blue dress and train and no waist when she was first married a fox s brush lies over the frame and serves to keep the dust off that work of art My library s small says Ponto with the most amazing impudence but well selected my boy well selected I have been reading the History of England all the morning CHAPTER XXVII A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS We had the fish which as the kind reader may remember I had brought down in a delicate attention to missus Ponto to variegate the repast of next day and cod and oyster sauce twice laid salt cod and scolloped oysters formed parts of the bill of fare until I began to fancy that the Ponto family like our late revered monarch George II had a fancy for stale fish And about this time the pig being consumed we began upon a sheep But how shall I forget the solemn splendour of a second course which was served up in great state by Stripes in a silver dish and cove a napkin round his dirty thumbs and consisted of a landrail not much bigger than a corpulent sparrow My love will you take any game says Ponto with prodigious gravity and stuck his fork into that little mouthful of an island in the silver sea Stripes too at intervals dribbled out the Marsala with a solemnity which would have done honour to a Duke s butler The Bamnecide s dinner to Shacabac was only one degree removed from these solemn banquets As there were plenty of pretty country places close by a comfortable country town with good houses of gentlefolks a beautiful old parsonage close to the church whither we went and where the Carabas family have their ancestral carved and monumented Gothic pew and every appearance of good society in the neighbourhood I rather wondered we were not enlivened by the appearance of some of the neighbours at the Evergreens and asked about them We can t in our position of life we can t well associate with the attorney s family as I leave you to suppose says missus Ponto confidentially Of course not I answered though I didn t know why And the Doctor said I A most excellent worthy creature says missus P saved Maria s life really a learned man but what can one do in one s position One may ask one s medical man to one s table certainly but his family my dear mister Snob Half a dozen little gallipots interposed Miss Wirt the governess he he he and the young ladies laughed in chorus We only live with the county families Miss Wirt one continued tossing up her head The Duke is abroad we are at feud with the Carabases the Ringwoods don t come down till Christmas in fact nobody s here till the hunting season positively nobody Whose is the large red house just outside of the town What the CHATEAU CALICOT he he he That purse proud ex linendraper mister Yardley with the yellow liveries and the wife in red velvet How CAN you my dear mister Snob be so satirical The impertinence of those people is really something quite overwhelming Well then there is the parson Doctor Chrysostom He s a gentleman at any rate At this missus Ponto looked at Miss Wirt After their eyes had met and they had wagged their heads at each other They looked up to the ceiling So did the young ladies They thrilled It was evident I had said something terrible Another black sheep in the Church thought I with a little sorrow for I don t care to own that I have a respect for the cloth I hope there s nothing wrong Wrong says missus P clasping her hands with a tragic air Oh says Miss Wirt and the two girls gasping in chorus Well says I I m very sorry for it I never saw a nicer looking old gentleman or a better school or heard a better sermon He used to preach those sermons in a surplice hissed out missus Ponto He s a Puseyite mister Snob Heavenly powers says I admiring the pure ardour of these female theologians and Stripes came in with the tea It s so weak that no wonder Ponto s sleep isn t disturbed by it Of mornings we used to go out shooting We had Ponto s own fields to sport over where we got the landrail and the non preserved part of the Hawbuck property and one evening in a stubble of Ponto s skirting the Carabas woods we got among some pheasants and had some real sport I shot a hen I know greatly to my delight Bag it says Ponto in rather a hurried manner here s somebody coming So I pocketed the bird You infernal poaching thieves roars out a man from the hedge in the garb of a gamekeeper I wish I could catch you on this side of the hedge I d put a brace of barrels into you that I would Curse that Snapper says Ponto moving off he s always watching me like a spy Carry off the birds you sneaks and sell em in London roars the individual who it appears was a keeper of Lord Carabas You ll get six shillings a brace for em YOU know the price of em well enough and so does your master too you scoundrel says Ponto still retreating We kill em on our ground cries mister Snapper WE don t set traps for other people s birds We re no decoy ducks We re no sneaking poachers We don t shoot ens like that ere Cockney who s got the tail of one a sticking out of his pocket Only just come across the hedge that s all I tell you what says Stripes who was out with us as keeper this day in fact he s keeper coachman gardener valet and bailiff with Tummus under him if YOU LL come across John Snapper and take your coat off I ll give you such a whopping as you ve never had since the last time I did it at Guttlebury Fair Whop one of your own weight mister Snapper said whistling his dogs and disappearing into the wood And so we came out of this controversy rather victoriously but I began to alter my preconceived ideas of rural felicity Notes one I have since heard that this aristocratic lady s father was a livery button maker in saint Martin s Lane where he met with misfortunes and his daughter acquired her taste for heraldry But it may be told to her credit that out of her earnings she has kept the bed ridden old bankrupt in great comfort and secrecy at Pentonville and furnished her brother s outfit for the Cadetship which her patron Lord Swigglebiggle gave her when he was at the Board of Control I have this information from a friend To hear Miss Wirt herself you would fancy that her Papa was a Rothschild and that the markets of Europe were convulsed when he went into the GAZETTE CHAPTER XXVIII ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Be hanged to your aristocrats Ponto said in some conversation we had regarding the family at Carabas between whom and the Evergreens there was a feud When I first came into the county it was the year before Sir John Buff contested in the Blue interest the Marquis then Lord saint Michaels who of course was Orange to the core paid me and missus Ponto such attentions that I fairly confess I was taken in by the old humbug and thought that I d met with a rare neighbour Gad Sir we used to get pines from Carabas and pheasants from Carabas and it was Ponto when will you come over and shoot and Ponto our pheasants want thinning and my Lady would insist upon her dear missus Ponto coming over to Carabas to sleep and put me I don t know to what expense for turbans and velvet gowns for my wife s toilette Well Sir the election takes place and though I was always a Liberal personal friendship of course induces me to plump for saint Michaels who comes in at the head of the poll Next year missus P insists upon going to town with lodgings in Clarges Street at ten pounds a week with a hired brougham and new dresses for herself and the girls and the deuce and all to pay Our first cards were to Carabas House my Lady s are returned by a great big flunkey and I leave you to fancy my poor Betsy s discomfiture as the lodging house maid took in the cards and Lady saint Michaels drives away though she actually saw us at the drawing room window Would you believe it Sir that though we called four times afterwards those infernal aristocrats never returned our visit that though Lady saint Michaels gave nine dinner parties and four DEJEUNERS that season she never asked us to one and that she cut us dead at the Opera though Betsy was nodding to her the whole night We wrote to her for tickets for Almack s she writes to say that all hers were promised and said in the presence of Wiggins her lady s maid who told it to Diggs my wife s woman that she couldn t conceive how people in our station of life could so far forget themselves as to wish to appear in any such place Go to Castle Carabas I d sooner die than set my foot in the house of that impertinent insolvent insolent jackanapes and I hold him in scorn After this Ponto gave me some private information regarding Lord Carabas s pecuniary affairs how he owed money all over the county how Jukes the carpenter was utterly ruined and couldn t get a shilling of his bill how Biggs the butcher hanged himself for the same reason how the six big footmen never received a guinea of wages and Snaffle the state coachman actually took off his blown glass wig of ceremony and flung it at Lady Carabas s feet on the terrace before the Castle all which stories as they are private I do not think proper to divulge But these details did not stifle my desire to see the famous mansion of Castle Carabas nay possibly excited my interest to know more about that lordly house and its owners At the entrance of the park there are a pair of great gaunt mildewed lodges mouldy Doric temples with black chimney pots in the finest classic taste and the gates of course are surmounted by the CHATS BOTTES the well known supporters of the Carabas family Give the lodge keeper a shilling says Ponto who drove me near to it in his four wheeled cruelty chaise I warrant it s the first piece of ready money he has received for some time I don t know whether there was any foundation for this sneer but the gratuity was received with a curtsey and the gate opened for me to enter Poor old porteress says I inwardly You little know that it is the Historian of Snobs whom you let in The gates were passed A damp green stretch of park spread right and left immeasurably confined by a chilly grey wall and a damp long straight road between two huge rows of moist dismal lime trees leads up to the Castle In the midst of the park is a great black tank or lake bristling over with rushes and here and there covered over with patches of pea soup A shabby temple rises on an island in this delectable lake which is approached by a rotten barge that lies at roost in a dilapidated boat house Clumps of elms and oaks dot over the huge green flat Every one of them would have been down long since but that the Marquis is not allowed to cut the timber Up that long avenue the Snobographer walked in solitude At the seventy ninth tree on the left hand side the insolvent butcher hanged himself I scarcely wondered at the dismal deed so woful and sad were the impressions connected with the place So for a mile and a half I walked alone and thinking of death I forgot to say the house is in full view all the way except when intercepted by the trees on the miserable island in the lake an enormous red brick mansion square vast and dingy It is flanked by four stone towers with weathercocks In the midst of the grand facade is a huge Ionic portico approached by a vast lonely ghastly staircase Rows of black windows framed in stone stretch on either side right and left three storeys and eighteen windows of a row You may see a picture of the palace and staircase in the Views of England and Wales with four carved and gilt carriages waiting at the gravel walk and several parties of ladies and gentlemen in wigs and hoops dotting the fatiguing lines of stairs But these stairs are made in great houses for people NOT to ascend The first Lady Carabas they are but eighty years in the peerage if she got out of her gilt coach in a shower would be wet to the skin before she got half way to the carved Ionic portico where four dreary statues of Peace Plenty Piety and Patriotism are the only sentinels You enter these palaces by back doors That was the way the Carabases got their peerage the misanthropic Ponto said after dinner Well I rang the bell at a little low side door it clanged and jingled and echoed for a long long while till at length a face as of a housekeeper peered through the door and as she saw my hand in my waistcoat pocket opened it Unhappy lonely housekeeper I thought Is Miss Crusoe in her island more solitary The door clapped to and I was in Castle Carabas The side entrance and All says the housekeeper The halligator hover the mantelpiece was brought home by Hadmiral saint Michaels when a Capting with Lord Hanson The harms on the cheers is the harms of the Carabas family The hall was rather comfortable We went clapping up a clean stone backstair and then into a back passage cheerfully decorated with ragged light green Kidderminster and issued upon THE GREAT ALL The great all is seventy two feet in lenth fifty six in breath and thirty eight feet igh The carvings of the chimlies representing the birth of Venus and Ercules and Eyelash is by Van Chislum the most famous sculpture of his hage and country The ceiling by Calimanco represents Painting Harchitecture and Music the naked female figure with the barrel horgan introducing George fust Lord Carabas to the Temple of the Muses The winder ornaments is by Vanderputty The floor is Patagonian marble and the chandelier in the centre was presented to Lionel second Marquis by Lewy the Sixteenth whose ead was cut hoff in the French Revelation We now henter THE SOUTH GALLERY One undred and forty eight in

drinking Van Ginnums Jupiter and Europia de Horn The Grandjunction Canal Venis by Candleetty and Italian Bandix by Slavata Rosa And so this worthy woman went on from one room into another from the blue room to the green and the green to the grand saloon and the grand saloon to the tapestry closet cackling her list of pictures and wonders and furtively turning up a corner of brown holland to show the colour of the old faded seedy mouldy dismal hangings At last we came to her Ladyship s bed room In the centre of this dreary apartment there is a bed about the size of one of those whizgig temples in which the Genius appears in a pantomime The huge gilt edifice is approached by steps and so tall that it might be let off in floors for sleeping rooms for all the Carabas family An awful bed A murder might be done at one end of that bed and people sleeping at the other end be ignorant of it Gracious powers fancy little Lord Carabas in a nightcap ascending those steps after putting out the candle The sight of that seedy and solitary splendour was too much for me I should go mad were I that lonely housekeeper in those enormous galleries in that lonely library filled up with ghastly folios that nobody dares read with an inkstand on the centre table like the coffin of a baby and sad portraits staring at you from the bleak walls with their solemn Mouldy eyes No wonder that Carabas does not come down here often It would require two thousand footmen to make the place cheerful No wonder the coachman resigned his wig that the masters are insolvent and the servants perish in this huge dreary out at elbow place A single family has no more right to build itself a temple of that sort than to erect a Tower of Babel Such a habitation is not decent for a mere mortal man But after all I suppose poor Carabas had no choice Fate put him there as it sent Napoleon to saint Helena Suppose it had been decreed by Nature that you and I should be Marquises We wouldn t refuse I suppose but take Castle Carabas and all with debts duns and mean makeshifts and shabby pride and swindling magnificence Next season when I read of Lady Carabas s splendid entertainments in the MORNING POST and see the poor old insolvent cantering through the Park I shall have a much tenderer interest in these great people than I have had heretofore Poor old shabby Snob Ride on and fancy the world is still on its knees before the house of Carabas Give yourself airs poor old bankrupt Magnifico who are under money obligations to your flunkeys and must stoop so as to swindle poor tradesmen And for us O my brother Snobs oughtn t we to feel happy if our walk through life is more even and that we are out of the reach of that surprising arrogance and that astounding meanness to which this wretched old victim is obliged to mount and descend CHAPTER XXIX A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Notable as my reception had been under that unfortunate mistake of missus Ponto that I was related to Lord Snobbington which I was not permitted to correct it was nothing compared to the bowing and kotooing the raptures and flurry which preceded and welcomed the visit of a real live lord and lord s son a brother officer of Cornet Wellesley Ponto in the one hundred and twentieth Hussars who came over with the young Cornet from Guttlebury where their distinguished regiment was quartered This was my Lord Gules Lord Saltire s grandson and heir a very young short sandy haired and tobacco smoking nobleman who cannot have left the nursery very long and who though he accepted the honest Major s invitation to the Evergreens in a letter written in a school boy handwriting with a number of faults of spelling may yet be a very fine classical scholar for what I know having had his education at Eton where he and young Ponto were inseparable At any rate if he can t write he has mastered a number of other accomplishments wonderful for one of his age and size He is one of the best shots and riders in England He rode his horse Abracadabra and won the famous Guttlebury steeple chase He has horses entered at half the races in the country under other people s names for the old lord is a strict hand and will not hear of betting or gambling He has lost and won such sums of money as my Lord George himself might be proud of He knows all the stables and all the jockeys and has all the information and is a match for the best Leg at Newmarket Nobody was ever known to be too much for him at play or in the stable Although his grandfather makes him a moderate allowance by the aid of POST OBITS and convenient friends he can live in a splendour becoming his rank He has not distinguished himself in the knocking down of policemen much he is not big enough for that But as a light weight his skill is of the very highest order At billiards he is said to be first rate He drinks and smokes as much as any two of the biggest officers in his regiment With such high talents who can say how far he may not go He may take to politics as a DELASSEMENT and be Prime Minister after Lord George Bentinck My young friend Wellesley Ponto is a gaunt and bony youth with a pale face profusely blotched From his continually pulling something on his chin I am led to fancy that he believes he has what is called an Imperial growing there That is not the only tuft that is hunted in the family by the way He can t of course indulge in those expensive amusements which render his aristocratic comrade so respected he bets pretty freely when he is in cash and rides when somebody mounts him for he can t afford more than his regulation chargers At drinking he is by no means inferior and why do you think he brought his noble friend Lord Gules to the Evergreens Why because he intended to ask his mother to order his father to pay his debts which she couldn t refuse before such an exalted presence Young Ponto gave me all this information with the most engaging frankness We are old friends I used to tip him when he was at school Gad says he our wedgment s so DOOTHID exthpenthif Must hunt you know A man couldn t live in the wedgment if he didn t Mess expenses enawmuth Must dine at mess Must drink champagne and claret Ours ain t a port and sherry light infantry mess Uniform s awful Fitzstultz our Colonel will have em so Must be a distinction you know At his own expense Fitzstultz altered the plumes in the men s caps you called them shaving brushes Snob my boy most absurd and unjust that attack of yours by the way that altewation alone cotht him five hundred pound The year befaw latht he horthed the wegiment at an immenthe expenthe and we re called the Queen th Own Pyebalds from that day Ever theen uth on pawade The Empewar Nicolath burtht into tearth of envy when he thaw uth at Windthor And you see continued my young friend I brought Gules down with me as the Governor is very sulky about shelling out just to talk my mother over who can do anything with him Gules told her that I was Fitzstultz s favourite of the whole regiment and Gad she thinks the Horse Guards will give me my troop for nothing and he humbugged the Governor that I was the greatest screw in the army Ain t it a good dodge With this Wellesley left me to go and smoke a cigar in the stables with Lord Gules and make merry over the cattle there under Stripes s superintendence Young Ponto laughed with his friend at the venerable four wheeled cruelty chaise but seemed amazed that the latter should ridicule still more an ancient chariot of the build of eighteen twenty four emblazoned immensely with the arme of the Pontos and the Snaileys from which latter distinguished family missus Ponto issued I found poor Pon in his study among his boots in such a rueful attitude of despondency that I could not but remark it Look at that says the poor fellow handing me over a document It s the second change in uniform since he s been in the army and yet there s no extravagance about the lad Lord Gules tells me he is the most careful youngster in the regiment God bless him But look at that by heaven Snob look at that and say how can a man of nine hundred keep out of the Bench He gave a sob as he handed me the paper across the table and his old face and his old corduroys and his shrunk shooting jacket and his lean shanks looked as he spoke more miserably haggard bankrupt and threadbare LIEUT WELLESLEY

servants waited at dinner and how the Ladies Schneider dressed and what his Royal Highness said when he came down to shoot and who was there What a blessing that boy is to me said she as my pimple faced young friend moved off to resume smoking operations with Gules in the now vacant kitchen and poor Ponto s dreary and desperate look shall I ever forget that O you parents and guardians O you men and women of sense in England O you legislators about to assemble in Parliament read over that tailor s bill above printed read over that absurd catalogue of insane gimcracks and madman s tomfoolery and say how are you ever to get rid of Snobbishness when society does so much for its education Three hundred and forty pounds for a young chap s saddle and breeches Before George I would rather be a Hottentot or a Highlander We laugh at poor Jocko the monkey dancing in uniform or at poor Jeames the flunkey with his quivering calves and plush tights or at the nigger Marquis of Marmalade dressed out with sabre and epaulets and giving himself the airs of a field marshal Lo is not one of the Queen s Pyebalds in full fig as great and foolish a monster CHAPTER XXX ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS At last came that fortunate day at the Evergreens when I was to be made acquainted with some of the county families with whom only people of Ponto s rank condescended to associate And now although poor Ponto had just been so cruelly made to bleed on occasion of his son s new uniform and though he was in the direst and most cut throat spirits with an overdrawn account at the banker s and other pressing evils of poverty although a tenpenny bottle of Marsala and an awful parsimony presided generally at his table yet the poor fellow was obliged to assume the most frank and jovial air of cordiality and all the covers being removed from the hangings and new dresses being procured for the young ladies and the family plate being unlocked and displayed the house and all within assumed a benevolent and festive appearance The kitchen fires began to blaze the good wine ascended from the cellar a professed cook actually came over from Guttlebury to compile culinary abominations Stripes was in a new coat and so was Ponto for a wonder and Tummus s button suit was worn EN PERMANENCE And all this to show off the little lord thinks I All this in honour of a stupid little cigarrified Cornet of dragoons who can barely write his name while an eminent and profound moralist like somebody is fobbed off with cold mutton and relays of pig Well well a martyrdom of cold mutton is just bearable I pardon missus Ponto from my heart I do especially as I wouldn t turn out of the best bed room in spite of all her hints but held my ground in the chintz tester vowing that Lord Gules as a young man was quite small and hardy enough to make himself comfortable elsewhere The great Ponto party was a very august one The Hawbucks came in their family coach with the blood red band emblazoned all over it and their man in yellow livery waited in country fashion at table only to be exceeded in splendour by the Hipsleys the opposition baronet in light blue The old Ladies Fitzague drove over in their little old chariot with the fat black horses the fat coachman the fat footman why are dowagers horses and footmen always fat And soon after these personages had arrived with their auburn fronts and red beaks and turbans came the Honourable and Reverend Lionel Pettipois who with General and missus Sago formed the rest of the party Lord and Lady Frederick Howlet were asked but they have friends at Ivybush missus Ponto told me and that very morning the Castlehaggards sent an excuse as her ladyship had a return of the quinsy Between ourselves Lady Castlehaggard s quinsy always comes on when there is dinner at the Evergreens If the keeping of polite company could make a woman happy surely my kind hostess missus Ponto was on that day a happy woman Every person present except the unlucky impostor who pretended to a connexion with the Snobbington Family and General Sago who had brought home I don t know how many lacs of rupees from India was related to the Peerage or the Baronetage missus P had her heart s desire If she had been an Earl s daughter herself could she have expected better company and her family were in the oil trade at Bristol as all her friends very well know What I complained of in my heart was not the dining which for this once was plentiful and comfortable enough but the prodigious dulness of the talking part of the entertainment O my beloved brother Snobs of the City if we love each other no better than our country brethren at least we amuse each other more if we bore ourselves we are not called upon to go ten miles to do it For instance the Hipsleys came ten miles from the south and the Hawbucks ten miles from the north of the Evergreens and were magnates in two different divisions of the county of Mangelwurzelshire Hipsley who is an old baronet with a bothered estate did not care to show his contempt for Hawbuck who is a new creation and rich Hawbuck on his part gives himself patronizing airs to General Sago who looks upon the Pontos as little better than paupers Old Lady Blanche says Ponto I hope will leave something to her god daughter my second girl we ve all of us half poisoned ourselves with taking her physic Lady Blanche and Lady Rose Fitzague have the first a medical and the second a literary turn I am inclined to believe the former had a wet COMPRESSE around her body on the occasion when I had the happiness of meeting her She doctors everybody in the neighbourhood of which she is the ornament and has tried everything on her own person She went into Court and testified publicly her faith in saint John Long she swore by Doctor Buchan she took quantities of Gambouge s Universal Medicine and whole boxfuls of Parr s Life Pills She has cured a multiplicity of headaches by Squinstone s Eye snuff she wears a picture of Hahnemann in her bracelet and a lock of Priessnitz s hair in a brooch She talked about her own complaints and those of her CONFIDANTE for the time being to every lady in the room successively from our hostess down to Miss Wirt taking them into corners and whispering about bronchitis hepatitis saint Vitus neuralgia cephalalgia and so forth I observed poor fat Lady Hawbuck in a dreadful alarm after some communication regarding the state of her daughter Miss Lucy Hawbuck s health and missus Sago turned quite yellow and put down her third glass of Madeira at a warning glance from Lady Blanche Lady Rose talked literature and about the book club at Guttlebury and is very strong in voyages and travels She has a prodigious interest in Borneo and displayed a knowledge of the history of the Punjaub and Kaffirland that does credit to her memory Old General Sago who sat perfectly silent and plethoric roused up as from a lethargy when the former country was mentioned and gave the company his story about a hog hunt at Ramjugger I observed her ladyship treated with something like contempt her neighbour the Reverend Lionel Pettipois a young divine whom you may track through the country by little awakening books at half a crown a hundred which dribble out of his pockets wherever he goes I saw him give Miss Wirt a sheaf of The Little Washer woman on Putney Common and to Miss Hawbuck a couple of dozen of Meat in the Tray or the Young Butcher boy Rescued and on paying a visit to Guttlebury gaol I saw two notorious fellows waiting their trial there and temporarily occupied with a game of cribbage to whom his Reverence offered a tract as he was walking over Crackshins Common and who robbed him of his purse umbrella and cambric handkerchief leaving him the tracts to distribute elsewhere CHAPTER XXXI A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS Why dear mister Snob said a young lady of rank and fashion to whom I present my best compliments if you found everything so SNOBBISH at the Evergreens if the pig bored you and the mutton was not to your liking and missus Ponto was a humbug and Miss Wirt a nuisance with her abominable piano practice why did you stay so long Ah Miss what a question Have you never heard of gallant British soldiers storming batteries of doctors passing nights in plague wards of lazarettos and other instances of martyrdom What do you suppose induced gentlemen to walk two miles up to the batteries of Sabroan with a hundred and fifty thundering guns bowling them down by hundreds not pleasure surely What causes your respected father to quit his comfortable home for his chambers after dinner and pore over the most dreary law papers until long past midnight Mademoiselle duty which must be done alike by military or legal or literary gents There s a power of martyrdom in our profession You won t believe it Your rosy lips assume a smile of incredulity a most naughty and odious expression in a young lady s face Well then the fact is that my chambers No twenty four Pump Court Temple were being painted by the Honourable Society and missus Slamkin my laundress having occasion to go into Durham to see her daughter who is married and has presented her with the sweetest little grandson a few weeks could not be better spent than in rusticating But ah how delightful Pump Court looked when I revisited its well known chimney pots CARI LUOGHI Welcome welcome O fog and smut But if you think there is no moral in the foregoing account of the Pontine family you are Madam most painfully mistaken In this very chapter we are going to have the moral why the whole of the papers are nothing BUT the moral setting forth as they do the folly of being a Snob You will remark that in the Country Snobography my poor friend Ponto has been held up almost exclusively for the public gaze and why Because we went to no other house Because other families did not welcome us to their mahogany No no Sir John Hawbuck of the Haws Sir John Hipsley of Briary Hall don t shut the gates of hospitality of General Sago s mulligatawny I could speak from experience And the two old ladies at Guttlebury were they nothing Do you suppose that an agreeable young dog who shall be nameless would not be made welcome Don t you know that people are too glad to see ANYBODY in the country But those dignified personages do not enter into the scheme of the present work and are but minor characters of our Snob drama just as in the play kings and emperors are not half so important as many humble persons The DOGE OF VENICE for instance gives way to OTHELLO who is but a nigger and the KING OF FRANCE to FALCONBRIDGE who is a gentleman of positively no birth at all So with the exalted characters above mentioned I perfectly well recollect that the claret at Hawbuck s was not by any means so good as that of Hipsley s while on the contrary some white hermitage at the Haws by the way the butler only gave me half a glass each time was supernacular And I remember the conversations O Madam Madam how stupid they were The subsoil ploughing the pheasants and poaching the row about the representation of the county the Earl of Mangelwurzelshire being at variance with his relative and nominee the Honourable Marmaduke Tomnoddy all these I could put down had I a mind to violate the confidence of private life and a great deal of conversation about the weather the Mangelwurzelshire Hunt new manures and eating and drinking of course But CUI BONO In these perfectly stupid and honourable families there is not that Snobbishness which it is our purpose to expose An ox is an ox a great hulking fat sided bellowing munching Beef He ruminates according to his nature and consumes his destined portion of turnips or oilcake until the time comes for his disappearance from the pastures to be succeeded by other deep lunged and fat ribbed animals Perhaps we do not respect an ox We rather acquiesce in him The Snob my dear Madam is the Frog that tries to swell himself to ox size Let us pelt the silly brute out of his folly Look I pray you at the case of my unfortunate friend Ponto a good natured kindly English gentleman not over wise but quite passable fond of port wine of his family of country sports and agriculture hospitably minded with as pretty a little patrimonial country house as heart can desire and a thousand pounds a year It is not much but ENTRE NOUS people can live for less and not uncomfortably For instance there is the doctor whom missus P does not condescend to visit that man educates a mirific family and is loved by the poor for miles round and gives them port wine for physic and medicine gratis And how those people can get on with their pittance as missus Ponto says is a wonder to HER Again there is the clergyman Doctor Chrysostom missus P says they quarrelled about Puseyism but I am given to understand it was because missus C had the PAS of her at the Haws you may see what the value of his living is any day in the Clerical Guide but you don t know what he gives away Even Pettipois allows that in whose eyes the Doctor s surplice is a scarlet abomination and so does Pettipois do his duty in his way and administer not only his tracts and his talk but his money and his means to his people As a lord s son by the way missus Ponto is uncommonly anxious that he should marry EITHER of the girls whom Lord Gules does not intend to choose Well although Pon s income would make up almost as much as that of these three worthies put together oh my dear Madam see in what hopeless penury the poor fellow lives What tenant can look to HIS forbearance What poor man can hope for HIS charity Master s the best of men honest Stripes says and when we was in the ridgment a more free handed chap didn t live But the way in which Missus DU scryou I wonder the young ladies is alive that I du They live upon a fine governess and fine masters and have clothes made by Lady Carabas s own milliner and their brother rides with earls to cover and only the best people in the county visit at the Evergreens and missus Ponto thinks herself a paragon of wives and mothers and a wonder of the world for doing all this misery and humbug and snobbishness on a thousand a year What an inexpressible comfort it was my dear Madam when Stripes put my portmanteau in the four wheeled chaise and poor P on being touched with sciatica drove me over to Carabas Arms at Guttlebury where we took leave There were some bagmen there in the Commercial Room and one talked about the house he represented and another about his dinner and a third about the Inns on the road and so forth a talk not very wise but honest and to the purpose about as good as that of the country gentlemen and oh how much pleasanter than listening to Miss Wirt s show pieces on the piano and missus Ponto s genteel cackle about the fashion and the county families CHAPTER XXXII SNOBBIUM GATHERUM WHEN I see the great effect which these papers are producing on an intelligent public I have a strong hope that before long we shall have a regular Snob department in the newspapers just as we have the Police Courts and the Court News at present When a flagrant case of bone crushing or Poor law abuse occurs in the world who so eloquent as THE TIMES to point it out When a gross instance of Snobbishness happens why should not the indignant journalist call the public attention to that delinquency too How for instance could that wonderful case of the Earl of Mangelwurzel and his brother be examined in the Snobbish point of view Let alone the hectoring the bullying the vapouring the bad grammar the mutual recriminations lie givings challenges retractations which abound in the fraternal dispute put out of the question these points as concerning the individual nobleman and his relative with whose personal affairs we have nothing to do and consider how intimately corrupt how habitually grovelling and mean how entirely Snobbish in a word a whole county must be which can find no better chiefs or leaders than these two gentlemen We don t want the great county of Mangelwurzelshire seems to say that a man should be able to write good grammar or that he should keep a Christian tongue in his head or that he should have the commonest decency of temper or even a fair share of good sense in order to represent us in Parliament All we require is that a man should be recommended to us by the Earl of Mangelwurzelshire And all that we require of the Earl of Mangelwurzelshire is that he should have fifty thousand a year and hunt the country O you pride of all Snobland O you crawling truckling self confessed lackeys and parasites But this is growing too savage don t let us forget our usual amenity and that tone of playfulness and sentiment with which the beloved reader and writer have pursued their mutual reflections hitherto Well Snobbishness pervades the little Social Farce as well as the great State Comedy and the self same moral is tacked to either There was for instance an account in the papers of a young lady who misled by a fortune teller actually went part of the way to India as far as Bagnigge Wells I think in search of a husband who was promised her there Do you suppose this poor deluded little soul would have left her shop for a man below her in rank or for anything but a darling of a Captain in epaulets and a red coat It was her Snobbish sentiment that misled her and made her vanities a prey to the swindling fortune teller Case two was that of Mademoiselle de Saugrenue the interesting young Frenchwoman with a profusion of jetty ringlets who lived for nothing at a boardinghouse at Gosport was then conveyed to Fareham gratis and being there and lying on the bed of the good old lady her entertainer the dear girl took occasion to rip open the mattress and steal a cash box with which she fled to London How would you account for the prodigious benevolence exercised towards the interesting young French lady Was it her jetty ringlets or her charming face Bah Do ladies love others for having faces and black hair she said SHE WAS A RELATION OF de Saugrenue talked of her ladyship her aunt and of herself as a De Saugrenue The honest boarding house people were at her feet at once Good honest simple lord loving children of Snobland Finally there was the case of the Right Honourable mister Vernon at York The Right Honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady He procured from her dinners money wearing apparel spoons implicit credence and an entire refit of linen Then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of whom he proposed to marry The father lent him money the mother made jams and pickles for him the daughters vied with each other in cooking dinners for the Right Honourable and what was the end One day the traitor fled with a teapot and a basketful of cold victuals It was the Right Honourable which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy simple Snobs Would they have been taken in by a commoner What old lady is there my dear sir who would take in you and me were we ever so ill to do and comfort us and clothe us and give us her money and her silver forks Alas and alas what mortal man that speaks the truth can hope for such a landlady And yet all these instances of fond and credulous Snobbishness have occurred in the same week s paper with who knows how many score more Just as we had concluded the above remarks comes a pretty little note sealed with a pretty little butterfly bearing a northern postmark and to the following effect nineteenth November mister Punch Taking great interest in your Snob Papers we are very anxious to know under what class of that respectable fraternity you would designate us We are three sisters from seventeen to twenty two Our father is HONESTLY AND TRULY of a very good family you will say it is Snobbish to mention that but I wish to state the plain fact our maternal grandfather was an Earl one We CAN afford to take in a stamped edition of YOU and all Dickens works as fast as they come out but we do NOT keep such a thing as a PEERAGE or even a BARONETAGE in the house We live with every comfort excellent cellar c c but as we cannot well afford a butler we have a neat table maid though our father was a military man has travelled much been in the best society c We HAVE a coachman and helper but we don t put the latter into buttons nor make them wait at table like Stripes and Tummus two We are just the same to persons with a handle to their name as to those without it We wear a moderate modicum of crinoline three and are never limp four in the morning We have good and abundant dinners on CHINA though we have plate five and just as good when alone as with company Now my dear mister PUNCH will you PLEASE give us a short answer in your next number and I will be SO much obliged to you Nobody knows we are writing to you not even our father nor will we ever tease six you again

disposition and entertain a lingering hope At all events I shall be impatient for next Sunday for you reach us on that day and I am ashamed to confess we CANNOT resist opening you in the carriage

little good natured things no that is I hope not I think not I won t be too confident none of us should be that we are not Snobs That very confidence savours of arrogance and to be arrogant is to be a Snob In all the social gradations from sneak to tyrant nature has placed a most wondrous and various progeny of Snobs But are there no kindly natures no tender hearts no souls humble simple and truth loving Ponder well on this question sweet young ladies And if you can answer it as no doubt you can lucky are you and lucky the respected Herr Papa and lucky the three handsome young gentlemen who are

Gordon and Exeter Hall say to this eight Dear little enthusiast nine You were never more mistaken miss in your life CHAPTER XXXIII SNOBS AND MARRIAGE Everybody of the middle rank who walks through this life with a sympathy for his companions on the same journey at any rate every man who has been jostling in the world for some three or four lustres must make no end of melancholy reflections upon the fate of those victims whom Society that is Snobbishness is immolating every day With love and simplicity and natural kindness Snobbishness is perpetually at war People dare not be happy for fear of Snobs People dare not love for fear of Snobs People pine away lonely under the tyranny of Snobs Honest kindly hearts dry up and die Gallant generous lads blooming with hearty youth swell into bloated old bachelorhood and burst and tumble over Tender girls wither into shrunken decay and perish solitary from whom Snobbishness has cut off the common claim to happiness and affection with which Nature endowed us all My heart grows sad as I see the blundering tyrant s handiwork As I behold it I swell with cheap rage and glow with fury against the Snob Come down I say thou skulking dulness Come down thou stupid bully and give up thy brutal ghost And I arm myself with the sword and spear and taking leave of my family go forth to do battle with that hideous ogre and giant that brutal despot in Snob Castle who holds so many gentle hearts in torture and thrall When PUNCH is king I declare there shall be no such thing as old maids and old bachelors The Reverend mister Malthus shall be burned annually instead of Guy Fawkes Those who don t marry shall go into the workhouse It shall be a sin for the poorest not to have a pretty girl to love him The above reflections came to mind after taking a walk with an old comrade Jack Spiggot by name who is just passing into the state of old bachelorhood after the manly and blooming youth in which I remember him Jack was one of the handsomest fellows in England when we entered together in the Highland Buffs but I quitted the Cuttykilts early and lost sight of him for many years Ah how changed he is from those days He wears a waistband now and has begun to dye his whiskers His cheeks which were red are now mottled his eyes once so bright and steadfast are the colour of peeled plovers eggs Are you married Jack says I remembering how consumedly in love he was with his cousin Letty Lovelace when the Cuttykilts were quartered at Strathbungo some twenty years ago Married no says he Not money enough Hard enough to keep myself much more a family on five hundred a year Come to Dickinson s there s some of the best Madeira in London there my boy So we went and talked over old times The bill for dinner and wine consumed was prodigious and the quantity of brandy and water that Jack took showed what a regular boozer he was A guinea or two guineas What the devil do I care what I spend for my dinner says he And Letty Lovelace says I Jack s countenance fell However he burst into a loud laugh presently Letty Lovelace says he She s Letty Lovelace still but Gad such a wizened old woman She s as thin as a thread paper you remember what a figure she had her nose has got red and her teeth blue She s always ill always quarrelling with the rest of the family always psalm singing and always taking pills Gad I had a rare escape THERE Push round the grog old boy Straightway memory went back to the days when Letty was the loveliest of blooming young creatures when to hear her sing was to make the heart jump into your throat when to see her dance was better than Montessu or Noblet they were the Ballet Queens of those days when Jack used to wear a locket of her hair with a little gold chain round his neck and exhilarated with toddy after a sederunt of the Cuttykilt mess used to pull out this token and kiss it and howl about it to the great amusement of the bottle nosed old Major and the rest of the table My father and hers couldn t put their horses together Jack said The General wouldn t come down with more than six thousand My governor said it shouldn t be done under eight Lovelace told him to go and be hanged and so we parted company They said she was in a decline Gammon She s forty and as tough and as sour as this bit of lemon peel Don t put much into your punch Snob my boy No man CAN stand punch after wine And what are your pursuits Jack says I Sold out when the governor died Mother lives at Bath Go down there once a year for a week Dreadful slow Shilling whist Four sisters all unmarried except the youngest awful work Scotland in August Italy in the winter Cursed rheumatism Come to London in March and toddle about at the Club old boy and we won t go home till maw aw rning till daylight does appear And here s the wreck of two lives mused the present Snobographer after taking leave of Jack Spiggot Pretty merry Letty Lovelace s rudder lost and she cast away and handsome Jack Spiggot stranded on the shore like a drunken Trinculo What was it that insulted Nature to use no higher name and perverted her kindly intentions towards them What cursed frost was it that nipped the love that both were bearing and condemned the girl to sour sterility and the lad to selfish old bachelorhood It was the infernal Snob tyrant who governs us all who says Thou shalt not love without a lady s maid thou shalt not marry without a carriage and horses thou shalt have no wife in thy heart and no children on thy knee without a page in buttons and a French BONNE thou shalt go to the devil unless thou hast a brougham marry poor and society shall forsake thee thy kinsmen shall avoid thee as a criminal thy aunts and uncles shall turn up their eyes and bemoan the sad sad manner in which Tom or Harry has thrown himself away You young woman may sell yourself without shame and marry old Croesus you young man may lie away your heart and your life for a jointure But if you are poor woe be to you Society the brutal Snob autocrat consigns you to solitary perdition Wither poor girl in your garret rot poor bachelor in your Club When I see those graceless recluses those unnatural monks and nuns of the order of saint Beelzebub one my hatred for Snobs and their worship and their idols passes all continence Let us hew down that man eating Juggernaut I say that hideous Dagon and I glow with the heroic courage of Tom Thumb and join battle with the giant Snob one This of course is understood to apply only to those unmarried persons whom a mean and Snobbish fear about money has kept from fulfilling their natural destiny Many persons there are devoted to celibacy because they cannot help it Of these a man would be a brute who spoke roughly Indeed after Miss O Toole s conduct to the writer he would be the last to condemn But never mind these are personal matters CHAPTER XXXIV SNOBS AND MARRIAGE In that noble romance called Ten Thousand a Year I remember a profoundly pathetic description of the Christian manner in which the hero mister Aubrey bore his misfortunes After making a display of the most florid and grandiloquent resignation and quitting his country mansion the writer supposes Aubrey to come to town in a post chaise and pair sitting bodkin probably between his wife and sister It is about seven o clock carriages are rattling about knockers are thundering and tears bedim the fine eyes of Kate and missus Aubrey as they think that in happier times at this hour their Aubrey used formerly to go out to dinner to the houses of the aristocracy his friends This is the gist of the passage the elegant words I forget But the noble noble sentiment I shall always cherish and remember What can be more sublime than the notion of a great man s relatives in tears about his dinner With a few touches what author ever more happily described A Snob We were reading the passage lately at the house of my friend Raymond Gray Esquire Barrister at Law an ingenuous youth without the least practice but who has luckily a great share of good spirits which enables him to bide his time and bear laughingly his humble position in the world Meanwhile until it is altered the stern laws of necessity and the expenses of the Northern Circuit oblige mister Gray to live in a very tiny mansion in a very queer small square in the airy neighbourhood of Gray s Inn Lane What is the more remarkable is that Gray has a wife there missus Gray was a Miss Harley Baker and I suppose I need not say THAT is a respectable family Allied to the Cavendishes the Oxfords the Marrybones they still though rather DECHUS from their original splendour hold their heads as high as any missus Harley Baker I know never goes to church without John behind to carry her prayer book nor will Miss Welbeck her sister walk twenty yards a shopping without the protection of Figby her sugar loaf page though the old lady is as ugly as any woman in the parish and as tall and whiskery as a grenadier The astonishment is how Emily Harley Baker could have stooped to marry Raymond Gray She who was the prettiest and proudest of the family she who refused Sir Cockle Byles of the Bengal Service she who turned up her little nose at Essex Temple Q C and connected with the noble house of Albyn she who had but four thousandL POUR TOUT POTAGE to marry a man who had scarcely as much more A scream of wrath and indignation was uttered by the whole family when they heard of this MESALLIANCE missus Harley Baker never speaks of her daughter now but with tears in her eyes and as a ruined creature Miss Welbeck says I consider that man a villain and has denounced poor good natured missus Perkins as a swindler at whose ball the young people met for the first time mister and missus Gray meanwhile live in Gray s Inn Lane aforesaid with a maid servant and a nurse whose hands are very full and in a most provoking and unnatural state of happiness They have never once thought of crying about their dinner like the wretchedly puling and Snobbish womankind of my favourite Snob Aubrey of Ten Thousand a Year but on the contrary accept such humble victuals as fate awards them with a most perfect and thankful good grace nay actually have a portion for a hungry friend at times as the present writer can gratefully testify I was mentioning these dinners and some admirable lemon puddings which missus Gray makes to our mutual friend the great mister Goldmore the East India Director when that gentleman s face assumed an expression of almost apoplectic terror and he gasped out What Do they give dinners He seemed to think it a crime and a wonder that such people should dine at all and that it was their custom to huddle round their kitchen fire over a bone and a crust Whenever he meets them in society it is a matter of wonder to him and he always expresses his surprise very loud how the lady can appear decently dressed and the man have an unpatched coat to his back I have heard him enlarge upon this poverty before the whole room at the Conflagrative Club to which he and I and Gray have the honour to belong We meet at the Club on most days At half past four Goldmore arrives in saint James s Street from the City and you may see him reading the evening papers in the bow window of the Club which enfilades Pall Mall a large plethoric man with a bunch of seals in a large bow windowed light waistcoat He has large coat tails stuffed with agents letters and papers about companies of which he is a Director His seals jingle as he walks I wish I had such a man for an uncle and that he himself were childless I would love and cherish him and be kind to him At six o clock in the full season when all the world is in saint James s Street and the carriages are cutting in and out among the cabs on the stand and the tufted dandies are showing their listless faces out of White s and you see respectable grey headed gentlemen waggling their heads to each other through the plate glass windows of Arthur s and the red coats wish to be Briareian so as to hold all the gentlemen s horses and that wonderful red coated royal porter is sunning himself before Marlborough House at the noon of London time you see a light yellow carriage with black horses and a coachman in a tight floss silk wig and two footmen in powder and white and yellow liveries and a large woman inside in shot silk a poodle and a pink parasol which drives up to the gate of the Conflagrative and the page goes and says to mister Goldmore who is perfectly aware of the fact as he is looking out of the windows with about forty other Conflagrative bucks Your carriage Sir G wags his head Remember eight o clock precisely says he to Mulligatawney the other East India Director and ascending the carriage plumps down by the side of missus Goldmore for a drive in the Park and then home to Portland Place As the carriage whirls off all the young bucks in the Club feel a secret elation It is a part of their establishment as it were That carriage belongs to their Club and their Club belongs to them They follow the equipage with interest they eye it knowingly as they see it in the Park But halt we are not come to the Club Snobs yet O my brave Snobs what a flurry there will be among you when those papers appear Well you may judge from the above description what sort of a man Goldmore is A dull and pompous Leadenhall Street Croesus good natured withal and affable cruelly affable mister Goldmore can never forget his lady used to say that it was missus Gray s Grandfather who sent him to India and though that young woman has made the most imprudent marriage in the world and has left her station in society her husband seems an ingenious and laborious young man and we shall do everything in our power to be of use to him So they used to ask the Grays to dinner twice or thrice in a season when by way of increasing the kindness Buff the butler is ordered to hire a fly to convey them to and from Portland Place Of course I am much too good natured a friend of both parties not to tell Gray of Goldmore s opinion in him and the nabob s astonishment at the of the briefless barrister having any dinner at all Indeed Goldmore s saying became a joke against Gray amongst us wags at the Club and we used to ask him when he tasted meat last whether we should bring him home something from dinner and cut a thousand other mad pranks with him in our facetious way One day then coming home from the Club mister Gray conveyed to his wife the astounding information that he had asked Goldmore to dinner My love says missus Gray in a tremor how could you be so cruel Why the dining room won t hold missus Goldmore Make your mind easy missus Gray her ladyship is in Paris It is only Croesus that s coming and we are going to the play afterwards to Sadler s Wells Goldmore said at the Club that he thought Shakspeare was a great dramatic poet and ought to be patronized whereupon fired with enthusiasm I invited him to our banquet Goodness gracious what CAN we give him for dinner He has two French cooks you know missus Goldmore is always telling us about them and he dines with Aldermen every day A plain leg of mutton my Lucy I prythee get ready at three Have it tender and smoking and juicy And what better meat can there be says Gray quoting my favourite poet But the cook is ill and you know that horrible Pattypan the pastrycook s Silence Frau says Gray in a deep tragedy voice I will have the ordering of this repast Do all things as I bid thee Invite our friend Snob here to partake of the feast Be mine the task of procuring it Don t be expensive Raymond says his wife Peace thou timid partner of the briefless one Goldmore s dinner shall be suited to our narrow means Only do thou in all things my commands And seeing by the peculiar expression of the rogue s countenance that some mad waggery was in preparation I awaited the morrow with anxiety CHAPTER XXXV SNOBS AND MARRIAGE Punctual to the hour by the way I cannot omit to mark down my hatred scorn and indignation towards those miserable Snobs who come to dinner at nine when they are asked at eight in order to make a sensation in the company May the loathing of honest folks the backbiting of others the curses of cooks pursue these wretches and avenge the society on which they trample Punctual I say to the hour of five which mister and missus Raymond Gray had appointed a youth of an elegant appearance in a neat evening dress whose trim whiskers indicated neatness whose light step denoted activity for in sooth he was hungry and always is at the dinner hour whatsoever that hour may be and whose rich golden hair curling down his shoulders was set off by a perfectly new four and ninepenny silk hat was seen wending his way down Bittlestone Street Bittlestone Square Gray s Inn The person in question I need not say was mister Snob HE was never late when invited to dine But to proceed my narrative mister Snob may have flattered himself that he made a sensation as he strutted down Bittlestone with his richly gilt knobbed cane and indeed I vow I saw heads looking at me from Miss Squilsby s the brass plated milliner opposite Raymond Gray s who has three silver paper bonnets and two fly blown prints of fashion in the window yet what was the emotion produced by my arrival compared to that which the little street thrilled when at five minutes past five the floss wigged coachman the yellow hammer cloth and flunkeys the black horses and blazing silver harness of mister Goldmore whirled down the street It is a very little street of very little houses most of them with very large brass plates like Miss Squilsby s Coal merchants architects and surveyors two surgeons a solicitor a dancing master and of course several house agents occupy the houses little two storeyed edifices with little stucco porticoes Goldmore s carriage overtopped the roofs almost the first floors might shake hands with Croesus as he lolled inside all the windows of those first floors thronged with children and women in a twinkling There was missus Hammerly in curl papers missus Saxby with her front awry mister Wriggles peering through the gauze curtains holding the while his hot glass of rum and water in fine a tremendous commotion in Bittlestone Street as the Goldmore carriage drove up to mister Raymond Gray s door How kind it is of him to come with BOTH the footmen says little missus Gray peeping at the vehicle too The huge domestic descending from his perch gave a rap at the door which almost drove in the building All the heads were out the sun was shining the very organ boy paused the footman the coach and Goldmore s red face and white waistcoat were blazing in splendour The herculean plushed one went back to open the carriage door Raymond Gray opened his in his shirt sleeves He ran up to the carriage Come in Goldmore says he just in time my boy Open the door What d ye call um and let your master out and What d ye call um obeyed mechanically with a face of wonder and horror only to be equalled by the look of stupefied astonishment which ornamented the purple countenance of his master Wawt taim will you please have the CAGE sir says What d ye call um in that peculiar unspellable inimitable flunkefied pronunciation which forms one of the chief charms of existence Best have it to the theatre at night Gray exclaims it is but a step from here to the Wells and we can walk there I ve got tickets for all Be at Sadler s Wells at eleven Yes at eleven exclaims Goldmore perturbedly and walks with a flurried step into the house as if he were going to execution as indeed he was with that wicked Gray as a Jack Ketch over him The carriage drove away followed by numberless eyes from doorsteps and balconies its appearance is still a wonder in Bittlestone Street Go in there and amuse yourself with Snob says Gray opening the little drawing room door I ll call out as soon as the chops are ready Fanny s below seeing to the pudding Gracious mercy says Goldmore to me quite confidentially how could he ask us I really had no idea of this this utter destitution Dinner dinner roars out Gray from the diningroom whence issued a great smoking and frying and entering that apartment we find missus Gray ready to receive us and looking perfectly like a Princess who by some accident had a bowl of potatoes in her hand which vegetables she placed on the table Her husband was meanwhile cooking mutton chops on a gridiron over the fire Fanny has made the roly poly pudding says he the chops are my part Here s a fine one try this Goldmore And he popped a fizzing cutlet on that gentleman s plate What words what notes of exclamation can describe the nabob s astonishment The tablecloth was a very old one darned in a score places There was mustard in a teacup a silver fork for Goldmore all ours were iron I wasn t born with a silver spoon in my mouth says Gray gravely That fork is the only one we have Fanny has it generally Raymond cries missus Gray with an imploring face She was used to better things you know and I hope one day to get her a dinner service I m told the electro plate is uncommonly good Where the deuce IS that boy with the beer And now said he springing up I ll be a gentleman And so he put on his coat and sat down quite gravely with four fresh mutton chops which he had by this time broiled We don t have meat every day mister Goldmore he continued and it s a treat to me to get a dinner like this You little know you gentlemen of England who live at home at ease what hardships briefless barristers endure Gracious mercy says mister Goldmore Where s the half and half Fanny go over to the Keys and get the beer Here s sixpence And what was our astonishment when Fanny got up as if to go Gracious mercy let ME cries Goldmore Not for worlds my dear sir She s used to it They wouldn t serve you as well as they serve her Leave her alone Law bless you Raymond said with astounding composure And missus Gray left the room and actually came back with a tray on which there was a pewter flagon of beer Little Polly to whom at her christening I had the honour of presenting a silver mug EX OFFICIO followed with a couple of tobacco pipes and the queerest roguish look in her round little chubby face Did you speak to Tapling about the gin Fanny my dear Gray asked after bidding Polly put the pipes on the chimney piece which that little person had some difficulty in reaching The last was turpentine and even your brewing didn t make good punch of it You would hardly suspect Goldmore that my wife a Harley Baker would ever make gin punch I think my mother in law would commit suicide if she saw her Don t be always laughing at mamma Raymond says missus Gray Well well she wouldn t die and I DON T wish she would And you don t make gin punch and you don t like it either and Goldmore do you drink your beer out of the glass or out of the pewter Gracious mercy ejaculates Croesus once more as little Polly taking the pot with both her little bunches of hands offers it smiling to that astonished Director And so in a word the dinner commenced and was presently ended in a similar fashion Gray pursued his unfortunate guest with the most queer and outrageous description of his struggles misery and poverty He described how he cleaned the knives when they were first married and how he used to drag the children in a little cart how his wife could toss pancakes and what parts of his dress she made He told Tibbits his clerk who was in fact the functionary who had brought the beer from the public house which missus Fanny had fetched from the neighbouring apartment to fetch the bottle of port wine when the dinner was over and told Goldmore as wonderful a history about the way in which that bottle of wine had come into his hands as any of his former stories had been When the repast was all over and it was near time to move to the play and missus Gray had retired and we were sitting ruminating rather silently over the last glasses of the port Gray suddenly breaks the silence by slapping Goldmore on the shoulder and saying Now Goldmore tell me something What asks Croesus Haven t you had a good dinner Goldmore started as if a sudden truth had just dawned upon him He HAD had a good dinner and didn t know it until then The three mutton chops consumed by him were best of the mutton kind the potatoes were perfect of their order as for the rolypoly it was too good The porter was frothy and cool and the port wine was worthy of the gills of a bishop I speak with ulterior views for there is more in Gray s cellar Well says Goldmore after a pause during which he took time to consider the momentous question Gray put to him Pon my word now you say so I I have I really have had a monsous good dinnah monsous good upon my ward Here s your health Gray my boy and your amiable lady and when missus Goldmore comes back I hope we shall see you more in Portland Place And with this the time came for the play and we went to see mister Phelps at Sadler s Wells The best of this story for the truth of every word of which I pledge my honour is that after this banquet which Goldmore enjoyed so the honest fellow felt a prodigious compassion and regard for the starving and miserable giver of the feast and determined to help him in his profession And being a Director of the newly established Antibilious Life Assurance Company he has had Gray appointed Standing Counsel with a pretty annual fee and only yesterday in an appeal from Bombay Buckmuckjee Bobbachee v Ramchowder Bahawder in the Privy Council Lord Brougham complimented mister Gray who was in the case on his curious and exact knowledge of the Sanscrit language Whether he knows Sanscrit or not I can t say but Goldmore got him the business and so I cannot help having a lurking regard for that pompous old Bigwig CHAPTER XXXVI SNOBS AND MARRIAGE We Bachelors in Clubs are very much obliged to you says my old school and college companion Essex Temple for the opinion which you hold of us You call us selfish purple faced bloated and other pretty names You state in the simplest possible terms that we shall go to the deuce You bid us rot in loneliness and deny us all claims to honesty conduct decent Christian life Who are you mister Snob to judge us Who are you with your infernal benevolent smirk and grin that laugh at all our generation I will tell you my case says Essex Temple mine and my sister Polly s and you may make what you like of it and sneer at old maids and bully old bachelors if you will I will whisper to you confidentially that my sister was engaged to Serjeant Shirker a fellow whose talents one cannot deny and be hanged to them but whom I have always known to be mean selfish and a prig However women don t see these faults in the men whom Love throws in their way Shirker who has about as much warmth as an eel made up to Polly years and years ago and was no bad match for a briefless barrister as he was then Have you ever read Lord Eldon s Life Do you remember how the sordid old Snob narrates his going out to purchase twopence worth of sprats which he and missus Scott fried between them And how he parades his humility and exhibits his miserable poverty he who at that time must have been making a thousand pounds a year Well Shirker was just as proud of his prudence just as thankful for his own meanness and of course would not marry without a competency Who so honourable Polly waited and waited faintly from year to year HE wasn t sick at heart HIS passion never disturbed his six hours sleep or kept his ambition out of mind He would rather have hugged an attorney any day than have kissed Polly though she was one of the prettiest creatures in the world and while she was pining alone upstairs reading over the stock of half a dozen frigid letters that the confounded prig had condescended to write to her HE be sure was never busy with anything but his briefs in chambers always frigid rigid self satisfied and at his duty The marriage trailed on year after year while mister Serjeant Shirker grew to be the famous lawyer he is Meanwhile my younger brother Pump Temple who was in the one hundred and twentieth Hussars and had the same little patrimony which fell to the lot of myself and Polly must fall in love with our cousin Fanny Figtree and marry her out of hand You should have seen the wedding Six bridesmaids in pink to hold the fan bouquet gloves scent bottle and pocket handkerchief of the bride basketfuls of white favours in the vestry to be pinned on to the footmen and horses a genteel congregation of curious acquaintance in the pews a shabby one of poor on the steps all the carriages of all our acquaintance whom Aunt Figtree had levied for the occasion and of course four horses for mister Pump s bridal vehicle Then comes the breakfast or DEJEUNER if you please with a brass band in the street and policemen to keep order The happy bridegroom spends about a year s income in dresses for the bridesmaids and pretty presents and the bride must have a TROUSSEAU of laces satins jewel boxes and tomfoolery to make her fit to be a lieutenant s wife There was no hesitation about Pump He flung about his money as if it had been dross and missus P Temple on the horse Tom Tiddler which her husband gave her was the most dashing of military women at Brighton or Dublin How old missus Figtree used to bore me and Polly with stories of Pump s grandeur and the noble company he kept Polly lives with the Figtrees as I am not rich enough to keep a home for her Pump and I have always been rather distant Not having the slightest notions about horseflesh he has a natural contempt for me and in our mother s lifetime when the good old lady was always paying his debts and petting him I m not sure there was not a little jealousy It used to be Polly that kept the peace between us She went to Dublin to visit Pump and brought back grand accounts of his doings gayest man about town Aide de Camp to the Lord Lieutenant Fanny admired everywhere Her Excellency godmother to the second boy the eldest with a string of aristocratic Christian names that made the grandmother wild with delight Presently Fanny and Pump obligingly came to London where the third was born Polly was godmother to this and who so loving as she and Pump now Oh Essex says she to me he is so good so generous so fond of his family so handsome who can help loving him and pardoning his little errors One day while missus Pump was yet in the upper regions and Doctor Fingerfee s brougham at her door every day having business at Guildhall whom should I meet in Cheapside but Pump and Polly The poor girl looked more happy and rosy than I have seen her these twelve years Pump on the contrary was rather blushing and embarrassed I couldn t be mistaken in her face and its look of mischief and triumph She had been committing some act of sacrifice I went to the family stockbroker She had sold out two thousand pounds that morning and given them to Pump Quarrelling was useless Pump had the money he was off to Dublin by the time I reached his mother s and Polly radiant still He was going to make his fortune he was going to embark the money in the Bog of Allen I don t know what The fact is he was going to pay his losses upon the last Manchester steeple chase and I leave you to imagine how much principal or interest poor Polly ever saw back again It was more than half her fortune and he has had another thousand since from her Then came efforts to stave off ruin and prevent exposure struggles on all our parts and sacrifices that here mister Essex Temple began to hesitate that needn t be talked of but they are of no more use than such sacrifices ever are Pump and his wife are abroad I don t like to ask where Polly has the three children and mister Serjeant Shirker has formally written to break off an engagement on the conclusion of which Miss Temple must herself have speculated when she alienated the greater part of her fortune And here s your famous theory of poor marriages Essex Temple cries concluding the above history How do you know that I don t want to marry myself How do you dare sneer at my poor sister What are we but martyrs of the reckless marriage system which mister Snob forsooth chooses to advocate And he thought he had the better of the argument which strange to say is not my opinion But for the infernal Snob worship might not every one of these people be happy If poor Polly s happiness lay in linking her tender arms round such a heartless prig as the sneak who has deceived her she might have been happy now as happy as Raymond Raymond in the ballad with the stone statue by his side She is wretched because mister Serjeant Shirker worships money and ambition and is a Snob and a coward If the unfortunate Pump Temple and his giddy hussy of a wife have ruined themselves and dragged down others into their calamity it is because they loved rank and horses and plate and carriages and COURT GUIDES and millinery and would sacrifice all to attain those objects And who misguides them If the world were more simple would not those foolish people follow the fashion Does not the world love COURT GUIDES and millinery and plate and carriages Mercy on us Read the fashionable intelligence read the COURT CIRCULAR read the genteel novels survey mankind from Pimlico to Red Lion Square and see how the Poor Snob is aping the Rich Snob how the Mean Snob is grovelling at the feet of the Proud Snob and the Great Snob is lording it over his humble brother Does the idea of equality ever enter Dives head Will it ever Will the Duchess of Fitzbattleaxe I like a good name ever believe that Lady Croesus her next door neighbour in Belgrave Square is as good a lady as her Grace Will Lady Croesus ever leave off pining the Duchess s parties and cease patronizing missus Broadcloth whose husband has not got his Baronetcy yet Will missus Broadcloth ever heartily shake hands with missus Seedy and give up those odious calculations about poor dear missus Seedy s income Will missus Seedy who is starving in her great house go and live comfortably in a little one or in lodgings Will her landlady Miss Letsam ever stop wondering at the familiarity of tradespeople or rebuking the insolence of Suky the maid who wears flowers under her bonnet like a lady But why hope why wish for such times Do I wish all Snobs to perish Do I wish these Snob papers to determine Suicidal fool art not thou too a Snob and a brother CHAPTER XXXVII CLUB SNOBS As I wish to be particularly agreeable to the ladies to whom I make my most humble obeisance we will now if you please commence maligning a class of Snobs against whom I believe most female minds are embittered I mean Club Snobs I have very seldom heard even the most gentle and placable woman speak without a little feeling of bitterness against those social institutions those palaces swaggering in saint James s which are open to the men while the ladies have but their dingy three windowed brick boxes in Belgravia or in Paddingtonia or in the region between the road of Edgware and that of Gray s Inn In my grandfather s time it used to be Freemasonry that roused their anger It was my grand aunt whose portrait we still have in the family who got into the clock case at the Royal Rosicrucian Lodge at Bungay Suffolk to spy the proceedings of the Society of which her husband was a member and being frightened by the sudden whirring and striking eleven of the clock just as the Deputy Grand Master was bringing in the mystic gridiron for the reception of a neophyte rushed out into the midst of the lodge assembled and was elected by a desperate unanimity Deputy Grand Mistress for life Though that admirable and courageous female never subsequently breathed a word with regard to the secrets of the initiation yet she inspired all our family with such a terror regarding the mysteries of Jachin and Boaz that none of our family have ever since joined the Society or worn the dreadful Masonic insignia It is known that Orpheus was torn to pieces by some justly indignant Thracian ladies for belonging to an Harmonic Lodge Let him go back to Eurydice they said whom he is pretending to regret so But the history is given in doctor Lempriere s elegant dictionary in a manner much more forcible than any this feeble pen can attempt At once then and without verbiage let us take up this subject matter of Clubs Clubs ought not in my mind to be permitted to bachelors If my friend of the Cuttykilts had not our club the Union Jack to go to I belong to the U J and nine other similar institutions who knows but he never would be a bachelor at this present moment Instead of being made comfortable and cockered up with every luxury as they are at Clubs bachelors ought to be rendered profoundly miserable in my opinion Every encouragement should be given to the rendering their spare time disagreeable There can be no more odious object according to my sentiments than young Smith in the pride of health commanding his dinner of three courses than middle aged Jones wallowing as I may say in an easy padded arm chair over the delicious novel or brilliant magazine or than old Brown that selfish old reprobate for whom mere literature has no charms stretched on the best sofa sitting on the second edition of THE TIMES having the MORNING CHRONICLE between his knees the HERALD pushed in between his coat and waistcoat the STANDARD under his arm the GLOBE under the other pinion and the DAILY NEWS in perusal I ll trouble you for PUNCH mister Wiggins says the unconscionable old gormandiser interrupting our friend who is laughing over the periodical in question This kind of selfishness ought not to be No no Young Smith instead of his dinner and his wine ought to be where at the festive tea table to be sure by the side of Miss Higgs sipping the bohea or tasting the harmless muffin while old missus Higgs looks on pleased at their innocent dalliance and my friend Miss Wirt the governess is performing Thalberg s last sonata in treble X totally unheeded at the piano Where should the middle aged Jones be At his time of life he ought to be the father of a family At such an hour say at nine o clock at night the nursery bell should have just rung the children to bed He and missus J ought to be by rights seated on each side of the fire by the dining room table a bottle of port wine between them not so full as it was an hour since missus J has had two glasses missus Grumble Jones s mother in law has had three Jones himself has finished the rest and dozes comfortably until bed time And Brown that old newspaper devouring miscreant what right has HE at a club at a decent hour of night He ought to be playing his rubber with Miss MacWhirter his wife and the family apothecary His candle ought to be brought to him at ten o clock and he should retire to rest just as the young people were thinking of a dance How much finer simpler nobler are the several employments I have sketched out for these gentlemen than their present nightly orgies at the horrid Club And ladies think of men who do not merely frequent the dining room and library but who use other apartments of those horrible dens which it is my purpose to batter down think of Cannon the wretch with his coat off at his age and size clattering the balls over the billiard table all night and making bets with that odious Captain Spot think of Pam in a dark room with Bob Trumper Jack Deuceace and Charley Vole playing the poor dear misguided wretch guinea points and five pounds on the rubber above all think oh think of that den of abomination which I am told has been established in SOME clubs called THE SMOKING ROOM think of the debauchees who congregate there the quantities of reeking whisky punch or more dangerous sherry cobbler which they consume think of them coming home at cock crow and letting themselves into the quiet house with the Chubb key think of them the hypocrites taking off their insidious boots before they slink upstairs the children sleeping overhead the wife of their bosom alone with the waning rushlight in the two pair front that chamber so soon to be rendered hateful by the smell of their stale cigars I am not an advocate of violence I am not by nature of an incendiary turn of mind but if my dear ladies you are for assassinating mister Chubb and burning down Club houses in saint James s there is ONE Snob at who will not think the worse of you The only men who as I opine ought to be allowed the use of Clubs are married men without a profession The continual presence of these in a house cannot be thought even by the most loving of wives desirable Say the girls are beginning to practise their music which in an honourable English family ought to occupy every young gentlewoman three hours it would be rather hard to call upon poor papa to sit in the drawing room all that time and listen to the interminable discords and shrieks which are elicited from the miserable piano during the above necessary operation A man with a good ear especially would go mad if compelled daily to submit to this horror Or suppose you have a fancy to go to the milliner s or to Howell and James s it is manifest my dear Madam that your husband is much better at the Club during these operations than by your side in the carriage or perched in wonder upon one of the stools at Shawl and Gimcrack s whilst young counter dandies are displaying their wares This sort of husbands should be sent out after breakfast and if not Members of Parliament or Directors of a Railroad or an Insurance Company should be put into their clubs and told to remain there until dinner time No sight is more agreeable to my truly regulated mind than to see the noble characters so worthily employed Whenever I pass by saint James s Street having the privilege like the rest of the world of looking in at the windows of Blight s or Foodle s or Snook s or the great bay at the Contemplative Club I behold with respectful appreciation the figures within the honest rosy old fogies the mouldy old dandies the waist belts and glossy wigs and tight cravats of those most vacuous and respectable men Such men are best there during the day time surely When you part with them dear ladies think of the rapture consequent on their return You have transacted your household affairs you have made your purchases you have paid your visits you have aired your poodle in the Park your French maid has completed the toilette which renders you so ravishingly beautiful by candlelight and you are fit to make home pleasant to him who has been absent all day Such men surely ought to have their Clubs and we will not class them among Club Snobs therefore on whom let us reserve our attack for the next chapter CHAPTER XXXVIII CLUB SNOBS Such a Sensation has been created in the Clubs by the appearance of the last paper on Club Snobs as can t but be complimentary to me who am one of their number I belong to many Clubs The Union Jack the Sash and Marlin spike Military Clubs The True Blue the No Surrender the Blue and Buff the Guy Fawkes and the Cato Street Political Clubs The Brummel and the Regent Dandy Clubs The Acropolis the Palladium the Areopagus the Pnyx the Pentelicus the Ilissus and the Poluphloisboio Thalasses Literary Clubs I never could make out how the latter set of Clubs got their names I don t know Greek for one and I wonder how many other members of those institutions do Ever since the Club Snobs have been announced I observe a sensation created on my entrance into any one of these places Members get up and hustle together they nod they scowl as they glance towards the present Snob Infernal impudent jackanapes If he shows me up says Colonel Bludyer I ll break every bone in his skin I told you what would come of admitting literary men into the Club says Ranville Ranville to his colleague Spooney of the Tape and Sealing Wax Office These people are very well in their proper places and as a public man I make a point of shaking hands with them and that sort of thing but to have one s privacy obtruded upon by such people is really too much Come along Spooney and the pair of prigs retire superciliously As I came into the coffee room at the No Surrender old Jawkins was holding out to a knot of men who were yawning as usual There he stood waving the STANDARD and swaggering before the fire What says he did I tell Peel last year If you touch the Corn Laws you touch the Sugar Question if you touch the Sugar you touch the Tea I am no monopolist I am a liberal man but I cannot forget that I stand on the brink of a precipice and if were to have Free Trade give me reciprocity And what was Sir Robert Peel s answer to me mister Jawkins he said Here Jawkins s eye suddenly turning on your humble servant he stopped his sentence with a guilty look his stale old stupid sentence which every one of us at the Club has heard over and over again Jawkins is a most pertinacious Club Snob Every day he is at that fireplace holding that STANDARD of which he reads up the leading article and pours it out ORE ROTUNDO with the most astonishing composure in the face of his neighbour who has just read every word of it in the paper Jawkins has money as you may see by the tie of his neckcloth He passes the morning swaggering about the City in bankers and brokers parlours and says I spoke with Peel yesterday and his intentions are so and so Graham and I were talking over the matter and I pledge you my word of honour his opinion coincides with mine and that What d ye call um is the only measure Government will venture on trying By evening paper time he is at the Club I can tell you the opinion of the City my lord says he and the way in which Jones Loyd looks at it is briefly this Rothschilds told me so themselves In Mark Lane people s minds are QUITE made up He is considered rather a well informed man He lives in Belgravia of course in a drab coloured genteel house and has everything about him that is properly grave dismal and comfortable His dinners are in the MORNING HERALD among the parties for the week and his wife and daughters make a very handsome appearance at the Drawing Room once a year when he comes down to the Club in his Deputy Lieutenant s uniform He is fond of beginning a speech to you by saying When I was in the House I c in fact he sat for Skittlebury for three weeks in the first Reformed Parliament and was unseated for bribery since which he has three times unsuccessfully contested that honourable borough Another sort of Political Snob I have seen at most Clubs and that is the man who does not care so much for home politics but is great upon foreign affairs I think this sort of man is scarcely found anywhere BUT in Clubs It is for him the papers provide their foreign articles at the expense of some ten thousand a year each He is the man who is really seriously uncomfortable about the designs of Russia and the atrocious treachery of Louis Philippe He it is who expects a French fleet in the Thames and has a constant eye upon the American President every word of whose speech goodness help him he reads He knows the names of the contending leaders in Portugal and what they are fighting about and it is he who says that Lord Aberdeen ought to be impeached and Lord Palmerston hanged or VICE VERSA Lord Palmerston s being sold to Russia the exact number of roubles paid by what house in the City is a favourite theme with this kind of Snob I once overheard him it was Captain Spitfire R N who had been refused a ship by the Whigs by the way indulging in the following conversation with mister Minns after dinner Why wasn t the Princess Scragamoffsky at Lady Palmerston s party Minns Because SHE CAN T SHOW why can t she show Shall I tell you Minns why she can t show The Princess Scragainoffsky s back is flayed alive Minns I tell you it s raw sir On Tuesday last at twelve o clock three drummers of the Preobajinski Regiment arrived at Ashburnham House and at half past twelve in the yellow drawing room at the Russian Embassy before the ambassadress and four ladies maids the Greek Papa and the Secretary of Embassy Madame de Scragamoffsky received thirteen dozen She was knouted sir knouted in the midst of England in Berkeley Square for having said that the Grand Duchess Olga s hair was red And now sir will you tell me Lord Palmerston ought to continue Minister Minns Good Ged Minns follows Spitfire about and thinks him the greatest and wisest of human beings CHAPTER XXXIX CLUB SNOBS Why does not some great author write The Mysteries of the Club houses or saint James s Street unveiled It would be a fine subject for an imaginative writer We must all as boys remember when we went to the fair and had spent all our money the sort of awe and anxiety with which we loitered round the outside of the show speculating upon the nature of the entertainment going on within Man is a Drama of Wonder and Passion and Mystery and Meanness and Beauty and Truthfulness and Etcetera Each Bosom is a Booth in Vanity Fair But let us stop this capital style I should die if I kept it up for a column a pretty thing a column all capitals would be by the way In a Club though there mayn t be a soul of your acquaintance in the room you have always the chance of watching strangers and speculating on what is going on within those tents and curtains of their souls their coats and waistcoats This is a never failing sport Indeed I am told there are some Clubs in the town where nobody ever speaks to anybody They sit in the coffee room quite silent and watching each other Yet how little you can tell from a man s outward demeanour There s a man at our Club large heavy middle aged gorgeously dressed rather bald with lacquered boots and a boa when he goes out quiet in demeanour always ordering and consuming a RECHERCHE little dinner whom I have mistaken for Sir John Pocklington any time these five years and respected as a man with five hundred pounds PER DIEM and I find he is but a clerk in an office in the City with not two hundred pounds income and his name is Jubber Sir John Pocklington was on the contrary the dirty little snuffy man who cried out so about the bad quality of the beer and grumbled at being overcharged three halfpence for a herring seated at the next table to Jubber on the day when some one pointed the Baronet out to me Take a different sort of mystery I see for instance old Fawney stealing round the rooms of the Club with glassy meaningless eyes and an endless greasy simper he fawns on everybody he meets and shakes hands with you and blesses you and betrays the most tender and astonishing interest in your welfare You know him to be a quack and a rogue and he knows you know it But he wriggles on his way and leaves a track of slimy flattery after him wherever he goes Who can penetrate that man s mystery What earthly good can he get from you or me You don t know what is working under that leering tranquil mask You have only the dim instinctive repulsion that warns you you are in the presence of a knave beyond which fact all Fawney s soul is a secret to you I think I like to speculate on the young men best Their play is opener You know the cards in their hand as it were Take for example Messrs Spavin and Cockspur A specimen or two of the above sort of young fellows may be found I believe at most Clubs They know nobody They bring a fine smell of cigars into the room with them and they growl together in a corner about sporting matters They recollect the history of that short period in which they have been ornaments of the world by the names of winning horses As political men talk about the Reform year the year the Whigs went out and so forth these young sporting bucks speak of TARNATION S year or OPODELDOC S year or the year when CATAWAMPUS ran second for the Chester Cup They play at billiards in the morning they absorb pale ale for breakfast and top up with glasses of strong waters They read BELL S LIFE and a very pleasant paper too with a great deal of erudition in the answers to correspondents They go down to Tattersall s and swagger in the Park with their hands plunged in the pockets of their paletots What strikes me especially in the outward demeanour of sporting youth is their amazing gravity their conciseness of speech and careworn and moody air In the smoking room at the Regent when Joe Millerson will be setting the whole room in a roar with laughter you hear young Messrs Spavin and Cockspur grumbling together in a corner I ll take your five and twenty to one about Brother to Bluenose whispers Spavin Can t do it at the price Cockspur says wagging his head ominously The betting book is always present in the minds of those unfortunate youngsters I think I hate that work even more than the Peerage There is some good in the latter though generally speaking a vain record though De Mogyns is not descended from the giant Hogyn Mogyn though half the other genealogies are equally false and foolish yet the mottoes are good reading some of them and the book itself a sort of gold laced and livened lackey to History and in so far serviceable But what good ever came out of or went into a betting book If I could be Caliph Omar for a week I would pitch every one of those despicable manuscripts into the flames from my Lord s who is in with Jack Snaffle s stable and is over reaching worse informed rogues and swindling greenhorns down to Sam s the butcher boy s who books eighteenpenny odds in the tap room and stands to win five and twenty bob In a turf transaction either Spavin or Cockspur would try to get the better of his father and to gain a point in the odds victimise his best friends One day we shall hear of one or other levanting an event at which not being sporting men we shall not break our hearts See mister Spavin is settling his toilette previous to departure giving a curl in the glass to his side wisps of hair Look at him It is only at the hulks or among turf men that you ever see a face so mean so knowing and so gloomy A much more humane being among the youthful Clubbists is the Lady killing Snob I saw Wiggle just now in the dressing room talking to Waggle his inseparable WAGGLE Pon my honour Wiggle she did WIGGLE Well Waggle as you say I own I think she DID look at me rather kindly We ll see to night at the French play And having arrayed their little persons these two harmless young bucks go upstairs to dinner CHAPTER XL CLUB SNOBS Both sorts of young men mentioned in my last under the flippant names of Wiggle and Waggle may be found in tolerable plenty I think in Clubs Wiggle and Waggle are both idle They come of the middle classes One of them very likely makes believe to be a barrister and the other has smart apartments about Piccadilly They are a sort of second chop dandies they cannot imitate that superb listlessness of demeanour and that admirable vacuous folly which distinguish the noble and high born chiefs of the race but they lead lives almost as bad were it but for the example and are personally quite as useless I am not going to arm a thunderbolt and launch it at the beads of these little Pall Mall butterflies They don t commit much public harm or private extravagance They don t spend a thousand pounds for diamond earrings for an Opera dancer as Lord Tarquin can neither of them ever set up a public house or broke the bank of a gambling club like the young Earl of Martingale They have good points kind feelings and deal honourably in money transactions only in their characters of men of second rate pleasure about town they and their like are so utterly mean self contented and absurd that they must not be omitted in a work treating on Snobs Wiggle has been abroad where he gives you to understand that his success among the German countesses and Italian princesses whom he met at the TABLES D HOTE was perfectly terrific His rooms are hung round with pictures of actresses and ballet dancers He passes his mornings in a fine dressing gown burning pastilles and reading Don Juan and French novels by the way the life of the author of Don Juan as described by himself was the model of the life of a Snob He has twopenny halfpenny French prints of women with languishing eyes dressed in dominoes guitars gondolas and so forth and tells you stories about them It s a bad print says he I know but I ve a reason for liking it It reminds me of somebody somebody I knew in other climes You have heard of the Principessa di Monte Pulciano I met her at Rimini Dear dear Francesca That fair haired bright eyed thing in the Bird of Paradise and the Turkish Simar with the love bird on her finger I m sure must have been taken from from somebody perhaps whom you don t know but she s known at Munich Waggle my boy everybody knows the Countess Ottilia de Eulenschreckenstein Gad sir what a beautiful creature she was when I danced with her on the birthday of Prince Attila of Bavaria in forty four Prince Carloman was our vis a vis and Prince Pepin danced the same CONTREDANSE She had a Polyanthus in her bouquet Waggle I HAVE IT NOW His countenance assumes an agonized and mysterious expression and he buries his head in the sofa cushions as if plunging into a whirlpool of passionate recollections Last year he made a considerable sensation by having on his table a morocco miniature case locked by a gold key which he always wore round his neck and on which was stamped a serpent emblem of eternity with the letter M in the circle Sometimes he laid this upon his little morocco writing table as if it were on an altar generally he had flowers upon it in the middle of a conversation he would start up and kiss it He would call out from his bed room to his valet Hicks bring me my casket I don t know who it is Waggle would say Who DOES know that fellow s intrigues Desborough Wiggle sir is the slave of passion I suppose you have heard the story of the Italian princess locked up in the Convent of Saint Barbara at Rimini He hasn t told you Then I m not at liberty to speak Or the countess about whom he nearly had the duel with Prince Witikind of Bavaria Perhaps you haven t even heard about that beautiful girl at Pentonville daughter of a most respectable Dissenting clergyman She broke her heart when she found he was engaged to a most lovely creature of high family who afterwards proved false to him and she s now in Hanwell Waggle s belief in his friend amounts to frantic adoration What a genius he is if he would but apply himself he whispers to me He could be anything sir but for his passions His poems are the most beautiful things you ever saw He s written a continuation of Don Juan from his own adventures Did you ever read his lines to Mary They re superior to Byron sir superior to Byron I was glad to hear this from so accomplished a critic as Waggle for the fact is I had composed the verses myself for honest Wiggle one day whom I found at his chambers plunged in thought over a very dirty old fashioned album in which he had not as yet written a single word I can t says he Sometimes I can write whole cantos and to day not a line Oh Snob such an opportunity Such a divine creature She s asked me to write verses for her album and I can t Is she rich said I I thought you would never marry any but an heiress Oh Snob she s the most accomplished highly connected creature and I can t get out a line How will you have it says I Hot with sugar Don t don t You trample on the most sacred feelings Snob I want something wild and tender like Byron I want to tell her that amongst the festive balls and that sort of thing you know I only think about her you know that I scorn the world and am weary of it you know and something about a gazelle and a bulbul you know And a yataghan to finish off with the present writer observed and we began TO MARY I seem in the midst of the crowd The lightest of all My laughter rings cheery and loud In banquet and ball My lip hath its smiles and its sneers For all men to see But my soul and my truth and my tears Are for thee are for thee Do you call THAT neat Wiggle says I I declare it almost makes me cry myself Now suppose says Wiggle we say that all the world is at my feet make her jealous you know and that sort of thing and that that I m going to TRAVEL you know That perhaps may work upon her feelings So WE as this wretched prig said began again Around me they flatter and fawn The young and the old The fairest are ready to pawn Their hearts for my gold They sue me I laugh as I spurn The slaves at my knee But in faith and in fondness I turn Unto thee unto thee Now for the travelling Wiggle my boy And I began in a voice choked with emotion Away for my heart knows no rest Since you taught it to feel The secret must die in my breast I burn to reveal The passion I may not I say Snob Wiggle here interrupted the excited bard just as I was about to break out into four lines so pathetic that they would drive you into hysterics I say ahem couldn t you say that I was a military man and that there was some danger of my life You a military man danger of your life What the deuce do you mean Why said Wiggle blushing a great deal I told her I was going out on the Ecuador expedition You abominable young impostor I exclaimed Finish the poem for yourself And so he did and entirely out of all metre and bragged about the work at the Club as his own performance Poor Waggle fully believed in his friend s genius until one day last week he came with a grin on his countenance to the Club and said Oh Snob I ve made SUCH a discovery Going down to the skating to day whom should I see but Wiggle walking with that splendid woman that lady of illustrious family and immense fortune Mary you know whom he wrote the beautiful verses about She s five and forty She s red hair She s a nose like a pump handle Her father made his fortune by keeping a ham and beef shop and Wiggle s going to marry her next week So much the better Waggle my young friend I exclaimed Better for the sake of womankind that this dangerous dog should leave off lady killing this Blue Beard give up practice Or better rather for his own sake For as there is not a word of truth in any of those prodigious love stories which you used to swallow nobody has been hurt except Wiggle himself whose affections will now centre in the ham and beef shop There ARE people mister Waggle who do these things in earnest and hold a good rank in the world too But these are not subjects for ridicule and though certainly Snobs are scoundrels likewise Their cases go up to a higher Court CHAPTER XLI CLUB SNOBS Bacchus is the divinity to whom Waggle devotes his especial worship Give me wine my boy says he to his friend Wiggle who is prating about lovely woman and holds up his glass full of the rosy fluid and winks at it portentously and sips it and smacks his lips after it and meditates on it as if he were the greatest of connoisseurs I have remarked this excessive wine amateurship especially in youth Snoblings from college Fledglings from the army Goslings from the public schools who ornament our Clubs are frequently to be heard in great force upon wine questions This bottle s corked says Snobling and mister Sly the butler taking it away returns presently with the same wine in another jug which the young amateur pronounces excellent Hang champagne says Fledgling it s only fit for gals and children Give me pale sherry at dinner and my twenty three claret afterwards What s port now says Gosling disgusting thick sweet stuff where s the old dry wine one USED to get Until the last twelvemonth Fledgling drank small beer at Doctor Swishtail s and Gosling used to get his dry old port at a gin shop in Westminster till he quitted that seminary in eighteen forty four Anybody who has looked at the caricatures of thirty years ago must remember how frequently bottle noses pimpled faces and other Bardolphian features are introduced by the designer They are much more rare now in nature and in pictures therefore than in those good old times but there are still to be found amongst the youth of our Clubs lads who glory in drinking bouts and whose faces quite sickly and yellow for the most part are decorated with those marks which Rowland s Kalydor is said to efface I was SO cut last night old boy Hopkins says to Tomkins with amiable confidence I tell you what we did We breakfasted with Jack Herring at twelve and kept up with brandy and soda water and weeds till four then we toddled into the Park for an hour then we dined and drank mulled port till half price then we looked in for an hour at the Haymarket then we came back to the Club and had grills and whisky punch till all was blue Hullo waiter Get me a glass of cherry brandy Club waiters the civilest the kindest the patientest of men die under the infliction of these cruel young topers But if the reader wishes to see a perfect picture on the stage of this class of young fellows I would recommend him to witness the ingenious comedy of LONDON ASSURANCE the amiable heroes of which are represented not only as drunkards and five o clock in the morning men but as showing a hundred other delightful traits of swindling lying and general debauchery quite edifying to witness How different is the conduct of these outrageous youths to the decent behaviour of my friend mister Papworthy who says to Poppins the butler at the Club PAPWORTHY Poppins I m thinking of dining early is there any cold game in the house POPPINS There s a game pie sir there s cold grouse sir there s cold pheasant sir there s cold peacock sir cold swan sir cold ostrich sir c c as the case may be PAPWORTHY Hem What s your best claret now Poppins in pints I mean POPPINS There s Cooper and Magnum s Lafitte sir there s Lath and Sawdust s saint Julien sir Bung s Leoville is considered remarkably fine and I think you d like Jugger s Chateau Margaux PAPWORTHY Hum hah well give me a crust of bread and a glass of beer I ll only LUNCH Poppins Captain Shindy is another sort of Club bore He has been known to throw all the Club in an uproar about the quality of his mutton chop Look at it sir Is it cooked sir Smell it sir Is it meat fit for a gentleman he roars out to the steward who stands trembling before him and who in vain tells him that the Bishop of Bullocksmithy has just had three from the same loin All the waiters in the Club are huddled round the captain s mutton chop He roars out the most horrible curses at John for not bringing the pickles he utters the most dreadful oaths because Thomas has not arrived with the Harvey Sauce Peter comes tumbling with the water jug over Jeames who is bringing the glittering canisters with bread Whenever Shindy enters the room such is the force of character every table is deserted every gentleman must dine as he best may and all those big footmen are in terror He makes his account of it He scolds and is better waited upon in consequence At the Club he has ten servants scudding about to do his bidding Poor missus Shindy and the children are meanwhile in dingy lodgings somewhere waited upon by a charity girl in pattens CHAPTER XLII CLUB SNOBS Every well bred English female will sympathize with the subject of the harrowing tale the history of Sackville Maine I am now about to recount The pleasures of Clubs have been spoken of let us now glance for a moment at the dangers of those institutions and for this purpose I must introduce you to my young acquaintance Sackville Maine It was at a ball at the house of my respected friend missus Perkins that I was introduced to this gentleman and his charming lady Seeing a young creature before me in a white dress with white satin shoes with a pink ribbon about a yard in breadth flaming out as she twirled in a polka in the arms of Monsieur de Springbock the German diplomatist with a green wreath on her head and the blackest hair this individual set eyes on seeing I say before me a charming young woman whisking beautifully in a beautiful dance and presenting as she wound and wound round the room now a full face then a three quarter face then a profile a face in fine which in every way you saw it looked pretty and rosy and happy I felt as I trust a not unbecoming curiosity regarding the owner of this pleasant countenance and asked Wagley who was standing by in conversation with an acquaintance who was the lady in question Which says Wagley That one with the coal black eyes I replied Hush says he and the gentleman with whom he was talking moved off with rather a discomfited air When he was gone Wagley burst out laughing COAL BLACK eyes said he you ve just hit it That s missus Sackville Maine and that was her husband who just went away He s a coal merchant Snob my boy and I have no doubt mister Perkins s Wallsends are supplied from his wharf He is in a flaming furnace when he hears coals mentioned He and his wife and his mother are very proud of missus Sackville s family she was a Miss Chuff daughter of Captain Chuff R N That is the widow that stout woman in crimson tabinet battling about the odd trick with old mister Dumps at the card table And so in fact it was Sackville Maine whose name is a hundred times more elegant surely than that of Chuff was blest with a pretty wife and a genteel mother in law both of whom some people may envy him Soon after his marriage the old lady was good enough to come and pay him a visit just for a fortnight at his pretty little cottage Kennington Oval and such is her affection for the place has never quitted it these four years She has also brought her son Nelson Collingwood Chuff to live with her but he is not so much at home as his mamma going as a day boy to Merchant Taylors School where he is getting a sound classical education If these beings so closely allied to his wife and so justly dear to her may be considered as drawbacks to Maine s happiness what man is there that has not some things in life to complain of And when I first knew mister Maine no man seemed more comfortable than he His cottage was a picture of elegance and comfort his table and cellar were excellently and neatly supplied There was every enjoyment but no ostentation The omnibus took him to business of a morning the boat brought him back to the happiest of homes where he would while away the long evenings by reading out the fashionable novels to the ladies as they worked or accompany his wife on the flute which he played elegantly or in any one of the hundred pleasing and innocent amusements of the domestic circle missus Chuff covered the drawing rooms with prodigious tapestries the work of her hands missus Sackville had a particular genius for making covers of tape or network for these tapestried cushions She could make home made wines She could make preserves and pickles She had an album into which during the time of his courtship Sackville Maine bad written choice scraps of Byron s and Moore s poetry analogous to his own situation and in a fine mercantile hand She had a large manuscript receipt book every quality in a word which indicated a virtuous and well bred English female mind And as for Nelson Collingwood Sackville would say laughing we couldn t do without him in the house If he didn t spoil the tapestry we should be over cushioned in a few months and whom could we get but him to drink Laura s home made wine The truth is the gents who came from the City to dine at the Oval could not be induced to drink it in which fastidiousness I myself when I grew to be intimate with the family confess that I shared And yet sir that green ginger has been drunk by some of England s proudest heroes missus Chuff would exclaim Admiral Lord Exmouth tasted and praised it sir on board Captain Chuff s ship the Nebuchadnezzar seventy four at Algiers and he had three dozen with turn in the Pitchfork frigate a part of which was served out to the men before he went into his immortal action with the Furibonde Captain Choufleur in the Gulf of Panama All this though the old dowager told us the story every day when the wine was produced never served to get rid of any quantity of it and the green ginger though it had fired British tars for combat and victory was not to the taste of us peaceful and degenerate gents of modern times I see Sackville now as on the occasion when presented by Wagley I paid my first visit to him It was in July a Sunday afternoon Sackville Maine was coming from church with his wife on one arm and his mother ill law in red tabinet as usual on the other A half grown or hobbadehoyish footman so to speak walked after them carrying their shining golden prayer books the ladies had splendid parasols with tags and fringes missus Chuff s great gold watch fastened to her stomach gleamed there like a ball of fire Nelson Collingwood was in the distance shying stones at an old horse on Kennington Common Twas on that verdant spot we met nor can I ever forget the majestic courtesy of missus Chuff as she remembered having had the pleasure of seeing me at missus Perkins s nor the glance of scorn which she threw at an unfortunate gentleman who was preaching an exceedingly desultory discourse to a sceptical audience of omnibus cads and nurse maids on a tub as we passed by I cannot help it sir says she I am the widow of an officer of Britain s Navy I was taught to honour my Church and my King and I cannot bear a Radical or a Dissenter With these fine principles I found Sackville Maine impressed Wagley said he to my introducer if no better engagement why shouldn t self and friend dine at the Oval mister Snob sir the mutton s coming off the spit at this very minute Laura and missus Chuff he said LAURAR and missus Chuff but I hate people who make remarks on these peculiarities of pronunciation will be most happy to see you and I can promise you a hearty welcome and as good a glass of port wine as any in England This is better than dining at the Sarcophagus thinks I to myself at which Club Wagley and I had intended to take our meal and so we accepted the kindly invitation whence arose afterwards a considerable intimacy Everything about this family and house was so good natured comfortable and well conditioned that a cynic would have ceased to growl there missus Laura was all graciousness and smiles and looked to as great advantage in her pretty morning gown as in her dress robe at missus Perkins s missus Chuff fired off her stories about the Nebuchadnezzar seventy four the action between the Pitchfork and the Furibonde the heroic resistance of Captain Choufleur and the quantity of snuff he took c c which as they were heard for the first time were pleasanter than I have subsequently found them Sackville Maine was the best of hosts He agreed in everything everybody said altering his opinions without the slightest reservation upon the slightest possible contradiction He was not one of those beings who would emulate a Schonbein or Friar Bacon or act the part of an incendiary towards the Thames his neighbour but a good kind simple honest easy fellow in love with his wife well disposed to all the world content with himself content even with his mother in law Nelson Collingwood I remember in the course of the evening when whisky and water was for some reason produced grew a little tipsy This did not in the least move Sackville s equanimity Take him upstairs Joseph said he to the hobbadehoy and Joseph don t tell his mamma What could make a man so happily disposed unhappy What could cause discomfort bickering and estrangement in a family so friendly and united Ladies it was not my fault it was missus Chuff s doing but the rest of the tale you shall have on a future day CHAPTER XLIII CLUB SNOBS The misfortune which befell the simple and good natured young Sackville arose entirely from that abominable Sarcophagus Club and that he ever entered it was partly the fault of the present writer For seeing missus Chuff his mother in law had a taste for the genteel indeed her talk was all about Lord Collingwood Lord Gambier Sir Jahaleel Brenton and the Gosport and Plymouth balls Wagley and I according to our wont trumped her conversation and talked about Lords Dukes Marquises and Baronets as if those dignitaries were our familiar friends Lord Sextonbury says I seems to have recovered her ladyship s death He and the Duke were very jolly over their wine at the Sarcophagus last night weren t they Wagley Good fellow the Duke Wagley replied Pray ma am to missus Chuff you who know the world and etiquette will you tell me what a man ought to do in my case Last June his Grace his son Lord Castlerampant Tom Smith and myself were dining at the Club when I offered the odds against DADDYLONGLEGS for the Derby forty to one in sovereigns only His Grace took the bet and of course I won He has never paid me Now can I ask such a great man for a sovereign One more lump of sugar if you please my dear madam It was lucky Wagley gave her this opportunity to elude the question for it prostrated the whole worthy family among whom we were They telegraphed each other with wondering eyes missus Chuff s stories about the naval nobility grew quite faint and kind little missus Sackville became uneasy and went upstairs to look at the children not at that young monster Nelson Collingwood who was sleeping off the whisky and water but at a couple of little ones who had made their appearance at dessert and of whom she and Sackville were the happy parents The end of this and subsequent meetings with mister Maine was that we proposed and got him elected as a member of the Sarcophagus Club It was not done without a deal of opposition the secret having been whispered that the candidate was a coal merchant You may be sure some of the proud people and most of the parvenus of the Club were ready to blackball him We combated this opposition successfully however We pointed out to the parvenus that the Lambtons and the Stuarts sold coals we mollified the proud by accounts of his good birth good nature and good behaviour and Wagley went about on the day of election describing with great eloquence the action between the Pitchfork and the Furibonde and the valour of Captain Maine our friend s father There was a slight mistake in the narrative but we carried our man with only a trifling sprinkling of black beans in the boxes Byles s of course who blackballs everybody and Bung s who looks down upon a coal merchant having himself lately retired from the wine trade Some fortnight afterwards I saw Sackville Maine under the following circumstances He was showing the Club to his family He had brought them thither in the light blue fly waiting at the Club door with missus Chuff s hobbadehoy footboy on the box by the side of the flyman in a sham livery Nelson Collingwood pretty missus Sackville missus Captain Chuff missus Commodore Chuff we call her were all there the latter of course in the vermilion tabinet which splendid as it is is nothing in comparison to the splendour of the Sarcophagus The delighted Sackville Maine was pointing out the beauties of the place to them It seemed as beautiful as Paradise to that little party The Sarcophagus displays every known variety of architecture and decoration The great library is Elizabethan the small library is pointed Gothic the dining room is severe Doric the strangers room has an Egyptian look the drawing rooms are Louis Quatorze so called because the hideous ornaments displayed were used in the time of Louis Quinze the CORTILE or hall is Morisco Italian It is all over marble maplewood looking glasses arabesques ormolu and scagliola Scrolls ciphers dragons Cupids polyanthuses and other flowers writhe up the walls in every kind of cornucopiosity Fancy every gentleman in Jullien s band playing with all his might and each performing a different tune the ornaments at our Club the Sarcophagus so bewilder and affect me Dazzled with emotions which I cannot describe and which she dared not reveal missus Chuff followed by her children and son in law walked wondering amongst these blundering splendours In the great library two hundred twenty five feet long by one hundred fifty the only man missus Chuff saw was Tiggs He was lying on a crimson velvet sofa reading a French novel of Paul de Kock It was a very little book He is a very little man In that enormous hall he looked like a mere speck As the ladies passed breathless and trembling in the vastness of the magnificent solitude he threw a knowing killing glance at the fair strangers as much as to say Ain t I a fine fellow They thought so I am sure WHO IS THAT hisses out missus Chuff when we were about fifty yards off him at the other end of the room Tiggs says I in a similar whisper Pretty comfortable this isn t it my dear says Maine in a free and easy way to missus Sackville all the magazines you see writing materials new works choice library containing every work of importance what have we here Dugdale s Monasticon a most valuable and I believe entertaining book And proposing to take down one of the books for missus Maine s inspection he selected Volume VII to which he was attracted by the singular fact that a brass door handle grew out of the back Instead of pulling out a book however he pulled open a cupboard only inhabited by a lazy housemaid s broom and duster at which he looked exceedingly discomfited while Nelson Collingwood losing all respect burst into a roar of laughter That s the rummest book I ever saw says Nelson I wish we d no others at Merchant Taylors Hush Nelson cries missus Chuff and we went into the other magnificent apartments How they did admire the drawing room hangings pink and silver brocade most excellent wear for London and calculated the price per yard and revelled on the luxurious sofas and gazed on the immeasurable looking glasses Pretty well to shave by eh says Maine to his mother in law He was getting more abominably conceited every minute Get away Sackville says she quite delighted and threw a glance over her shoulder and spread out the wings of the red tabinet and took a good look at herself so did missus Sackville just one and I thought the glass reflected a very smiling pretty creature But what s a woman at a looking glass Bless the little dears it s their place They fly to it naturally It pleases them and they adorn it What I like to see and watch with increasing joy and adoration is the Club MEN at the great looking glasses Old Gills pushing up his collars and grinning at his own mottled face Hulker looking solemnly at his great person and tightening his coat to give himself a waist Fred Minchin simpering by as he is going out to dine and casting upon the reflection of his white neckcloth a pleased moony smile What a deal of vanity that Club mirror has reflected to be sure Well the ladies went through the whole establishment with perfect pleasure They beheld the coffee rooms and the little tables laid for dinner and the gentlemen who were taking their lunch and old Jawkins thundering away as usual they saw the reading rooms and the rush for the evening papers they saw the kitchens those wonders of art where the CHEF was presiding over twenty pretty kitchen maids and ten thousand shining saucepans and they got into the light blue fly perfectly bewildered with pleasure Sackville did not enter it though little Laura took the back seat on purpose and left him the front place alongside of missus Chuff s red tabinet We have your favourite dinner says she in a timid voice won t you come Sackville I shall take a chop here to day my dear Sackville replied Home James And he went up the steps of the Sarcophagus and the pretty face looked very sad out of the carriage as the blue fly drove away CHAPTER XLIV CLUB SNOBS Why Why did I and Wagley ever do so cruel an action as to introduce young Sackville Maine into that odious Sarcophagus Let our imprudence and his example be a warning to other gents let his fate and that of his poor wife be remembered by every British female The consequences of his entering the Club were as follows One of the first vices the unhappy wretch acquired in this abode of frivolity was that of SMOKING Some of the dandies of the Club such as the Marquis of Macabaw Lord Doodeen and fellows of that high order are in the habit of indulging in this propensity upstairs in the billiard rooms of the Sarcophagus and partly to make their acquaintance partly from a natural aptitude for crime Sackville Maine followed them and became an adept in the odious custom Where it is introduced into a family I need not say how sad the consequences are both to the furniture and the morals Sackville smoked in his dining room at home and caused an agony to his wife and mother in law which I do not venture to describe He then became a professed BILLIARD PLAYER wasting hours upon hours at that amusement betting freely playing tolerably losing awfully to Captain Spot and colonel Cannon He played matches of a hundred games with these gentlemen and would not only continue until four or five o clock in the morning at this work but would be found at the Club of a forenoon indulging himself to the detriment of his business the ruin of his health and the neglect of his wife From billiards to whist is but a step and when a man gets to whist and five pounds on a rubber my opinion is that it is all up with him How was the coal business to go on and the connection of the firm to be kept up and the senior partner always at the card table Consorting now with genteel persons and Pall Mall bucks Sackville became ashamed of his snug little residence in Kennington Oval and transported his family to Pimlico where though missus Chuff his mother in law was at first happy as the quarter was elegant and near her Sovereign poor little Laura and the children found a woful difference Where were her friends who came in with their work of a morning At Kennington and in the vicinity of Clapham Where were her children s little playmates On Kennington Common The great thundering carriages that roared up and down the drab coloured streets of the new quarter contained no friends for the sociable little Laura The children that paced the squares attended by a BONNE or a prim governess were not like those happy ones that flew kites or played hop scotch on the well beloved old Common And ah what a difference at Church too between saint Benedict s of Pimlico with open seats service in sing song tapers albs surplices garlands and processions and the honest old ways of Kennington The footmen too attending saint Benedict s were so splendid and enormous that James missus Chuff s boy trembled amongst them and said he would give warning rather than carry the books to that church any more The furnishing of the house was not done without expense And ye gods what a difference there was between Sackville s dreary French banquets in Pimlico and the jolly dinners at the Oval No more legs of mutton no more of the best port wine in England but ENTREES on plate and dismal twopenny champagne and waiters in gloves and the Club bucks for company among whom missus Chuff was uneasy and missus Sackville quite silent Not that he dined at home often The wretch had become a perfect epicure and dined commonly at the Club with the gormandising clique there with old Doctor Maw Colonel Cramley who is as lean as a greyhound and has jaws like a jack and the rest of them Here you might see the wretch tippling Sillery champagne and gorging himself with French viands and I often looked with sorrow from my table on which cold meat the Club small beer and a half pint of Marsala form the modest banquet and sighed to think it was my work And there were other beings present to my repentant thoughts Where s his wife thought I Where s poor good kind little Laura At this very moment it s about the nursery bed time and while yonder good for nothing is swilling his wine the little ones are at Laura s knees lisping their prayers and she is teaching them to say Pray God bless Papa When she has put them to bed her day s occupation is gone and she is utterly lonely all night and sad and waiting for him Oh for shame Oh for shame Go home thou idle tippler How Sackville lost his health how he lost his business how he got into scrapes how he got into debt how he became a railroad director how the Pimlico house was shut up how he went to Boulogne all this I could tell only I am too much ashamed of my part of the transaction They returned to England because to the surprise of everybody missus Chuff came down with a great sum of money which nobody knew she had saved and paid his liabilities He is in England but at Kennington His name is taken off the books of the Sarcophagus long ago When we meet he crosses over to the other side of the street I don t call as I should be sorry to see a look of reproach or sadness in Laura s sweet face Not however all evil as I am proud to think has been the influence of the Snob of England upon Clubs in general Captain Shindy is afraid to bully the waiters any more and eats his mutton chop without moving Acheron Gobemouche does not take more than two papers at a time for his private reading Tiggs does not ring the bell and cause the library waiter to walk about a quarter of a mile in order to give him Vol II which lies on the next table Growler has ceased to walk from table to table in the coffee room and inspect what people are having for dinner Trotty Veck takes his own umbrella from the hall the cotton one and Sydney Scraper s paletot lined with silk has been brought back by Jobbins who entirely mistook it for his own Wiggle has discontinued telling stories about the ladies he has killed Snooks does not any more think it gentlemanlike to blackball attorneys Snuffler no longer publicly spreads out his great red cotton pocket handkerchief before the fire for the admiration of two hundred gentlemen and if one Club Snob has been brought back to the paths of rectitude and if one poor John has been spared a journey or a scolding say friends and brethren if these sketches of Club Snobs have been in vain CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON SNOBS How it is that we have come to No forty five of this present series of papers my dear friends and brother Snobs I hardly know but for a whole mortal year have we been together prattling and abusing the human race and were we to live for a hundred years more I believe there is plenty of subject for conversation in the enormous theme of Snobs The national mind is awakened to the subject Letters pour in every day conveying marks of sympathy directing the attention of the Snob of England to races of Snobs yet undescribed Where are your Theatrical Snobs your Commercial Snobs your Medical and Chirurgical Snobs your Official Snobs your Legal Snobs your Artistical Snobs your Musical Snobs your Sporting Snobs write my esteemed correspondents Surely you are not going to miss the Cambridge Chancellor election and omit showing up your Don Snobs who are coming cap in hand to a young Prince of six and twenty and to implore him to be the chief of their renowned University writes a friend who seals with the signet of the Cam and Isis Club Pray pray cries another now the Operas are opening give us a lecture about Omnibus Snobs Indeed I should like to write a chapter about the Snobbish Dons very much and another about the Snobbish Dandies Of my dear Theatrical Snobs I think with a pang and I can hardly break away from some Snobbish artists with whom I have long long intended to have a palaver But what s the use of delaying When these were done there would be fresh Snobs to pourtray The labour is endless No single man could complete it Here are but fifty two bricks and a pyramid to build It is best to stop As Jones always quits the room as soon as he has said his good thing as Cincinnatus and General Washington both retired into private life in the height of their popularity as Prince Albert when he laid the first stone of the Exchange left the bricklayers to complete that edifice and went home to his royal dinner as the poet Bunn comes forward at the end of the season and with feelings too tumultuous to describe blesses his KYIND friends over the footlights so friends in the flush of conquest and the splendour of victory amid the shouts and the plaudits of a people triumphant yet modest the Snob of England bids ye farewell But only for a season Not for ever No no There is one celebrated author whom I admire very much who has been taking leave of the public any time these ten years in his prefaces and always comes back again when everybody is glad to see him How can he have the heart to be saying good bye so often I believe that Bunn is affected when he blesses the people Parting is always painful Even the familiar bore is dear to you I should be sorry to shake hands even with Jawkins for the last time I think a well constituted convict on coming home from transportation ought to be rather sad when he takes leave of Van Diemen s Land When the curtain goes down on the last night of a pantomime poor old clown must be very dismal depend on it Ha with what joy he rushes forward on the evening of the twenty sixth of December next and says How are you Here we are But I am growing too sentimental to return to the theme THE NATIONAL MIND IS AWAKENED TO THE SUBJECT OF SNOBS The word Snob has taken a place in our honest English vocabulary We can t define it perhaps We can t say what it is any more than we can define wit or humour or humbug but we KNOW what it is Some weeks since happening to have the felicity to sit next to a young lady at a hospitable table where poor old Jawkins was holding forth in a very absurd pompous manner I wrote upon the spotless damask S B and called my neighbour s attention to the little remark That young lady smiled She knew it at once Her mind straightway filled up the two letters concealed by apostrophic reserve and I read in her assenting eyes that she knew Jawkins was a Snob You seldom get them to make use of the word as yet it is true but it is inconceivable how pretty an expression their little smiling mouths assume when they speak it out If any young lady doubts just let her go up to her own room look at herself steadily in the glass and say Snob If she tries this simple experiment my life for it she will smile and own that the word becomes her mouth amazingly A pretty little round word all composed of soft letters with a hiss at the beginning just to make it piquant as it were Jawkins meanwhile went on blundering and bragging and boring quite unconsciously And so he will no doubt go on roaring and braying to the end of time or at least so long as people will hear him You cannot alter the nature of men and Snobs by any force of satire as by laying ever so many stripes on a donkey s back you can t turn him into a zebra But we can warn the neighbourhood that the person whom they and Jawkins admire is an impostor We apply the Snob test to him and try whether he is conceited and a quack whether pompous and lacking humility whether uncharitable and proud of his narrow soul How does he treat a great man how regard a small one How does he comport himself in the presence of His Grace the Duke and how in that of Smith the tradesman And it seems to me that all English society is cursed by this mammoniacal superstition and that we are sneaking and bowing and cringing on the one hand or bullying and scorning on the other from the lowest to the highest My wife speaks with great circumspection proper pride she calls it to our neighbour the tradesman s lady and she I mean missus Snob Eliza would give one of her eyes to go to Court as her cousin the Captain s wife did She again is a good soul but it costs her agonies to be obliged to confess that we live in Upper Thompson Street Somers Town And though I believe in her heart missus Whiskerington is fonder of us than of her cousins the Smigsmags you should hear how she goes on prattling about Lady Smigsmag and I said to Sir John my dear John and about the Smigsmags house and parties in Hyde Park Terrace Lady Smigsmag when she meets Eliza who is a sort of a kind of a species of a connection of the family pokes out one finger which my wife is at liberty to embrace in the most cordial manner she can devise But oh you should see her ladyship s behaviour on her first chop dinner party days when Lord and Lady Longears come I can bear it no longer this diabolical invention of gentility which kills natural kindliness and honest friendship Proper pride indeed Rank and precedence forsooth The table of ranks and degrees is a lie and should be flung into the fire Organize rank and precedence that was well for the masters of ceremonies of former ages Come forward some great marshal and organize Equality in society and your rod shall swallow up all the juggling old court goldsticks If this is not gospel truth if the world does not tend to this if hereditary great man worship is not a humbug and an idolatry let us have the Stuarts back again and crop the Free Press s ears in the pillory If ever our cousins the Smigsmags asked me to meet Lord Longears I would like to take an opportunity after dinner and say in the most good natured way in the world Sir Fortune makes you a present of a number of thousand pounds every year The ineffable wisdom of our ancestors has placed you as a chief and hereditary legislator over me Our admirable Constitution the pride of Britons and envy of surrounding nations obliges me to receive you as my senator superior and guardian Your eldest son Fitz Heehaw is sure of a place in Parliament your younger sons the De Brays will kindly condescend to be post captains and lieutenants colonels and to represent us in foreign courts or to take a good living when it falls convenient These prizes our admirable Constitution the pride and envy of c pronounces to be your due without count of your dulness your vices your selfishness or your entire incapacity and folly Dull as you may be and we have as good a right to assume that my lord is an ass as the other proposition that he is an enlightened patriot dull I say as you may be no one will accuse you of such monstrous folly as to suppose that you are indifferent to the good luck which you possess or have any inclination to part with it No and patriots as we are under happier circumstances Smith and I I have no doubt were we dukes ourselves would stand by our order We would submit good naturedly to sit in a high place We would acquiesce in that admirable Constitution pride and envy of c which made us chiefs and the world our inferiors we would not cavil particularly at that notion of hereditary superiority which brought many simple people cringing to our knees May be we would rally round the Corn Laws we would make a stand against the Reform Bill we would die rather than repeal the Acts against Catholics and Dissenters we would by our noble system of class legislation bring Ireland to its present admirable condition But Smith and I are not Earls as yet We don t believe that it is for the interest of Smith s army that De Bray should be a Colonel at five and twenty of Smith s diplomatic relations that Lord Longears should go Ambassador to Constantinople of our politics that Longears should put his hereditary foot into them This bowing and cringing Smith believes to be the act of Snobs and he will do all in his might and main to be a Snob and to submit to Snobs no longer To Longears he says We can t help seeing Longears that we are as good as you We can spell even better can think quite as rightly we will not have you for our master or black your shoes any more Your footmen do it but they are paid and the fellow who comes to get a list of the company when you give a banquet or a dancing breakfast at Longueoreille House gets money from the newspapers for performing that service But for us thank you for nothing Longears my boy and we don t wish to pay you any more than we owe We will take off our hats to Wellington because he is Wellington but to you who are you I am sick of COURT CIRCULARS I loathe HAUT TON intelligence I believe such words as Fashionable Exclusive Aristocratic and the like to be wicked unchristian epithets that ought to be banished from honest vocabularies A Court system that sends men of genius to the second table I hold to be a Snobbish system A society that sets up to be polite and ignores Arts and Letters I hold to be a Snobbish society You who despise your neighbour are a Snob you who forget your own friends meanly to follow after those of a higher degree are a Snob you who are ashamed of your poverty and blush for your calling are a Snob as are you who boast of your pedigree or are proud of your wealth To laugh at such is mister PUNCH S business May he laugh honestly hit no foul blow and tell the truth when at his very broadest grin never forgetting that if Fun is good Truth
