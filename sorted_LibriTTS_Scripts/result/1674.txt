LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER MASTER CERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH HER BIRTH AND PARENTAGE THE subject of this biography SOJOURNER TRUTH as she now calls herself but whose name originally was Isabella was born as near as she can now calculate between the years seventeen ninety seven and eighteen hundred She was the daughter of James and Betsey slaves of one Colonel Ardinburgh Hurley Ulster County New York Colonel Ardinburgh belonged to that class of people called Low Dutch Of her first master she can give no account as she must have been a mere infant when he died and she with her parents and some ten or twelve other fellow human chattels became the legal property of his son Charles Ardinburgh She distinctly remembers hearing her father and mother say that their lot was a fortunate one as Master Charles was the best of the family being comparatively speaking a kind master to his slaves James and Betsey having by their faithfulness docility and respectful behavior won his particular regard received from him particular favors among which was a lot of land lying back on the slope of a mountain where by improving the pleasant evenings and Sundays they managed to raise a little tobacco corn or flax which they exchanged for extras in the articles of food or clothing for themselves and children She has no remembrance that Saturday afternoon was ever added to their own time as it is by some masters in the Southern States ACCOMMODATIONS Among Isabella s earliest recollections was the removal of her master Charles Ardinburgh into his new house which he had built for a hotel soon after the decease of his father A cellar under this hotel was assigned to his slaves as their sleeping apartment all the slaves he possessed of both sexes sleeping as is quite common in a state of slavery in the same room She carries in her mind to this day a vivid picture of this dismal chamber its only lights consisting of a few panes of glass through which she thinks the sun never shone but with thrice reflected rays and the space between the loose boards of the floor and the uneven earth below was often filled with mud and water the uncomfortable splashings of which were as annoying as its noxious vapors must have been chilling and fatal to health She shudders even now as she goes back in memory and revisits this cellar and sees its inmates of both sexes and all ages sleeping on those damp boards like the horse with a little straw and a blanket and she wonders not at the rheumatisms and fever sores and palsies that distorted the limbs and racked the bodies of those fellow slaves in after life Still she does not attribute this cruelty for cruelty it certainly is to be so unmindful of the health and comfort of any being leaving entirely out of sight his more important part his everlasting interests so much to any innate or constitutional cruelty of the master as to that gigantic inconsistency that inherited habit among slaveholders of expecting a willing and intelligent obedience from the slave because he is a MAN at the same time every thing belonging to the soul harrowing system does its best to crush the last vestige of a man within him and when it is crushed and often before he is denied the comforts of life on the plea that he knows neither the want nor the use of them and because he is considered to be little more or little less than a beast HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS Isabella s father was very tall and straight when young which gave him the name of Bomefree low Dutch for tree at least this is SOJOURNER s pronunciation of it and by this name he usually went The most familiar appellation of her mother was Mau mau Bett She was the mother of some ten or twelve children though Sojourner is far from knowing the exact number of her brothers and sisters she being the youngest save one and all older than herself having been sold before her remembrance She was privileged to behold six of them while she remained a slave Of the two that immediately preceded her in age a boy of five years and a girl of three who were sold when she was an infant she heard much and she wishes that all who would fain believe that slave parents have not natural affection for their offspring could have listened as she did while Bomefree and Mau mau Bett their dark cellar lighted by a blazing pine knot would sit for hours recalling and recounting every endearing as well as harrowing circumstance that taxed memory could supply from the histories of those dear departed ones of whom they had been robbed and for whom their hearts still bled Among the rest they would relate how the little boy on the last morning he was with them arose with the birds kindled a fire calling for his Mau mau to come for all was now ready for her little dreaming of the dreadful separation which was so near at hand but of which his parents had an uncertain but all the more cruel foreboding There was snow on the ground at the time of which we are speaking and a large old fashioned sleigh was seen to drive up to the door of the late colonel Ardinburgh This event was noticed with childish pleasure by the unsuspicious boy but when he was taken and put into the sleigh and saw his little sister actually shut and locked into the sleigh box his eyes were at once opened to their intentions and like a frightened deer he sprang from the sleigh and running into the house concealed himself under a bed But this availed him little He was re conveyed to the sleigh and separated for ever from those whom God had constituted his natural guardians and protectors and who should have found him in return a stay and a staff to them in their declining years But I make no comments on facts like these knowing that the heart of every slave parent will make its own comments involuntarily and correctly as soon as each heart shall make the case its own Those who are not parents will draw their conclusions from the promptings of humanity and philanthropy these enlightened by reason and revelation are also unerring HER RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION Isabella and Peter her youngest brother remained with their parents the legal property of Charles Ardinburgh till his decease which took place when Isabella was near nine years old After this event she was often surprised to find her mother in tears and when in her simplicity she inquired Mau mau what makes you cry she would answer Oh my child I am thinking of your brothers and sisters that have been sold away from me And she would proceed to detail many circumstances respecting them But Isabella long since concluded that it was the impending fate of her only remaining children which her mother but too well understood even then that called up those memories from the past and made them crucify her heart afresh In the evening when her mother s work was done she would sit down under the sparkling vault of heaven and calling her children to her would talk to them of the only Being that could effectually aid or protect them Her teachings were delivered in Low Dutch her only language and translated into English ran nearly as follows My children there is a God who hears and sees you A God mau mau Where does he live asked the children He lives in the sky she replied and when you are beaten or cruelly treated or fall into any trouble you must ask help of him and he will always hear and help you She taught them to kneel and say the Lord s Prayer She entreated them to refrain from lying and stealing and to strive to obey their masters At times a groan would escape her and she would break out in the language of the Psalmist Oh Lord how long Oh Lord how long And in reply to Isabella s question What ails you mau mau her only answer was Oh a good deal ails me Enough ails me Then again she would point them to the stars and say in her peculiar language Those are the same stars and that is the same moon that look down upon your brothers and sisters and which they see as they look up to them though they are ever so far away from us and each other Thus in her humble way did she endeavor to show them their Heavenly Father as the only being who could protect them in their perilous condition at the same time she would strengthen and brighten the chain of family affection which she trusted extended itself sufficiently to connect the widely scattered members of her precious flock These instructions of the mother were treasured up and held sacred by Isabella as our future narrative will show THE AUCTION At length the never to be forgotten day of the terrible auction arrived when the slaves horses and other cattle of Charles Ardinburgh deceased were to be put under the hammer and again change masters Not only Isabella and Peter but their mother were now destined to the auction block and would have been struck off with the rest to the highest bidder but for the following circumstance A question arose among the heirs Who shall be burdened with Bomefree when we have sent away his faithful Mau mau Bett He was becoming weak and infirm his limbs were painfully rheumatic and distorted more from exposure and hardship than from old age though he was several years older than Mau mau Bett he was no longer considered of value but must soon be a burden and care to some one After some contention on the point at issue none being willing to be burdened with him it was finally agreed as most expedient for the heirs that the price of Mau mau Bett should be sacrificed and she receive her freedom on condition that she take care of and support her faithful James faithful not only to her as a husband but proverbially faithful as a slave to those who would not willingly sacrifice a dollar for his comfort now that he had commenced his descent into the dark vale of decrepitude and suffering This important decision was received as joyful news indeed to our ancient couple who were the objects of it and who were trying to prepare their hearts for a severe struggle and one altogether new to them as they had never before been separated for though ignorant helpless crushed in spirit and weighed down with hardship and cruel bereavement they were still human and their human hearts beat within them with as true an affection as ever caused a human heart to beat And their anticipated separation now in the decline of life after the last child had been torn from them must have been truly appalling Another privilege was granted them that of remaining occupants of the same dark humid cellar I have before described otherwise they were to support themselves as they best could And as her mother was still able to do considerable work and her father a little they got on for some time very comfortably The strangers who rented the house were humane people and very kind to them they were not rich and owned no slaves How long this state of things continued we are unable to say as Isabella had not then sufficiently cultivated her organ of time to calculate years or even weeks or hours But she thinks her mother must have lived several years after the death of Master Charles She remembers going to visit her parents some three or four times before the death of her mother and a good deal of time seemed to her to intervene between each visit At length her mother s health began to decline a fever sore made its ravages on one of her limbs and the palsy began to shake her frame still she and James tottered about picking up a little here and there which added to the mites contributed by their kind neighbors sufficed to sustain life and drive famine from the door DEATH OF MAU MAU BETT One morning in early autumn from the reason above mentioned we cannot tell what year Mau mau Bett told James she would make him a loaf of rye bread and get missus Simmons their kind neighbor to bake it for them as she would bake that forenoon James told her he had engaged to rake after the cart for his neighbors that morning but before he commenced he would pole off some apples from a tree near which they were allowed to gather and if she could get some of them baked with the bread it would give a nice relish for their dinner He beat off the apples and soon after saw Mau mau Bett come out and gather them up At the blowing of the horn for dinner he groped his way into his cellar anticipating his humble but warm and nourishing meal when lo instead of being cheered by the sight and odor of fresh baked bread and the savory apples his cellar seemed more cheerless than usual and at first neither sight nor sound met eye or ear But on groping his way through the room his staff which he used as a pioneer to go before and warn him of danger seemed to be impeded in its progress and a low gurgling choking sound proceeded from the object before him giving him the first intimation of the truth as it was that Mau mau Bett his bosom companion the only remaining member of his large family had fallen in a fit of the palsy and lay helpless and senseless on the earth Who among us located in pleasant homes surrounded with every comfort and so many kind and sympathizing friends can picture to ourselves the dark and desolate state of poor old James penniless weak lame and nearly blind as he was at the moment he found his companion was removed from him and he was left alone in the world with no one to aid comfort or console him for she never revived again and lived only a few hours after being discovered senseless by her poor bereaved James LAST DAYS OF BOMEFREE Isabella and Peter were permitted to see the remains of their mother laid in their last narrow dwelling and to make their bereaved father a little visit ere they returned to their servitude And most piteous were the lamentations of the poor old man when at last they also were obliged to bid him Farewell Juan Fernandes on his desolate island was not so pitiable an object as this poor lame man Blind and crippled he was too superannuated to think for a moment of taking care of himself and he greatly feared no persons would interest themselves in his behalf Oh he would exclaim I had thought God would take me first Mau mau was so much smarter than I and could get about and take care of herself and I am so old and so helpless What is to become of me I can t do anything any more my children are all gone and here I am left helpless and alone And then as I was taking leave of him said his daughter in relating it he raised his voice and cried aloud like a child Oh how he DID cry I HEAR it now and remember it as well as if it were but yesterday poor old man He thought God had done it all and my heart bled within me at the sight of his misery He begged me to get permission to come and see him sometimes which I readily and heartily promised him But when all had left him the Ardinburghs having some feeling left for their faithful and favorite slave took turns about in keeping him permitting him to stay a few weeks at one house and then a while at another and so around If when he made a removal the place where he was going was not too far off he took up his line of march staff in hand and asked for no assistance If it was twelve or twenty miles they gave him a ride While he was living in this way Isabella was twice permitted to visit him Another time she walked twelve miles and carried her infant in her arms to see him but when she reached the place where she hoped to find him he had just left for a place some twenty miles distant and she never saw him more The last time she did see him she found him seated on a rock by the road side alone and far from any house He was then migrating from the house of one Ardinburgh to that of another several miles distant His hair was white like wool he was almost blind and his gait was more a creep than a walk but the weather was warm and pleasant and he did not dislike the journey When Isabella addressed him he recognized her voice and was exceeding glad to see her He was assisted to mount the wagon was carried back to the famous cellar of which we have spoken and there they held their last earthly conversation He again as usual bewailed his loneliness spoke in tones of anguish of his many children saying They are all taken away from me I have now not one to give me a cup of cold water why should I live and not die Isabella whose heart yearned over her father and who would have made any sacrifice to have been able to be with and take care of him tried to comfort by telling him that she had heard the white folks say that all the slaves in the State would be freed in ten years and that then she would come and take care of him I would take just as good care of you as Mau mau would if she was here continued Isabel Oh my child replied he I cannot live that long Oh do daddy do live and I will take such good care of you was her rejoinder She now says Why I thought then in my ignorance that he could live if he would I just as much thought so as I ever thought any thing in my life and I insisted on his living but he shook his head and insisted he could not But before Bomefree s good constitution would yield either to age exposure or a strong desire to die the Ardinburghs again tired of him and offered freedom to two old slaves Caesar brother of Mau mau Bett and his wife Betsy on condition that they should take care of James I was about to say their brother in law but as slaves are neither husbands nor wives in law the idea of their being brothers in law is truly ludicrous And although they were too old and infirm to take care of themselves Caesar having been afflicted for a long time with fever sores and his wife with the jaundice they eagerly accepted the boon of freedom which had been the life long desire of their souls though at a time when emancipation was to them little more than destitution and was a freedom more to be desired by the master than the slave Sojourner declares of the slaves in their ignorance that their thoughts are no longer than her finger DEATH OF BOMEFREE A rude cabin in a lone wood far from any neighbors was granted to our freed friends as the only assistance they were now to expect Bomefree from this time found his poor needs hardly supplied as his new providers were scarce able to administer to their own wants However the time drew near when things were to be decidedly worse rather than better for they had not been together long before Betty died and shortly after Caesar followed her to that bourne from whence no traveller returns leaving poor James again desolate and more helpless than ever before as this time there was no kind family in the house and the Ardinburghs no longer invited him to their homes Yet lone blind and helpless as he was James for a time lived on One day an aged colored woman named Soan called at his shanty and James besought her in the most moving manner even with tears to tarry awhile and wash and mend him up so that he might once more be decent and comfortable for he was suffering dreadfully with the filth and vermin that had collected upon him Soan was herself an emancipated slave old and weak with no one to care for her and she lacked the courage to undertake a job of such seeming magnitude fearing she might herself get sick and perish there without assistance and with great reluctance and a heart swelling with pity as she afterwards declared she felt obliged to leave him in his wretchedness and filth And shortly after her visit this faithful slave this deserted wreck of humanity was found on his miserable pallet frozen and stiff in death The kind angel had come at last and relieved him of the many miseries that his fellow man had heaped upon him Yes he had died chilled and starved with none to speak a kindly word or do a kindly deed for him in that last dread of hour of need The news of his death reached the ears of John Ardinburgh a grandson of the old Colonel and he declared that Bomefree who had ever been a kind and faithful slave should now have a good funeral And now gentle reader what think you constituted a good funeral Answer some black paint for the coffin and a jug of ardent spirits What a compensation for a life of toil of patient submission to repeated robberies of the most aggravated kind and also far more than murderous neglect Mankind often vainly attempts to atone for unkindness or cruelty to the living by honoring the same after death but John Ardinburgh undoubtably meant his pot of paint and jug of whisky should act as an opiate on his slaves rather than on his own seared conscience COMMENCEMENT OF ISABELLA S TRIALS IN LIFE Having seen the sad end of her parents so far as it relates to this earthly life we will return with Isabella to that memorable auction which threatened to separate her father and mother A slave auction is a terrible affair to its victims and its incidents and consequences are graven on their hearts as with a pen of burning steel At this memorable time Isabella was struck off for the sum of one hundred dollars to one John Nealy of Ulster County New York and she has an impression that in this sale she was connected with a lot of sheep She was now nine years of age and her trials in life may be dated from this period She says with emphasis Now the war begun She could only talk Dutch and the Nealys could only talk English mister Nealy could understand Dutch but Isabel and her mistress could neither of them understand the language of the other and this of itself was a formidable obstacle in the way of a good understanding between them and for some time was a fruitful source of dissatisfaction to the mistress and of punishment and suffering to Isabella She says If they sent me for a frying pan not knowing what they meant perhaps I carried them pot hooks and trammels Then oh how angry mistress would be with me Then she suffered terribly terribly with the cold During the winter her feet were badly frozen for want of proper covering They gave her a plenty to eat and also a plenty of whippings One Sunday morning in particular she was told to go to the barn on going there she found her master with a bundle of rods prepared in the embers and bound together with cords When he had tied her hands together before her he gave her the most cruel whipping she was ever tortured with He whipped her till the flesh was deeply lacerated and the blood streamed from her wounds and the scars remain to the present day to testify to the fact And now she says when I hear em tell of whipping women on the bare flesh it makes my flesh crawl and my very hair rise on my head Oh my God she continues what a way is this of treating human beings In those hours of her extremity she did not forget the instructions of her mother to go to God in all her trials and every affliction and she not only remembered but obeyed going to him and telling him all and asking Him if He thought it was right and begging him to protect and shield her from her persecutors She always asked with an unwavering faith that she should receive just what she pleaded for And now she says though it seems curious I do not remember ever asking for any thing but what I got it And I always received it as an answer to my prayers When I got beaten I never knew it long enough to go beforehand to pray and I always thought that if I only had had time to pray to God for help I should have escaped the beating She had no idea God had any knowledge of her thoughts save what she told him or heard her prayers unless they were spoken audibly And consequently she could not pray unless she had time and opportunity to go by herself where she could talk to God without being overheard TRIALS CONTINUED When she had been at mister Nealy s several months she began to beg God most earnestly to send her father to her and as soon as she commenced to pray she began as confidently to look for his coming and ere it was long to her great joy he came She had no opportunity to speak to him of the troubles that weighed so heavily on her spirit while he remained but when he left she followed him to the gate and unburdened her heart to him inquiring if he could not do something to get her a new and better place In this way the slaves often assist each other by ascertaining who are kind to their slaves comparatively and then using their influence to get such an one to hire or buy their friends and masters often from policy as well as from latent humanity allow those they are about to sell or let to choose their own places if the persons they happen to select for masters are considered safe pay He promised to do all he could and they parted But every day as long as the snow lasted for there was snow on the ground at the time she returned to the spot where they separated and walking in the tracks her father had made in the snow repeated her prayer that God would help her father get her a new and better place A long time had not elapsed when a fisherman by the name of Scriver appeared at mister Nealy s and inquired of Isabel if she would like to go and live with him She eagerly answered Yes and nothing doubting but he was sent in answer to her prayer and she soon started off with him walking while he rode for he had bought her at the suggestion of her father paying one hundred and five dollars for her He also lived in Ulster County but some five or six miles from mister Nealy s Scriver besides being a fisherman kept a tavern for the accommodation of people of his own class for his was a rude uneducated family exceedingly profane in their language but on the whole an honest kind and well disposed people They owned a large farm but left it wholly unimproved attending mainly to their vocations of fishing and inn keeping Isabella declares she can ill describe the kind of life she led with them It was a wild out of door kind of lief She was expected to carry fish to hoe corn to bring roots and herbs from the woods for beers go to the Strand for a gallon of molasses or liquor as the case might require and browse around as she expresses it It was a life that suited her well for the time being as devoid of hardship or terror as it was of improvement a need which had not yet become a want Instead of improving at this place morally she retrograded as their example taught her to curse and it was here that she took her first oath After living with them for about a year and a half she was sold to one John J Dumont for the sum of seventy pounds This was in eighteen ten mister Dumont lived in the same county as her former masters in the town of New Paltz and she remained with him till a short time previous to her emancipation by the State in eighteen twenty eight HER STANDING WITH HER NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS Had missus Dumont possessed that vein of kindness and consideration for the slaves so perceptible in her husband s character Isabella would have been as comfortable here as one had best be if one must be a slave mister Dumont had been nursed in the very lap of slavery and being naturally a man of kind feelings treated his slaves with all the consideration he did his other animals and more perhaps But missus Dumont who had been born and educated in a non slaveholding family and like many others used only to work people who under the most stimulating of human motives were willing to put forth their every energy could not have patience with the creeping gait the dull understanding or see any cause for the listless manners and careless slovenly habits of the poor down trodden outcast entirely forgetting that every high and efficient motive had been removed far from him and that had not his very intellect been crushed out of him the slave would find little ground for aught but hopeless despondency From this source arose a long series of trials in the life of our heroine which we must pass over in silence some from motives of delicacy and others because the relation of them might inflict undeserved pain on some now living whom Isabel remembers only with esteem and love therefore the reader will not be surprised if our narrative appears somewhat tame at this point and may rest assured that it is not for want of facts as the most thrilling incidents of this portion of her life are from various motives suppressed One comparatively trifling incident she wishes related as it made a deep impression on her mind at the time showing as she thinks how God shields the innocent and causes them to triumph over their enemies and also how she stood between master and mistress In her family missus Dumont employed two white girls one of whom named Kate evinced a disposition to lord it over Isabel and in her emphatic language to grind her down Her master often shielded her from the attacks and accusations of others praising her for her readiness and ability to work and these praises seemed to foster a spirit of hostility to her in the minds of missus Dumont and her white servant the latter of whom took every opportunity to cry up her faults lessen her in the esteem of her master and increase against her the displeasure of her mistress which was already more than sufficient for Isabel s comfort Her master insisted that she could do as much work as half a dozen common people and do it well too whilst her mistress insisted that the first was true only because it ever came from her hand but half performed A good deal of feeling arose from this difference of opinion which was getting to rather an uncomfortable height when all at once the potatoes that Isabel cooked for breakfast assumed a dingy dirty look Her mistress blamed her severely asking her master to observe a fine specimen of Bell s work adding it is the way all her work is done Her master scolded also this time and commanded her to be more careful in future Kate joined with zest in the censures and was very hard upon her Isabella thought that she had done all she well could to have them nice and became quite distressed at their appearances and wondered what she should do to avoid them In this dilemma Gertrude Dumont mister D s eldest child a good kind hearted girl of ten years who pitied Isabel sincerely when she heard them all blame her so unsparingly came forward offering her sympathy and assistance and when about to retire to bed on the night of Isabella s humiliation she advanced to Isabel and told her if she would wake her early next morning she would get up and attend to her potatoes for her while she Isabella went to milking and they would see if they could not have them nice and not have Poppee her word for father and Matty her word for mother and all of em scolding so terribly Isabella gladly availed herself of this kindness which touched her to the heart amid so much of an opposite spirit When Isabella had put the potatoes over to boil Getty told her she would herself tend the fire while Isabel milked She had not long been seated by the fire in performance of her promise when Kate entered and requested Gertrude to go out of the room and do something for her which she refused still keeping her place in the corner While there Kate came sweeping about the fire caught up a chip lifted some ashes with it and dashed them into the kettle Now the mystery was solved the plot discovered Kate was working a little too fast at making her mistress s words good at showing that missus Dumont and herself were on the right side of the dispute and consequently at gaining power over Isabella Yes she was quite too fast inasmuch as she had overlooked the little figure of justice which sat in the comer with scales nicely balanced waiting to give all their dues But the time had come when she was to be overlooked no longer It was Getty s turn to speak now Oh Poppee oh Poppee said she Kate has been putting ashes in among the potatoes I saw her do it Look at those that fell on the outside of the kettle You can now see what made the potatoes so dingy every morning though Bell washed them clean And she repeated her story to every new comer till the fraud was made as public as the censure of Isabella had been Her mistress looked blank and remained dumb her master muttered something which sounded very like an oath and poor Kate was so chop fallen she looked like a convicted criminal who would gladly have hid herself now that the baseness was out to conceal her mortified pride and deep chagrin It was a fine triumph for Isabella and her master and she became more ambitious than ever to please him and he stimulated her ambition by his commendation and by boasting of her to his friends telling them that that wench pointing to Isabel is better to me than a man for she will do a good family s washing in the night and be ready in the morning to go into the field where she will do as much at raking and binding as my best hands Her ambition and desire to please were so great that she often worked several nights in succession sleeping only short snatches as she sat in her chair and some nights she would not allow herself to take any sleep save what she could get resting herself against the wall fearing that if she sat down she would sleep too long These extra exertions to please and the praises consequent upon them brought upon her head the envy of her fellow slaves and they taunted her with being the white folks nigger On the other hand she received the larger share of the confidence of her master and many small favors that were by them unattainable I asked her if her master Dumont ever whipped her She answered Oh yes he sometimes whipped me soundly though never cruelly And the most severe whipping he ever give me was because I was cruel to a cat At this time she looked upon her master as a God and believed that he knew of and could see her at all times even as God himself And she used sometimes to confess her delinquencies from the conviction that he already knew them and that she should fare better if she confessed voluntarily and if any one talked to her of the injustice of her being a slave she answered them with contempt and immediately told her master She then firmly believed that slavery was right and honorable Yet she now sees very clearly the false position they were all in both masters and slaves and she looks back with utter astonishment at the absurdity of the claims so arrogantly set up by the masters over beings designed by God to be as free as kings and at the perfect stupidity of the slave in admitting for one moment the validity of these claims In obedience to her mother s instructions she had educated herself to such a sense of honesty that when she had become a mother she would sometimes whip her child when it cried to her for bread rather than give it a piece secretly lest it should learn to take what was not its own And the writer of this knows from personal observation that the slaveholders of the South feel it to be a religious duty to teach their slaves to be honest and never to take what is not their own Oh consistency art thou not a jewel Yet Isabella glories in the fact that she was faithful and true to her master she says It made me true to my God meaning that it helped to form in her a character that loved truth and hated a lie and had saved her from the bitter pains and fears that are sure to follow in the wake of insincerity and hypocrisy As she advanced in years an attachment sprung up between herself and a slave named Robert But his master an Englishman by the name of Catlin anxious that no one s property but his own should be enhanced by the increase of his slaves forbade Robert s visits to Isabella and commanded him to take a wife among his fellow servants Notwithstanding this interdiction Robert following the bent of his inclinations continued his visits to Isabel though very stealthily and as he believed without exciting the suspicion of his master but one Saturday afternoon hearing that Bell was ill he took the liberty to go and see her The first intimation she had of his visit was the appearance of her master inquiring if she had seen Bob On her answering in the negative he said to her If you see him tell him to take care of himself for the Catlins are after him Almost at that instant Bob made his appearance and the first people he met were his old and his young masters They were terribly enraged at finding him there and the eldest began cursing and calling upon his son to Knock down the d d black rascal at the same time they both fell upon him like tigers beating him with the heavy ends of their canes bruising and mangling his head and face in the most awful manner and causing the blood which streamed from his wounds to cover him like a slaughtered beast constituting him a most shocking spectacle mister Dumont interposed at this point telling the ruffians they could no longer thus spill human blood on his premises he would have no niggers killed there The Catlins then took a rope they had taken with them for the purpose and tied Bob s hands behind him in such a manner that mister Dumont insisted on loosening the cord declaring that no brute should be tied in that manner where he was And as they led him away like the greatest of criminals the more humane Dumont followed them to their homes as Robert s protector and when he returned he kindly went to Bell as he called her telling her he did not think they would strike him any more as their wrath had greatly cooled before he left them Isabella had witnessed this scene from her window and was greatly shocked at the murderous treatment of poor Robert whom she truly loved and whose only crime in the eye of his persecutors was his affection for her This beating and we know not what after treatment completely subdued the spirit of its victim for Robert ventured no more to visit Isabella but like an obedient and faithful chattel took himself a wife from the house of his master Robert did not live many years after his last visit to Isabel but took his departure to that country where they neither marry nor are given in marriage and where the oppressor cannot molest ISABELLA S MARRIAGE Subsequently Isabella was married to a fellow slave named Thomas who had previously had two wives one of whom if not both had been torn from him and sold far away And it is more than probable that he was not only allowed but encouraged to take another at each successive sale I say it is probable because the writer of this knows from personal observation that such is the custom among slaveholders at the present day and that in a twenty months residence among them we never knew any one to open the lip against the practice and when we severely censured it the slaveholder had nothing to say and the slave pleaded that under existing circumstances he could do no better Such an abominable state of things is silently tolerated to say the least by slaveholders deny it who may And what is that religion that sanctions even by its silence all that is embraced in the Peculiar Institution If there can be any thing more diametrically opposed to the religion of Jesus than the working of this soul killing system which is as truly sanctioned by the religion of America as are her ministers and churches we wish to be shown where it can be found We have said Isabella was married to Thomas she was after the fashion of slavery one of the slaves performing the ceremony for them as no true minister of Christ can perform as in the presence of God what he knows to be a mere farce a mock marriage unrecognised by any civil law and liable to be annulled any moment when the interest or caprice of the master should dictate With what feelings must slaveholders expect us to listen to their horror of amalgamation in prospect while they are well aware that we know how calmly and quietly they contemplate the present state of licentiousness their own wicked laws have created not only as it regards the slave but as it regards the more privileged portion of the population of the South Slaveholders appear to me to take the same notice of the vices of the slave as one does of the vicious disposition of his horse They are often an inconvenience further than that they care not to trouble themselves about the matter ISABELLA AS A MOTHER In process of time Isabella found herself the mother of five children and she rejoiced in being permitted to be the instrument of increasing the property of her oppressors Think dear reader without a blush if you can for one moment of a mother thus willingly and with pride laying her own children the flesh of her flesh on the altar of slavery a sacrifice to the bloody Moloch But we must remember that beings capable of such sacrifices are not mothers they are only things chattels property But since that time the subject of this narrative has made some advances from a state of chattelism towards that of a woman and a mother and she now looks back upon her thoughts and feelings there in her state of ignorance and degradation as one does on the dark imagery of a fitful dream One moment it seems but a frightful illusion again it appears a terrible reality I would to God it were but a dreamy myth and not as it now stands a horrid reality to some three millions of chattelized human beings I have already alluded to her care not to teach her children to steal by her example and she says with groanings that cannot be written The Lord only knows how many times I let my children go hungry rather than take secretly the bread I liked not to ask for All parents who annul their preceptive teachings by their daily practices would do well to profit by her example Another proof of her master s kindness of heart is found in the following fact If her master came into the house and found her infant crying as she could not always attend to its wants and the commands of her mistress at the same time he would turn to his wife with a look of reproof and ask her why she did not see the child taken care of saying most earnestly I will not hear this crying I can t bear it and I will not hear any child cry so Here Bell take care of this child if no more work is done for a week And he would linger to see if his orders were obeyed and not countermanded When Isabella went to the field to work she used to put her infant in a basket tying a rope to each handle and suspending the basket to a branch of a tree set another small child to swing it It was thus secure from reptiles and was easily administered to and even lulled to sleep by a child too young for other labors I was quite struck with the ingenuity of such a baby tender as I have sometimes been with the swinging hammock the native mother prepares for her sick infant apparently so much easier than aught we have in our more civilized homes easier for the child because it gets the motion without the least jar and easier for the nurse because the hammock is strung so high as to supersede the necessity of stooping SLAVEHOLDER S PROMISES After emancipation had been decreed by the State some years before the time fixed for its consummation Isabella s master told her if she would do well and be faithful he would give her free papers one year before she was legally free by statute In the year eighteen twenty six she had a badly diseased hand which greatly diminished her usefulness but on the arrival of July four eighteen twenty seven the time specified for her receiving her free papers she claimed the fulfilment of her master s promise but he refused granting it on account as he alleged of the loss he had sustained by her hand She plead that she had worked all the time and done many things she was not wholly able to do although she knew she had been less useful than formerly but her master remained inflexible Her very faithfulness probably operated against her now and he found it less easy than he thought to give up the profits of his faithful Bell who had so long done him efficient service But Isabella inwardly determined that she would remain quietly with him only until she had spun his wool about one hundred pounds and then she would leave him taking the rest of the time to herself Ah she says with emphasis that cannot be written the slaveholders are TERRIBLE for promising to give you this or that or such and such a privilege if you will do thus and so and when the time of fulfilment comes and one claims the promise they forsooth recollect nothing of the kind and you are like as not taunted with being a LIAR or at best the slave is accused of not having performed his part or condition of the contract Oh said she I have felt as if I could not live through the operation sometimes Just think of us so eager for our pleasures and just foolish enough to keep feeding and feeding ourselves up with the idea that we should get what had been thus fairly promised and when we think it is almost in our hands find ourselves flatly denied Just think how could we bear it Why there was Charles Brodhead promised his slave Ned that when harvesting was over he might go and see his wife who lived some twenty or thirty miles off So Ned worked early and late and as soon as the harvest was all in he claimed the promised boon His master said he had merely told him he would see if he could go when the harvest was over but now he saw that he could not go But Ned who still claimed a positive promise on which he had fully depended went on cleaning his shoes His master asked him if he intended going and on his replying yes took up a sled stick that lay near him and gave him such a blow on the head as broke his skull killing him dead on the spot The poor colored people all felt struck down by the blow Ah and well they might Yet it was but one of a long series of bloody and other most effectual blows struck against their liberty and their lives But to return from our digression The subject of this narrative was to have been free July four eighteen twenty seven but she continued with her master till the wool was spun and the heaviest of the fall s work closed up when she concluded to take her freedom into her own hands and seek her fortune in some other place Note Yet no official notice was taken of his more than brutal murder HER ESCAPE The question in her mind and one not easily solved now was How can I get away So as was her usual custom she told God she was afraid to go in the night and in the day every body would see her At length the thought came to her that she could leave just before the day dawned and get out of the neighborhood where she was known before the people were much astir Yes said she fervently that s a good thought Thank you God for that thought So receiving it as coming direct from God she acted upon it and one fine morning a little before day break she might have been seen stepping stealthily away from the rear of Master Dumont s house her infant on one arm and her wardrobe on the other the bulk and weight of which probably she never found so convenient as on the present occasion a cotton handkerchief containing both her clothes and her provisions As she gained the summit of a high hill a considerable distance from her master s the sun offended her by coming forth in all his pristine splendor She thought it never was so light before indeed she thought it much too light She stopped to look about her and ascertain if her pursuers were yet in sight No one appeared and for the first time the question came up for settlement Where and to whom shall I go In all her thoughts of getting away she had not once asked herself whither she should direct her steps She sat down fed her infant and again turning her thoughts to God her only help she prayed him to direct her to some safe asylum And soon it occurred to her that there was a man living somewhere in the direction she had been pursuing by the name of Levi Rowe whom she had known and who she thought would be likely to befriend her She accordingly pursued her way to his house where she found him ready to entertain and assist her though he was then on his death bed He bade her partake of the hospitalities of his house said he knew of two good places where she might get in and requested his wife to show her where they were to be found As soon as she came in sight of the first house she recollected having seen it and its inhabitants before and instantly exclaimed That s the place for me I shall stop there She went there and found the good people of the house mister and missus Van Wagener absent but was kindly received and hospitably entertained by their excellent mother till the return of her children When they arrived she made her case known to them They listened to her story assuring her they never turned the needy away and willingly gave her employment She had not been there long before her old master Dumont appeared as she had anticipated for when she took French leave of him she resolved not to go too far from him and not put him to as much trouble in looking her up for the latter he was sure to do as Tom and Jack had done when they ran away from him a short time before This was very considerate in her to say the least and a proof that like begets like He had often considered her feelings though not always and she was equally considerate When her master saw her he said Well Bell so you ve run away from me No I did not run away I walked away by day light and all because you had promised me a year of my time His reply was You must go back with me Her decisive answer was No I won t go back with you He said Well I shall take the child This also was as stoutly negatived mister Isaac S Van Wagener then interposed saying he had never been in the practice of buying and selling slaves he did not believe in slavery but rather than have Isabella taken back by force he would buy her services for the balance of the year for which her master charged twenty dollars and five in addition for the child The sum was paid and her master Dumont departed but not till he had heard mister Van Wagener tell her not to call him master adding there is but one master and he who is your master is my master Isabella inquired what she should call him He answered call me Isaac Van Wagener and my wife is Maria Van Wagener Isabella could not understand this and thought it a mighty change as it most truly was from a master whose word was law to simple Isaac S Van Wagener who was master to no one With these noble people who though they could not be the masters of slaves were undoubtedly a portion of God s nobility she resided one year and from them she derived the name of Van Wagener he being her last master in the eye of the law and a slave s surname is ever the same as his master that is if he is allowed to have any other name than Tom Jack or Guffin Slaves have sometimes been severely punished for adding their master s name to their own But when they have no particular title to it it is no particular offence ILLEGAL SALE OF HER SON A little previous to Isabel s leaving her old master he had sold her child a boy of five years to a doctor Gedney who took him with him as far as New York city on his way to England but finding the boy too small for his service he sent him back to his brother Solomon Gedney This man disposed of him to his sister s husband a wealthy planter by the name of Fowler who took him to his own home in Alabama This illegal and fraudulent transaction had been perpetrated some months before Isabella knew of it as she was now living at mister Van Wagener s The law expressly prohibited the sale of any slave out of the State and all minors were to be free at twenty one years of age and mister Dumont had sold Peter with the express understanding that he was soon to return to the State of New York and be emancipated at the specified time When Isabel heard that her son had been sold South she immediately started on foot and alone to find the man who had thus dared in the face of all law human and divine to sell her child out of the State and if possible to bring him to account for the deed Arriving at New Paltz she went directly to her former mistress Dumont complaining bitterly of the removal of her son Her mistress heard her through and then replied Ugh a fine fuss to make about a little nigger Why haven t you as many of em left as you can see to and take care of A pity tis the niggers are not all in Guinea Making such a halloo balloo about the neighborhood and all for a paltry nigger Isabella heard her through and after a moment s hesitation answered in tones of deep determination I ll have my child again Have your child again repeated her mistress her tones big with contempt and scorning the absurd idea of her getting him How can you get him And what have you to support him with if you could Have you any money No answered Bell I have no money but God has enough or what s better And I ll have my child again These words were pronounced in the most slow solemn and determined measure and manner And in speaking of it she says Oh my God I know d I d have him agin I was sure God would help me to get him Why I felt so tall within I felt as if the power of a nation was with me The impressions made by Isabella on her auditors when moved by lofty or deep feeling can never be transmitted to paper to use the words of another till by some Daguerrian act we are enabled to transfer the look the gesture the tones of voice in connection with the quaint yet fit expressions used and the spirit stirring animation that at such a time pervades all she says After leaving her mistress she called on missus Gedney mother of him who had sold her boy who after listening to her lamentations her grief being mingled with indignation at the sale of her son and her declaration that she would have him again said Dear me What a disturbance to make about your child What is your child better than my child My child is gone out there and yours is gone to live with her to have enough of every thing and be treated like a gentleman And here she laughed at Isabel s absurd fears as she would represent them to be Yes said Isabel your child has gone there but she is married and my boy has gone as a slave and he is too little to go so far from his mother Oh I must have my child And here the continued laugh of missus G seemed to Isabel in this time of anguish and distress almost demoniacal And well it was for missus Gedney that at that time she could not even dream of the awful fate awaiting her own beloved daughter at the hands of him whom she had chosen as worthy the wealth of her love and confidence and in whose society her young heart had calculated on a happiness purer and more elevated than was ever conferred by a kingly crown But alas she was doomed to disappointment as we shall relate by and by At this point Isabella earnestly begged of God that he would show to those about her that He was her helper and she adds in narrating And He did or if He did not show them he did me IT IS OFTEN DARKEST JUST BEFORE DAWN This homely proverb was illustrated in the case of our sufferer for at the period at which we have arrived in our narrative to her the darkness seemed palpable and the waters of affliction covered her soul yet light was about to break in upon her Soon after the scenes related in our last chapter which had harrowed up her very soul to agony she met a man we would like to tell you who dear reader but it would be doing him no kindness even at the present day to do so who evidently sympathized with her and counselled her to go to the Quakers telling her they were already feeling very indignant at the fraudulent sale of her son and assuring her that they would readily assist her and direct her what to do He pointed out to her two houses where lived some of those people who formerly more than any other sect perhaps lived out the principles of the gospel of Christ She wended her way to their dwellings was listened to unknown as she personally was to them with patience and soon gained their sympathies and active company operation They gave her lodgings for the night and it is very amusing to hear her tell of the nice high clean white beautiful bed assigned her to sleep in which contrasted so strangely with her former pallets that she sat down and contemplated it perfectly absorbed in wonder that such a bed should have been appropriated to one like herself For some time she thought that she would lie down beneath it on her usual bedstead the floor I did indeed says she laughing heartily at her former self However she finally concluded to make use of the bed for fear that not to do so might injure the feelings of her good hostess In the morning the Quaker saw that she was taken and set down near Kingston with directions to go to the Court House and enter complaint to the Grand Jury By a little inquiry she found which was the building she sought went into the door and taking the first man she saw of imposing appearance for the grand jury she commenced her complaint But he very civilly informed her there was no Grand Jury there she must go up stairs When she had with some difficulty ascended the flight through the crowd that filled them she again turned to the grandest looking man she could select telling him she had come to enter a complaint to the Grand Jury For his own amusement he inquired what her complaint was but when he saw it was a serious matter he said to her This is no place to enter a complaint go in there pointing in a particular direction She then went in where she found the Grand Jurors indeed sitting and again commenced to relate her injuries After holding some conversation among themselves one of them rose and bidding her follow him led the way to a side office where he heard her story and asked her if she could swear that the child she spoke of was her son Yes she answered I swear it s my son Stop stop said the lawyer you must swear by this book giving her a book which she thinks must have been the Bible She took it and putting it to her lips began again to swear it was her child The clerks unable to preserve their gravity any longer burst into an uproarious laugh and one of them inquired of lawyer Chip of what use it could be to make her swear It will answer the law replied the officer He then made her comprehend just what he wished her to do and she took a lawful oath as far as the outward ceremony could make it one All can judge how far she understood its spirit and meaning He now gave her a writ directing her to take it to the constable at New Paltz and have him serve it on Solomon Gedney She obeyed walking or rather trotting in her haste some eight or nine miles But while the constable through mistake served the writ on a brother of the real culprit Solomon Gedney slipped into a boat and was nearly across the North River on whose banks they were standing before the dull Dutch constable was aware of his mistake Solomon Gedney meanwhile consulted a lawyer who advised him to go to Alabama and bring back the boy otherwise it might cost him fourteen years imprisonment and a thousand dollars in cash By this time it is hoped he began to feel that selling slaves unlawfully was not so good a business as he had wished to find it He secreted himself till due preparations could be made and soon set sail for Alabama Steamboats and railroads had not then annihilated distance to the extent they now have and although he left in the fall of the year spring came ere he returned bringing the boy with him but holding on to him as his property It had ever been Isabella s prayer not only that her son might be returned but that he should be delivered from bondage and into her own hands lest he should be punished out of mere spite to her who was so greatly annoying and irritating to her oppressors and if her suit was gained her very triumph would add vastly to their irritation She again sought advice of Esquire Chip whose counsel was that the aforesaid constable serve the before mentioned writ upon the right person This being done soon brought Solomon Gedney up to Kingston where he gave bonds for his appearance at court in the sum of six hundred dollars Esquire Chip next informed his client that her case must now lie over till the next session of the court some months in the future The law must take its course said he What wait another court wait months said the persevering mother Why long before that time he can go clear off and take my child with him no one knows where I cannot wait I must have him now whilst he is to be had Well said the lawyer very coolly if he puts the boy out of the way he must pay the six hundred dollars one half of which will be yours supposing perhaps that three hundred dollars would pay for a heap of children in the eye of a slave who never in all her life called a dollar her own But in this instance he was mistaken in his reckoning She assured him that she had not been seeking money neither would money satisfy her it was her son and her son alone she wanted and her son she must have Neither could she wait court not she The lawyer used his every argument to convince her that she ought to be very thankful for what they had done for her that it was a great deal and it was but reasonable that she should now wait patiently the time of the court Yet she never felt for a moment like being influenced by these suggestions She felt confident she was to receive a full and literal answer to her prayer the burden of which had been O Lord give my son into my hands and that speedily Let not the spoilers have him any longer Notwithstanding she very distinctly saw that those who had thus far helped her on so kindly were wearied of her and she feared God was wearied also She had a short time previous learned that Jesus was a Saviour and an intercessor and she thought that if Jesus could but be induced to plead for her in the present trial God would listen to him though he were wearied of her importunities To him of course she applied As she was walking about scarcely knowing whither she went asking within herself Who will show me any good and lend a helping hand in this matter she was accosted by a perfect stranger and one whose name she has never learned in the following terms Halloo there how do you get along with your boy do they give him up to you She told him all adding that now every body was tired and she had none to help her He said Look here I ll tell you what you d better do Do you see that stone house yonder pointing in a particular direction Well lawyer Demain lives there and do you go to him and lay your case before him I think he ll help you Stick to him Don t give him peace till he does I feel sure if you press him he ll do it for you She needed no further urging but trotted off at her peculiar gait in the direction of his house as fast as possible and she was not encumbered with stockings shoes or any other heavy article of dress When she had told him her story in her impassioned manner he looked at her a few moments as if to ascertain if he were contemplating a new variety of the genus homo and then told her if she would give him five dollars he would get her son for her in twenty four hours Why she replied I have no money and never had a dollar in my life Said he If you will go to those Quakers in Poppletown who carried you to court they will help you to five dollars in cash I have no doubt and you shall have your son in twenty four hours from the time you bring me that sum She performed the journey to Poppletown a distance of some ten miles very expeditiously collected considerable more than the sum specified by the barrister then shutting the money tightly in her hand she trotted back and paid the lawyer a larger fee than he had demanded When inquired of by people what she had done with the overplus she answered Oh I got it for lawyer Demain and I gave it to him They assured her she was a fool to do so that she should have kept all over five dollars and purchased herself shoes with it Oh I do not want money or clothes now I only want my son and if five dollars will get him more will surely get him And if the lawyer had returned it to her she avers she would not have accepted it She was perfectly willing he should have every coin she could raise if he would but restore her lost son to her Moreover the five dollars he required were for the remuneration of him who should go after her son and his master and not for his own services The lawyer now renewed his promise that she should have her son in twenty four hours But Isabella having no idea of this space of time went several times in a day to ascertain if her son had come Once when the servant opened the door and saw her she said in a tone expressive of much surprise Why this woman s come again She then wondered if she went too often When the lawyer appeared he told her the twenty four hours would not expire till the next morning if she would call then she would see her son The next morning saw Isabel at the lawyer s door while he was yet in his bed He now assured her it was morning till noon and that before noon her son would be there for he had sent the famous Matty Styles after him who would not fail to have the boy and his master on hand in due season either dead or alive of that he was sure Telling her she need not come again he would himself inform her of their arrival After dinner he appeared at mister Rutzer s a place the lawyer had procured for her while she awaited the arrival of her boy assuring her her son had come but that he stoutly denied having any mother or any relatives in that place and said she must go over and identify him She went to the office but at sight of her the boy cried aloud and regarded her as some terrible being who was about to take him away from a kind and loving friend He knelt even and begged them with tears not to take him away from his dear master who had brought him from the dreadful South and been so kind to him When he was questioned relative to the bad scar on his forehead he said Fowler s horse hove him And of the one on his cheek That was done by running against the carriage In answering these questions he looked imploringly at his master as much as to say If they are falsehoods you bade me say them may they be satisfactory to you at least The justice noting his appearance bade him forget his master and attend only to him But the boy persisted in denying his mother and clinging to his master saying his mother did not live in such a place as that However they allowed the mother to identify her son and Esquire Demain pleaded that he claimed the boy for her on the ground that he had been sold out of the State contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided spoke of the penalties annexed to said crime and of the sum of money the delinquent was to pay in case any one chose to prosecute him for the offence he had committed Isabella who was sitting in a corner scarcely daring to breathe thought within herself If I can but get the boy the two hundred dollars may remain for whoever else chooses to prosecute I have done enough to make myself enemies already and she trembled at the thought of the formidable enemies she had probably arrayed against herself helpless and despised as she was When the pleading was at an end Isabella understood the Judge to declare as the sentence of the Court that the boy be delivered into the hands of the mother having no other master no other controller no other conductor but his mother This sentence was obeyed he was delivered into her hands the boy meanwhile begging most piteously not to be taken from his dear master saying she was not his mother and that his mother did not live in such a place as that And it was some time before lawyer Demain the clerks and Isabella could collectively succeed in calming the child s fears and in convincing him that Isabella was not some terrible monster as he had for the last months probably been trained to believe and who in taking him away from his master was taking him from all good and consigning him to all evil When at last kind words and bon bons had quieted his fears and he could listen to their explanations he said to Isabella Well you do look like my mother used to and she was soon able to make him comprehend some of the obligations he was under and the relation he stood in both to herself and his master She commenced as soon as practicable to examine the boy and found to her utter astonishment that from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot the callosities and indurations on his entire body were most frightful to behold His back she described as being like her fingers as she laid them side by side Heavens what is all this said Isabel He answered It is where Fowler whipped kicked and beat me She exclaimed Oh Lord Jesus look see my poor child Oh Lord render unto them double for all this Oh my God Pete how did you bear it Oh this is nothing mammy if you should see Phillis I guess you d scare She had a little baby and Fowler cut her till the milk as well as blood ran down her body You would scare to see Phillis mammy When Isabella inquired What did Miss Eliza say Pete when you were treated so badly he replied Oh mammy she said she wished I was with Bell Sometimes I crawled under the stoop mammy the blood running all about me and my back would stick to the boards and sometimes Miss Eliza would come and grease my sores when all were abed and asleep Note Meaning missus Eliza Fowler DEATH OF missus ELIZA FOWLER As soon as possible she procured a place for Peter as tender of locks at a place called Wahkendall near Greenkills After he was thus disposed of she visited her sister Sophia who resided at Newberg and spent the winter in several different families where she was acquainted She remained some time in the family of a mister Latin who was a relative of Solomon Gedney and the latter when he found Isabel with his cousin used all his influence to persuade him she was a great mischief maker and a very troublesome person that she had put him to some hundreds of dollars expense by fabricating lies about him and especially his sister and her family concerning her boy when the latter was living so like a gentleman with them and for his part he would not advise his friends to harbor or encourage her However his cousins the Latins could not see with the eyes of his feelings and consequently his words fell powerless on them and they retained her in their service as long as they had aught for her to do She then went to visit her former master Dumont She had scarcely arrived there when mister Fred Waring entered and seeing Isabel pleasantly accosted her and asked her what she was driving at now a days On her answering nothing particular he requested her to go over to his place and assist his folks as some of them were sick and they needed an extra hand She very gladly assented When mister W retired her master wanted to know why she wished to help people that called her the worst of devils as mister Waring had done in the courthouse for he was the uncle of Solomon Gedney and attended the trial we have described and declared that she was a fool to he wouldn t do it Oh she told him she would not mind that but was very glad to have people forget their anger towards her She went over but too happy to feel that their resentment was passed and commenced her work with a light heart and a strong will She had not worked long in this frame of mind before a young daughter of mister Waring rushed into the rooms exclaiming with uplifted hands Heavens and earth Isabella Fowler s murdered Cousin Eliza Ho said Isabel that s nothing he liked to have killed my child nothing saved him but God Meaning that she was not at all surprised at it for a man whose heart was sufficiently hardened to treat a mere child as hers had been treated was in her opinion more fiend than human and prepared for the commission of any crime that his passions might prompt him to The child further informed her that a letter had arrived by mail bringing the news Immediately after this announcement Solomon Gedney and his mother came in going direct to missus Waring s room where she soon heard tones as of some one reading She thought something said to her inwardly Go up stairs and hear At first she hesitated but it seemed to press her the more Go up and hear She went up unusual as it is for slaves to leave their work and enter unbidden their mistress s room for the sole purpose of seeing or hearing what may be seen or heard there But on this occasion Isabella says she walked in at the door shut it placed her back against it and listened She saw them and heard them read He knocked her down with his fist jumped on her with his knees broke her collar bone and tore out her wind pipe He then attempted his escape but was pursued and arrested and put in an iron bank for safe keeping And the friends were requested to go down and take away the poor innocent children who had thus been made in one short day more than orphans If this narrative should ever meet the eye of those innocent sufferers for another s guilt let them not be too deeply affected by the relation but placing their confidence in Him who sees the end from the beginning and controls the results rest secure in the faith that although they may physically suffer for the sins of others if they remain but true to themselves their highest and more enduring interests can never suffer from such a cause This relation should be suppressed for their sakes were it not even now so often denied that slavery is fast undermining all true regard for human life We know this one instance is not a demonstration to the contrary but adding this to the lists of tragedies that weekly come up to us through the Southern mails may we not admit them as proofs irrefragable The newspapers confirmed this account of the terrible affair When Isabella had heard the letter all being too much absorbed in their own feelings to take note of her she returned to her work her heart swelling with conflicting emotions She was awed at the dreadful deed she mourned the fate of the loved Eliza who had in such an undeserved and barbarous manner been put away from her labors and watchings as a tender mother and last though not least in the development of her character and spirit her heart bled for the afflicted relatives even those of them who laughed at her calamity and mocked when her fear came Her thoughts dwelt long and intently on the subject and the wonderful chain of events that had conspired to bring her that day to that house to listen to that piece of intelligence to that house where she never was before or afterwards in her life and invited there by people who had so lately been hotly incensed against her It all seemed very remarkable to her and she viewed it as flowing from a special providence of God She thought she saw clearly that their unnatural bereavement was a blow dealt in retributive justice but she found it not in her heart to exult or rejoice over them She felt as if God had more than answered her petition when she ejaculated in her anguish of mind Oh Lord render unto them double She said I dared not find fault with God exactly but the language of my heart was Oh my God that s too much I did not mean quite so much God It was a terrible blow to the friends of the deceased and her selfish mother who said Isabella made such a to do about her boy not from affection but to have her own will and way went deranged and walking to and fro in her delirium called aloud for her poor murdered daughter Eliza Eliza The derangement of missus G was a matter of hearsay as Isabella saw her not after the trial but she has no reason to doubt the truth of what she heard Isabel could never learn the subsequent fate of Fowler but heard in the spring of forty nine that his children had been seen in Kingston one of whom was spoken of as a fine interesting girl albeit a halo of sadness fell like a veil about her ISABELLA S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE We will now turn from the outward and temporal to the inward and spiritual life of our subject It is ever both interesting and instructive to trace the exercises of a human mind through the trials and mysteries of life and especially a naturally powerful mind left as hers was almost entirely to its own workings and the chance influences it met on its way and especially to note its reception of that divine light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world We see as knowledge dawns upon it truth and error strangely commingled here a bright spot illuminated by truth and there one darkened and distorted by error and the state of such a soul may be compared to a landscape at early dawn where the sun is seen superbly gilding some objects and causing others to send forth their lengthened distorted and sometimes hideous shadows Her mother as we have already said talked to her of God From these conversations her incipient mind drew the conclusion that God was a great man greatly superior to other men in power and being located high in the sky could see all that transpired on the earth She believed he not only saw but noted down all her actions in a great book even as her master kept a record of whatever he wished not to forget But she had no idea that God knew a thought of hers till she had uttered it aloud As we have before mentioned she had ever been mindful of her mother s injunctions spreading out in detail all her troubles before God imploring and firmly trusting him to send her deliverance from them Whilst yet a child she listened to a story of a wounded soldier left alone in the trail of a flying army helpless and starving who hardened the very ground about him with kneeling in his supplications to God for relief until it arrived From this narrative she was deeply impressed with the idea that if she also were to present her petitions under the open canopy of heaven speaking very loud she should the more readily be heard consequently she sought a fitting spot for this her rural sanctuary The place she selected in which to offer up her daily orisons was a small island in a small stream covered with large willow shrubbery beneath which the sheep had made their pleasant winding paths and sheltering themselves from the scorching rays of a noon tide sun luxuriated in the cool shadows of the graceful willows as they listened to the tiny falls of the silver waters It was a lonely spot and chosen by her for its beauty its retirement and because she thought that there in the noise of those waters she could speak louder to God without being overheard by any who might pass that way When she had made choice of her sanctum at a point of the island where the stream met after having been separated she improved it by pulling away the branches of the shrubs from the centre and weaving them together for a wall on the outside forming a circular arched alcove made entirely of the graceful willow To this place she resorted daily and in pressing times much more frequently At this time her prayers or more appropriately talks with God were perfectly original and unique and would be well worth preserving were it possible to give the tones and manner with the words but no adequate idea of them can be written while the tones and manner remain inexpressible She would sometimes repeat Our Father in heaven in her Low Dutch as taught her by her mother after that all was from the suggestions of her own rude mind She related to God in minute detail all her troubles and sufferings inquiring as she proceeded Do you think that s right God and closed by begging to be delivered from the evil whatever it might be She talked to God as familiarly as if he had been a creature like herself and a thousand times more so than if she had been in the presence of some earthly potentate She demanded with little expenditure of reverence or fear a supply of all her more pressing wants and at times her demands approached very near to commands She felt as if God was under obligation to her much more than she was to him He seemed to her benighted vision in some manner bound to do her bidding Her heart recoils now with very dread when she recalls those shocking almost blasphemous conversations with great Jehovah And well for herself did she deem it that unlike earthly potentates his infinite character combined the tender father with the omniscient and omnipotent Creator of the universe She at first commenced promising God that if he would help her out of all her difficulties she would pay him by being very good and this goodness she intended as a remuneration to God She could think of no benefit that was to accrue to herself or her fellow creatures from her leading a life of purity and generous self sacrifice for the good of others as far as any but God was concerned she saw nothing in it but heart trying penance sustained by the sternest exertion and this she soon found much more easily promised than performed Days wore away new trials came God s aid was invoked and the same promises repeated and every successive night found her part of the contract unfulfilled She now began to excuse herself by telling God she could not be good in her present circumstances but if he would give her a new place and a good master and mistress she could and would be good and she expressly stipulated that she would be good one day to show God how good she would be all of the time when he should surround her with the right influences and she should be delivered from the temptations that then so sorely beset her But alas when night came and she became conscious that she had yielded to all her temptations and entirely failed of keeping her word with God having prayed and promised one hour and fallen into the sins of anger and profanity the next the mortifying reflection weighed on her mind and blunted her enjoyment Still she did not lay it deeply to heart but continued to repeat her demands for aid and her promises of pay with full purpose of heart at each particular time that that day she would not fail to keep her plighted word Thus perished the inward spark like a flame just igniting when one waits to see whether it will burn on or die out till the long desired change came and she found herself in a new place with a good mistress and one who never instigated an otherwise kind master to be unkind to her in short a place where she had literally nothing to complain of and where for a time she was more happy than she could well express Oh every thing there was so pleasant and kind and good and all so comfortable enough of every thing indeed it was beautiful she exclaimed Here at mister Van Wagener s as the reader will readily perceive she must have been she was so happy and satisfied that God was entirely forgotten Why should her thoughts turn to him who was only known to her as a help in trouble She had no trouble now her every prayer had been answered in every minute particular She had been delivered from her persecutors and temptations her youngest child had been given her and the others she knew she had no means of sustaining if she had them with her and was content to leave them behind Their father who was much older than Isabel and who preferred serving his time out in slavery to the trouble and dangers of the course she pursued remained with and could keep an eye on them though it is comparatively little that they can do for each other while they remain in slavery and this little the slave like persons in every other situation of life is not always disposed to perform There are slaves who copying the selfishness of their superiors in power in their conduct towards their fellows who may be thrown upon their mercy by infirmity or illness allow them to suffer for want of that kindness and care which it is fully in their power to render them The slaves in this country have ever been allowed to celebrate the principal if not some of the lesser festivals observed by the Catholics and Church of England many of them not being required to do the least service for several days and at Christmas they have almost universally an entire week to themselves except perhaps the attending to a few duties which are absolutely required for the comfort of the families they belong to If much service is desired they are hired to do it and paid for it as if they were free The more sober portion of them spend these holidays in earning a little money Most of them visit and attend parties and balls and not a few of them spend it in the lowest dissipation This respite from toil is granted them by all religionists of whatever persuasion and probably originated from the fact that many of the first slaveholders were members of the Church of England Frederick Douglass who has devoted his great heart and noble talents entirely to the furtherance of the cause of his down trodden race has said From what I know of the effect of their holidays upon the slave I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves These holidays serve as conductors or safety valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity But for these the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors I warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake When Isabella had been at mister Van Wagener s a few months she saw in prospect one of the festivals approaching She knows it by none but the Dutch name Pingster as she calls it but I think it must have been Whitsuntide in English She says she looked back into Egypt and every thing looked so pleasant there as she saw retrospectively all her former companions enjoying their freedom for at least a little space as well as their wonted convivialities and in her heart she longed to be with them With this picture before her mind s eye she contrasted the quiet peaceful life she was living with the excellent people of Wahkendall and it seemed so dull and void of incident that the very contrast served but to heighten her desire to return that at least she might enjoy with them once more the coming festivities These feelings had occupied a secret corner of her breast for some time when one morning she told missus Van Wagener that her old master Dumont would come that day and that she should go home with him on his return They expressed some surprise and asked her where she obtained her information She replied that no one had told her but she felt that he would come It seemed to have been one of those events that cast their shadows before for before night mister Dumont made his appearance She informed him of her intention to accompany him home He answered with a smile I shall not take you back again you ran away from me Thinking his manner contradicted his words she did not feel repulsed but made herself and child ready and when her former master had seated himself in the open dearborn she walked towards it intending to place herself and child in the rear and go with him But ere she reached the vehicle she says that God revealed himself to her with all the suddenness of a flash of lightning showing her in the twinkling of an eye that he was all over that he pervaded the universe and that there was no place where God was not She became instantly conscious of her great sin in forgetting her almighty Friend and ever present help in time of trouble All her unfulfilled promises arose before her like a vexed sea whose waves run mountains high and her soul which seemed but one mass of lies shrunk back aghast from the awful look of him whom she had formerly talked to as if he had been a being like herself and she would now fain have hid herself in the bowels of the earth to have escaped his dread presence But she plainly saw there was no place not even in hell where he was not and where could she flee Another such a look as she expressed it and she felt that she must be extinguished forever even as one with the breath of his mouth blows out a lamp so that no spark remains A dire dread of annihilation now seized her and she waited to see if by another look she was to be stricken from existence swallowed up even as the fire licketh up the oil with which it comes in contact When at last the second look came not and her attention was once more called to outward things she observed her master had left and exclaiming aloud Oh God I did not know you were so big walked into the house and made an effort to resume her work But the workings of the inward man were too absorbing to admit of much attention to her avocations She desired to talk to God but her vileness utterly forbade it and she was not able to prefer a petition What said she shall I lie again to God I have told him nothing but lies and shall I speak again and tell another lie to God She could not and now she began to wish for some one to speak to God for her Then a space seemed opening between her and God and she felt that if some one who was worthy in the sight of heaven would but plead for her in their own name and not let God know it came from her who was so unworthy God might grant it At length a friend appeared to stand between herself and an insulted Deity and she felt as sensibly refreshed as when on a hot day an umbrella had been interposed between her scorching head and a burning sun But who was this friend became the next inquiry Was it Deencia who had so often befriended her She looked at her with her new power of sight and lo she too seemed all bruises and putrifying sores like herself No it was some one very different from Deencia Who are you she exclaimed as the vision brightened into a form distinct beaming with the beauty of holiness and radiant with love She then said audibly addressing the mysterious visitant I know you and I don t know you Meaning You seem perfectly familiar I feel that you not only love me but that you always have loved me yet I know you not I cannot call you by name When she said I know you the subject of the vision remained distinct and quiet When she said I don t know you it moved restlessly about like agitated waters So while she repeated without intermission I know you I know you that the vision might remain Who are you was the cry of her heart and her whole soul was in one deep prayer that this heavenly personage might be revealed to her and remain with her At length after bending both soul and body with the intensity of this desire till breath and strength seemed failing and she could maintain her position no longer an answer came to her saying distinctly It is Jesus Yes she responded it is Jesus Previous to these exercises of mind she heard Jesus mentioned in reading or speaking but had received from what she heard no impression that he was any other than an eminent man like a Washington or a Lafayette Now he appeared to her delighted mental vision as so mild so good and so every way lovely and he loved her so much And how strange that he had always loved her and she had never known it And how great a blessing he conferred in that he should stand between her and God And God was no longer a terror and a dread to her She stopped not to argue the point even in her own mind whether he had reconciled her to God or God to herself though she thinks the former now being but too happy that God was no longer to her as a consuming fire and Jesus was altogether lovely Her heart was now full of joy and gladness as it had been of terror and at one time of despair In the light of her great happiness the world was clad in new beauty the very air sparkled as with diamonds and was redolent of heaven She contemplated the unapproachable barriers that existed between herself and the great of this world as the world calls greatness and made surprising comparisons between them and the union existing between herself and Jesus Jesus the transcendently lovely as well as great and powerful for so he appeared to her though he seemed but human and she watched for his bodily appearance feeling that she should know him if she saw him and when he came she would go and dwell with him as with a dear friend It was not given to her to see that he loved any other and she thought if others came to know and love him as she did she should be thrust aside and forgotten being herself but a poor ignorant slave with little to recommend her to his notice And when she heard him spoken off she said mentally What others know Jesus I thought no one knew Jesus but me and she felt a sort of jealousy lest she should be robbed of her newly found treasure She conceived one day as she listened to reading that she heard an intimation that Jesus was married and hastily inquired if Jesus had a wife What said the reader God have a wife Is Jesus God inquired Isabella Yes to be sure he is was the answer returned From this time her conceptions of Jesus became more elevated and spiritual and she sometimes spoke of him as God in accordance with the teaching she had received But when she was simply told that the Christian world was much divided on the subject of Christ s nature some believing him to be coequal with the Father to be God in and of himself very God of very God some that he is the well beloved only begotten Son of God and others that he is or was rather but a mere man she said Of that I only know as I saw I did not see him to be God else how could he stand between me and God I saw him as a friend standing between me and God through whom love flowed as from a fountain Now so far from expressing her views of Christ s character and office in accordance with any system of theology extant she says she believes Jesus is the same spirit that was in our first parents Adam and Eve in the beginning when they came from the hand of their Creator When they sinned through disobedience this pure spirit forsook them and fled to heaven that there it remained until it returned again in the person of Jesus and that previous to a personal union with him man is but a brute possessing only the spirit of an animal She avers that in her darkest hours she had no fear of any worse hell than the one she then carried in her bosom though it had ever been pictured to her in its deepest colors and threatened her as a reward for all her misdemeanors Her vileness and God s holiness and all pervading presence which filled immensity and threatened her with constant annihilation composed the burden of her vision of terror Her faith in prayer is equal to her faith in the love of Jesus Her language is Let others say what they will of the efficacy of prayer I believe in it and I shall pray Thank God Yes I shall always pray she exclaims putting her hands together with the greatest enthusiasm For some time subsequent to the happy change we have spoken off Isabella s prayers partook largely of their former character and while in deep affliction she labored for the recovery of her son she prayed with constancy and fervor and the following may be taken as a specimen Oh God you know how much I am distressed for I have told you again and again Now God help me get my son If you were in trouble as I am and I could help you as you can me think I would n t do it Yes God you know I would do it Oh God you know I have no money but you can make the people do for me and you must make the people do for me I will never give you peace till you do God Oh God make the people hear me don t let them turn me off without hearing and helping me And she has not a particle of doubt that God heard her and especially disposed the hearts of thoughtless clerks eminent lawyers and grave judges and others between whom and herself there seemed to her almost an infinite remove to listen to her suit with patient and respectful attention backing it up with all needed aid The sense of her nothingness in the eyes of those with whom she contended for her rights sometimes fell on her like a heavy weight which nothing but her unwavering confidence in an arm which she believed to be stronger than all others combined could have raised from her sinking spirit Oh how little did I feel she repeated with a powerful emphasis Neither would you wonder if you could have seen me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets meanly clad bare headed and bare footed Oh God only could have made such people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers And this perfect trust based on the rock of Deity was a soul protecting fortress which raising her above the battlements of fear and shielding her from the machinations of the enemy impelled her onward in the struggle till the foe was vanquished and the victory gained We have now seen Isabella her youngest daughter and her only son in possession of at least their nominal freedom It has been said that the freedom of the most free of the colored people of this country is but nominal but stinted and limited as it is at best it is an immense remove from chattel slavery This fact is disputed I know but I have no confidence in the honesty of such questionings If they are made in sincerity I honor not the judgment that thus decides Her husband quite advanced in age and infirm of health was emancipated with the balance of the adult slaves of the State according to law the following summer July four eighteen twenty eight For a few years after this event he was able to earn a scanty living and when he failed to do that he was dependent on the world s cold charity and died in a poorhouse Isabella had herself and two children to provide for her wages were trifling for at that time the wages of females were at a small advance from nothing and she doubtless had to learn the first elements of economy for what slaves that were never allowed to make any stipulations or calculations for themselves ever possessed an adequate idea of the true value of time or in fact of any material thing in the universe To such prudent using is meanness and saving is a word to be sneered at Of course it was not in her power to make to herself a home around whose sacred hearth stone she could collect her family as they gradually emerged from their prison house of bondage a home where she could cultivate their affection administer to their wants and instil into the opening minds of her children those principles of virtue and that love of purity truth and benevolence which must for ever form the foundation of a life of usefulness and happiness No all this was far beyond her power or means in more senses than one and it should be taken into the account whenever a comparison is instituted between the progress made by her children in virtue and goodness and the progress of those who have been nurtured in the genial warmth of a sunny home where good influences cluster and bad ones are carefully excluded where line upon line and precept upon precept are daily brought to their quotidian tasks and where in short every appliance is brought in requisition that self denying parents can bring to bear on one of the dearest objects of a parent s life the promotion of the welfare of their children But God forbid that this suggestion should be wrested from its original intent and made to shield any one from merited rebuke Isabella s children are now of an age to know good from evil and may easily inform themselves on any point where they may yet be in doubt and if they now suffer themselves to be drawn by temptation into the paths of the destroyer or forget what is due to the mother who has done and suffered so much for them and who now that she is descending into the vale of years and feels her health and strength declining will turn her expecting eyes to them for aid and comfort just as instinctively as the child turns its confiding eye to its fond parent when it seeks for succor or sympathy for it is now their turn to do the work and bear the burdens of life so all must bear them in turn as the wheel of life rolls on if I say they forget this their duty and their happiness and pursue an opposite course of sin and folly they must lose the respect of the wise and good and find when too late that the way of the transgressor is hard NEW TRIALS

6726-56640-0007	train-other-500	Two years passed before Isabella knew what character Peter was establishing for himself among his low and worthless comrades passing under the assumed name of Peter Williams and she began to feel a parent s pride in the promising appearance of her only son

6726-56640-0014	train-other-500	but Peter was not disposed to consent to that proposition while the city and its pleasures were accessible to him Isabella now became a prey to distressing fears dreading lest the next day or hour come fraught with the report of some dreadful crime
6726-56640-0015	train-other-500	committed or abetted by her son She thanks the Lord for sparing her that giant sorrow as all his wrong doings never ranked higher in the eye of the law than misdemeanors But as she could see no improvement in Peter
none	none	 as a last resort she resolved to leave him for a time unassisted to bear the penalty of his conduct and see what effect that would have on him In the trial hour she remained firm in her resolution 
6726-56640-0016	train-other-500	Peter again fell into the hands of the police and sent for his mother as usual but she went not to his relief In his extremity he sent for Peter Williams a respectable colored barber whose name he had been wearing
6726-56640-0017	train-other-500	and who sometimes helped young culprits out of their troubles and sent them from city dangers by shipping them on board of whaling vessels The curiosity of this man was awakened by the culprit s bearing his own name

6726-56640-0018	train-other-500	He went to see his mother and informed her of what had happened to him She listened incredulously as to an idle tale He asked her to go with him and see for herself She went giving no credence to his story
6726-56640-0019	train-other-500	till she found herself in the presence of mister Williams and heard him saying to her I am very glad I have assisted your son he stood in great need of sympathy and assistance but I could not think he had such a mother here although he assured me he had
none	none	 Isabella s great trouble now was a fear lest her son should deceive his benefactor and be missing when the vessel sailed but he begged her earnestly to trust him for he said he had resolved to do better and meant to abide by the resolve Isabella s heart gave her no peace till the time of sailing when Peter sent mister Williams and another messenger whom she knew to tell her he had sailed But for a month afterwards she looked to see him emerging from some by place in the city and appearing before her 
6726-56640-0020	train-other-500	so afraid was she that he was still unfaithful and doing wrong But he did not appear and at length she believed him really gone He left in the summer of eighteen thirty nine and his friends heard nothing further from him

none	none	 His letters are inserted here for preservation in case they prove the last she ever hears from him in this world FINDING A BROTHER AND SISTER When Isabella had obtained the freedom of her son she remained in Kingston where she had been drawn by the judicial process about a year during which time she became a member of the Methodist Church there and when she went to New York she took a letter missive from that church to the Methodist Church in John street Afterwards she withdrew her connection with that church and joined Zion s Church in Church street composed entirely of colored people With the latter church she remained until she went to reside with mister Pierson after which she was gradually drawn into the kingdom set up by the prophet Matthias in the name of God the Father for he said the spirit of God the Father dwelt in him While Isabella was in New York her sister Sophia came from Newburg to reside in the former place Isabel had been favored with occasional interviews with this sister although at one time she lost sight of her for the space of seventeen years almost the entire period of her being at mister Dumont s and when she appeared before her again handsomely dressed she did not recognize her till informed who she was Sophia informed her that her brother Michael a brother she had never seen was in the city and when she introduced him to Isabella he informed her that their sister Nancy had been living in the city and had deceased a few months before He described her features her dress her manner and said she had for some time been a member in Zion s Church naming the class she belonged to Isabella almost instantly recognized her as a sister in the church with whom she had knelt at the altar and with whom she had exchanged the speaking pressure of the hand in recognition of their spiritual sisterhood little thinking at the time that they were also children of the same earthly parents even Bomefree and Mau mau Bett As inquiries and answers rapidly passed and the conviction deepened that this was their sister the very sister they had heard so much of but had never seen for she was the self same sister that had been locked in the great old fashioned sleigh box when she was taken away never to behold her mother s face again this side the spirit land and Michael the narrator was the brother who had shared her fate Isabella thought D h here she was we met and was I not at the time struck with the peculiar feeling of her hand the bony hardness so just like mine and yet I could not know she was my sister and now I see she looked so like my mother And Isabella wept and not alone Sophia wept and the strong man Michael mingled his tears with theirs Oh Lord inquired Isabella what is this slavery that it can do such dreadful things what evil can it not do Well may she ask for surely the evils it can and does do daily and hourly can never be summed up till we can see them as they are recorded by him who writes no errors and reckons without mistake This account which now varies so widely in the estimate of different minds will be viewed alike by all Think you dear reader when that day comes the most rapid abolitionist will say Behold I saw all this while on the earth Will he not rather say Oh who has conceived the breadth and depth of this moral malaria this putrescent plague spot Perhaps the pioneers in the slave s cause will be as much surprised as any to find that with all their looking there remained so much unseen GLEANINGS There are some hard things that crossed Isabella s life while in slavery that she has no desire to publish for various reasons First because the parties from whose hands she suffered them have rendered up their account to a higher tribunal and their innocent friends alone are living to have their feelings injured by the recital secondly because they are not all for the public ear from their very nature thirdly and not least because she says were she to tell all that happened to her as a slave all that she knows is God s truth it would seem to others especially the uninitiated so unaccountable so unreasonable and what is usually called so unnatural though it may be questioned whether people do not always act naturally they would not easily believe it Why no she says they d call me a liar they would indeed and I do not wish to say anything to destroy my own character for veracity though what I say is strictly true Some things have been omitted through forgetfulness which not having been mentioned in their places can only be briefly spoken of here such as that her father Bomefree had had two wives before he took Mau mau Bett one of whom if not both were torn from him by the iron hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh that her husband Thomas after one of his wives had been sold away from him ran away to New York City where he remained a year or two before he was discovered and taken back to the prison house of slavery that her master Dumont when he promised Isabella one year of her time before the State should make her free made the same promise to her husband and in addition to freedom they were promised a log cabin for a home of their own all of which with the one thousand and one day dreams resulting therefrom went into the repository of unfulfilled promises and unrealized hopes that she had often heard her father repeat a thrilling story of a little slave child which because it annoyed the family with its cries was caught up by a white man who dashed its brains out against the wall An Indian for Indians were plenty in that region then passed along as the bereaved mother washed the bloody corpse of her murdered child and learning the cause of its death said with characteristic vehemence If I had been here I would have put my tomahawk in his head meaning the murderer s Of the cruelty of one Hasbrouck He had a sick slave woman who was lingering with a slow consumption whom he made to spin regardless of her weakness and suffering and this woman had a child that was unable to walk or talk at the age of five years neither could it cry like other children but made a constant piteous moaning sound This exhibition of helplessness and imbecility instead of exciting the master s pity stung his cupidity and so enraged him that he would kick the poor thing about like a foot ball Isabella s informant had seen this brute of a man when the child was curled up under a chair innocently amusing itself with a few sticks drag it hence that he might have the pleasure of tormenting it She had see him with one blow of his foot send it rolling quite across the room and down the steps at the door Oh how she wished it might instantly die But she said it seemed as tough as a moccasin Though it did die at last and made glad the heart of its friends and its persecutor no doubt rejoiced with them but from very different motives But the day of his retribution was not far off for he sickened and his reason fled It was fearful to hear his old slave soon tell how in the day of his calamity she treated him She was very strong and was therefore selected to support her master as he sat up in bed by putting her arms around while she stood behind him It was then that she did her best to wreak her vengeance on him She would clutch his feeble frame in her iron grasp as in a vice and when her mistress did not see would give him a squeeze a shake and lifting him up set him down again as hard as possible If his breathing betrayed too tight a grasp and her mistress said Be careful don t hurt him Soan her every ready answer was Oh no Missus no in her most pleasant tone and then as soon as Missus s eyes and ears were engaged away another grasp another shake another bounce She was afraid the disease alone would let him recover an event she dreaded more than to do wrong herself Isabella asked her if she were not afraid his spirit would haunt her Oh no says Soan he was so wicked the devil will never let him out of hell long enough for that Many slaveholders boast of the love of their slaves How would it freeze the blood of some of them to know what kind of love rankles in the bosoms of slaves for them Witness the attempt to poison missus Calhoun and hundreds of similar cases Most surprising to every body because committed by slaves supposed to be so grateful for their chains These reflections bring to mind a discussion on this point between the writer and a slaveholding friend in Kentucky on Christmas morning eighteen forty six We had asserted that until mankind were far in advance of what they are now irresponsible power over our fellow beings would be as it is abused Our friend declared it was his conviction that the cruelties of slavery existed chiefly in imagination and that no person in D County where we then were but would be above ill treating a helpless slave We answered that if his belief was well founded the people in Kentucky were greatly in advance of the people of New England for we would not dare say as much as that of any school district there letting alone counties No we would not answer for our own conduct even on so delicate a point The next evening he very magnanimously overthrew his own position and established ours by informing us that on the morning previous and as near as we could learn at the very hour in which we were earnestly discussing the probabilities of the case a young woman of fine appearance and high standing in society the pride of her husband and the mother of an infant daughter only a few miles from us ay in D County too was actually beating in the skull of a slave woman called Tabby and not content with that had her tied up and whipped after her skull was broken and she died hanging to the bedstead to which she had been fastened When informed that Tabby was dead she answered I am glad of it for she has worried my life out of me But Tabby s highest good was probably not the end proposed by missus M for no one supposed she meant to kill her Tabby was considered quite lacking in good sense and no doubt belonged to that class at the South that are silly enough to die of moderate correction A mob collected around the house for an hour or two in that manner expressing a momentary indignation But was she treated as a murderess Not at all She was allowed to take boat for her residence was near the beautiful Ohio that evening to spend a few months with her absent friends after which she returned and remained with her husband no one to molest or make her afraid Had she been left to the punishment of an outraged conscience from right motives I would have rejoiced with exceeding joy But to see the life of one woman and she a murderess put in the balance against the lives of three millions of innocent slaves and to contrast her punishment with what I felt would be the punishment of one who was merely suspected of being an equal friend of all mankind regardless of color or condition caused my blood to stir within me and my heart to sicken at the thought The husband of missus M was absent from home at the time alluded to and when he arrived some weeks afterwards bringing beautiful presents to his cherished companion he beheld his once happy home deserted Tabby murdered and buried in the garden and the wife of his bosom and the mother of his child the doer of a dreadful deed a murderess When Isabella went to New York City she went in company with a Miss Grear who introduced her to the family of mister James Latourette a wealthy merchant and a Methodist in religion but who the latter part of his life felt that he had outgrown ordinances and advocated free meetings holding them at his own dwelling house for several years previous to his death She worked for them and they generously gave her a home while she labored for others and in their kindness made her as one of their own At that time the moral reform movement was awakening the attention of the benevolent in that city Many women among whom were missus Latourette and Miss Grear became deeply interested in making an attempt to reform their fallen sisters even the most degraded of them and in this enterprise of labor and danger they enlisted Isabella and others who for a time put forth their most zealous efforts and performed the work of missionaries with much apparent success Isabella accompanied those ladies to the most wretched abodes of vice and misery and sometimes she went where they dared not follow They even succeeded in establishing prayer meetings in several places where such a thing might least have been expected But these meetings soon became the most noisy shouting ranting and boisterous of gatherings where they became delirious with excitement and then exhausted from over action Such meetings Isabel had not much sympathy with at best But one evening she attended one of them where the members of it in a fit of ecstasy jumped upon her cloak in such a manner as to drag her to the floor and then thinking she had fallen in a spiritual trance they increased their glorifications on her account jumping shouting stamping and clapping of hands rejoicing so much over her spirit and so entirely overlooking her body that she suffered much both from fear and bruises and ever after refused to attend any more such meetings doubting much whether God had any thing to do with such worship THE MATTHIAS DELUSION We now come to an eventful period in the life of Isabella as identified with one of the most extraordinary religious delusions of modern times but the limits prescribed for the present work forbid a minute narration of all the occurrences that transpired in relation to it After she had joined the African Church in Church street and during her membership there she frequently attended mister Latourette s meetings at one of which mister Smith invited her to go to a prayer meeting or to instruct the girls at the Magdalene Asylum Bowery Hill then under the protection of mister Pierson and some other persons chiefly respectable females To reach the Asylum Isabella called on Katy mister Pierson s colored servant of whom she had some knowledge mister Pierson saw her there conversed with her asked her if she had been baptized and was answered characteristically by the Holy Ghost After this Isabella saw Katy several times and occasionally mister Pierson who engaged her to keep his house while Katy went to Virginia to see her children This engagement was considered an answer to a prayer by mister Pierson who had both fasted and prayed on the subject while Katy and Isabella appeared to see in it the hand of God mister Pierson was characterized by a strong devotional spirit which finally became highly fanatical He assumed the title of Prophet asserting that God had called him in an omnibus in these words Thou are Elijah the Tishbite Gather unto me all the members of Israel at the foot of Mount Carmel which he understood as meaning the gathering of his friends at Bowery Hill Not long afterward he became acquainted with the notorious Matthias whose career was as extraordinary as it was brief Robert Matthews or Matthias as he was usually called was of Scotch extraction but a native of Washington County New York and at that time about forty seven years of age He was religiously brought up among the Anti Burghers a sect of Presbyterians the clergyman the reverend mister Bevridge visiting the family after the manner of the church and being pleased with Robert put his hand on his head when a boy and pronounced a blessing and this blessing with his natural qualities determined his character for he ever after thought he should be a distinguished man Matthias was brought up a farmer till nearly eighteen years of age but acquired indirectly the art of a carpenter without any regular apprenticeship and showed considerable mechanical skill He obtained property from his uncle Robert Thompson and then he went into business as a store keeper was considered respectable and became a member of the Scotch Presbyterian Church He married in eighteen thirteen and continued in business in Cambridge In eighteen sixteen he ruined himself by a building speculation and the derangement of the currency which denied bank facilities and soon after he came to New York with his family and worked at his trade He afterwards removed to Albany and became a hearer at the Dutch Reformed Church then under doctor Ludlow s charge He was frequently much excited on religious subjects In eighteen twenty nine he was well known if not for street preaching for loud discussions and pavement exhortations but he did not make set sermons In the beginning of eighteen thirty he was only considered zealous but in the same year he prophesied the destruction of the Albanians and their capital and while preparing to shave with the Bible before him he suddenly put down the soap and exclaimed I have found it I have found a text which proves that no man who shaves his beard can be a true Christian and shortly afterwards without shaving he went to the Mission House to deliver an address which he had promised and in this address he proclaimed his new character pronounced vengeance on the land and that the law of God was the only rule of government and that he was commanded to take possession of the world in the name of the King of kings His harangue was cut short by the trustees putting out the lights About this time Matthias laid by his implements of industry and in June he advised his wife to fly with him from the destruction which awaited them in the city and on her refusal partly on account of Matthias calling himself a Jew whom she was unwilling to retain as a husband he left her taking some of the children to his sister in Argyle forty miles from Albany At Argyle he entered the church and interrupted the minister declaring the congregation in darkness and warning them to repentance He was of course taken out of the church and as he was advertised in the Albany papers he was sent back to his family His beard had now obtained a respectable length and thus he attracted attention and easily obtained an audience in the streets For this he was sometimes arrested once by mistake for Adam Paine who collected the crowd and then left Matthias with it on the approach of the officers He repeatedly urged his wife to accompany him on a mission to convert the world declaring that food could be obtained from the roots of the forest if not administered otherwise At this time he assumed the name of Matthias called himself a Jew and set out on a mission taking a western course and visiting a brother at Rochester a skillful mechanic since dead Leaving his brother he proceeded on his mission over the Northern States occasionally returning to Albany After visiting Washington and passing through Pennsylvania he came to New York His appearance at that time was mean but grotesque and his sentiments were but little known On May the fifth eighteen thirty two he first called on mister Pierson in Fourth street in his absence Isabella was alone in the house in which she had lived since the previous autumn On opening the door she for the first time beheld Matthias and her early impression of seeing Jesus in the flesh rushed to her mind She heard his inquiry and invited him into the parlor and being naturally curious and much excited and possessing a good deal of tact she drew him into conversation stated her own opinions and heard his replies and explanations Her faith was at first staggered by his declaring himself a Jew but on this point she was relieved by his saying Do you not remember how Jesus prayed and repeated part of the Lord s Prayer in proof that the Father s kingdom was to come and not the Son s She then understood him to be a converted Jew and in the conclusion she says she felt as if God had sent him to set up the kingdom Thus Matthias at once secured the good will of Isabella and we may supposed obtained from her some information in relation to mister Pierson especially that missus Pierson declared there was no true church and approved of mister Pierson s preaching Matthias left the house promising to return on Saturday evening mister P at this time had not seen Matthias Isabella desirous of hearing the expected conversation between Matthias and mister Pierson on Saturday hurried her work got it finished and was permitted to be present Indeed the sameness of belief made her familiar with her employer while her attention to her work and characteristic faithfulness increased his confidence This intimacy the result of holding the same faith and the principle afterwards adopted of having but one table and all things in common made her at once the domestic and the equal and the depositary of very curious if not valuable information To this object even her color assisted Persons who have traveled in the South know the manner in which the colored people and especially slaves are treated they are scarcely regarded as being present This trait in our American character has been frequently noticed by foreign travelers One English lady remarks that she discovered in course of conversation with a Southern married gentleman that a colored girl slept in his bedroom in which also was his wife and when he saw that it occasioned some surprise he remarked What would he do if he wanted a glass of water in the night Other travelers have remarked that the presence of colored people never seemed to interrupt a conversation of any kind for one moment Isabella then was present at the first interview between Matthias and Pierson At this interview mister Pierson asked Matthias if he had a family to which he replied in the affirmative he asked him about his beard and he gave a scriptural reason asserting also that the Jews did not shave and that Adam had a beard mister Pierson detailed to Matthias his experience and Matthias gave his and they mutually discovered that they held the same sentiments both admitting the direct influence of the Spirit and the transmission of spirits from one body to another Matthias admitted the call of mister Pierson in the omnibus in Wall street which on this occasion he gave in these words Thou art Elijah the Tishbite and thou shalt go before me in the spirit and power of Elias to prepare my way before me And mister Pierson admitted Matthias call who completed his declaration on the twentieth of June in Argyle which by a curious coincidence was the very day on which Pierson had received his call in the omnibus Such singular coincidences have a powerful effect on excited minds From that discovery Pierson and Matthias rejoiced in each other and became kindred spirits Matthias however claiming to be the Father or to possess the spirit of the Father he was God upon the earth because the spirit of God dwelt in him while Pierson then understood that his mission was like that of John the Baptist which the name Elias meant This conference ended with an invitation to supper and Matthias and Pierson washing each other s feet mister Pierson preached on the following Sunday but after which he declined in favor of Matthias and some of the party believed that the kingdom had then come As a specimen of Matthias preaching and sentiments the following is said to be reliable The spirit that built the Tower of Babel is now in the world it is the spirit of the devil The spirit of man never goes upon the clouds all who think so are Babylonians The only heaven is on earth All who are ignorant of truth are Ninevites The Jews did not crucify Christ it was the Gentiles Every Jew has his guardian angel attending him in this world God don t speak through preachers he speaks through me his prophet John the Baptist addressing mister Pierson read the tenth chapter of Revelations After the reading of the chapter the prophet resumed speaking as follows Ours is the mustard seed kingdom which is to spread all over the earth Our creed is truth and no man can find truth unless he obeys John the Baptist and comes clean into the church All real men will be saved all mock men will be damned When a person has the Holy Ghost then he is a man and not till then They who teach women are of the wicked The communion is all nonsense so is prayer Eating a nip of bread and drinking a little wine won t do any good All who admit members into their church and suffer them to hold their lands and houses their sentence is Depart ye wicked I know you not All females who lecture their husbands their sentence is the same The sons of truth are to enjoy all the good things of this world and must use their means to bring it about Every thing that has the smell of woman will be destroyed Woman is the capsheaf of the abomination of desolation full of all deviltry In a short time the world will take fire and dissolve it is combustible already All women not obedient had better become so as soon as possible and let the wicked spirit depart and become temples of truth Praying is all mocking When you see any one wring the neck of a fowl instead of cutting off its head he has not got the Holy Ghost Cutting gives the least pain All who eat swine s flesh are of the devil and just as certain as he eats it he will tell a lie in less than half an hour If you eat a piece of pork it will go crooked through you and the Holy Ghost will not stay in you but one or the other must leave the house pretty soon The pork will be as crooked in you as ram s horns and as great a nuisance as the hogs in the street The cholera is not the right word it is choler which means God s wrath Abraham Isaac and Jacob are now in this world they did not go up in the clouds as some believe why should they go there They don t want to go there to box the compass from one place to another The Christians now a days are for setting up the Son s kingdom It is not his it is the Father s kingdom It puts me in mind of a man in the country who took his son in business and had his sign made Hitchcock Son but the son wanted it Hitchcock Father and that is the way with your Christians They talk of the Son s kingdom first and not the Father s kingdom Matthias and his disciples at this time did not believe in a resurrection of the body but that the spirits of the former saints would enter the bodies of the present generation and thus begin heaven on earth of which he and mister Pierson were the first fruits Matthias made the residence of mister Pierson his own but the latter being apprehensive of popular violence in his house if Matthias remained there proposed a monthly allowance to him and advised him to occupy another dwelling Matthias accordingly took a house in Clarkson street and then sent for his family at Albany but they declined coming to the city However his brother George complied with a similar offer bringing his family with him where they found very comfortable quarters Isabella was employed to do the housework In May eighteen thirty three Matthias left his house and placed the furniture part of which was Isabella s elsewhere living himself at the hotel corner of Marketfield and West streets Isabella found employment at mister Whiting s Canal street and did the washing for Matthias by missus Whiting s permission Of the subsequent removal of Matthias to the farm and residence of mister B Folger at Sing Sing where he was joined by mister Pierson and others laboring under a similar religious delusion the sudden melancholy and somewhat suspicious death of mister Pierson and the arrest of Matthias on the charge of his murder ending in a verdict of not guilty the criminal connection that subsisted between Matthias missus Folger and other members of the Kingdom as match spirits the final dispersion of this deluded company and the voluntary exilement of Matthias in the far West after his release c c we do not deem it useful or necessary to give any particulars Those who are curious to know what there transpired are referred to a work published in New York in eighteen thirty five entitled Fanaticism its Sources and Influence illustrated by the simple Narrative of Isabella in the case of Matthias mister and missus B Folger mister Pierson mister Mills Catharine Isabella c c By G Vale eighty four Roosevelt street Suffice it to say that while Isabella was a member of the household at Sing Sing doing much laborious service in the spirit of religious disinterestedness and gradually getting her vision purged and her mind cured of its illusions she happily escaped the contamination that surrounded her assiduously endeavoring to discharge all her duties in a becoming manner FASTING When Isabella resided with mister Pierson he was in the habit of fasting every Friday not eating or drinking anything from Thursday evening to six o clock on Friday evening Then again he would fast two nights and three days neither eating nor drinking refusing himself even a cup of cold water till the third day at night when he took supper again as usual Isabella asked him why he fasted He answered that fasting gave him great light in the things of God which answer gave birth to the following train of thought in the mind of his auditor Well if fasting will give light inwardly and spiritually I need it as much as any body and I ll fast too If mister Pierson needs to fast two nights and three days then I who need light more than he does ought to fast more and I will fast three nights and three days This resolution she carried out to the letter putting not so much as a drop of water in her mouth for three whole days and nights The fourth morning as she arose to her feet not having the power to stand she fell to the floor but recovering herself sufficiently she made her way to the pantry and feeling herself quite voracious and fearing that she might now offend God by her voracity compelled herself to breakfast on dry bread and water eating a large six penny loaf before she felt at all stayed or satisfied She says she did get light but it was all in her body and none in her mind and this lightness of body lasted a long time Oh she was so light and felt so well she could skim around like a gull THE CAUSE OF HER LEAVING THE CITY The first years spent by Isabella in the city she accumulated more than enough to satisfy all her wants and she placed all the overplus in the Savings Bank Afterwards while living with mister Pierson he prevailed on her to take it all thence and invest it in a common fund which he was about establishing as a fund to be drawn from by all the faithful the faithful of course were the handful that should subscribe to his peculiar creed This fund commenced by mister Pierson afterwards became part and parcel of the kingdom of which Matthias assumed to be head and at the breaking up of the kingdom her little property was merged in the general ruin or went to enrich those who profited by the loss of others if any such there were mister Pierson and others had so assured her that the fund would supply all her wants at all times and in all emergencies and to the end of life that she became perfectly careless on the subject asking for no interest when she drew her money from the bank and taking no account of the sum she placed in the fund She recovered a few articles of the furniture from the wreck of the kingdom and received a small sum of money from mister B Folger as the price of missus Folger s attempt to convict her of murder With this to start upon she commenced anew her labors in the hope of yet being able to accumulate a sufficiency to make a little home for herself in her advancing age With this stimulus before her she toiled hard working early and late doing a great deal for a little money and turning her hand to almost anything that promised good pay Still she did not prosper and somehow could not contrive to lay by a single dollar for a rainy day When this had been the state of her affairs some time she suddenly paused and taking a retrospective view of what had passed inquired within herself why it was that for all her unwearied labors she had nothing to show why it was that others with much less care and labor could hoard up treasures for themselves and children She became more and more convinced as she reasoned that every thing she had undertaken in the city of New York had finally proved a failure and where her hopes had been raised the highest there she felt the failure had been the greatest and the disappointment most severe After turning it in her mind for some time she came to the conclusion that she had been taking part in a great drama which was in itself but one great system of robbery and wrong Yes she said the rich rob the poor and the poor rob one another True she had not received labor from others and stinted their pay as she felt had been practised against her but she had taken their work from them which was their only means to get money and was the same to them in the end For instance a gentleman where she lived would give her a dollar to hire a poor man to clear the new fallen snow from the steps and side walks She would arise early and perform the labor herself putting the money into her own pocket A poor man would come along saying she ought to have let him have the job he was poor and needed the pay for his family She would harden her heart against him and answer I am poor too and I need it for mine But in her retrospection she thought of all the misery she might have been adding to in her selfish grasping and it troubled her conscience sorely and this insensibility to the claims of human brotherhood and the wants of the destitute and wretched poor she now saw as she never had done before to be unfeeling selfish and wicked These reflections and convictions gave rise to a sudden revulsion of feeling in the heart of Isabella and she began to look upon money and property with great indifference if not contempt being at that time unable probably to discern any difference between a miserly grasping at and hoarding of money and means and a true use of the good things of this life for one s own comfort and the relief of such as she might be enabled to befriend and assist One thing she was sure of that the precepts Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you Love your neighbor as yourself and so forth were maxims that had been but little thought of by herself or practised by those about her Her next decision was that she must leave the city it was no place for her yea she felt called in spirit to leave it and to travel east and lecture She had never been further east than the city neither had she any friends there of whom she had particular reason to expect any thing yet to her it was plain that her mission lay in the east and that she would find friends there She determined on leaving but these determinations and convictions she kept close locked in her own breast knowing that if her children and friends were aware of it they would make such an ado about it as would render it very unpleasant if not distressing to all parties Having made what preparations for leaving she deemed necessary which was to put up a few articles of clothing in a pillow case all else being deemed an unnecessary incumbrance about an hour before she left she informed missus Whiting the woman of the house where she was stopping that her name was no longer Isabella but SOJOURNER and that she was going east And to her inquiry What are you going east for her answer was The Spirit calls me there and I must go She left the city on the morning of the first of June eighteen forty three crossing over to Brooklyn L I and taking the rising sun for her only compass and guide she remembered Lot s wife and hoping to avoid her fate she resolved not to look back till she felt sure the wicked city from which she was fleeing was left too far behind to be visible in the distance and when she first ventured to look back she could just discern the blue cloud of smoke that hung over it and she thanked the Lord that she was thus far removed from what seemed to her a second Sodom She was now fairly started on her pilgrimage her bundle in one hand and a little basket of provisions in the other and two York shillings in her purse her heart strong in the faith that her true work lay before her and that the Lord was her director and she doubted not he would provide for and protect her and that it would be very censurable in her to burden herself with any thing more than a moderate supply for her then present needs Her mission was not merely to travel east but to lecture as she designated it testifying of the hope that was in her exhorting the people to embrace Jesus and refrain from sin the nature and origin of which she explained to them in accordance with her own most curious and original views Through her life and all its chequered changes she has ever clung fast to her first permanent impressions on religious subjects Wherever night overtook her there she sought for lodgings free if she might if not she paid at a tavern if she chanced to be at one if not at a private dwelling with the rich if they would receive her if not with the poor But she soon discovered that the largest houses were nearly always full if not quite full company was soon expected and that it was much easier to find an unoccupied corner in a small house than in a large one and if a person possessed but a miserable roof over his head you might be sure of a welcome to part of it But this she had penetration enough to see was quite as much the effect of a want of sympathy as of benevolence and this was also very apparent in her religious conversations with people who were strangers to her She said she never could find out that the rich had any religion If I had been rich and accomplished I could for the rich could always find religion in the rich and I could find it among the poor At first she attended such meetings as she heard of in the vicinity of her travels and spoke to the people as she found them assembled Afterwards she advertised meetings of her own and held forth to large audiences having as she said a good time When she became weary of travelling and wished a place to stop a while and rest herself she said some opening for her was always near at hand and the first time she needed rest a man accosted her as she was walking inquiring if she was looking for work She told him that was not the object of her travels but that she would willingly work a few days if any one wanted He requested her to go to his family who were sadly in want of assistance which he had been thus far unable to supply She went to the house where she was directed and was received by his family one of whom was ill as a Godsend and when she felt constrained to resume her journey they were very sorry and would fain have detained her longer but as she urged the necessity of leaving they offered her what seemed in her eyes a great deal of money as a remuneration for her labor and an expression of their gratitude for her opportune assistance but she would only receive a very little of it enough as she says to enable her to pay tribute to Caesar if it was demanded of her and two or three York shillings at a time were all she allowed herself to take and then with purse replenished and strength renewed she would once more set out to perform her mission THE CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSING A TRAVELLER A NIGHT S LODGING As she drew near the center of the Island she commenced one evening at nightfall to solicit the favor of a night s lodging She had repeated her request a great many it seemed to her some twenty times and as many times she received a negative answer She walked on the stars and the tiny horns of the new moon shed but a dim light on her lonely way when she was familiarly accosted by two Indians who took her for an acquaintance She told them they were mistaken in the person she was a stranger there and asked them the direction to a tavern They informed her it was yet a long way some two miles or so and inquired if she were alone Not wishing for their protection or knowing what might be the character of their kindness she answered No not exactly and passed on At the end of a weary way she came to the tavern or rather to a large building which was occupied as a court house tavern and jail and on asking for a night s lodging was informed she could stay if she would consent to be locked in This to her mind was an insuperable objection To have a key turned on her was a thing not to be thought of at least not to be endured and she again took up her line of march preferring to walk beneath the open sky to being locked up by a stranger in such a place She had not walked far before she heard the voice of a woman under an open shed she ventured to accost her and inquired if she knew where she could get in for the night The woman answered that she did not unless she went home with them and turning to her good man asked him if the stranger could not share their home for the night to which he cheerfully assented Sojourner thought it evident he had been taking a drop too much but as he was civil and good natured and she did not feel inclined to spend the night alone in the open air she felt driven to the necessity of accepting their hospitality whatever it might prove to be The woman soon informed her that there was a ball in the place at which they would like to drop in a while before they went to their home Balls being no part of Sojourner s mission she was not desirous of attending but her hostess could be satisfied with nothing short of a taste of it and she was forced to go with her or relinquish their company at once in which move there might be more exposure than in accompanying her She went and soon found herself surrounded by an assemblage of people collected from the very dregs of society too ignorant and degraded to understand much less entertain a high or bright idea in a dirty hovel destitute of every comfort and where the fumes of whiskey were abundant and powerful Sojourner s guide there was too much charmed with the combined entertainments of the place to be able to tear herself away till she found her faculties for enjoyment failing her from a too free use of liquor and she betook herself to bed till she could recover them Sojourner seated in a corner had time for many reflections and refrained from lecturing them in obedience to the recommendation Cast not your pearls c When the night was far spent the husband of the sleeping woman aroused the sleeper and reminded her that she was not very polite to the woman she had invited to sleep at her house and of the propriety of returning home They once more emerged into the pure air which to our friend Sojourner after so long breathing the noisome air of the ball room was most refreshing and grateful Just as day dawned they reached the place they called their home Sojourner now saw that she had lost nothing in the shape of rest by remaining so long at the ball as their miserable cabin afforded but one bunk or pallet for sleeping and had there been many such she would have preferred sitting up all night to occupying one like it They very politely offered her the bed if she would use it but civilly declining she waited for morning with an eagerness of desire she never felt before on the subject and was never more happy than when the eye of day shed its golden light once more over the earth She was once more free and while daylight should last independent and needed no invitation to pursue her journey Let these facts teach us that every pedestrian in the world is not a vagabond and that it is a dangerous thing to compel any one to receive that hospitality from the vicious and abandoned which they should have received from us as thousands can testify who have thus been caught in the snares of the wicked The fourth of July Isabella arrived at Huntingdon from thence she went to Cold Springs where she found the people making preparations for a mass temperance meeting With her usual alacrity she entered into their labors getting up dishes a la New York greatly to the satisfaction of those she assisted After remaining at Cold Springs some three weeks she returned to Huntingdon where she took boat for Connecticut Landing at Bridgeport she again resumed her travels towards the north east lecturing some and working some to get wherewith to pay tribute to Caesar as she called it and in this manner she presently came to the city of New Haven where she found many meetings which she attended at some of which she was allowed to express her views freely and without reservation She also called meetings expressly to give herself an opportunity to be heard and found in the city many true friends of Jesus as she judged with whom she held communion of spirit having no preference for one sect more than another but being well satisfied with all who gave her evidence of having known or loved the Saviour After thus delivering her testimony in this pleasant city feeling she had not as yet found an abiding place she went from thence to Bristol at the request of a zealous sister who desired her to go to the latter place and hold a religious conversation with some friends of hers there She went as requested found the people kindly and religiously disposed and through them she became acquainted with several very interesting persons A spiritually minded brother in Bristol becoming interested in her new views and original opinions requested as a favor that she would go to Hartford to see and converse with friends of his there Standing ready to perform any service in the Lord she went to Hartford as desired bearing in her hand the following note from this brother SISTER I send you this living messenger as I believe her to be one that God loves Ethiopia is stretching forth her hands unto God You can see by this sister that God does by his Spirit alone teach his own children things to come Please receive her and she will tell you some new things Let her tell her story without interrupting her and give close attention and you will see she has got the lever of truth that God helps her to pry where but few can She cannot read or write but the law is in her heart Send her to brother brother and where she can do the most good From your brother H L B SOME OF HER VIEWS AND REASONINGS As soon as Isabella saw God as an all powerful all pervading spirit she became desirous of hearing all that had been written of him and listened to the account of the creation of the world and its first inhabitants as contained in the first chapters of Genesis with peculiar interest For some time she received it all literally though it appeared strange to her that God worked by the day got tired and stopped to rest c But after a little time she began to reason upon it thus Why if God works by the day and one day s work tires him and he is obliged to rest either from weariness or on account of darkness or if he waited for the cool of the day to walk in the garden because he was inconvenienced by the heat of the sun why then it seems that God cannot do as much as I can for I can bear the sun at noon and work several days and nights in succession without being much tired Or if he rested nights because of the darkness it is very queer that he should make the night so dark that he could not see himself If I had been God I would have made the night light enough for my own convenience surely But the moment she placed this idea of God by the side of the impression she had once so suddenly received of his inconceivable greatness and entire spirituality that moment she exclaimed mentally No God does not stop to rest for he is a spirit and cannot tire he cannot want for light for he hath all light in himself And if God is all in all and worketh all in all as I have heard them read then it is impossible he should rest at all for if he did every other thing would stop and rest too the waters would not flow and the fishes could not swim and all motion must cease God could have no pauses in his work and he needed no Sabbaths of rest Man might need them and he should take them when he needed them whenever he required rest As it regarded the worship of God he was to be worshipped at all times and in all places and one portion of time never seemed to her more holy than another These views which were the results of the workings of her own mind assisted solely by the light of her own experience and very limited knowledge were for a long time after their adoption closely locked in her own breast fearing lest their avowal might bring upon her the imputation of infidelity the usual charge preferred by all religionists against those who entertain religious views and feelings differing materially from their own If from their own sad experience they are withheld from shouting the cry of infidel they fail not to see and to feel ay and to say that the dissenters are not of the right spirit and that their spiritual eyes have never been unsealed While travelling in Connecticut she met a minister with whom she held a long discussion on these points as well as on various other topics such as the origin of all things especially the origin of evil at the same time bearing her testimony strongly against a paid ministry He belonged to that class and as a matter of course as strongly advocated his own side of the question I had forgotten to mention in its proper place a very important fact that when she was examining the Scriptures she wished to hear them without comment but if she employed adult persons to read them to her and she asked them to read a passage over again they invariably commenced to explain by giving her their version of it and in this way they tried her feelings exceedingly In consequence of this she ceased to ask adult persons to read the Bible to her and substituted children in their stead Children as soon as they could read distinctly would re read the same sentence to her as often as she wished and without comment and in that way she was enabled to see what her own mind could make out of the record and that she said was what she wanted and not what others thought it to mean She wished to compare the teachings of the Bible with the witness within her and she came to the conclusion that the spirit of truth spoke in those records but that the recorders of those truths had intermingled with them ideas and suppositions of their own This is one among the many proofs of her energy and independence of character When it became known to her children that Sojourner had left New York they were filled with wonder and alarm Where could she have gone and why had she left were questions no one could answer satisfactorily Now their imaginations painted her as a wandering maniac and again they feared she had been left to commit suicide and many were the tears they shed at the loss of her But when she reached Berlin Conn she wrote to them by amanuensis informing them of her whereabouts and waiting an answer to her letter thus quieting their fears and gladdening their hearts once more with assurances of her continued life and her love THE SECOND ADVENT DOCTRINES In Hartford and vicinity she met with several persons who believed in the Second Advent doctrines or the immediate personal appearance of Jesus Christ At first she thought she had never heard of Second Advent But when it was explained to her she recollected having once attended mister Miller s meeting in New York where she saw a great many enigmatical pictures hanging on the wall which she could not understand and which being out of the reach of her understanding failed to interest her In this section of country she attended two camp meetings of the believers in these doctrines the second advent excitement being then at its greatest height The last meeting was at Windsor Lock The people as a matter of course eagerly inquired of her concerning her belief as it regarded their most important tenet She told them it had not been revealed to her perhaps if she could read she might see it differently Sometimes to their eager inquiry Oh don t you believe the Lord is coming she answered I believe the Lord is as near as he can be and not be it With these evasive and non exciting answers she kept their minds calm as it respected her unbelief till she could have an opportunity to hear their views fairly stated in order to judge more understandingly of this matter and see if in her estimation there was any good ground for expecting an event which was in the minds of so many as it were shaking the very foundations of the universe She was invited to join them in their religious exercises and accepted the invitation praying and talking in her own peculiar style and attracting many about her by her singing When she had convinced the people that she was a lover of God and his cause and had gained a good standing with them so that she could get a hearing among them she had become quite sure in her own mind that they were laboring under a delusion and she commenced to use her influence to calm the fears of the people and pour oil upon the troubled waters In one part of the grounds she found a knot of people greatly excited she mounted a stump and called out Hear hear When the people had gathered around her as they were in a state to listen to any thing new she addressed them as children and asked them why they made such a To do are you not commanded to watch and pray You are neither watching nor praying And she bade them with the tones of a kind mother retire to their tents and there watch and pray without noise or tumult for the Lord would not come to such a scene of confusion the Lord came still and quiet She assured them the Lord might come move all through the camp and go away again and they never know it in the state they then were They seemed glad to seize upon any reason for being less agitated and distressed and many of them suppressed their noisy terror and retired to their tents to watch and pray begging others to do the same and listen to the advice of the good sister She felt she had done some good and then went to listen further to the preachers They appeared to her to be doing their utmost to agitate and excite the people who were already too much excited and when she had listened till her feelings would let her listen silently no longer she arose and addressed the preachers The following are specimens of her speech Here you are talking about being changed in the twinkling of an eye If the Lord should come he d change you to nothing for there is nothing to you You seem to be expecting to go to some parlor away up somewhere and when the wicked have been burnt you are coming back to walk in triumph over their ashes this is to be your New Jerusalem Now I can t see any thing so very nice in that coming back to such a muss as that will be a world covered with the ashes of the wicked Besides if the Lord comes and burns as you say he will I am not going away I am going to stay here and stand the fire like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego And Jesus will walk with me through the fire and keep me from harm Nothing belonging to God can burn any more than God himself such shall have no need to go away to escape the fire No I shall remain Do you tell me that God s children can t stand fire And her manner and tone spoke louder than words saying It is absurd to think so The ministers were taken quite aback at so unexpected an opposer and one of them in the kindest possible manner commenced a discussion with her by asking her questions and quoting scripture to her concluding finally that although she had learned nothing of the great doctrine which was so exclusively occupying their minds at the time she had learned much that man had never taught her At this meeting she received the address of different persons residing in various places with an invitation to visit them She promised to go soon to Cabotville and started shaping her course for that place She arrived at Springfield one evening at six o clock and immediately began to search for a lodging for the night She walked from six till past nine and was then on the road from Springfield to Cabotville before she found any one sufficiently hospitable to give her a night s shelter under their roof Then a man gave her twenty five cents and bade her go to a tavern and stay all night She did so returning in the morning to thank him assuring him she had put his money to its legitimate use She found a number of the friends she had seen at Windsor when she reached the manufacturing town of Cabotville which has lately taken the name of Chicopee and with them she spent a pleasant week or more after which she left them to visit the Shaker village in Enfield She now began to think of finding a resting place at least for a season for she had performed quite a long journey considering she had walked most of the way and she had a mind to look in upon the Shakers and see how things were there and whether there was any opening there for her But on her way back to Springfield she called at a house and asked for a piece of bread her request was granted and she was kindly invited to tarry all night as it was getting late and she would not be able to stay at every house in that vicinity which invitation she cheerfully accepted When the man of the house came in he recollected having seen her at the camp meeting and repeated some conversations by which she recognized him again He soon proposed having a meeting that evening went out and notified his friends and neighbors who came together and she once more held forth to them in her peculiar style Through the agency of this meeting she became acquainted with several people residing in Springfield to whose houses she was cordially invited and with whom she spent some pleasant time One of these friends writing of her arrival there speaks as follows After saying that she and her people belonged to that class of persons who believed in the second advent doctrines and that this class believing also in freedom of speech and action often found at their meetings many singular people who did not agree with them in their principal doctrine and that being thus prepared to hear new and strange things They listened eagerly to Sojourner and drank in all she said and also that she soon became a favorite among them that when she arose to speak in their assemblies her commanding figure and dignified manner hushed every trifler into silence and her singular and sometimes uncouth modes of expression never provoked a laugh but often were the whole audience melted into tears by her touching stories She also adds Many were the lessons of wisdom and faith I have delighted to learn from her She continued a great favorite in our meetings both on account of her remarkable gift in prayer and still more remarkable talent for singing and the aptness and point of her remarks frequently illustrated by figures the most original and expressive As we were walking the other day she said she had often thought what a beautiful world this would be when we should see every thing right side up Now we see every thing topsy turvy and all is confusion For a person who knows nothing of this fact in the science of optics this seemed quite a remarkable idea We also loved her for her sincere and ardent piety her unwavering faith in God and her contempt of what the world calls fashion and what we call folly She was in search of a quiet place where a way worn traveller might rest She had heard of Fruitlands and was inclined to go there but the friends she found here thought it best for her to visit Northampton She passed her time while with us working wherever her work was needed and talking where work was not needed She would not receive money for her work saying she worked for the Lord and if her wants were supplied she received it as from the Lord She remained with us till far into winter when we introduced her at the Northampton Association She wrote to me from thence that she had found the quiet resting place she had so long desired And she has remained there ever since ANOTHER CAMP MEETING When Sojourner had been at Northampton a few months she attended another camp meeting at which she performed a very important part A party of wild young men with no motive but that of entertaining themselves by annoying and injuring the feelings of others had assembled at the meeting hooting and yelling and in various ways interrupting the services and causing much disturbance Those who had the charge of the meeting having tried their persuasive powers in vain grew impatient and tried threatening The young men considering themselves insulted collected their friends to the number of a hundred or more dispersed themselves through the grounds making the most frightful noises and threatening to fire the tents It was said the authorities of the meeting sat in grave consultation decided to have the ring leaders arrested and sent for the constable to the great displeasure of some of the company who were opposed to such an appeal to force and arms Be that as it may Sojourner seeing great consternation depicted in every countenance caught the contagion and ere she was aware found herself quaking with fear Under the impulse of this sudden emotion she fled to the most retired corner of a tent and secreted herself behind a trunk saying to herself I am the only colored person here and on me probably their wicked mischief will fall first and perhaps fatally But feeling how great was her insecurity even there as the very tent began to shake from its foundations she began to soliloquise as follows Shall I run away and hide from the Devil Me a servant of the living God Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that mob when I know it is written One shall chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight I know there are not a thousand here and I know I am a servant of the living God I ll go to the rescue and the Lord shall go with and protect me Oh said she I felt as if I had three hearts and that they were so large my body could hardly hold them She now came forth from her hiding place and invited several to go with her and see what they could do to still the raging of the moral elements They declined and considered her wild to think of it The meeting was in the open fields the full moon shed its saddened light over all and the woman who was that evening to address them was trembling on the preachers stand The noise and confusion were now terrific Sojourner left the tent alone and unaided and walking some thirty rods to the top of a small rise of ground commenced to sing in her most fervid manner with all the strength of her most powerful voice the hymn on the resurrection of Christ It was early in the morning it was early in the morning Just at the break of day When he rose when he rose when he rose And went to heaven on a cloud All who have ever heard her sing this hymn will probably remember it as long as they remember her The hymn the tune the style are each too closely associated with to be easily separated from herself and when sung in one of her most animated moods in the open air with the utmost strength of her most powerful voice must have been truly thrilling As she commenced to sing the young men made a rush towards her and she was immediately encircled by a dense body of the rioters many of them armed with sticks or clubs as their weapons of defence if not of attack As the circle narrowed around her she ceased singing and after a short pause inquired in a gentle but firm tone Why do you come about me with clubs and sticks I am not doing harm to any one We ar n t a going to hurt you old woman we came to hear you sing cried many voices simultaneously Sing to us old woman cries one Talk to us old woman says another Pray old woman says a third Tell us your experience says a fourth You stand and smoke so near me I cannot sing or talk she answered Stand back said several authoritative voices with not the most gentle or courteous accompaniments raising their rude weapons in the air The crowd suddenly gave back the circle became larger as many voices again called for singing talking or praying backed by assurances that no one should be allowed to hurt her the speakers declaring with an oath that they would knock down any person who should offer her the least indignity She looked about her and with her usual discrimination said inwardly Here must be many young men in all this assemblage bearing within them hearts susceptible of good impressions I will speak to them She did speak they silently heard and civilly asked her many questions It seemed to her to be given her at the time to answer them with truth and wisdom beyond herself Her speech had operated on the roused passions of the mob like oil on agitated waters they were as a whole entirely subdued and only clamored when she ceased to speak or sing Those who stood in the back ground after the circle was enlarged cried out Sing aloud old woman we can t hear Those who held the sceptre of power among them requested that she should make a pulpit of a neighboring wagon She said If I do they ll overthrow it No they sha n t he who dares hurt you we ll knock him down instantly d n him cried the chiefs No we won t no we won t nobody shall hurt you answered the many voices of the mob They kindly assisted her to mount the wagon from which she spoke and sung to them about an hour Of all she said to them on the occasion she remembers only the following Well there are two congregations on this ground It is written that there shall be a separation and the sheep shall be separated from the goats The other preachers have the sheep I have the goats And I have a few sheep among my goats but they are very ragged This exordium produced great laughter When she became wearied with talking she began to cast about her to contrive some way to induce them to disperse While she paused they loudly clamored for more more sing sing more She motioned them to be quiet and called out to them Children I have talked and sung to you as you asked me and now I have a request to make of you will you grant it Yes yes yes resounded from every quarter Well it is this she answered if I will sing one more hymn for you will you then go away and leave us this night in peace Yes yes came faintly feebly from a few I repeat it says Sojourner and I want an answer from you all as of one accord If I will sing you one more will you go away and leave us this night in peace Yes yes yes shouted many voices with hearty emphasis I repeat my request once more said she and I want you all to answer And she reiterated the words again This time a long loud Yes yes yes came up as from the multitudinous mouth of the entire mob AMEN it is SEALED repeated Sojourner in the deepest and most solemn tones of her powerful and sonorous voice Its effect ran through the multitude like an electric shock and the most of them considered themselves bound by their promise as they might have failed to do under less imposing circumstances Some of them began instantly to leave others said Are we not to have one more hymn Yes answered their entertainer and she commenced to sing I bless the Lord I ve got my seal to day and to day To slay Goliath in the field to day and to day The good old way is a righteous way I mean to take the kingdom in the good old way While singing she heard some enforcing obedience to their promise while a few seemed refusing to abide by it But before she had quite concluded she saw them turn from her and in the course of a few minutes they were running as fast as they well could in a solid body and she says she can compare them to nothing but a swarm of bees so dense was their phalanx so straight their course so hurried their march As they passed with a rush very near the stand of the other preachers the hearts of the people were smitten with fear thinking that their entertainer had failed to enchain them longer with her spell and that they were coming upon them with redoubled and remorseless fury But they found they were mistaken and that their fears were groundless for before they could well recover from their surprise every rioter was gone and not one was left on the grounds or seen there again during the meeting Sojourner was informed that as her audience reached the main road some distance from the tents a few of the rebellious spirits refused to go on and proposed returning but their leaders said No we have promised to leave all promised and we must go all go and you shall none of you return again She did not fall in love at first sight with the Northampton Association for she arrived there at a time when appearances did not correspond with the ideas of associationists as they had been spread out in their writings for their phalanx was a factory and they were wanting in means to carry out their ideas of beauty and elegance as they would have done in different circumstances But she thought she would make an effort to tarry with them one night though that seemed to her no desirable affair But as soon as she saw that accomplished literary and refined persons were living in that plain and simple manner and submitting to the labors and privations incident to such an infant institution she said Well if these can live here I can Afterwards she gradually became pleased with and attached to the place and the people as well she might for it must have been no small thing to have found a home in a Community composed of some of the choicest spirits of the age where all was characterized by an equality of feeling a liberty of thought and speech and a largeness of soul she could not have before met with to the same extent in any of her wanderings Our first knowledge of her was derived from a friend who had resided for a time in the Community and who after describing her and singing one of her hymns wished that we might see her But we little thought at that time that we should ever pen these simple annals of this child of nature When we first saw her she was working with a hearty good will saying she would not be induced to take regular wages believing as once before that now Providence had provided her with a never failing fount from which her every want might be perpetually supplied through her mortal life In this she had calculated too fast For the Associationists found that taking every thing into consideration they would find it most expedient to act individually and again the subject of this sketch found her dreams unreal and herself flung back upon her own resources for the supply of her needs This she might have found more inconvenient at her time of life for labor exposure and hardship had made sad inroads upon her iron constitution by inducing chronic disease and premature old age had she not remained under the shadow of one who never wearies in doing good giving to the needy and supplying the wants of the destitute She has now set her heart upon having a little home of her own even at this late hour of life where she may feel a greater freedom than she can in the house of another and where she can repose a little after her day of action has passed by And for such a home she is now dependant on the charities of the benevolent and to them we appeal with confidence Through all the scenes of her eventful life may be traced the energy of a naturally powerful mind the fearlessness and child like simplicity of one untrammelled by education or conventional customs purity of character an unflinching adherence to principle and a native enthusiasm which under different circumstances might easily have produced another Joan of Arc With all her fervor and enthusiasm and speculation her religion is not tinctured in the least with gloom No doubt no hesitation no despondency spreads a cloud over her soul but all is bright clear positive and at times ecstatic Her trust is in God and from him she looks for good and not evil She feels that perfect love casteth out fear Having more than once found herself awaking from a mortifying delusion as in the case of the Sing Sing kingdom and resolving not to be thus deluded again she has set suspicion to guard the door of her heart and allows it perhaps to be aroused by too slight causes on certain subjects her vivid imagination assisting to magnify the phantoms of her fears into gigantic proportions much beyond their real size instead of resolutely adhering to the rule we all like best when it is to be applied to ourselves that of placing every thing we see to the account of the best possible motive until time and circumstance prove that we were wrong Where no good motive can be assigned it may become our duty to suspend our judgment till evidence can be had In the application of this rule it is an undoubted duty to exercise a commendable prudence by refusing to repose any important trust to the keeping of persons who may be strangers to us and whose trustworthiness we have never seen tried But no possible good but incalculable evil may and does arise from the too common practice of placing all conduct the source of which we do not fully understand to the worst of intentions How often is the gentle timid soul discouraged and driven perhaps to despondency by finding its good evil spoken of and a well meant but mistaken action loaded with an evil design If the world would but sedulously set about reforming itself on this one point who can calculate the change it would produce the evil it would annihilate and the happiness it would confer None but an all seeing eye could at once embrace so vast a result A result how desirable and one that can be brought about only by the most simple process that of every individual seeing to it that he commit not this sin himself For why should we allow in ourselves the very fault we most dislike when committed against us Shall we not at least aim at consistency Had she possessed less generous self sacrifice more knowledge of the world and of business matters in general and had she failed to take it for granted that others were like herself and would when her turn came to need do as she had done and find it more blessed to give than to receive she might have laid by something for the future For few perhaps have ever possessed the power and inclination in the same degree at one and the same time to labor as she has done both day and night for so long a period of time And had these energies been well directed and the proceeds well husbanded since she has been her own mistress they would have given her an independence during her natural life But her constitutional biases and her early training or rather want of training prevented this result and it is too late now to remedy the great mistake Shall she then be left to want Who will not answer No Note GEORGE W BENSON HER LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER MASTER In the spring of eighteen forty nine Sojourner made a visit to her eldest daughter Diana who has ever suffered from ill health and remained with mister Dumont Isabella s humane master She found him still living though advanced in age and reduced in property as he had been for a number of years but greatly enlightened on the subject of slavery He said he could then see that slavery was the wickedest thing in the world the greatest curse the earth had ever felt that it was then very clear to his mind that it was so though while he was a slaveholder himself he did not see it so and thought it was as right as holding any other property Sojourner remarked to him that it might be the same with those who are now slaveholders O no replied he with warmth it cannot be For now the sin of slavery is so clearly written out and so much talked against why the whole world cries out against it that if any one says he don t know and has not heard he must I think be a liar In my slaveholding days there were few that spoke against it and these few made little impression on any one Had it been as it is now think you I could have held slaves No I should not have dared to do it but should have emancipated every one of them Now it is very different all may hear if they will Yes reader if any one feels that the tocsin of alarm or the anti slavery trump must sound a louder note before they can hear it one would think they must be very hard of hearing yea that they belong to that class of whom it may be truly said they have stopped their ears that they may not hear She received a letter from her daughter Diana dated Hyde Park December nineteen eighteen forty nine which informed her that mister Dumont had gone West with some of his sons that he had taken along with him probably through mistake the few articles of furniture she had left with him Never mind says Sojourner what we give to the poor we lend to the Lord She thanked the Lord with fervor that she had lived to hear her master say such blessed things She recalled the lectures he used to give his slaves on speaking the truth and being honest and laughing she says he taught us not to lie and steal when he was stealing all the time himself and did not know it Oh how sweet to my mind was this confession And what a confession for a master to make to a slave A slaveholding master turned to a brother Poor old man may the Lord bless him and all slave holders partake of his spirit CERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER HURLEY ULSTER company Oct thirteenth eighteen thirty four This is to certify that I am well acquainted with Isabella this colored woman I have been
