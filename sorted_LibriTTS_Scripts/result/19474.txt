Introduction C nineteen fifty two nineteen eighty three by doctor John D Clark New Introduction C nineteen eighty three by John F Carr Cover art by Gino D Achille Introduction to ULLER UPRISING by John F Carr With the publication of this novel Uller Uprising all of H Beam Piper s previously published science fiction is now available in Ace editions Uller Uprising was first published in nineteen fifty two in a Twayne Science Fiction Triplet a hardbound collection of three thematically connected novels The other two were Judith Merril s Daughters of Earth and Fletcher Pratt s The Long View A year later it appeared in the February and March issues of Space Science Fiction edited by Lester Del Rey The magazine version which was abridged by about a third was believed by many bibliographers to be the only version and as a novella it was too short for book publication The Twayne version had a small print run and is so scarce that few people have seen it Those bibliographers who knew of its existence assumed that both versions of Uller were the same It was through a telephone conversation with Charles N Brown publisher of Locus and correspondent with Piper that I learned about the Twayne edition and its greater length Brown allowed me to photocopy his original for which we owe him a debt of thanks because the Twayne version is not only novel length but far better than the shorter one that appeared in Space Science Fiction Probably the most surprising and interesting thing about the Twayne edition is the essay that forms the introduction to that volume and is reprinted here The essay is by doctor John D Clark an eminent scientist of the fourties and fifties and one of the discoverers of sulfa the first miracle drug It describes in great detail the planetary system of the star Beta Hydri and gives the names of those planets Uller and Niflheim A publisher s note states that Clark s essay was written first and given to the contributors as background material for a novel they would then write The fans of H Beam Piper seem to owe a great debt to doctor Clark Uller Uprising became the foundation of Piper s monumental Terro Human Future History the first story where we encounter the Terran Federation In it we learn about Odin the planet that will one day be the capital of the First Galactic Empire and humble Niflheim which in more decadent times will become a common expletive a word meaning hell This is also where Piper introduced and explained the Atomic Era dating system A E Uller Uprising is set in the early years of the Terran Federation s expansion and exploration an epoch of great vitality In The Edge of the Knife Piper compares this time of discovery to the Spanish conquest of the Americas This feeling of vigor and unlimited possibilities runs through all the early Federation stories Uller Uprising Omnilingual Naudsonce When in the Course and to a lesser degree in the late Federation novels Little Fuzzy Fuzzy Sapiens and Fuzzies and Other People See Federation by H Beam Piper for a good overview of this period In these stories we see Terro Humans at their best and at their worst Individual heroism and bravery in the face of grave danger in Uller Uprising Federation law and justice in Little Fuzzy and its sequels and in Omnilingual and Naudsonce the spirit of science and rational inquiry Yet we also see colonial exploitation and subjugation in Uller Uprising and Oomphel in the Sky the greed and corruption of Chartered land companies in Little Fuzzy and political corruption in Four Day Planet These stories are about a living Terro Human culture not a utopia It was Piper s attention to historical realism and his use of actual historical models that have helped his work to pass the test of time and have led to his becoming the favorite of a new generation of readers more than twenty five years after his death Uller Uprising is the story of a confrontation between a human overlord and alien servants with an ironic twist at the end Like most of Piper s best work Uller Uprising is modeled after an actual event in human history in this case the Sepoy Mutiny a Bengal uprising in British held India brought about when rumors were spread to native soldiers that cartridges being issued by the British were coated with animal fat The rebellion quickly spread throughout India and led to the massacre of the British Colony at Cawnpore Piper s novel is not a mere retelling of the Indian Mutiny but rather an analysis of an historical event applied to a similar situation in the far future Like many philosophers and social theorists before him Piper attempted to chart the progress of human kind unlike most however he did not envision or try to create a system of ethics that would end all of humanity s problems The best he could offer was his model of the self reliant man The man who actually knows what has to be done and how to do it and he s going to go right ahead and do it without holding a dozen conferences and round table discussions and giving everybody a fair and equal chance to foul things up for him Piper brought his own ideas and judgments about society and history into all of his work but they appear most clearly in his Terro Human Future History While not everyone will agree with Piper s theories they give his work a bite that most popular fiction lacks One cannot read Piper complacently And one can often find a wry insight sandwiched in between the blood and thunder Other future histories may span more centuries or better illuminate the highlights of several decades but until a rival is created with more historical depth and attention to detail H Beam Piper s Terro Human Future History will stand as the Bayeux Tapestry of science fiction histories In many ways certainly during his lifetime Piper was the most underrated of the John W Campbell s Astounding writers He was probably also the most Campbellian his self reliant man is almost a mirror image of Campbell s Citizen Piper died a bitter man a failure in his own mind shortly before his death he believed he could no longer earn a living as a writer without charity from his friends or the state Now he s the cornerstone of Ace Books Had he lived long enough to finish another half dozen books he would have been among the sf greats of the sixties But maybe he does know after all Jerry Pournelle who was very much influenced by Piper and in many ways considers himself Beam s spiritual descendant and incidently was John W Campbell s last major discovery has said that sometimes when he s gotten down a particularly good line he can hear the old man chuckle and whisper atta boy Introduction doctor John D Clark THE SILICONE WORLD one THE STAR AND ITS MOST IMPORTANT PLANET The planet is named Uller it seems that when interstellar travel was developed the names of Greek Gods had been used up so those of Norse gods were used It is the second planet of the star Beta Hydri right angle zero twenty three declension seventy seven thirty two G zero solar type star of approximately the same size as Sol distance from Earth twenty one light years Uller revolves around it in a nearly circular orbit at a distance of one hundred million miles making it a little colder than Earth A year is of the approximate length of that on Earth A day lasts twenty six hours The axis of Uller is in the same plane as the orbit so that at a certain time of the year the north pole is pointed directly at the sun while at the opposite end of the orbit it points directly away The result is highly exaggerated seasons At the poles the temperature runs from one hundred twenty deg C to a low of eighty deg C At the equator it remains not far from ten deg C all year round Strong winds blow during the summer and winter from the hot to the cold pole few winds during the spring and fall The appearance of the poles varies during the year from baked deserts to glaciers covered with solid CO Free water exists in the equatorial regions all year round two SOLAR MOVEMENT AS SEEN FROM ULLER As seen from the north pole no sun is visible on Jan one On April one it bisects the horizon all day swinging completely around April one to July one it continues swinging around gradually rising in the sky the spiral converging to its center at the zenith which it reaches July one From July one to October one the spiral starts again spreading out from the center until on October one it bisects the horizon again On October one night arrives to stay until April one At the equator the sun is visible bisecting the southern horizon for all twenty six hours of the day on January one From January one to April one the sun starts to dip below the horizon at night to rise higher above it during the day During all this time it rises and sets at the same hours but rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest At noon it is higher each day in the southern sky until April one when it rises due east passes through the zenith and sets due west From April one to July one its noon position drops down to the north until on July one it is visible all day bisected by the northern horizon three CHEMISTRY AND GEOLOGY OF ULLER Calcium and chlorine are rarer than on earth sodium is somewhat commoner As a result of the shortage of calcium there is a higher ration of silicates to carbonates than exists on earth The water is slightly alkaline and resembles a very dilute solution of sodium silicate water glass It would have a pH of eight point five and tastes slightly soapy Also when it dries out it leaves a sticky and then a glassy crackly film Rocks look fairly earthlike but the absence or scarcity of anything like limestone is noticeable Practically all the sedimentary rocks are of the sandstone type All rivers are seasonal running from the polar regions to the central seas in the spring only or until the polar cap is completely dried out four ANIMAL LIFE As on Earth life arose in the primitive waters and with a carbon base but because of the abundance of silicone there was a strong tendency for the microscopic organisms to develop silicate exoskeletons like diatoms The present invertebrate animal life of the planet is of this type and is confined to the equatorial seas They run from amoeba like objects to things like crayfish with silicate skeletons Later some species of them started taking silicone into their soft tissues and eventually their carbon chain compounds were converted to silicone type chains from C C C to O Si O Si O Si with organic radicals on the side links These organisms were a transitional type with silicone tissues and water body fluids resembling the earthly amphibians and are now practically extinct There are a few species something like segmented worms still to be seen in the backwaters of the central seas A further development occurred when the silicone chain animals began to get short chain silicones into their circulatory systems held in solution by OH or NH groups on the ends and branches of the chains The proportion of these compounds gradually increased until the water was a minor and then a missing constituent The larger mobile species were then practically anhydrous Their blood consists of short chain silicones with quartz reinforcing for the soft parts and their armor teeth et cetera of pure amorphous quartz opal Most of these parts are of the milky variety variously tinted with metallic impurities as are the varieties of sapphires These pure silicone animals due to their practical indestructibility annihilated all but the smaller of the carbon animals and drove the compromise types into odd corners as relics They developed into a fish like animal with a very large swim bladder to compensate for the rather higher density of the silicone tissues and from these fish the land animals developed Due to their high density and resulting high weight they tend to be low on the ground rather reptilian in look Three pairs of legs are usual in order to distribute the heavy load There is no sharp dividing line between the quartz armor and the silicone tissue One merges into the other The dominant pure silicone animals only could become mobile and venture far from the temperate equatorial regions of Uller since they neither froze nor stiffened with cold nor became incapacitated by heat Note that all animal life is cold blooded with a negligible difference between body and ambient temperatures Since the animals are silicones they don t get sluggish like cold snakes five PLANT LIFE The plants are of the carbon metabolism silicate shell type like the primitive animals They spread out from the equator as far as they could go before the baking polar summers killed them They have normal seasonal growth in the temperate zones and remain dormant and frozen in the winter At the poles there is no vegetation not because of the cold winter but because of the hot summer The winter winds frequently blow over dead trees and roll them as far as the equatorial seas Other dead vegetation because of the highly silicious water always gets petrified unless it is eaten first What with the quartz speckled hides of the living vegetation and the solid quartz of the dead a forest is spectacular The silicone animals live on the plants They chew them up dehydrate them and convert their silicious outer bark and carbonaceous interiors into silicones for themselves When silicone tissue is metabolized the carbon and hydrogen go to CO and H O which are breathed out while the silicone goes into SiO which is deposited as more teeth and armor Compare the terrestrial octopus which makes armor plating out of calcium urate instead of excreting urea or uric acid The animals can of course eat each other too or make a meal of the small carbonaceous animals of the equatorial seas Further note that the animals cannot digest plants when they are cold They can eat them and store them but the disposal of the solid water and CO is too difficult a problem When they warm up the water in the plants melts and can be disposed of and things are simpler II THE FLUORINE PLANET one THE STAR AND PLANET The planet named Niflheim is the fourth planet of Nu Puppis right angle six thirty six declension forty three nine Beight type star blue white and hot one hundred forty eight light years distant from Earth which will require a speed in excess of light to reach it Niflheim is four hundred sixty two million miles from its primary a little less than the distance of Jupiter from our sun It thus does not receive too great a total amount of energy but what it does receive is of high potential a large fraction of it being in the ultra violet and higher frequencies Watch out for really super special sunburn et cetera on unwarned personnel The gravity of Niflheim is approximately one g the atmospheric pressure approximately one atmosphere and the average ambient temperature about sixty deg C seventy six deg F two ATMOSPHERE The oxidizer in the atmosphere is free fluorine F in a rather low concentration about four or five percent With it appears a mad collection of gases There are a few inert diluents such as N nitrogen argon helium neon et cetera but the major fraction consists of CF carbon tetrafluoride BF boron trifluoride SiF silicon tetrafluoride PF phosphorous pentafluoride SF sulphur hexafluoride and probably others In other words the fluorides of all the non metals that can form fluorides The phosphorous pentafluoride rains out when the weather gets cold There is also free oxygen but no chlorine That would be liquid except in very hot weather It sometimes appears combined with fluorine in chlorine trifluoride The atmosphere has a slight yellowish tinge three SOIL AND GEOLOGY Above the metallic core of the planet the lithosphere consists exclusively of fluorides of the metals There are no oxides sulfides silicates or chlorides There are small deposits of such things as bromine trifluoride but these have no great importance Since fluorides are weak mechanically the terrain is flattish Nothing tough like granite to build mountains out of Since the fluoride ion is colorless the color of the soil depends upon the predominant metal in the region As most of the light metals also have colorless ions the colored rocks are rather rare four THE WATERS UNDER THE EARTH They consist of liquid hydrofluoric acid HF It melts at eighty three deg C and boils at nineteen point four deg C In it are dissolved varying quantities of metallic and non metallic fluorides such as boron trifluoride sodium fluoride et cetera When the oceans and lakes freeze they do so from the bottom up so there is no layer of ice over free liquid five PLANTS AND PLANT METABOLISM The plants function by photosynthesis taking HF as water from the soil and carbon tetrafluoride as the equivalent of carbon dioxide from the air to produce chain compounds such as H H H H C C C C F F F F and at the same time liberating free fluorine This reaction could only take place on a planet receiving lots of ultra violet because so much energy is needed to break up carbon tetrafluoride and hydrofluoric acid The plant catalyst doubling for the magnesium in chlorophyll is nickel The plants are colored in various ways They get their metals from the soil six ANIMALS AND ANIMAL METABOLISM Animals depend upon two main reactions for their energy and for the construction of their harder tissues The soft tissues are about the same as the plant molecules but the hard tissues are produced by the reaction H H H F F F C C C F C C C HF F F F F F F resulting in a teflon boned and shelled organism He s going to be tough to do much with Diatoms leave strata of powdered teflon The main energy reaction is H H H C C C F CF HF F F F The blood catalyst metal is titanium which results in colorless arterial blood and violet veinous as the titanium flips back and forth between tri and tetra valent states seven EFFECT ON INTRUDING ITEMS Water decomposes into oxygen and hydrofluoric acid All organic matter earth type converts into oxygen carbon tetrafluoride hydrofluoric acid et cetera with more or less speed A rubber gas mask lasts about an hour Glass first frosts and then disappears Plastics act like rubber only a little slower The heavy metals iron nickel copper monel et cetera stand up well forming an insoluble coat of fluorides at first and then doing nothing else eight

none	none	GO THERE Large natural crystals of fluorides such as calcium difluoride titanium tetrafluoride zirconium tetrafluoride are extremely useful in optical instruments of various forms Uranium appears as uranium hexafluoride all ready for the diffusion process Compounds of such non metals as boron are obtainable from the atmosphere in high purity with very little trouble All metallurgy must be electrical There are considerable deposits of beryllium and they occur in high concentration in its ores PROLOGUE On Satan s Footstool The big armor tender vibrated gently and not unpleasantly as the contragravity field alternated on and off occasionally varying its normal rate of five hundred to the second when some thermal updraft lifted the vehicle and the automatic radar altimeter control acted to alter the frequency and lower it again Sometimes it rocked slightly like a boat on the water and in the big screen which served in lieu of a window at the front of the control cabin the dingy yellow landscape would seem to tilt a little If unshielded human eyes could have endured the rays of Nu Puppis Niflheim s primary the whole scene would have appeared a vivid Saint Patrick s Day green the effect of the blue predominant light on the yellow atmosphere The outside visor pickup however was fitted with filters which blocked out the gamma rays and X rays and most of the ultra violet rays and added the longer light waves of red and orange which were absent so that things looked much as they would have under the light of a Gzero type star like Sol The air was faintly yellow the sky was yellow with a greenish cast and the clouds were green gray A thousand feet below the local equivalent of a forest grew the trees topped with huge ragged leaves looking like hundred foot stalks of celery There would be animal life down there too little round things four inches across like eight legged crabs gnawing at the vegetation and bigger things two feet long with articulated shell armor and sixteen legs which fed on the smaller herbivores Beyond in the middleground was open grassland if one could so call a mat of wormlike colorless or pastel tinted sprouts and a river meandered through it On the skyline fifty miles away was a range of low dunes and hills none more than a thousand feet high No human had ever set foot on the surface or breathed the air of Niflheim To have done so would have been instant death the air was a mixture of free fluorine and fluoride gasses the soil was metallic fluorides damp with acid rains and the river was pure hydrofluoric acid Even the ordinary spacesuit would have been no protection the glass and rubber and plastic would have disintegrated in a matter of minutes People came to Niflheim and worked the mines and uranium refineries and chemical plants but they did so inside power driven and contragravity lifted armor and they lived on artificial satellites two thousand miles off planet This vehicle for instance was built and protected as no spaceship ever had to be completely insulated and entered only through a triple airlock an outer lock which would be evacuated outward after it was closed a middle lock kept evacuated at all times and an inner lock evacuated into the interior of the vehicle before the middle lock could be opened Niflheim was worse than airless much worse The chief engineer sat at his controls making the minor lateral adjustments in the vehicle s position which were not possible to the automatic controls One of the radiomen was receiving from the orbital base the other was saying over and over in an exasperatedly patient voice doctor Murillo doctor Murillo Please come in doctor Murillo At his own panel of instruments a small man with grizzled black hair around a bald crown and a grizzled beard chewed nervously at the stump of a dead cigar and listened intently to what was or for what wasn t coming in to his headset receiver A couple of assistants checked dials and refreshed their memories from notebooks and peered anxiously into the big screen A large plump faced young man in soiled khaki shirt and shorts with extremely hairy legs was doodling on his notepad and eating candy out of a bag And a black haired girl in a suit of coveralls three sizes too big for her and apparently not much of anything else lounged with one knee hooked over her chair arm staring into the screen at the distant horizon doctor Murillo doctor Mur The radioman broke off in mid syllable and listened for a moment I hear you doctor go ahead Then a moment later What s your position now doctor I can see them the girl said lifting a hand in front of her At two o clock about one of my hand s breadths above the horizon The man with the grizzled beard put his face into the fur around the eyepiece of the telescopic visor and twisted a dial You have good eyes Miss Quinton he complimented Only four personal armors Ahmed ask him where the fifth is We only see four of your personal armors the radioman said Who s missing and why He waited for a moment then lowered the hand phone and turned The fifth one s inside the handling machine One of the Ullerans Gorkrink The larger of the specks that had appeared on the horizon resolved itself into a handling machine a thing like an oversized contragravity tank with a bulldozer blade a stubby derrick boom instead of a gun and jointed claw tipped arms to the sides The smaller dots grew into personal armor egg shaped things that sprouted arms and grab hooks and pushers in all directions The man with the grizzled beard began talking rapidly into his hand phone then hung it up There was a series of bumps and the armor tender weightless on contragravity shook as the handling machine came aboard You ever see any nuclear bombing Miss Quinton the young man with the hairy legs asked offering her his candy bag Only by telecast back Sol side she replied helping herself Test shots at the Federation Navy proving ground on Mars I never even heard of nuclear bombs being used for mining till I came here though Well if this turns out as well as the other job three months ago it ll be something to see he promised These volcanoes have been dormant for oh maybe as long as a thousand years there ought to be a pretty good head of gas down there And the magma ll be thick viscous stuff like basalt on Terra Of course this won t be anything like basalt in composition it ll be intensely compressed metallic fluorides with a very high metal content The volcanoes we shot three months ago yielded a fine flow of lava with all sorts of metals nickel beryllium vanadium chromium indium as well as copper and iron What sort of gas were you speaking about she asked Hydrogen That s what s going to make the fireworks it combines explosively with fluorine The hydrogen fluorine combination is what passes for combustion here the result is hydrofluoric acid the local equivalent of water See the metallic core of this planet is covered much less thickly than that of Terra with fluoride rock fluorspar and that sort of thing There s nothing like granite here for instance That s why those big dunes out there are the best Niflheim has in the way of mountains The subsurface hydrogen is produced when the acid filters down through the rock combines with pure metals underneath doctor Murillo s inside now the radioman said Just came out of the inner airlock He ll be up as soon as he gets out of his pressure suit As soon as he gets here I ll touch it off the bearded man said Everything set de Jong Everything ready doctor Gomes one of his assistants assured him The door at the rear of the control cabin opened and Juan Murillo the seismologist entered followed by an assistant Murillo was a big man copper skinned barrel chested he looked like a third or fourth generation Martian of Andes Indian ancestry He came forward and stood behind Gomes chair looking down at the instruments His assistant stopped at the door This assistant was not human He was a biped vaguely humanoid but he had four arms and a face like a lizard s and except for some equipment on a belt he was entirely naked He spoke rapidly to Murillo in a squeaking jabber Murillo turned Yes if you wish Gorkrink he said in the English Spanish Afrikaans Portuguese mixture that was Sixth Century A E Lingua Terra Then he turned back to Gomes as the Ulleran sat down in a chair by the door Well she s all yours Lourenco shoot the works Gomes stabbed the radio detonator button in front of him A voice came out of the PA speaker overhead In sixty seconds the bombs will be detonated thirty seconds fifteen seconds ten seconds five seconds four seconds three seconds two seconds one second Out on the rolling skyline fifty miles away a lancelike ray of blue white light shot up into the gathering dusk a clump of five rays really from five deep shafts in an irregular pentagon half a mile across blended into one by the distance An instant later there was a blinding flash like sheet lightning and a huge ball of varicolored fire belched upward leaving a series of smoke rings to float more slowly after it That fireball flattened then spread to form the mushroom head of a column of incandescent gas that mounted to overtake it engorging the smoke rings as it rose twisting writhing changing shape turning to dark smoke in one moment and belching flame and crackling with lightning the next The armor tender began to pitch and roll it was all the engineer and one of the assistants could do together to keep it level In about half an hour the large young man told the girl the real fireworks should be starting What s coming up now is just small debris from the nuclear blast When the shockwaves get down far enough to crack things open the gas ll come up and then steam and ash and then the magma This one ought to be twice as good as the one we shot three months ago it ought to be every bit as good as Krakatoa on Terra in fifty nine Pre Atomic Well even this much was worth staying over for the girl said watching the screen You going on to Uller on the City of Canberra Lourenco Gomes asked I wish I were I have to stay over and make another shot in a month or so and I ve had about all of Niflheim I can take now The sooner I get onto a planet where they don t ration the air the better I ll like it Well what do you know the large young man with the hairy legs mock marveled He doesn t like our nice planet Nice planet Gomes muttered something They call Terra God s Footstool well I ll give you one guess who uses this thing to prop his cloven hoofs on When are you going to Terra the girl asked him Terra I don t know a year two years But I m going to Uller on the next ship the City of Pretoria if we get the next blast off in time They want me to design some improvements on a couple of power reactors so I ll probably see you when I get there Here she comes the chief engineer called Watch the base of the column The pillar of fiery smoke and dust still boiling up from where the bombs had gone off far underground was being violently agitated at the bottom A series of new flashes broke out lifting and spreading the incandescent radioactive gasses and then a great gush of flame rose A column of pure hydrogen must have rushed up into the vacuum created by the explosion the next blast of flame in a lateral sheet came at nearly ten thousand feet above the ground and great rags of fire changing from red to violet and back through the spectrum to red again went soaring away to dissipate in the upper atmosphere Then geysers of hot ash and molten rock spouted upward some of the white hot debris landed almost at the acid river half way to the armor tender We ve started a first class earthquake too the Hispano Indian Martian Murillo said looking at the instruments About six big cracks opening in the rock structure You know when this quiets down and cools off we ll have more ore on the surface than we can handle in ten years and more than we could have mined by ordinary means in fifty About four miles from the original blast another eruption began with a terrific gas explosion Well that finishes our work the large young man said going to a kitbag in the corner of the cabin and getting out a bottle Get some of those plastic cups over there somebody this one calls for a drink That s right Gomes said You do something once it may be an accident you repeat the performance and it s a success He began pushing papers aside on his desk and the girl in the too ample coveralls brought drinking cups The Ulleran in the background rose quickly and squeaked apologetically Murillo nodded Yes of course Gorkrink No need for you to stay here The Ulleran went out closing the door behind him That taboo against Ullerans and Terrans watching each other eat and drink Murillo said What is that part of their religion No it s their version of modesty the girl replied Like some of our sex inhibitions which they can t even begin to understand But you were speaking to him in Lingua Terra I didn t know any of them understood it Gorkrink does Murillo said uncorking the bottle and pouring into the plastic cups None of them can speak it of course because of the structure of their vocal organs any more than we can speak their languages without artificial aids But I can talk to him in Lingua Terra without having to put one of those damn gags in my mouth and he can pass my instructions on to the others He s been a big help I ll be sorry to lose him Lose him Yes his year s up he s going back to Uller on the Canberra You know it s impossible to keep some trace of fluorine from the air in the handling machines or even out on the orbiters and it plays the devil with their lungs He wanted to stay on another three months to help with the next shot but the medics wouldn t hear of it He s from Keegark wherever on Uller that is claims to be a prince or something I know all the other geeks kowtow to him But he s a damn good worker Very smart picks things up the first time you tell him I ll recommend him unqualifiedly for any kind of work with contragravity or mechanized equipment They all had drinks now except the chief engineer who wanted a rain check on his Well here s to us Murillo said The first A bomb miners in history I Commander in Chief Front and Center General Carlos von Schlichten threw his cigarette away flexed his hands in his gloves and set his monocle more firmly in his eye stepping forward as the footsteps on the stairway behind him ceased and the other officers emerged from the squat flint keep Captain Cazabielle the post company big chocolate brown Brigadier General Themistocles M zangwe little Colonel Hideyoshi O Leary Far in front of him to the left the horizon was lost in the cloudbank over Takkad Sea directly in front and to the right the brown and gray and black flint mountains sawed into the sky until they vanished in the distance Unseen below the old caravan trail climbed one side of the pass and slid down the other a sheer five hundred feet below the parapet and the two corner catapult platforms which now mounted ninety mm guns On the little hundred foot square parade ground in front of the keep his aircar was parked and the soldiers were assembled Ten or twelve of them were Terrans a couple of lieutenants sergeants gunners technicians the sergeant driver and corporal gunner of his own car The other fifty odd were Ulleran natives They stood erect on stumpy legs and broad six toed feet They had four arms apiece one pair from true shoulders and the other connected to a pseudo pelvis midway down the torso Their skins were slate gray and rubbery speckled with pinhead sized bits of quartz that had been formed from perspiration for their body tissues were silicone instead of carbon hydrogen Their narrow heads were unpleasantly saurian they had small double lidded red eyes and slit like nostrils and wide mouths filled with opalescent teeth Except for their belts and equipment they were completely naked the uniform consisted of the emblem of the Chartered Uller Company stencil painted on chests and backs Clothing to them was unnecessary either for warmth or modesty As to the former they were cold blooded and could stand a temperature range of from a hundred and twenty to minus one hundred Centigrade Von Schlichten had seen them sleeping in the open with their bodies covered with frost or freezing rain he had also seen them wade through boiling water As to the second they had practically no sex inhibitions they were all of the same gender true functional hermaphrodites Any individual among them could bear young or fertilize the ova of any other individual Fifteen years ago when he had come to Uller as a former Terran Federation captain newly commissioned colonel in the army of the Uller Company it had taken some time before he had become accustomed to the detailing of a non com and a couple of privates out of each platoon for baby sitting duty At least though they didn t have the squaw trouble around army posts on Uller that they had on Thor where he had last been stationed An airjeep coming in out of the sun circled the crag top fort and let down onto the terrace next to von Schlichten s command car It carried a bristle of fifteen mm machine guns and two of the eight fifty mm rocket tubes on either side were empty and freshly smoke stained The duraglass canopy slid back and the two man crew lieutenant driver and sergeant gunner jumped out Von Schlichten knew them both Lieutenant Kendall Sergeant Garcia he greeted Good afternoon gentlemen Both saluted in the informal hell with rank we re all human manner of Terran soldiers on extraterrestrial duty and returned the greeting How s the Jeel situation he asked then nodded toward the fired rocket tubes I see you had some shooting Yes sir the lieutenant said Two bands of them We sighted the first coming up the eastern side of the mountain about two miles this side of the Blue Springs We got about half of them with MG fire and the rest dived into a big rock crevice We had to use two rockets on them and then had to let down and pot a few of them with our pistols We caught the second band in that little punchbowl place about a mile this side of Zortolk s Old Fort There were only six of them they were bunched together feeding Off one of their own gang I d say the way we ve been keeping them up in the high rocks they ve been eating inside the family quite a bit lately We let them have two rockets No survivors Not many very big pieces in fact We let down at Zortolk s for a beer after that and Captain Martinelli told us that one of his jeeps caught what he thinks was the same band that was down off the mountain night before last and ate those peasants on Prince Neeldink s estate By God I m glad to hear that There d been a perfect hell of a flap about that business Before the Terrans came to Uller it was a good year when not more than five hundred farm folk would be killed and eaten by Jeel cannibals The incident of two nights ago had been the first of its kind in almost six months but the nobleman whose serfs had been eaten was practically accusing the Company of responsibility for the crime I ll see that Neeldink is informed The more you do for these damned geeks the more they expect from you When you get your vehicle re ammoed lieutenant suppose you buzz back to where you machine gunned that first gang If there are any more around they ll have moved in for the free meal by now This breakdown of the Jeels taboo against eating fellow tribesmen was one of the best things he d heard from the cannibal extermination project for some time He turned to Themistocles M zangwe In about two weeks get a little task force together Say ten combat cars about twenty airjeeps and a battalion of Kragan Rifles in troop carriers Oh yes and this good for nothing Konkrook Fencibles outfit of Prince Jaizerd s they can be used for beaters and to block escape routes He turned back to Lieutenant Kendall and Sergeant Garcia Good work boys And if the synchro photos show that any of that first bunch got away don t feel too badly about it These Jeels can hide on the top of a pool table He climbed into the command car followed by Themistocles M zangwe and Hideyoshi O Leary Sergeant Harry Quong and Corporal Hassan Bogdanoff took their places on the front seat the car lifted turned to nose into the wind and rose in a slow spiral Below the fort grew smaller a flat topped rectangle of masonry overlooking the pass a gun covering each approach and two more on the square keep to cover the rocky hogback on which the fort had been built with the flagpole between them Once that pole had lifted a banner of ragged black marsh flopper skin bearing the device of the Kragan riever chieftain whose family had built the castle now it carried a neat rectangle of blue bunting emblazoned with the wreathed globe of the Terran Federation and below that the blue gray pennant which bore the vermilion trademark of the Chartered Uller Company Where now sir Harry Quong asked He looked at his watch Seventeen hundred there wasn t time for a visit to Zortolk s Old Fort ten miles to the north at the next pass Back to Konkrook to the island The nose of the car swung east by south the cold jet rotors began humming and then the hot jets were cut in The car turned from the fort and the mountains and shot away over the foothills toward the coastal plain Below were forests yellow green with new foliage of the second growing season of the equatorial year veined with narrow dirt roads and spotted with occasional clearings Farther east the dirty gray woodsmoke of Uller marked the progress of the charcoal burnings It took forty years to burn the forests clear back to the flint cliffs by the time the burners reached the mountains the new trees at the seaward edge would be ready to cut Off to the south he could see the dark green squares where the hemlocks and Norway spruce had been planted by the Company With a little chemical fertilizer they were doing well and they made better charcoal than the silicate heavy native wood That was the only natural fuel on Uller there was no coal of course since fallen timber and even standing dead trees petrified in a matter of a couple of years There was too much silica on Uller and not enough of anything else what would be coal seams on Terra were strata of silicified wood And of course there was no petroleum There was less charcoal being burned now than formerly the Uller Company had been bringing in great quantities of synthetic thermoconcentrate fuel and had been setting up nuclear furnaces and nuclear electric power plants wherever they gained a foothold on the planet Beyond the forests came the farmlands Around the older estates thick walls of flint and petrified wood had been built and wide moats dug to keep out the shellosaurs But now the moats were dry and the walls falling into disrepair Some of the newer farms land devoted to agriculture with the declining demand for charcoal had neither moats nor walls That was the Company too the huge shell armored beasts had become virtually extinct in the Konk Isthmus now since the introduction of bazookas and recoilless rifles There seemed to be quite a bit of power equipment working in the fields and big contragravity lorries were drifting back and forth scattering fertilizer mainly nitrates from Mimir or Yggdrasill There were still a good number of animal drawn plows and harrows in use however As planets went Uller was no bargain he thought sourly At times he wished he had never followed the lure of rapid promotion and fantastically high pay and left the Federation regulars for the army of the Uller Company If he hadn t he d probably be a colonel at five thousand sols a year but maybe it would be better to be a middle aged colonel on a decent planet Odin with its two moons Hugin and Munin and its wide grasslands and its evergreen forests that looked and even smelled like the pinewoods of Terra or Baldur with snow capped mountains and clear cold lakes and rocky rivers dashing under great vine hung trees or Freya where the people were human to the last degree and the women were so breathtakingly beautiful than a Company army general at twenty five thousand on this combination icebox furnace wind tunnel and stonepile where the water tasted like soapsuds and left a crackly film when it dried where the temperature ranged from pole to pole between two hundred and fifty and minus a hundred and fifty Fahrenheit and the Beaufort scale ran up to thirty where nothing that ran or swam or grew was fit for a human to eat and where the people Of course there were worse planets than Uller There was Nidhog cold and foggy its equatorial zone a gloomy marsh and the rest of the planet locked in eternal ice There was Bifrost which always kept the same face turned to its primary one side blazingly hot and the other close to absolute zero with a narrow and barely habitable twilight zone between There was Mimir swarming with a race of semi intelligent quasi rodents murderous treacherous utterly vicious Or Niflheim The Uller Company had the franchise for Niflheim too they d had to take that and agree to exploit the planet s resources in order to get the franchise for Uller which furnished a good quick measure of the comparative merits of the two Ahead the city of Konkrook sprawled along the delta of the Konk river and extended itself inland The river was dry now Except in spring when it was a red brown torrent it never ran more than a trickle and not at all this late in the northern summer The aircar lost altitude and the hot jet stopped firing They came gliding in over the suburbs and the yellow green parks over the low one story dwellings and shops the lofty temples and palaces the fantastically twisted towers following a street that became increasingly mean and squalid as it neared the industrial district along the waterfront Von Schlichten on the right glanced idly down puffing slowly on his cigarette Then he stiffened the muscles around his right eye clamping tighter on the monocle Leaning forward he punched Harry Quong lightly on the shoulder Circle back sergeant let s have a look at that street again he directed Something going on down there looks like a riot Yes sir I saw it the Chinese Australian driver replied Terrans in trouble bein mobbed by geeks Aircar parked right in the bloody middle of it The car made a twisting banking loop and came back more slowly Colonel Hideyoshi O Leary was using the binoculars That s right he said Terrans being mobbed Two of them backed up against a house I saw one of them firing a pistol Von Schlichten had the handset of the car s radio and was punching out the combination of the Company guardhouse on Gongonk Island he held down the signal button until he got an answer Von Schlichten in car over Konkrook Riot on Fourth Avenue just off Seventy second Street No Terran could possibly remember the names of Konkrook s streets even native troops recruited from outside found the numbers easier to learn and remember Geeks mobbing a couple of Terrans I m going down now to do what I can to help send troops in a hurry Kragan Rifles And stand by my driver ll give it to you as it happens The voice of somebody at the guardhouse bawling orders came out of the receiver as he tossed the phone forward over Harry Quong s shoulder Quong caught it and began speaking rapidly and urgently into it while he steered with the other hand Von Schlichten took one of the five pound spiked riot maces out of the rack in front of him Themistocles M zangwe had already drawn his pistol he shifted it to his left hand and took a mace in his right The Nipponese Irish colonel looking like a homicidally infuriated pixie had an automatic in one hand and a long dagger in the other Harry Quong and Hassan Bogdanoff were old Uller hands they d done this sort of work before Bogdanoff rose into the ball turret and swung the twin fifteen mm s around cutting loose Quong brought the car in fast at about shoulder height on the mob Between them they left a swath of mangled killed wounded and stunned natives Then spinning the car around Quong set it down hard on a clump of rioters as close as possible to the struggling group around the two Terrans Von Schlichten threw back the canopy and jumped out of the car O Leary and M zangwe behind him There was another aircar a dark maroon civilian job at the curb its native driver was slumped forward over the controls a short crossbow bolt sticking out of his neck Backed against the closed door of a house a Terran with white hair and a small beard was clubbing futilely with an empty pistol He was wounded and blood was streaming over his face His companion a young woman in a long fur coat was laying about her with a native bolo knife Von Schlichten s mace had a spiked ball head and a four inch spike in front of that He smashed the ball down on the back of one Ulleran s head and jabbed another in the rump with the spike Zak Zak he yelled in pidgin Ulleran Jik jik you lizard faced Creator s blunder The Ulleran whirled swinging a blade somewhere between a big butcherknife and a small machete His mouth was open and there was froth on his lips Znidd suddabit he screamed Von Schlichten parried the cut on the steel shaft of his mace Suddabit yourself you geek bastard he shouted back ramming the spike end into the opal filled mouth And znidd you too he added recovering and slamming the ball head down on the narrow saurian skull The Ulleran went down spurting a yellow fluid about the consistency of gun oil Then without wasting words he maced another of the things Ahead one of the natives had caught the wounded Terran with both lower hands and was raising a dagger with his upper right The girl in the fur coat swung wildly slashing the knife arm then chopped down on the creature s neck To one side a native somewhat better dressed than the others to the extent of a couple of belts with gold ornaments drew a Terran automatic Von Schlichten hurled his mace and drew his pistol thumbing off the safety as he swung it up but before he could fire Hassan Bogdanoff had seen and swung his guns around the double burst caught the native in the chest and fairly tore him apart Another of them closed with the girl grabbing her right arm with all four hands and biting at her she screamed and kicked her attacker in the groin where an Ulleran is if anything even more vulnerable than a Terran The native howled hideously and von Schlichten jumping over a couple of corpses shoved the muzzle of his pistol into the creature s open mouth and pulled the trigger blowing its head apart like a rotten pumpkin and splashing both himself and the girl with yellow blood and rancid looking gray green brains Hideyoshi O Leary jumping forward after von Schlichten stuck his dagger into the neck of a rioter and left it there then caught the girl around the waist with his free arm Themistocles M zangwe dropped his mace and swung the frail looking man onto his back Together they struggled back to the command car von Schlichten covering the retreat with his pistol Another rioter a Zirk nomad from the North he guessed was aiming one of the long barreled native air rifles holding the ten inch globe of the air chamber in both lower hands Von Schlichten shot him and the Zirk literally blew to pieces For an instant he wondered how the small bursting charge of a ten mm explosive pistol bullet could accomplish such havoc and assumed that the native had been carrying a bomb in his belt Then another explosion tossed fragmentary corpses nearby and another and another Glancing quickly over his shoulder he saw four combat cars coming in firing with forty mm auto cannon and fifteen mm machine guns They swept between the hovels on one side and the warehouses on the other strafing the mob darted up to a thousand feet looped and came swooping back and this time there were three long blue gray troop carriers behind them These landed in the hastily cleared street and began disgorging native Company soldiers Kragan mercenaries he noted with satisfaction They carried a modified version of the regular Terran Federation infantry rifle stocked and sighted to conform to their physical peculiarities with long thorn like triangular bayonets One platoon ran forward dropped to one knee and began firing rapidly into what was left of the mob Four handed soldiers can deliver a simply astonishing volume of fire particularly when armed with auto rifles having twenty shot drop out magazines which can be changed with the lower hands without lowering the weapon There was a clatter of shod hoofs and a company of the King of Konkrook s cavalry came trotting up on their six legged lizard headed quartz speckled mounts Some of these charged into side alleys joyfully lancing and cutting down fleeing rioters while others dismounted three tossing their reins to a fourth and went to work with their crossbows Von Schlichten who ordinarily entertained a dim opinion of the King of Konkrook s soldiery admitted grudgingly that it was smart work four hands were a big help in using a crossbow too A Terran captain of native infantry came over saluting Are you and your people all right general he asked Von Schlichten glanced at the front seat of his car where Harry Quong a pistol in his right hand was still talking into the radio phone and Hassan Bogdanoff was putting fresh belts into his guns Then he saw that the Graeco African brigadier and the Irish Japanese colonel had gotten the wounded man into the car The girl having dropped her bolo was leaning against the side of the car one foot heedlessly in what was left of an Ulleran who had gotten smashed under it weak with nervous reaction We seem to be Captain Pedolsky Very smart work you must have those vehicles of yours on hyperspace drive How is he colonel We d better get him to the hospital right away O Leary replied I think he has a concussion Harry call the hospital Tell them what the score is and tell them we re bringing the casualty in to their top landing stage Why we ll make out very nicely captain You d better stay around with your Kragans and make sure that these geeks of King Jaikark s don t let the riot flare up again and get away from them And don t let them get the impression that they can maintain order around here without our help the Company would like to see that attitude discouraged Yes sir I understand Captain Pedolsky opened the pouch on his belt and took out the false palate and tongue clicker without which no Terran could do more than mouth a crude and barely comprehensible pidgin Ulleran Stuffing the gadget into his mouth he turned and began jabbering orders Von Schlichten helped the girl into the car placing her on his right The wounded civilian was propped up in the left corner of the seat and Colonel O Leary and Brigadier General M zangwe took the jump seats The driver put on the contragravity field and the car lifted up Them see if there s a flask and a drinking cup in the door pocket next to you he said I think Miss Quinton could use a drink The girl turned Even in her present disheveled condition she was beautiful a trifle on the petite side with black hair and black eyes that quirked up oddly at the outer corners Her nails were black lacquered and spotted with little gold stars evidently a new feminine fad from Terra I certainly could general How did you know my name You ve been on Uller for the last three months ever since the City of Canberra got in from Niflheim On Uller there aren t enough of us that everybody doesn t know all about everybody else You re doctor Paula Quinton you re an extraterrestrial sociographer and you re a field agent for the Extraterrestrials Rights Association like Mohammed Ferriera here He took the cup and flask from Themistocles M zangwe and poured her a drink Take this easy now Baldur honey rum a hundred and fifty proof He watched her sip the stuff cautiously cough over the first mouthful and then get the rest of it down More When she shook her head he stoppered the flask and relieved her of the cup What were you doing in that district anyhow he wanted to know I d have thought Mohammed Ferriera would have had more sense than to take you there or go there himself for that matter We went to visit a friend of his a native named Keeluk who seems to be a sort of combination clergyman and labor leader she replied I m going to observe labor conditions at the North Pole mines in a short while and mister Keeluk was going to give me letters of introduction to friends of his at Skilk With the aid of his monocle von Schlichten managed to keep a straight face Neither M zangwe nor O Leary had any such aid the African rolled his eyes and the Japanese Irishman grimaced We talked with mister Keeluk for a while the girl said and when we came out we found that our driver had been killed and a mob had gathered Of course we were carrying pistols they re part of this survival kit you make everybody carry along with the emergency rations and the water desilicator mister Ferriera s wasn t loaded but mine was When they rushed us I shot a couple of them and then picked up that big knife That s why you re still alive von Schlichten commented We wouldn t be if you hadn t come along she told him I never in my life saw anything as beautiful as you coming through that mob swinging that war club Well I never saw anything much more beautiful than those forty mm s beginning to land in the mob von Schlichten replied The aircar swung out over Konkrook Channel and headed toward the blue gray Company buildings on Gongonk Island and the Company airport swarming with lorries and airboats where the ten thousand ton Oom Paul Kruger had just come in from Keegark and the Company s one real warship the cruiser Procyon was lifting out for Grank in the North Down at the southern tip of the island the three thousand foot globe of the spaceship City of Pretoria from Niflheim was loading with cargo for Terra Just what happened while you and mister Ferriera were in Keeluk s house Miss Quinton Hideyoshi O Leary asked trying not to sound official Was Keeluk with you all the time Or did he go out for a while say fifteen or twenty minutes before you left Why yes he did Paula Quinton looked surprised How did you guess it You see a dog started barking behind the house and he excused himself and A dog von Schlichten almost shouted The other officers echoed him and on the front seat Harry Quong said Coo bli me Why yes Paula Quinton s eyes widened But there are no dogs on Uller except a few owned by Terrans And wasn t there something about Von Schlichten had the radio phone and was calling the command car at the scene of the riot The sergeant driver answered Von Schlichten here my compliments to Captain Pedolsky and tell him he s to make immediate and thorough search of the house in front of which the incident occurred and adjoining houses For his information that s Keeluk s house Tell him to look for traces of Governor General Harrington s collie or any of the other terrestrial animals that have been disappearing that goat for instance or those rabbits And I want Keeluk brought in alive and in condition to be interrogated I ll send more troops or Constabulary to help you He handed the phone to M zangwe You take care of that end of it Them you know who can be spared But what the girl began That s why you were attacked he told her Keeluk was afraid to let you get away from there alive to report hearing that dog so he went out and had a gang of thugs rounded up to kill you But he was only gone five minutes In five minutes I can put all the troops in Konkrook into action Keeluk doesn t have radio or TV we hope but he has his forces concentrated and he has a pretty good staff But mister Keeluk s a friend of ours He knows what our Association is trying to do for his people So he shows his appreciation by setting that mob on you Look he has a lot of influence in that section When you were attacked why wasn t he out trying to quiet the mob When they jumped you you tried to get back into the house M zangwe put in And you found the door barred against you Yes but The girl looked troubled M zangwe had guessed right But what s all the excitement about the dog What is it the sacred totem animal of the Uller Company It s just a big brown collie named Stalin like half the dogs on Terra Somebody stole it and Keeluk was keeping it and we want to know why We don t like geek mysteries not when they lead to murderous attacks on Terrans at least The aircar let down on the hospital landing stage A stretcher was waiting with a Terran interne and two Ulleran orderlies They got the still unconscious Mohammed Ferriera out of the car You d better go with them yourself Miss Quinton von Schlichten advised You have a couple of nasty looking bruises and bumps A couple of abrasions too where those geeks grabbed you they have hides like sandpaper And better have that coat cleaned before that goo on it hardens or it ll be ruined Yes You have a lot of it on your uniform too He glanced down at the blue gray jacket So I have And another thing Those letters Keeluk was going to give you the ones to his friends in Skilk Did you get them She felt in the pocket of her coat Yes I still have them I wish you d let Colonel O Leary have a look at them There may be more to them than you think Hid will you go with Miss Quinton II Rakkeed Stalin and the reverend Keeluk Von Schlichten in a fresh uniform sat at the end of the table in Sidney Harrington s office Harrington and Eric Blount the Lieutenant Governor faced each other across it over the three foot disc of an Ulleran chess board Harrington had the white or center position Blount sandy haired and considerably younger was playing black and his pieces were closing in relentlessly from the outer rim
3274_167022_000000_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then what Harrington asked 
3274_167022_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten dropped ash from his cigarette into the tray that served all three of them 
3274_167022_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing much he replied 
none	none	Keeluk bugged out as soon as he saw my car let down 
3274_167022_000002_000002	train-clean-360	We picked up a few of his ragtag and bobtail and they re being questioned now but I doubt if they ll tell us anything we don t know already 
3274_167022_000002_000003	train-clean-360	The dog had been kept in a lean to back of the house it had been removed probably as soon as Keeluk called in his goon gang 
3274_167022_000002_000004	train-clean-360	At least one of the rabbits had been kept on the premises too some time ago 
3274_167022_000002_000005	train-clean-360	No trace of the goat 
3274_167022_000003_000000	train-clean-360	He watched Blount move one of his pieces and nodded approvingly 
none	none	The riot s been put down he continued but we re keeping two companies of Kragans in the city and about a dozen airjeeps patrolling the section from Eightieth down to Sixty fourth and from the waterfront back to Eighth Avenue 
3274_167022_000003_000002	train-clean-360	There is also the equivalent of a regiment of King Jaikark s infantry spearmen crossbowmen and a few riflemen and two of those outsize cavalry companies of his helping hold the lid down 
3274_167022_000003_000003	train-clean-360	They re making mass arrests indiscriminately 
3274_167022_000003_000004	train-clean-360	More slaves for Jaikark s court favorite of course 
3274_167022_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Or else Gurgurk wants them to use for patronage Blount added 
3274_167022_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 He s been building quite a political organization lately 
3274_167022_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Getting ready to shove Jaikark off the throne I d say 
3274_167022_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Harrington pushed one of his pieces out along a radial line toward the rim 
none	none	Blount promptly took a pawn which under Ulleran rules entitled him to a second move 
3274_167022_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He shifted another piece a sort of combination knight and bishop to threaten the piece Harrington had moved 
3274_167022_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Gurgurk wouldn t dare try anything like that the Governor General said 
3274_167022_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 He knows we wouldn t let him get away with it We have too much of an investment in King Jaikark 
3274_167022_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why s Gurgurk been supporting this damned Rakkeed Blount wanted to know hastily interposing a piece 
3274_167022_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Gurgurk can follow one of two lines of policy 
3274_167022_000007_000002	train-clean-360	He can undertake to heave Jaikark off the throne and seize power or he has to support Jaikark on the throne We re subsidizing Jaikark 
3274_167022_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Rakkeed has been preaching this crusade against the Terrans and against Jaikark whom we control 
3274_167022_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Gurgurk has been subsidizing Rakkeed 
3274_167022_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 You haven t any proof of that Harrington protested 
3274_167022_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 My Intelligence Section has von Schlichten put in 
3274_167022_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 We can give sums of money and dates and the names of the intermediaries through whom they were paid to Rakkeed 
3274_167022_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Eric is absolutely correct in making that statement 
none	none	Personally I think Gurgurk s plan is something like this Rakkeed will stir up anti Terran sentiment here in Konkrook and direct it against our puppet Jaikark as well as against us Blount said When the outbreak comes Jaikark will be killed and then Gurgurk will step in seize the Palace and use the Royal army to put down the revolt that he s incited in the first place 
3274_167022_000010_000001	train-clean-360	That will put him in the position of the friend of the Company and most of his dupes will be rounded up and sold as slaves and King Gurgurk ll pocket the proceeds 
3274_167022_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The only question is will Rakkeed let himself be used that way 
3274_167022_000010_000003	train-clean-360	I think Rakkeed s bigger than Gurgurk ever can be 
3274_167022_000010_000004	train-clean-360	And more of a threat to the Company 
3274_167022_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Everywhere we turn Rakkeed s at the bottom of whatever happens to be wrong 
3274_167022_000010_000006	train-clean-360	This business for instance Keeluk s one of Rakkeed s followers 
3274_167022_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Eric you have Rakkeed on the brain Harrington exclaimed impatiently then moved the threatened piece counterclockwise on the circle where he had placed it 
3274_167022_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 He s just a barbarian caravan driver 
3274_167022_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Eric Blount moved the piece that had taken Harrington s pawn 
3274_167022_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Your king s in danger he warned 
3274_167022_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 And Hitler was just a paper hanger 
3274_167022_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Rakkeed has no following except among the rabble Harrington puffed furiously at his pipe trying to figure the best protection for his king 
none	none	You just think he hasn t Blount retorted
3274_167022_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Here in Konkrook he s always entertained by one or another of the big ship owning nobles They probably deprecate his table manners but they just love his politics 
none	none	And the same thing at Keegark and at the Free Cities along the Eastern Shore
3274_167022_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 The last time Rakkeed was in Konkrook he was the guest of the Keegarkan Ambassador von Schlichten stated 
3274_167022_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Intelligence got that from a spy we d planted among the embassy servants 
3274_167022_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You sure this spy wasn t just romancing Harrington asked 
3274_167022_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 You get so confounded many wild stories about Rakkeed 
none	none	Three days after he was reported here at Konkrook he was reported at Skilk five thousand miles away said to be having an audience with King Firkked
3274_167022_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No mystery to that von Schlichten said 
3274_167022_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 He travels on our ships in disguise coolie class on the geek deck 
none	none	Be a good idea if he could be caught at it some time Blount said making another move
3274_167022_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 One of the lower deck loading ports could be left unlocked by carelessness and he could blunder overboard at about five thousand feet He watched Harrington make a deceptively pointless looking move 
3274_167022_000019_000002	train-clean-360	 Sid this damn dog business worries me 
3274_167022_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Worries me too 
3274_167022_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I m fond of that mutt and God only knows what sort of stuff he s been getting to eat 
3274_167022_000020_000002	train-clean-360	And I hate to think of why those geeks stole him too 
none	none	Well at risk of seeming heartless I m not so much worried for Stalin as I am about why Keeluk was hiding him and why he was willing to murder the only two Terrans in Konkrook who trust him to prevent our finding out that he had him
3274_167022_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 A mister Keeluk a clergyman von Schlichten quoted 
3274_167022_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He chain lit another cigarette and stubbed out the old one 
3274_167022_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 Maybe the reverend 
3274_167022_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Keeluk wanted Stalin for sacramental purposes 
none	none	Blount looked up sharply
3274_167022_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Ritual killing he asked 
3274_167022_000023_000002	train-clean-360	 Or sympathetic magic 
3274_167022_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten shrugged 
3274_167022_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Take your choice 
3274_167022_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Maybe Rakkeed wanted the dog to kill before a congregation of his followers killing us by proxy or in effigy 
none	none	Or maybe they think we worship Stalin and getting control of him would give them power over us I wish we knew a little more about Ulleran psychology 
3274_167022_000025_000000	train-clean-360	That wasn t the first time he d made that wish 
none	none	Even if sex weren t the paramount psychological factor the ancient Freudians believed it was an extremely important one and on Uller most of the fundamental terms of Terran psychology were meaningless 
3274_167022_000025_000002	train-clean-360	At the same time the average Ulleran probably had complexes and neuroses that would have had Freud talking to himself and they certainly indulged in practices that would have even stood Krafft Ebing s hair on end 
none	none	One thing Blount said
3274_167022_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 It doesn t take any Ulleran psychologist to know that about eighty percent of them hate us poisonously 
3274_167022_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh rubbish Harrington blew the exclamation out around his pipe stem with a gush of smoke 
3274_167022_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 A few fanatics hate us and a few merchants who lost money when we replaced this primitive barter economy of theirs but nine tenths of them have benefited enormously from us and continue to benefit 
3274_167022_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And hate us more deeply with each new benefit Blount added 
3274_167022_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 They resent everything we ve done for them 
3274_167022_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes this spaceport proposition of King Orgzild of Keegark looks like it now doesn t it Harrington retorted 
3274_167022_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 He hates and resents us so much that he s offered us a spaceport at his city 
3274_167022_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What s it going to cost him Blount asked 
3274_167022_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 He furnishes the land sequestered from the estate of some noble he executed for treason and the labor all forced 
3274_167022_000030_000002	train-clean-360	We furnish the structural steel the machine equipment the engineering 
none	none	We get a spaceport we don t really need and he gets all the business it ll bring to Keegark Considering the fact that Rakkeed is a welcome guest at his embassy here and at the Royal Palace at Keegark I m beginning to wonder if he isn t fomenting trouble for us here at Konkrook to make us willing to move our main base to his city 
3274_167022_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He made a move 
3274_167022_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Instantly Harrington slashed out from the middle of the board with one of his heavy duty all purpose pieces and took a piece then moved again 
3274_167022_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Now look whose king s threatened he crowed 
3274_167022_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I see Blount brought a piece clockwise around the board and took the threatening piece then moved again 
3274_167022_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope you see whose king s threatened now 
3274_167022_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Harrington swore reached out to move a piece and then jerked his hand back as though the piece were radioactive 
3274_167022_000034_000001	train-clean-360	For a while he sat puffing his pipe and staring at the board 
none	none	In fact Orgzild s so sure that we re going to accept his offer that he s started building two new power reactors to handle the additional power demand that ll result from the increased business Blount continued
3274_167022_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s he getting the plutonium von Schlichten asked 
3274_167022_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Where can he get it Harrington replied 
none	none	He just bought four tons of it from us off the City of Pretoria
3274_167022_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a hell of a lot of plutonium Blount said 
3274_167022_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I wonder if he mightn t have some idea of what else plutonium can be used for beside generating power 
3274_167022_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh God I hope not Harrington exclaimed 
3274_167022_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 You re going to get me started seeing burglars under the bed next 
3274_167022_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe there are burglars Blount said pointing with his cigarette holder to Harrington s threatened king 
3274_167022_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Can t you do something about that Sid Then he turned to von Schlichten 
3274_167022_000040_000002	train-clean-360	 Before we get off the subject how about those letters the reverend 
3274_167022_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Keeluk gave to the Quinton girl 
3274_167022_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 All addressed to Skilkans known to be Rakkeed disciples and rabidly anti Terran von Schlichten replied 
3274_167022_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 We radioed the list to Skilk Colonel Cheng Li our intelligence man there teleprinted us back a lot of material on them that looks like the Newgate Calendar 
3274_167022_000041_000002	train-clean-360	We turned the letters themselves over to Doc Petrie the Ulleran philology sharp who is a pretty fair cryptanalyst 
3274_167022_000041_000003	train-clean-360	He couldn t find any indications of cipher but there was a lot of gossip about Keeluk s friends and parishioners which might have arbitrary code meanings 
none	none	I m going to explain the situation to Miss Quinton and advise her to have nothing to do with any of the people Keeluk gave her letters to 
3274_167022_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Harrington had gotten his king temporarily out of danger losing a piece doing it 
3274_167022_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Think she ll listen to you he asked 
3274_167022_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 These Extraterrestrials Rights Association people are a lot of blasted fanatics themselves We re a gang of bloody handed flint hearted imperialistic sons of bitches in their book and anything we say s sure to be a Hitler sized lie 
3274_167022_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh they re not as bad as all that 
3274_167022_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I never met the girl before today but old Mohammed Ferriera s a decent bloke 
none	none	And their association s really done a lot of good 
3274_167022_000044_000003	train-clean-360	For one thing they put an end to the peonage system on Yggdrasill and I know what conditions were like there before they did 
3274_167022_000045_000000	train-clean-360	A calculating look came into Harrington s eye 
3274_167022_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He puffed slowly at his pipe and slid a piece from the center toward the sector of the board nearest him 
3274_167022_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Blount whistled softly and made a quick re arrangement 
3274_167022_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Carlos did you say she told you she was going to Skilk in the near future Harrington asked 
none	none	Well look here you re going up that way yourself with that battalion of Kragans on the Aldebaran 
3274_167022_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Why don t you invite her to make the trip with you 
3274_167022_000046_000003	train-clean-360	You can be quite attractive to young ladies when you try and she ll be grateful for that rescue this afternoon which is always a good foundation 
3274_167022_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Maybe you can plant a couple of ideas where they ll do the most good 
none	none	She s only been here for three months since the Canberra got in from Niflheim 
3274_167022_000046_000006	train-clean-360	You know and I know and we all know that there are a lot of things up there at the polar mines that would look like hell to anybody who didn t understand local conditions 
none	none	Well Miss Quinton s company won t be any particularly heavy cross for me to bear von Schlichten replied
3274_167022_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I won t guarantee anything of course 
none	none	The intercom speaker on the table whistled several times Harrington swore laid down his pipe and got up brushing ashes from the front of his coat 
3274_167022_000048_000002	train-clean-360	He flipped a switch and spoke into the box 
3274_167022_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Governor a voice replied out of it there s a geek procession just landed from a water barge in front and is coming up the roadway to Company House 
3274_167022_000049_000001	train-clean-360	A platoon of Jaikark s Household Guards with rifles the Spear of State a royal litter about thirty geek nobles on foot a gift litter another platoon of riflemen if you say the last syllable quick enough 
3274_167022_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 That ll be Gurgurk coming to tell us how unhappy his Sodden and Inebriated Geekship is about that fracas on Seventy second Street Harrington said 
none	none	The gift litter will contain the customary indemnity at the current market quotation Have Gurgurk and party admitted all but the rifle platoons give him an honor guard of our Kragans and keep his own gun toters outside 
3274_167022_000050_000003	train-clean-360	Take them to the Reception Hall and hold them there till I signal from the Audience Hall and then herd them in 
3274_167022_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He came back and made a move 
3274_167022_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Immediately Blount took one of his pieces moved again took another and made the third move to which he was entitled 
3274_167022_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll mate you in four moves he predicted 
3274_167022_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Want to play it out before we go down 
3274_167022_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Sure what s time to a geek 
none	none	Gurgurk d think we were worried about something if we didn t keep him waiting 
3274_167022_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Good Lord 
none	none	You do have me over a barrel Eric III Four and Twenty Geek Heads Governor General Sidney Harrington sat on the comfortably upholstered bench on the dais of the Audience Hall flanked by von Schlichten and Eric Blount 
3274_167023_000000_000001	train-clean-360	He didn t look particularly regal even on that high seat with his ruddy outdoorsman s face and his ragged gray mustache and his old tweed coat spotted with pipe ashes he might have been any of the dozen odd country gentleman neighbors of von Schlichten s boyhood in the Argentine 
none	none	But then to a Terran any of the kings of Uller would have looked like a freak birth in a lizard house at a zoo it was hard to guess what impression Harrington would make on an Ulleran 
3274_167023_000001_000000	train-clean-360	He took the false palate and tongue clicker officially designated as an enunciator Ulleran and colloquially as a geek speaker out of his coat pocket and shoved it into his mouth 
3274_167023_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten and Blount put in theirs and Harrington pressed the floor button with his toe 
3274_167023_000001_000002	train-clean-360	After a brief interval the wide doors at the other end of the hall slid open and the Konkrookan notables attended by a dozen Company native officers and a guard of Kragan Rifles entered 
3274_167023_000001_000003	train-clean-360	The honor guard advanced in two columns between them marched an unclad and heavily armed native carrying an ornate spear with a three foot blade upright in front of him with all four hands 
3274_167023_000001_000004	train-clean-360	It was the Konkrookan Spear of State it represented the proxy presence of King Jaikark 
none	none	Behind it stalked Gurgurk the Konkrookan equivalent of Prime Minister or Grand Vizier he wore a gold helmet and a thing like a string vest made of gold wire and carried a long sword with a two hand grip a pair of Terran automatics built for a hand with six four knuckled fingers and a pair of matched daggers 
3274_167023_000001_000006	train-clean-360	He was considerably past the Ulleran prime of life seventy or eighty to judge from the worn appearance of his opal teeth the color of his skin and the predominantly reddish tint of his quartz speckles 
3274_167023_000001_000007	train-clean-360	An immature Ulleran would be a very light gray white under the arms and his quartz specks would run from white to pale yellow 
none	none	The retinue of nobles behind Gurgurk ran through the whole spectrum from a princeling who was almost oyster gray to old Ghroghrank the Keegarkan Ambassador who was even blacker and more red speckled than Gurgurk All of them carried about as much ironmongery as the Prime Minister the pistols were all Terran and the swords and daggers were mostly made either on Terra or at the Terran operated steel works on Volund 
3274_167023_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Four slaves brought up the rear carrying an ornately inlaid box on poles 
3274_167023_000002_000001	train-clean-360	When the spear bearer reached the exact middle of the hall he halted and grounded his regalia weapon with a thump 
none	none	Gurgurk came up and halted a couple of paces behind and to the left of the spear and all the other nobles drew up in two curved lines some ten paces to the rear with considerable pushing and jostling and a sotto voce argument with overtones of weapon fingering about precedence All that is but Ghroghrank and another noble who came up and planted themselves beside Gurgurk 
3274_167023_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten regarded the assemblage sourly through his monocle 
none	none	Maybe Sid Harrington did look regal after all The Governor General rose slowly and descended from the dais advancing to within ten paces of the Spear von Schlichten and Blount accompanying him 
3274_167023_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Out of the corner of his eye von Schlichten watched a couple of Kragan mercenaries with fifty shot machine rifles move unobtrusively to positions from whence they could if necessary spray the visitors with bullets without endangering the Terrans 
3274_167023_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Welcome Gurgurk Harrington gibbered through his false palate 
3274_167023_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 The Company is honored by this visit 
none	none	I come in the name of my royal master His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty Jaikark the Seventeenth King of Konkrook and of all the lands of the Konk Isthmus Gurgurk squeaked and clicked I have the honor to bring with me the Lord Ghroghrank Ambassador of King Orgzild of Keegark to the court of my royal master And I Ghroghrank said after being suitably welcomed am honored to be accompanied by Prince Gorkrink special envoy from my master his Royal and Imperial Majesty King Orgzild who is in your city to receive the shipment of power metal my royal master has been honored to be permitted to purchase from the Company 
3274_167023_000007_000000	train-clean-360	More protocol about welcoming Gorkrink 
3274_167023_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Then Gurgurk cleared his throat with a series of barking sounds 
none	none	My royal master His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty is prostrated with grief he stated solemnly Were his sorrow not so overwhelming he would have come in His Own Sacred Person to express the pain and shame which he feels that people of the Company should be set upon and endangered in the streets of the royal city If he weren t doped to the ears von Schlichten substituted mentally There was a native drug which had on its users the combined effects of hashish heroin and yohimbine Jaikark and all his court circle were addicts 
3274_167023_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He probably hadn t even heard of the riot 
none	none	The soldiers of His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty came most promptly to the aid of the troops of the Company did they not General von Schlichten Harrington asked
3274_167023_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Within minutes Your Excellency von Schlichten replied gravely Their promptness valor and efficiency were most exemplary 
3274_167023_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Gurgurk spoke at length expressing himself as delighted on behalf of his royal master at hearing such high praise from so distinguished a soldier 
none	none	Eric Blount then contributed a short speech beseeching the gods that the deep and beautiful friendship existing between the Chartered Uller Company and His Sublime etcetera would continue unimpaired and that His Sublime etcetera would enjoy long life and peaceful reign managing by a trick of Konkrookan grammar to imply that the second would be conditional upon the first The Keegarkan Ambassador then spoke his piece expressing on behalf of King Orgzild the deepest regret that the people of the Company should be so molested and managing to hint that things like that simply didn t happen at Keegark The Prince Gorkrink then spoke briefly in sympathy for the great and good friend of all Ulleran peoples Mohammed Ferriera who had been injured and hoping that he would soon enjoy full health again 
3274_167023_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He also managed to convey King Orgzild s pleasure at having obtained the plutonium 
none	none	Von Schlichten noticed that a few of his more recent quartz specks were slightly greenish in tinge a sure sign that he had not long ago been exposed to the fluorine tainted air which men and geeks alike breathed on Niflheim 
3274_167023_000013_000003	train-clean-360	When a geek prince hired out as a laborer for a year on Niflheim he did so for only one purpose to learn Terran technologies 
3274_167023_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Gurgurk then announced that so enormous a crime against the friends of His Sublime etcetera had not been allowed to go unpunished signaling behind him with one of his lower hands for the box to be brought forward 
none	none	The slaves carried it to the front set it down and opened it taking from it a rug which they spread on the floor 
3274_167023_000014_000002	train-clean-360	On this from the box they placed twenty four newly severed opal grinning heads in four neat rows 
3274_167023_000014_000003	train-clean-360	They had all been freshly scrubbed and polished but they still smelled like crushed cockroaches 
3274_167023_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The three Terrans looked at them gravely 
3274_167023_000015_000001	train-clean-360	A double dozen heads was standard payment for an attack in which no Terran had been killed Ostensibly they were the heads of the ringleaders in practice they were usually lopped from the first two dozen prisoners or over age slaves at hand without regard for whether the victims had even heard of the crime which they were expiating 
3274_167023_000015_000002	train-clean-360	If the Extraterrestrial s Rights Association were really serious about the rights of these geeks they d advocate booting out all these native princes and turning the whole planet over to the Company 
3274_167023_000015_000003	train-clean-360	That had been the Terran Federation s idea from the beginning why else give the Company s chief representative the title of Governor General 
3274_167023_000016_000000	train-clean-360	There was another long speech from Gurgurk with the nobles behind him murmuring antiphonal agreement standard procedure for which there was a standard pun geek chorus and a speech of response from Sid Harrington 
none	none	Standing stiffly through the whole rigamarole von Schlichten waited for it to end as finally it did 
3274_167023_000017_000000	train-clean-360	They walked back from the door whence they had escorted the delegation and stood looking down at the saurian heads on the rug Harrington raised his voice and called to a Kragan sergeant whose chevrons were painted on all four arms 
none	none	Take this carrion out and stuff it in the incinerator he ordered If any of you think you can clean up this rug and this box you re welcome to them Wait a moment von Schlichten told the sergeant Then he disgorged and pouched his geek speaker
3274_167023_000019_000002	train-clean-360	 See that head there he asked rolling it over with his toe 
3274_167023_000019_000003	train-clean-360	 I killed that geek myself with my pistol while Them and Hid were getting Ferriera into the car 
3274_167023_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Miss Quinton killed that one with the bolo see where she chopped him on the back of the neck 
3274_167023_000019_000005	train-clean-360	The cut that took off the head was a little low and missed it 
none	none	And Hid O Leary stuck a knife in that one He walked around the rug turning heads over with his foot This was cut rate head payment they just slashed off two dozen heads at the scene of the riot 
3274_167023_000019_000008	train-clean-360	I don t like this butchery of worn out slaves and petty thieves any better than anybody else but this I don t like either Six months ago Gurgurk wouldn t have tried to pull anything like this 
3274_167023_000019_000009	train-clean-360	Now he s laughing up his non existent sleeve at us 
3274_167023_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what I ve been preaching all along Eric Blount took up after him 
3274_167023_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 These geeks need having the fear of Terra thrown into them 
3274_167023_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh nonsense Eric you re just as bad as Carlos here Harrington tut tutted 
3274_167023_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Next you ll be saying that we ought to depose Jaikark and take control ourselves 
3274_167023_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what s wrong with that for an idea von Schlichten demanded Don t you think we could 
3274_167023_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Our Kragans could go through that army of Jaikark s like fast neutrons through toilet paper 
3274_167023_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 My God Harrington exploded 
3274_167023_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t let me hear that kind of talk again 
none	none	We re not conquistadores we re employees of a business concern here to make money honestly by exchanging goods and services with these people 
3274_167023_000024_000000	train-clean-360	He turned and walked away out of the Audience Hall leaving von Schlichten and Blount to watch the removal of the geek heads 
3274_167023_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You know I went a little too far von Schlichten confessed 
3274_167023_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Or too fast rather 
3274_167023_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He s got to be conditioned to accept that idea 
3274_167023_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 We can t go too slowly either Blount replied 
3274_167023_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 If we wait for him to change his mind it ll be the same as waiting for him to retire And that ll be waiting too long 
3274_167023_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten nodded seriously 
3274_167023_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you notice the green specks in the hide of that Prince Gorkrink he asked 
none	none	He s just come back from Niflheim Not on the Pretoria I don t think Probably on the Canberra three months ago And he s here to get that plutonium and ship it to Keegark on the Oom Paul Kruger Blount considered I wonder just what he learned on Niflheim I wonder just what s going on at Keegark von Schlichten said Orgzild s pulled down a regular First Century model iron curtain 
3274_167023_000029_000001	train-clean-360	You know four of our best native Intelligence operatives have been murdered in Keegark in the last three months and six more have just vanished there 
3274_167023_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I m going there in a few days myself to talk to Orgzild about this spaceport deal Blount said 
3274_167023_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll have a talk with Hendrik Lemoyne and MacKinnon 
3274_167023_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And I ll see what I can find out for myself 
none	none	Well let s go have a drink von Schlichten suggested consulting his watch About time for a cocktail IV 
3224_167024_000002_000000	train-clean-360	If You Read It in Stanley Browne
none	none	 Von Schlichten and Blount entered the bar together the Broadway Room decorated in gleaming plastics and chromium in enthusiastic if slightly inaccurate imitation of a First Century New York nightclub There were no native servants to spoil the illusion such as it was the service was fully automatic 
3224_167024_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Going to a bartending machine von Schlichten dialed the cocktail they had decided upon and inserted his key to charge the drinks to his account filling a four portion jug 
3224_167024_000004_000000	train-clean-360	As they turned away they almost collided with Hideyoshi O Leary and Paula Quinton 
none	none	The girl wore a long sleeved gown to conceal a bandage on her right wrist and her face was rather heavily powdered in spots otherwise she looked none the worse for recent experiences Well you seem to have gotten yourself repaired Miss Quinton he greeted her
3224_167024_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Feel better now 
3224_167024_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Miss Quinton this is Lieutenant Governor Blount 
3224_167024_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Eric Miss Paula Quinton 
3224_167024_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Delighted Miss Quinton Blount said 
3224_167024_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Carlos tells us he found you standing over poor Mohammed Ferriera fighting like a commando 
none	none	How is Mohammed by the way 
3224_167024_000006_000003	train-clean-360	No danger I hope we all like him 
3224_167024_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Mohammed Ferriera was still unconscious the girl reported he had a minor concussion but the medics were not greatly disturbed and expected him to be fully recovered in a few weeks 
3224_167024_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten invited her and her escort to join him and Blount 
none	none	Colonel O Leary was carrying a cocktail jug and a couple of glasses finding a table out of the worst of the noise they all sat down together
3224_167024_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose you think it s a joke our being nearly murdered by the people we came to help Paula began a trifle defensively 
none	none	Not a very funny joke von Schlichten told her
3224_167024_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 It s been played on us till it s lost its humor 
none	none	Yes geek ingratitude s an old story to all of us Blount agreed You stay on this planet very long and you ll see what I mean You call them that too she asked as though disappointed in him Maybe if you stopped calling them geeks they wouldn t resent you the way they do You know that s a nasty name in the First Century Pre Atomic it designated a degraded person who performed some sort of revolting public exhibition Biting off live chickens heads in a sideshow wild man act Hideyoshi O Leary supplied
3224_167024_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 When you get up north watch how the peasants kill these little things like six legged iguanas that they raise for food 
3224_167024_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That isn t the reason though von Schlichten said 
3224_167024_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 As we use it the word s pure onomatopoeia 
none	none	You ve learned some of the languages you know what they sound like Geek geek geek As far as that goes you know what the geek name for a Terran is Blount asked Suddabit She looked puzzled for a moment then slipped in her enunciator 
3224_167024_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Even in the absence of any native she used her handkerchief to mask the act 
none	none	Suddabit she said distinctly Sud da a bit Taking out the geek speaker she put it away
3224_167024_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 Why that s exactly how they d pronounce it 
none	none	And don t tell me you haven t heard it before O Leary said The geeks were screaming it at you over on Seventy second Street this afternoon Znidd suddabit kill the Terrans 
3224_167024_000017_000003	train-clean-360	That s Rakkeed the Prophet s whole gospel 
3224_167024_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 So you see Eric Blount rammed home the moral this is just another case of nobody with any right to call anybody else s kettle black Cigarette 
none	none	Thank you She leaned toward the lighter flame O Leary had snapped into being
3224_167024_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I suspect that of being a principle you d like me to bear in mind at the polar mines when I see let s say some laborer being beaten by a couple of overseers with three foot lengths of three quarter inch steel cable 
none	none	Well you could also remember that a native s skin is about half an inch thick and a good deal tougher than a human s von Schlichten told her And it wouldn t hurt any if you found out how these laborers are treated at home Mostly they re serfs hired from the big landowners it s a fact you can easily verify that permission to join the labor companies at the polar mines is regarded as a privilege granted as a reward or denied as a punishment 
3224_167024_000020_000003	train-clean-360	And most of the geek landowners are bitterly critical of the way we treat our labor at the mines they claim we make them dissatisfied with the treatment they get at home 
3224_167024_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course they re always glad to have the peasants taken off their hands during a slack agricultural season Blount added and we train workers to handle contragravity power equipment 
3224_167024_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I won t deny that there s a lot of unnecessary brutality on the part of the native foremen and overseers which we re trying gradually to eliminate You ll have to remember though that we re dealing with a naturally brutal race 
none	none	Of course mistreatment of native labor is always blamed on other natives never on the gentle and kindly Terrans she replied
3224_167024_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 That s been SOP on every planet our Association s had any experience with 
none	none	Now look you just came here from Niflheim von Schlichten objected The Company employs quite a few geeks there how much brutality did you run into there
3224_167024_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I must admit the Ullerans who work there are very well treated 
none	none	Except that I don t think it s right to employ any people with silicone body tissues where they re going to breathe fluorine tainted air Nobody ought to be employed on that planet Hideyoshi O Leary declared I did a two year hitch there when I was first commissioned in the Company service
3224_167024_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I put in two years there too Blount supported him 
none	none	And I might add that that s a year longer than any Ulleran native is ever allowed to spend on Niflheim 
3224_167024_000026_000002	train-clean-360	You know what the setup is there don t you The Terran Federation Space Navy discovered and explored both Uller and Niflheim which made both planets public domain 
none	none	The Company was originally formed to exploit Uller alone but the Federation insisted that both planets would have to be franchised to the same company They wanted Niflheim exploited mainly because of the uranium deposits there As it turned out the Company s making as much money out of Niflheim as we are out of Uller What you miss is this von Schlichten pointed out On Niflheim there are about a thousand Terrans and not more than five hundred geeks all employed on construction work and in the mines on the planet itself working directly under Terran supervision We use them because they have four hands and in the power driven contragravity armor that s necessary there they can manipulate more controls and do more things at once than we can Here on Uller at the polar mines there are about ten thousand geeks working under five hundred Terrans and most of the latter are engineers or technicians who don t do supervisory work So we have to use native foremen and they re guilty of what mistreatment the workers suffer And remember too O Leary added work at the polar mines can only go on for about two months out of the year mid September to mid November at the Arctic and mid March to mid May at the Antarctic Naturally things have to be done in a hurry and under pressure Well why do you work mines at the poles Aren t there mineral deposits in places where you can work all year round Not as rich or as accessible Blount said
3224_167024_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 You know what the seasons are like at the poles of this planet 
none	none	The temperature will range from about two fifty Fahrenheit in mid summer to a hundred and fifty below in winter 
3224_167024_000030_000003	train-clean-360	There s the most intense sort of thermal erosion you can imagine the ice cap melts in the spring to a sea which boils away completely by the middle of the summer 
none	none	There will be violent circular storms of hot wind blowing away the light sand and dust and leaving the heavier particles of metallic ores and metals behind 
3224_167024_000030_000005	train-clean-360	Then when the winds fall we move in for a couple of months It isn t really mining or even quarrying we just scoop up ore from the surface load it onto ore boats and fly it down to Skilk and Krink and Grank where it s smelted through the winter 
none	none	The natives run the smelters use the heat to thaw frozen food for themselves and their livestock while they re melting the ore 
3224_167024_000030_000007	train-clean-360	In the north metallurgy and food preparation have always been combined that way 
none	none	Yes if you think the natives who work at the mines feel themselves ill treated you might propose closing them down entirely and see what the native reaction would be von Schlichten told her Independently hired free workers can make themselves rich by native standards in a couple of seasons many of the serfs pick up enough money from us in incentive pay to buy their freedom after one season Well if the Company s doing so much good on this planet how is it that this native Rakkeed the one you call the Mad Prophet is able to find such a following Paula demanded There must be something wrong somewhere
3224_167024_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a fair question Blount replied inverting a cocktail jug over his glass to extract the last few drops 
none	none	When we came to Uller we found a culture roughly like that of Europe during the Seventh Century Pre Atomic or more closely like that of Japan before the beginning of the First Century P A We initiated a technological and economic revolution here and such revolutions have their casualties too A number of classes and groups got squeezed pretty badly like the horse breeders and harness manufacturers on Terra by the invention of the automobile or the coal and hydroelectric interests when direct conversion of nuclear energy to electric current was developed or the railroads and steamship lines at the time of the discovery of the contragravity field Naturally there s a lot of ill feeling on the part of merchants and artisans who weren t able or willing to adapt themselves to changing conditions they re all backing Rakkeed and yelling Znidd suddabit now You know it s a shame that geek messiah isn t a smart crook instead of an honest fanatic he could take in the equivalent of a couple of million sols a year off the North Uller merchants and the Equatorial Zone shipowners But it is a fact which not even Rakkeed can successfully deny that we ve raised the general living standard of this planet by about two hundred percent Rakkeed is a Zirk von Schlichten said
3224_167024_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 They re the nomads who hire out to the northern merchants as caravan drivers and also prey or used to prey on the caravans as brigands 
none	none	Since our air freighters got into operation neither caravan driving nor caravan raiding has been a paying business and our air patrols have made caravan raiding suicidal as well So the Zirks don t like us The only thing they know or are willing to learn is handling these six legged riding and pack animals we call hipposaurs We employ a few of them as cavalry and a few more of them work as the local equivalent of gauchos and the rest just sit around and listen to Rakkeed s sermons 
3224_167024_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Both jugs were empty 
none	none	Colonel O Leary as befitted his junior rank picked them up after a good natured wrangle with von Schlichten Blount handed the colonel his credit key The merchants in the north don t like us beside spoiling the caravan trade we re spoiling their local business because the land owning barons who used to deal with them are now dealing directly with us At Skilk King Firkked s afraid his feudal nobility is going to try to force a Runnymede on him so he s been currying favor with the urban merchants that makes him as pro Rakkeed and as anti Terran as they are At Krink King Jonkvank has the support of his barons but he s afraid of his urban bourgeoisie and we pay him a handsome subsidy so he s pro Terran and anti Rakkeed 
3224_167024_000036_000003	train-clean-360	At Skilk Rakkeed comes and goes openly at Krink he has a price on his head 
none	none	Jonkvank is not one of the assets we boast about too loudly Hideyoshi O Leary said pausing on his way from the table He s as bloody minded an old murderer as you d care not to meet in a dark alley anywhere We can turn our backs on him and not expect a knife between our shoulders anyhow von Schlichten said And we can believe oh up to eighty percent of what he tells us and that s sixty percent better than any of the other native princes except King Kankad of course The Kragans are the only real friends we have on this planet He thought for a moment Miss Quinton are you doing sociographic research work here in addition to your Ex Rights work he asked Well let me advise you to pay some attention to the Kragans You ll only find them treated at any length at all in that compendium of misinformation Willard Stanley Browne s Short Sociographic History of Beta Hydrae II and ninety percent of what Stanley Browne says about them is completely erroneous
3224_167024_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but they re just a parasite race on the Terrans doctor Paula Quinton objected 
3224_167024_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 You find races like that all through the explored galaxy pathetic cultural mongrels 
none	none	Both men laughed heartily Colonel O Leary returning with the jugs wanted to know what he d missed 
3224_167024_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Blount told him 
3224_167024_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha 
none	none	She s been reading that thing of Stanley Browne s he said What s the matter with Stanley Browne Paula demanded
3224_167024_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Stanley Browne is one author you can depend on O Leary assured her If you read it in Stanley Browne it s wrong 
none	none	You know I don t think she s run into many Kragans We ought to take her over and introduce her to King Kankad 
3224_167024_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Von Schlichten allowed himself to be smitten by an idea 
none	none	By Allah so we had he exclaimed Look you re going to Skilk in the next week aren t you Well do you think you could get all your end jobs cleared up here and be ready to leave by eight hundred Tuesday 
3224_167024_000044_000004	train-clean-360	That s four days from today 
3224_167024_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sure I could 
none	none	Why Well I m going to Skilk myself with the armed troopship Aldebaran We re stopping at King Kankad s Town to pick up a battalion of Kragan Rifles for duty at the polar mines where you re going Suppose we leave here in my command car go to Kankad s Town and wait there till the Aldebaran gets in 
3224_167024_000046_000003	train-clean-360	That would give us about two to three hours 
3224_167024_000046_000004	train-clean-360	If you think the Kragans are pathetic cultural mongrels what you ll see there will open your eyes 
none	none	And I might add that the nearest Stanley Browne ever came to seeing Kankad s Town was from the air once at a distance of four miles Well they live entirely by serving as mercenary soldiers for the Uller Company don t they More or less You see when we came to Uller they were barbarian brigands had a string of forts along caravan roads and at fords and mountain passes and levied tolls 
3224_167024_000048_000002	train-clean-360	They raided into Konkrook and Keegark territory too 
3224_167024_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Well we had to break that up 
none	none	We fought a little war with them beat them rather badly in a couple of skirmishes and then made a deal with them That was before my time when old Jerry Kirke was Governor General He negotiated a treaty with their King bought their rievers forts outright and paid them a subsidy to compensate for loss of tolls and raid spoil and agreed to employ the whole tribe as soldiers 
3224_167024_000048_000007	train-clean-360	We ve taught them a lot you ll see how much when you visit their town but they aren t cultural mongrels 
3224_167024_000048_000008	train-clean-360	You ll like them 
3224_167024_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Well general I ll take you up she said 
3224_167024_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 But I warn you if this is some scheme to indoctrinate me with the Uller Company s side of the case and blind me to unjust exploitation of the natives here I don t propagandize very easily 
none	none	Fair enough as long as you don t let fear of being propagandized blind you to the good we re doing here or impair your ability to observe and draw accurate conclusions 
3224_167024_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Just stay scientific about it and I ll be satisfied 
none	none	Now let s take time out for lubrication he said filling her glass and passing the jug Two hours and five cocktails later they were still at the table and they had taught Paula Quinton some twenty verses of The Heathen Geeks They Wear No Breeks including the four printable ones V You Can Depend on It It s Wrong Gongonk Island with its blue gray Company buildings and the Terran green of the farms and the spaceport with its ring of mooring pylons empty since the City of Pretoria had lifted out two days before for Terra was dropping away behind Von Schlichten held his lighter for Paula Quinton then lit his own cigarette I was rather horrified Friday afternoon at the way you and Colonel O Leary and mister Blount were blaspheming against Stanley Browne she said His book is practically the sociographers Koran for this planet But I ve been checking up since and I find that everybody who s been here any length of time seems to deride it and it s full of the most surprising misstatements I m either going to make myself famous or get burned at the stake by the Extraterrestrial Sociographic Society after I get back to Terra In the last three months I ve been really too busy with Ex Rights work to do much research but I m beginning to think there s a great deal in Stanley Browne s book that will have to be reconsidered How d you get into this Miss Quinton he asked You mean sociography or Ex Rights Well my father and my grandfather were both extraterrestrial sociographers anthropologists whose subjects aren t anthropomorphic and I majored in sociography at the University of Montevideo And I ve always been in sympathy with extraterrestrial races one of my great grandmothers was a Freyan The deuce I d never have guessed that as small and dark as you are Well another of my great grandmothers was Japanese she replied The family name s French I m also part Spanish part Russian part Italian part English the usual modern Argentine mixture I m an Argentino too From La Rioja over along the Sierra de Velasco My family lived there for the past five centuries They came to the Argentine in the Year Three Atomic Era On account of the Hitler bust up Yes I believe the first one also a General von Schlichten was what was then known as a war criminal That makes us partners in crime then she laughed The Quintons had to leave France about the same time they were what was known as collaborationists That s probably why the Southern Hemisphere managed to stay out of the Third and Fourth World Wars he considered It was full of the descendants of people who d gotten the short end of the Second Do you speak the Kragan language general she asked I understand it s entirely different from the other Equatorial Ulleran languages Yes That s what gives the Kragans an entirely different semantic orientation For instance they have nothing like a subject predicate sentence structure That s why Stanley Browne to the contrary notwithstanding they are entirely non religious Their language hasn t instilled in them a predisposition to think of everything as the result of an action performed by an agent And they have no definite parts of speech any word can be used as any part of speech depending on context Tense is applied to words used as nouns not words used as verbs there are four tenses spatial temporal present things here and now spatial present and temporal remote things which were here at some other time spatial remote and temporal present things existing now somewhere else and spatial temporal remote things somewhere else some other time Why it s a wonder they haven t developed a Theory of Relativity They have It resembles ours about the way the Wright Brothers airplane resembles this aircar but I was explaining the Keene Gonzales Dillingham Theory and the older Einstein Theory to King Kankad once and it was beautiful to watch how he picked it up Half the time he was a jump ahead of me The aircar began losing altitude and speed as they came in over Kraggork Swamp the treetops below blended into a level plain of yellow green pierced by glints of stagnant water underneath and broken by an occasional low hillock sometimes topped by a stockaded village Those are the swamp savages homes he told her Most of what you find in Stanley Browne about them is fairly accurate He spent a lot of time among them He never seems to have realized though that they are living now as they have ever since the first appearance of intelligent life on this planet You mean they re the real aboriginal people of Uller They and the Jeel cannibals whom we are doing our best to exterminate he replied You see at one time the dominant type of mobile land life was the thing we call a shellosaur a big thing running from five to fifteen tons plated all over with silicate shell till it looked like a six legged pine cone Some were herbivores and some were carnivores There are a few left in remote places quite a few in the Southern Hemisphere which we haven t explored very much They were a satisfied life form Outside of a volcano or an earthquake or an avalanche nothing could hurt a shellosaur but a bigger shellosaur Finally of course they grew beyond their sustenance limit but in the meantime some of them began specializing on mobility instead of armor and began excreting waste matter instead of turning it to shell Some of these new species got rid of their shell entirely Parahomo sapiens Ulleris is descended from one of these The shellosaurs were still a serious menace though The ancestors of the present Ulleran the proto geeks when they were at about the Java Ape Man stage of development took two divergent courses to escape the shellosaurs Some of them took to the swamps where the shellosaurs would sink if they tried to follow Those savages down there are still living in the same manner they never progressed Others encountered problems of survival which had to be overcome by invention They progressed to barbarism like the people of the fishing villages and some of them progressed to civilization like the Konkrookans and the Keegarkans Then there were others who took to the high rocks where the shellosaurs couldn t climb The Jeels are the primitive original example of that Most of the North Uller civilizations developed from mountaineer savages and so did the Zirks and the other northern plains nomads Well how about the Kragans Paula asked Which were they Von Schlichten was scanning the horizon ahead He pulled over a pair of fifty power binoculars on a swinging arm and put them where she could use them Right ahead there just a little to the left See that brown gray spot on the landward edge of the swamp That s King Kankad s Town It s been there for thousands of years and it s always been Kankad s Town You might say even the same Kankad The Kragan kings have always provided their own heirs by self fertilization That s a complicated process involving simultaneous male and female masturbation but the offspring is an exact duplicate of the single parent The present Kankad speaks of his heir as Little Me which is a fairly accurate way of putting it He knew what she was seeing through the glasses a massive butte of flint jutting out into the swamp on the end of a sharp ridge with a city on top of it All the buildings were multi storied some piling upward from the top and some clinging to the sides The high watchtower at the front now carried a telecast director aimed at an automatic relay station on an unmanned orbiter two thousand miles off planet They re either swamp people who moved up onto that rock or they re mountaineers who came out that far along the ridge and stopped she said Which Nobody s ever tried to find out Maybe if you stay on Uller long enough you can That ought to be good for about eight to ten honorary doctorates And maybe a hundred sols a year in book royalties Maybe I ll just do that general What s that on the little island over there she asked shifting the glasses A clump of flat roofed buildings Under a red and yellow danger flag That s Dynamite Island the Kragans have an explosives plant there They make nitroglycerine like all the thalassic peoples they also make TNT and catastrophite and propellants Learned that from us of course They also manufacture most of their own firearms some of them pretty extreme up to twenty five mm for shoulder rifles Don t ever fire one it d break every bone in your body Are they that much stronger than us He shook his head Just denser heavier They re about equal to us in weight lifting They can t run or jump as well as we can We often come out here for games with the Kragans where the geeks can t watch us And that reminds me you re right about that being a term of derogation because I don t believe I ve ever knowingly spoken of a Kragan as a geek and in fact they ve picked up the word from us and apply it to all non Kragans But as I was saying our baseball team has to give theirs a handicap but their football team can beat the daylights out of ours In a tug of war we have to put two men on our end for every one of theirs But they don t even try to play tennis with us Don t the other natives make their own firearms No and we re not going to teach them how The thalassic peoples here in the Equatorial Zone are fairly good empirical teaspoon measure chemists Well no alchemists They found out how to make nitroglycerine and use it for blasting and for bombs and mines and they screw little capsules of it on the ends of their arrows Most of their chemistry such as it is was learned in trying to prevent organic materials like wood from petrifying Up in the north where it gets cold they learned a lot about metallurgy and ceramics and about forced draft pneumatics from having to keep fires going all winter to thaw frozen food They make air rifles to shoot metal darts The aircar came in circling slowly over the town on the big rock and let down on the roof of the castle like building from which the watchtower rose There were a dozen or so individuals waiting for them the five Terrans three men and two women from the telecast station and the rest Kragans One of these dark skinned but with speckles no darker than light amber armed only with a heavy dagger came over and clapped von Schlichten on the shoulder grinning opalescently Greetings Von he squawked in Kragan then seeing Paula switched over to the customary language of the Takkad Sea country It makes happiness to see you How long will you stay with us Till the Aldebaran gets in from Konkrook to pick up the rifles von Schlichten replied in Lingua Terra He looked at his watch Two hours and a half Kankad this is Paula Quinton Paula King Kankad He took out his geek speaker and crammed it into his mouth Before any other race on Uller that would have been the most shocking sort of bad manners without the token concealment of the handkerchief Kankad took it as a matter of course At some length von Schlichten explained the nature of Paula s sociographic work her connection with the Extraterrestrials Rights Association and her intention of going to the Arctic mines Kankad nodded You were right he said I wouldn t have understood all that in your language If I had read it maybe but not if I heard it He put his upper right hand on Paula s shoulder and uttered a clicking approximation of her name I make you one of us he told her You must come back after the work stops at the mines if you want to learn about my people I ll show you what you want to see and tell you what you want to know But why not stay here Why bother about those geeks at the mines the Company treats them much better than they deserve Stay here with us we will make you happy to be with us Paula replied slowly I thank Kankad but I must go Those on Terra who sent me here want me to learn for myself how the workers at the mines are treated But I will come back in a hundred a hundred and fifty days Kankad s opal jeweled grin widened Good We ll be waiting for you He turned and introduced another Kragan about his own age who wore the equipment and insignia of a Company native major and was freshly painted with the Company emblem This is Kormork He and I have borne young to each other Kormork you watch over Paula Quinton He managed on the second try to make it more or less recognizable Bring her back safe Or else find yourself a good place to hide Kankad introduced the rest of his people and von Schlichten introduced the Terrans from the telecast station Then Kankad looked at the watch he was wearing on his lower left wrist We will have plenty of time before the ship comes to show Paula the town he suggested Von you know better than I do what she would like to see He led the way past a pair of long ninety mm guns to a stone stairway Von Schlichten explained as they went down that the guns of King Kankad s Town were the only artillery above seventy five mm on Uller in non Terran hands They climbed into an open machine gun carrier and strapped themselves to their seats and for two hours King Kankad showed her the sights of the town They visited the school where young Kragans were being taught to read Lingua Terra and studied from textbooks printed in Johannesburg and Sydney and Buenos Aires Kankad showed her the repair shops where two score descendants of Kragan riever chieftains were working on contragravity equipment under the supervision of a Scottish Afrikaner and his Malay Portuguese wife the small arms factory where very respectable copies of Terran rifles and pistols and auto weapons were being turned out the machine shop the physics and chemistry labs the hospital the ammunition loading plant the battery of one hundred fifty five mm Long Toms built in Kankad s own shops which covered the road up the sloping rock spine behind the city the printing shop and book bindery the observatory with a big telescope and an ingenious orrery of the Beta Hydrae system the nuclear power plant part of the original price for giving up brigandage Half an hour before the ship from Konkrook was due they had arrived at the airport where a gang of Kragans were clearing a berth for the Aldebaran From somewhere Kankad produced two cold bottles of Cape Town beer for Paula and von Schlichten and a bowl of some boiling hot black liquid for himself Von Schlichten and Paula lit cigarettes between sips of his bubbling hell brew Kankad gnawed on the stalk of some swamp plant Paula seemed as much surprised at Kankad s disregard for the eating taboo as she had been at von Schlichten s open flouting of the convention of concealment when he had put in his geek speaker This is the only place on Uller where this happens von Schlichten told her Here or in the field when Terran and Kragan soldiers are together There aren t any taboos between us and the Kragans No Kankad said We cannot eat each others food and because our bodies are different we cannot be the fathers of each others young But we have been battle comrades and worksharers and we have learned from each other my people more from yours than yours from mine Before you came my people were like children shooting arrows at little animals on the beach and climbing among the rocks at dare me and I do and playing war with toy weapons But we are growing up and it will not be long before we will stand beside you as the grown son stands beside his parent and when that day comes you will not be ashamed of us It was easy to forget that Kankad had four arms and a rubbery quartz speckled skin and a face like a lizard I have always wished that some of your people could come to Terra to study von Schlichten said I was talking about it with Sid Harrington only a short while ago He thinks it would be a good thing for your people and for mine Yes I want Little Me when he s old enough to travel to visit your world Kankad said And some of the other young ones And when Little Me is old enough to take over the rule of our people I would like to go to Terra myself Some day I am going to return to Terra I would like to have you make the trip with me von Schlichten said That would be wonderful Von Kankad exclaimed I want to see your world before I die It must be a wonderful place A world is what its people make it and your people must be able to make anything of your world that you would want We almost made a lifeless desert like the poles of Uller out of our world once von Schlichten told him Four hundred and more years ago we fought great wars among ourselves with weapons such as I hope will never even be thought of on Uller Our whole Northern Hemisphere where our greatest nations were was devastated much of it is wasteland to this day But we put an end to that folly in time we made one nation out of all our people and swore never to commit such crimes again and then we built the ships that took us out to the stars But I want you to see our world and some of the other worlds that we have visited I think you would like it I know I would And with you to tell me what the things I would see meant Kankad was silent for a moment Then he spoke again changing the subject abruptly I hope Paula will pardon me but isn t Paula the kind of Terran that bears young That s right Kankad I never bore any yet but that s the kind of Terran I am I like Paula Kankad said She has come all the way from Terra to help us and to learn about us Of course the Kragans don t need that kind of help and the geeks who would stick a knife in her as soon as she turned her back on them don t deserve it But she wants to learn about us just as I want to learn about Terra Von why don t you and Paula have young he asked I think that would be fine Then Little Paula Von and Little Me could be friends long after the three of us are dead and gone VI The Bad News Came After the Coffee The last clatter of silverware and dishes ceased as the native servants finished clearing the table There was a remaining clatter of cups and saucers liqueur glasses tinkled and an occasional cigarette lighter clicked At the head table the voices seemed louder don t like it a millisol s worth Brigadier General Barney Mordkovitz the Skilk military company was saying to the lady on his right They re too confounded meek Nowadays nobody yells Znidd suddabit at you Nobody sticks all four thumbs in his mouth and waves his fingers Nobody commits nuisance on the sidewalk in front of you They just stand and look at you like a farmer looking at a turkey the week before Christmas and that I don t like Oh bosh Jules Keaveney the Skilk Resident Agent at the head of the table exclaimed You soldiers are all alike begging your pardon General von Schlichten he nodded in the direction of the guest of honor If they don t bow and scrape to you and get off the sidewalk to let you pass you say they re insolent and need a lesson If they do you say they re plotting insurrection What I said Mordkovitz repeated was that I expect a certain amount of disorder and a certain minimum show of hostility toward us from some of these geeks to conform to what I know to be our unpopularity with many of them When I don t find it I want to know why I m inclined von Schlichten came to his subordinate s support to agree This sudden absence of overt hostility is disquieting Colonel Cheng Li he called on the local Intelligence officer and Constabulary chief This fellow Rakkeed was here about a month ago Was there any noticeable disorder at that time Anti Terran demonstrations attacks on Company property or personnel shooting at aircars that sort of thing No more than usual general In fact it was when Rakkeed came here that the condition General Mordkovitz was speaking of began to become conspicuous We did catch some of Rakkeed s disciples trying to get in among the enlisted men of the Tenth N U N I and the Fifth Zirk Cavalry and promote disaffection That was reported at the time sir And acted upon as far as the civil administration would permit von Schlichten replied And I might say that Lieutenant Governor Blount has reported from Keegark where he is now that the same unnatural absence of hostility exists there Well of course general Keaveney said patronizingly King Orgzild has things under pretty tight control at Keegark He d not allow a few fanatics to do anything to prejudice these spaceport negotiations I wonder if the idea back of that spaceport proposition isn t to get us concentrated at Keegark where Orgzild could wipe us all out in one surprise blow somebody down the table suggested Oh Orgzild wouldn t be crazy enough to try anything like that Commander Dirk Prinsloo of the Aldebaran declared He d get away with it for just twelve months the time it would take to get the news to Terra and for a Federation Space Navy task force to get here And then there d be little bits of radioactive geek floating around this system as far out as the orbit of Beta Hydrae VII That s quite true von Schlichten agreed The point is does Orgzild know it I doubt if he even believes there is a Terra Then where in Space does he think we come from Keaveney demanded I believe he thinks Niflheim is our home world von Schlichten replied Or rather the string of orbiters and artificial satellites around Niflheim Where he thinks Niflheim is I wouldn t even try to guess Well it takes six months for a ship to go between here and Nif Prinsloo considered Because of the hyperdrive effects the experienced time of the voyage inside the ship is of the order of three weeks Taking that as the figure he d estimate the distance at about a quarter million miles assuming the velocity as being the speed of one of our contragravity ships here on Uller I m assuming he doesn t even know there is a hyperdrive Yes After he d wiped us out he might even consider the idea of an invasion of Niflheim with captured contragravity ships Hideyoshi O Leary chuckled That would be a big laugh if any of us were alive then to do any laughing You don t really believe that general Keaveney asked His tone was still derisive but under the derision was uncertainty After all von Schlichten had been on Uller for fifteen years to his two Any question of geek psychology is wide open as far as I m concerned the longer I stay here the less I understand it Von Schlichten finished his brandy and got out cigarette case and lighter I have an idea of the sort of garbled reports these spies of his who spend a year on Niflheim as laborers bring back You know the line Rakkeed s been taking of course Colonel Cheng Li put in He as much as says that Niflheim s our home and that the farms where we raise food here and those evergreen plantings on Konk Isthmus and between here and Grank are the beginning of an attempt to drive all native life from this planet and make it over for ourselves And that savage didn t think an idea like that up for himself he got it from somebody like Orgzild the black bearded brigadier general added You know the main base off Niflheim is practically self supporting with hydroponic gardens and animal tissue culture vats And it s enough bigger than one of the City ships to pass for a little world Yes somebody like Orgzild or King Firkked here could easily pick up the idea that that s our home planet But King Kankad was talking about Paula Quinton began We were speaking of geeks not Kragans Von Schlichten lit his cigarette and held his lighter for hers You saw that big Beta Hydrae orrery at Kankad s observatory Well there s quite a little story about that You know it s generally realized by the natives here that Uller is a globe The North Zirks have ridden all the way around it on hipposaur back in the high latitudes and the thalassic peoples at the Equator have sailed all the five equatorial seas and portaged all the isthmuses between But of course Uller is the center of the universe the sun travels around it on a rather complicated double spiral track As a theory it explains most of what they re able to observe and any minor effects that don t conform to it are just ignored They have a model a most ingenious affair run by clockwork at the University of Konkrook to show the apparent movement and position of Beta Hydrae in the sky it does so fairly accurately Well some of our astronomers constructed this orrery and exhibited it to a gathering of the leading native scholars who are also the high priests of the local religion Sort of combined Academy of Arts and Sciences and College of Cardinals They almost were massacred As soon as the assembled pundits saw this thing and grasped its meaning they began geeking and skreeking and yorking and squawking and brandishing knives it was blasphemous and sacrilegious and undermined the Faith and invalidated the whole logic system I was brigadier general in command of Konkrook military district then the post Them M zangwe has now When I got a riot call from the University I hustled around with a company of Kragans and we cleared the hall with the bayonet and ran the reverend professors out onto the campus and after we got things in hand the Kragans crowded around the orrery trying to set it up to show the existing position of the planet relative to the primary and figure out the theory back of it They were very much interested some of them must have sent word home about it because Kankad came in on the next ship wanting to see it He was so much taken with it that Sid Harrington gave it to him It s one of his most cherished possessions but the Konkrook pundits bite all four thumbs and wave their fingers every time they think of it He warmed his coffee from a controlled temperature pot You can t use Kragan thinking on any subject as a criterion of what somebody like Orgzild s opinions will be I never could understand the admiration some of you military people have for those cutthroats Keaveney declared Oh yes I can You like them because they do your dirty work for you He reads Stanley Browne too I ll bet Hideyoshi O Leary said Miss Quinton how did you like your visit to Kankad s Town Still think the Kragans are cultural mongrels Why they re wonderful I never expected anything like it They just seem to have picked up everything they could from us and then gone on from there to develop a culture of their own with our techniques For instance those big guns the ones they call the Ridge Battery that they built for themselves They aren t copies of Terran guns They don t look like our work or give you the feel our work would And that telescope at the observatory she continued Did they build that too Yes all we furnished was a couple of textbooks on lens grinding and telescope design and a book on optics You see when we made that deal with them they realized that we weren t any better fighters than they were we just had better weapons To have the same kind of weapons they d have to learn to make them and once they began studying technology they found that they had to study science Weapon making was the entering wedge after that they found that they could use the same skills to make anything else they wanted Give them another century or so and they ll be one of the great races of the galaxy Yes and it s a good thing they re our friends too Mordkovitz added I m only sorry there are so few of them and so many of the geeks Yes the Company ought to let us stockpile nuclear weapons here just to be on the safe side another officer farther down the table said Well I m not exactly in favor of that von Schlichten replied It s the same principle as not allowing guards who have to go in among the convicts to carry firearms If somebody like Orgzild got hold of a nuclear bomb even a little old First Century H bomb he could use it for a model and construct a hundred like it with all the plutonium we ve been handing out for power reactors And there are too few of us and we re concentrated in too few places to last long if that happened What this planet needs though is a visit by a fifty odd ship task force of the Space Navy just to show the geeks what we have back of us After a show like that there d be a lot less znidd suddabit around here General I deplore that sort of talk Keaveney said I hear too much of this mailed fist and rattling saber stuff from some of the junior officers here without your giving countenance and encouragement to it We re here to earn dividends for the stockholders of the Uller Company and we can only do that by gaining the friendship respect and confidence of the natives mister Keaveney Paula Quinton spoke up I doubt if even you would seriously accuse the Extraterrestrials Rights Association of favoring what you call a mailed fist and rattling saber policy We ve done everything in our power to help these people and if anybody should have their friendship we should Well only five days ago in Konkrook mister Mohammed Ferriera and I were attacked by a mob our native aircar driver was murdered and if it hadn t been for General von Schlichten and his soldiers we d have lost our own lives mister Ferriera is still hospitalized as a result of injuries he received It seems that General von Schlichten and his Kragans aren t trying to get friendship and confidence they re willing to settle for respect in the only way they can get it by hitting harder and quicker than the geeks can Somebody down the table one of the military of course said Hear hear Von Schlichten came as close as a man wearing a monocle can to winking at Paula Good girl he thought she s started playing on the Army team Well of course Keaveney began Then he stopped as a Terran sergeant came up to the table and bent over Barney Mordkovitz shoulder whispering urgently The black bearded brigadier rose immediately taking his belt from the back of his chair and putting it on Motioning the sergeant to accompany him he spoke briefly to Keaveney and then came around the table to where von Schlichten sat the Resident Agent accompanying him Message just came in from Konkrook general he said softly Sid Harrington s dead It took von Schlichten all of a second to grasp what had been said Good God When How Here s all we know sir the sergeant said giving him a radioprint slip Came in ten minutes ago It was an all station priority telecast Governor General Harrington had died suddenly in his room at twenty two ten there were no details He glanced at his watch it was twenty two forty three Konkrook and Skilk were in the same time zone that was fast work He handed the slip to Mordkovitz who gave it to Keaveney You from the telecast station sergeant he asked All right let s go Wait a minute general Keaveney put out a hand to detain him as he took his belt and put it on How about this He gestured nervously with the radioprint slip Get up and make an announcement now von Schlichten told him fastening the buckle and hitching his pistol and survival kit into place It ll be out all over the planet in half an hour Never hold news out unnecessarily He stubbed out his cigarette Come on sergeant As he hurried from the banquet room he could hear Keaveney tapping on his wine glass Everybody please Let me have your attention There has just come in a piece of the most tragic news VII Bismillah How Dumb Can We Get The lights had come on inside the semicircular and now open storm porch of Company House but it was still daylight outside The sky above the mountain to the west was fading from crimson to burnt orange and a couple of the brighter stars were winking into visibility Von Schlichten and the sergeant hurried a hundred yards down the street between low thick walled office buildings to the telecast station next to the Administration Building A woman captain met him just inside the door of the big soundproofed room We have a wavelength open to Konkrook general she said In booth three He nodded Thank you captain We ve all lost a true friend haven t we Another girl a tech sergeant was in the booth on the screen was the image of a third young woman a lieutenant at Konkrook station The sergeant rose and started to leave the booth Stick around sergeant von Schlichten told her I ll want you to take over when I m through He sat down in front of the combination visiscreen and pickup Now lieutenant just what happened he asked How did he die We think it was poison general General M zangwe has ordered autopsy and chemical analysis If you can wait about ten minutes he ll be able to talk to you himself Call him In the meantime give me everything you know Well the governor decided to go to bed early he was going hunting in the morning I suppose you know his usual routine Von Schlichten nodded Harrington would have taken a shower put on his dressing gown and then sat down at his desk lighted his pipe poured a drink of Terran bourbon and begun to write his diary Well at twenty two ten give or take a couple of minutes the Kragan guard sergeant on that floor heard ten pistol shots as fast as they could be fired semi auto in the governor s room The door was locked but he shot it off with his own pistol and went in He found Governor Harrington on the floor wearing only his gown holding an empty pistol He was in convulsions frothing at the mouth in horrible pain Evidently he d fired his pistol which he kept on his desk to call help all the bullets had gone into the ceiling The sergeant punched the emergency button beside the bed and reported then tried to help the governor but it was too late One of the medics got there in five minutes just as he was dying He d written his diary up to noon of today and broken off in the middle of a word There was a bottle and an overturned glass on his desk The Constabulary got there a few minutes later and then Brigadier General M zangwe took charge A white rat given fifteen drops from the whiskey bottle died with the same symptoms in about ninety seconds Who had access to the whiskey bottle A geek servant who takes care of the room He was caught an hour earlier trying to slip off the island without a pass they were holding him at the guardhouse when Governor Harrington died He s now being questioned by the Kragans The girl s face was bleakly remorseless I hope they do plenty to him I hope they don t kill him before he talks Wait a moment general we have General M zangwe now the girl said I ll switch you over The screen broke into a kaleidoscopic jumble of color then cleared the chocolate brown face of Themistocles M zangwe was looking out of it I heard what happened how they found him and about that geek chamber valet being arrested von Schlichten said Did you get anything out of him He s admitted putting poison in the bottle but he claims it was his own idea But he s one of Father Keeluk s parishioners so Keeluk God damn so that was it von Schlichten almost shouted Now I know what he wanted with Stalin and that goat and those rabbits Five thousand miles away in Konkrook Themistocles M zangwe whistled Bismillah How dumb can we get he cried Of course they d need terrestrial animals to find out what would poison a Terran Wait a minute I ll make a note of that to spring on this geek if the Kragans haven t finished him by now Von Schlichten watched M zangwe pick up a stenophone and whisper into it for a moment All right Carlos what else Has Eric been notified We called Keegark but he s in audience with King Orgzild and we can t reach him Well who s in charge at Konkrook now Not much of anybody Laviola the Fiscal Secretary and Hans Meyerstein the Banking Cartel s lawyer and Howlett the Personnel Chief and Buhrmann the Commercial Secretary have made up a sort of quadrumvirate and are trying to run things I don t know what would happen if anything came up suddenly A blue gray uniformed arm with a major s cuff braid came into the screen handing a slip of paper to M zangwe he took it glanced at it and swore Von Schlichten waited until he had read it through Well something has all right the African said We just got a call from Jaikark s Palace a revolt s broken out presumably headed by Gurgurk Household Guards either mutinied or wiped out by the mutineers all but those twenty Kragan Rifles we loaned Jaikark They and about a dozen of Jaikark s courtiers and their personal retainers are holding the approaches to the King s apartments The native lieutenant in charge of the Kragans just radioed in says the situation is desperate When a Kragan says that he means damn near hopeless Is this being recorded When M zangwe nodded he continued All right Use the recording for your authority and take charge I m declaring martial rule at Konkrook as of now twenty two fifty three Tell Eric Blount what s happened and what you ve done as soon as you can get in touch with him I m leaving for Konkrook at once I ought to get in by eight hundred Now as to the trouble at the Palace Don t commit more than one company of Kragans and ten airjeeps and four combat cars and tell them to evacuate Jaikark and his followers and our Kragans to Gongonk Island And alert your whole force These geek palace revolutions are always synchronized with street rioting and this thing seems to have been synchronized with Sid Harrington s death too Get our Kragans out if you can t save anybody else from the Palace but sacrificing thirty or forty men to save twenty is no kind of business And keep sending reports I can pick them up on my car radio as I come down He turned to the girl sergeant Keep on this there ll be more coming in He rose and left the booth If we can pull Jaikark s bacon off the fire he was thinking the Company can dictate its own terms to him afterward if Jaikark s killed we ll have Gurgurk s head off for it and then take over Konkrook In either case it ll be a long step toward getting rid of all these geek despots And with Eric Blount as Governor General The girl captain in charge of the station met him as he came out Poison he told her A geek servant did the job on orders from Gurgurk and possibly Rakkeed Gurgurk s started a putsch against King Jaikark I m going to Konkrook at once Call the military airport and have my command car brought to Company House Harry Quong and Hassan Bogdanoff had been at the banquet too on a world of lizard faced silicate eaters the social difference between a human general and a human aircar driver was almost infinitesimal He d have to talk to Barney Mordkovitz too when word of events at Konkrook got out among the local geeks as it probably had already The inner door of the soundproofed telecast room burst open three men hurried inside and it slammed shut behind them In the brief interval there had been firing audible from outside One of the men had a pistol in his right hand and with his left arm he supported a companion whose shoulder was mangled and dripped blood The third man had a burp gun in his hands All were in civilian dress shorts and light jackets The man with the pistol holstered it and helped his injured companion into a chair The burp gunner advanced into the room looked around saw von Schlichten and addressed him General The geeks turned on us he cried The Tenth North Uller s mutinied they re running wild all over the place They ve taken their barracks and supply buildings and the lorry hangars and the maintenance yard they re headed this way in a mob Some of the Zirk Cavalry s joined them How about the Kragans The Eighteenth Rifles They re with us I saw a party of them firing into the mob I saw some of the Tenth N U N I tossing a dead Kragan on their bayonets Have any ammo left for that burp gun Come on then let s see what it s like at Company House von Schlichten said Captain Malavez you know what to do about defending this station Get busy doing it And have that girl in booth three tell Konkrook what s happened here and say that I won t be coming down as planned just yet He opened the door and the rattle of shots outside became audible again The civilian with the burp gun knew better than to let a general go out first elbowing von Schlichten out of the way he crouched over his weapon and dashed outside Drawing his pistol von Schlichten followed pulling the door shut after him Darkness had fallen while he had been inside now the whole Company Reservation was ablaze with electric lights Somebody at the power plant either the regular staff if they were still holding or the mutineers if they had taken it had thrown on the emergency lights There was a confused mass of gray skinned figures in front of Company House reflected light twinkling on steel over them from the direction of the native troops barracks more natives were coming on the run On the roof of a building across the street two machine guns were already firing into the mob A group of Terrans came running out of a roadway between two buildings from the direction of the repair shops several of them paused to fire behind them with pistols They started toward Company House saw what was going on there and veered darting into the door of the building from which the auto weapons were firing From up the street a hundred odd saurian faced native soldiers were coming at the double bayonets fixed and rifles at high port with them ran several Terrans Motioning his companion to follow von Schlichten ran to meet them falling in beside a Terran captain who ran in front What s the score captain he asked Tenth North Uller and the Fifth Cavalry have mutinied so have these rag tag Auxiliaries That mob down there s part of them He was puffing under the double effort of running and talking Whole thing blew up in seconds no chance to communicate with anybody A Terran woman in black slacks and an orange sweater ran across the street in front of them pursued by a group of enlisted men of the Tenth North Uller Native Infantry all shrieking Znidd suddabit The fugitive ran into a doorway across the street before her pursuers were aware of their danger the Kragans had swept over them There was no shooting the slim cruel bladed bayonets did the work From behind him as he ran von Schlichten could hear Kragan voices in a new cry Znidd geek Znidd geek The mob were swarming up onto the steps and into the semi rotunda of the storm porch There was shooting which told him that some of the humans who had been at the banquet were still alive He wondered half sick how many and whether they could hold out till he could clear the doorway and most of all he found himself thinking of Paula Quinton Skidding to a stop within fifty yards of the mob he flung out his arms crucifix wise to halt the Kragans Behind he could hear the Terrans and native officers shouting commands to form front Give them one clip reload and then give them the bayonet he ordered Shove them off the steps and then clear the porch One clip fire and reload at will somebody passed it on in Kragan The hundred rifles let go all at once and for five seconds they poured a deafening two thousand rounds into the mutineers There was some fire in reply a Zirk corporal narrowly missed him with a pistol he saw the captain s head fly apart when an explosive rifle bullet hit him and half a dozen Kragans went down Reload Set your safeties von Schlichten bellowed Charge Under human officers the North Uller Native Infantry would have stood firm Even under their native officers and sergeants they should not have broken as they did but the best of these had paid for their loyalty to the Company with their lives and the rest had destroyed their authority by revolting against the source from which it was derived At that the Skilkan peasantry who made up the Tenth Infantry and the Zirk cavalrymen tried briefly to fight as individuals shrieking Znidd suddabit until the Kragans were upon them stabbing and shooting They drove the rioters from the steps or killed them there they wiped out those who had gotten into the semicircle of the storm porch The inside doors von Schlichten saw were open but beyond them were Terrans and a dozen or so Kragans Hideyoshi O Leary and Barney Mordkovitz seemed to be in command of these We had about thirty seconds warning Mordkovitz reported and the Kragans in the hall bought us another sixty seconds Of course we all had our pistols Hey These storm doors are wedged somebody discovered Those goddam geek servants Yeah kill any of them you catch somebody else advised If we could have gotten these doors closed The mob driven from the steps was trying to reform and renew the attack From up the street the machine guns silent during the bayonet fight began hammering again The mob surged forward to get out of their fire and were met by a rifle blast and a hedge of bayonets at the steps they surged back and the machine guns flailed them again They started to rush the building from whence the automatic fire came and there was a fusillade and a shriek of Znidd geek from up the street They turned and fled in the direction from whence they had come bullets scourging them from three directions at once For a moment von Schlichten and the three Terrans and eighty odd Kragans who had survived the fight stood on the steps weapons poised seeking more enemies The machine guns up the street stuttered a few short bursts and were silent From behind the beleaguered Terrans and their Kragan guards were emerging He saw Jules Keaveney and his wife Commander Prinsloo of the Aldebaran Harry Quong and Bogdanoff Ah there she was He heaved a breath of relief and waved to her The Kragans were already setting about their after battle chores About twenty of them spread out on guard the others by fours went into the street one covering with his rifle while the other three checked on their own casualties used the short leaf shaped swords they carried to slash off the heads of enemy wounded and collected weapons and ammunition A couple of hundred more Kragans led by Native Major Kormork the company parent of young with King Kankad came up at the double and stopped in front of Company House We were in quarters aboard the Aldebaran and in the guesthouse at the airport Kormork reported We were attacked fifteen minutes ago by a mob We took ten minutes beating them off and five more getting here I sent Native Captain Zeerjeek and the rest of the force to retake the supply depot and the shops and lorry hangars which had been taken and relieve the military airport which is under attack There was still firing from the commercial airport and the smaller military airfield Once there was a string of heavy explosions that sounded like eighty mm rockets Good enough I hope you didn t spread yourself out too thin What s the situation at the commercial airport The two ships the Aldebaran and the freighter Northern Star are both safe Kormork replied I saw them go on contragravity and rise to about a hundred feet Whose crowd is that you have he asked the Terran lieutenant who had taken over command of the first force of Kragans Company six Eighteenth Rifles sir We were on duty at the guardhouse fighting broke out in the direction of the native barracks A couple of runners from Captain Retief of Company four came in with word that he was being attacked by mutineers from the Tenth N U N I but that he was holding them back So Captain Charbonneau who was killed a few minutes ago left a Terran lieutenant and a Kragan native lieutenant and a couple of native sergeants and thirty Kragans to hold the guardhouse and brought the rest of us here Von Schlichten nodded You d pass the military airport and the power plant wouldn t you he asked Yes sir The military airport s holding out and I saw the red and yellow danger lights on the fence around the power plant That meant the power plant was for the time safe somebody d turned twenty thousand volts into the fence All right I m setting up my command post at the telecast station where the communication equipment is He turned to the crowd that had come out onto the porch from inside Where s Colonel Cheng Li Here general The Intelligence and Constabulary officer pushed through the crowd I was on the phone talking to the military airport the commercial airport ordnance depot spaceport ship docks and power plant All answer I m afraid Pop Goode at the city power plant is done for nobody answers there but the TV pickup is still on in the load dispatcher s room and the place is full of geeks Colonel Jarman s coming here with a lorry to get combat car crews he s short handed Port Captain Leavitt has all the native labor at the airport and spaceport herded into a repair dock he s keeping them covered with the forward ninety mm gun of the Northern Star Lorry hangars repair shops and maintenance yards don t answer That s what I was going to ask you Good enough Harry Quong Hassan Bogdanoff His command car crew front and centered I want you to take Colonel O Leary up as soon as my car s brought here Hid you go up and see what s going on Drop flares where there isn t any light And take a look at the native labor camp and the equipment park south of the reservation Kormork you take all your gang and half these soldiers from the Eighteenth here and help clear the native troops barracks And don t bother taking any prisoners we can t spare personnel to guard them Kormork grinned The taking of prisoners had always been one of those irrational Terran customs which no Ulleran regarded with favor or even comprehension VIII Authority of Governor General von Schlichten There was fresh intelligence from Konkrook by the time he returned to the telecast station Mutiny had broken out there among the laborers and native troops who outnumbered the Terrans and their Kragan mercenaries on Gongonk Island by five thousand to five hundred and fifteen hundred respectively The attempt to relieve Jaikark s palace had been called off before the relief force could be sent there was heavy and confused fighting all over the island and most of the combat contragravity and about half the Kragan Rifles had had to be committed to defend the Company farms across the Channel on the mainland south of the city There had also been an urgent call for help from Colonel Rodolfo MacKinnon in command of Company troops at the Keegark Residency and another from the Residency at Kwurk one of the Free Cities on the eastern shore of Takkad Sea He called Keegark a girl apparently one of the civilian telecast technicians answered We must have help General von Schlichten she told him The native troops all but two hundred Kragans have mutinied They have everything here except Company House docks airport everything We re trying to hold out but there are thousands of them Our Takkad Native Infantry soldiers of King Orgzild s army and townspeople They all seem to have firearms What happened to Eric Blount and your Resident Agent mister Lemoyne We don t know They were at the Palace talking to King Orgzild We ve tried to call the Palace but we can t get through general we must have help A call came in a few minutes later from Krink five hundred miles to the northeast across the mountains the Resident Agent there one Francis Xavier Shapiro reported rioting in the city and an attempted palace revolution against King Jonkvank and that the Residency was under attack By way of variety it was the army of King Jonkvank that had mutinied the Sixth North Uller Native Infantry and the two companies of Zirk cavalry at Krink were still loyal along with the Kragans There was a pattern to all this Von Schlichten stood staring at the big map on the wall showing the Takkad Sea area at the Equatorial Zone and the country north of it to the pole the area of Uller occupied by the Company He was almost beginning to discern the underlying logic of the past half hour s events when Keaveney the Skilk Resident blundered into him in a half daze Sorry general didn t see you His face was ashen and his jowls sagged Von Schlichten wondered if there could be another spectacle so woe begone as a back slapping extrovert with the bottom knocked out of him My God it s happening all over Uller Not just here at Skilk everywhere where we have a residency or a trading station Why it s the end of all of us It s not quite that bad mister Keaveney He looked at his watch It was now nearly an hour since the native troops here at Skilk had mutinied Insurrections like this usually succeeded or failed in the first hour It was a little early to be certain but he was beginning to suspect that this one hadn t succeeded If we all do our part we ll come out of it all right he told Keaveney more cheerfully than he felt then turned to ask Brigadier General Mordkovitz how the fighting was going at the native troops barracks Not badly general Colonel Jarman s got some contragravity up and working They blew out all four of the Tenth N U N I s barracks the Tenth and the Zirks are trying to defend the cavalry barracks Some of our Kragans managed to slip around behind the cavalry stables They re leading out hipposaurs and sniping at the rear of the cavalry barracks That ll give us some cavalry of our own a lot of these Kragans are good riders How about the repair shops and maintenance yard and lorry hangars I don t want these geeks getting hold of that equipment and using it against us Kormork s outfit are trying to take back the lorry hangars Jarman s got a couple of airjeeps and a combat car helping them won t be one of us left by this time tomorrow Keaveney was wailing to Paula Quinton and another woman And the Company is finished We d better get him a drink or a cup of coffee general Mordkovitz suggested With a knockout drop in it Colonel Cheng Li the Intelligence officer seemed to have somewhat the same idea He approached Keaveney and tried to quiet him At the same time a woman in black slacks and an orange sweater the one whose pursuers had been overrun by the Kragans at the beginning of the fighting approached von Schlichten General King Kankad s calling she said He s on the screen in booth four Right To avoid any possibility of misunderstanding he slipped his geek speaker into his mouth before entering the booth Kankad s face was looking out of the screen at him with Phil Yamazaki the telecast operator at Kankad s Town standing behind him Von The Kragan spoke almost as though in physical pain What can I do to help I have twenty thousand of my people here who are capable of bearing arms all with firearms but I have transport for only five hundred Where shall I send them Von Schlichten thought quickly Keegark was finished the Residency stood in the middle of the city surrounded by two hundred thousand of King Orgzild s troops and subjects Since Ullerans were bisexual the total population less the senile crippled and very young was the military potential Sending Kankad s five hundred warriors and his meager contragravity there would be the same as shoveling them into a furnace The people at Keegark would have to be written off like the twenty Kragans at Jaikark s palace Send them to Konkrook he decided Them M zangwe s in command there he ll need help to hold the Company farms Maybe he can find additional transport for you I ll call him I ll send off what force I can at once Kankad promised How does it go with you at Skilk We re holding so far he replied Paula is with me here she sends her friendship Captain Inez Malavez the woman officer in charge of the station put her head into the booth General Immediate urgency message from Colonel O Leary she said Native laborers from the mine labor camp are pouring into the mine equipment park Colonel O Leary s used all his rockets and MG ammunition trying to stop them Call you back later von Schlichten told Kankad I ll see what Them M zangwe can do about transport get what force you can started for Konkrook at once He left the booth removing his geek speaker Barney he called General Mordkovitz Who s the ranking officer in direct contact with the Eighteenth Rifles Major Falkenberg That s right Well tell him to get as many of his Kragans as he can spare down to the equipment park He turned to Inez Malavez You call Jarman tell him what O Leary reported and tell him to get cracking on it Tell him not to let those geeks get any of that equipment onto contragravity knock it down as fast as they try to lift out with it And tell him to see what he can do in the way of troop carriers or lorries to get Falkenberg s Rifles to the equipment park How s business at the lorry hangars and maintenance yard Kormork s still working on that the girl captain told him Nothing definite yet In one corner of the big room somebody had thumbtacked a ten foot square map of the Company area to the floor Paula Quinton and missus Jules Keaveney were on their knees beside it pushing out handfuls of little pink and white pills that somebody had brought in two bottles from the dispensary across the road each using a billiard bridge The girl in the orange sweater had a handful of scribbled notes and was telling them where to push the pills There were other objects on the map too pistol cartridges and cigarettes and foil wrapped food concentrate wafers Paula seeing him straightened The pink are ours general she said The white are the geeks Von Schlichten suppressed a grin that was the second time he d heard her use that word this evening The cigarettes are airjeeps the cartridges are combat cars and the wafers are lorries or troop carriers Not exactly regulation map markers but I ve seen stranger things used Captain Malavez Yes sir The girl captain rushing past her hands full of teleprint sheets stopped in mid stride What we need he told her is a big TV screen and a pickup mounted on some sort of a contragravity vehicle at about two to five thousand feet directly overhead to give us an image of the whole area Can do Can try sir We have an eight foot circular screen that ought to do all right for two thousand feet I ll implement that at once Going into a temporarily idle telecast booth he called Konkrook First he spoke to a civilian who chewed a dead cigar and then he got Themistocles M zangwe on the screen How is it now he asked Getting a little better the Graeco African replied Half an hour ago we were shooting geeks out the windows here now we have them contained between the spaceport and the native troops and labor barracks and down the east side of the island to the farms We have the wire around the farms on the island electrified and we re using almost all our combat contragravity to keep the farms on the mainland clear He hesitated for a moment Did you hear about Eric and Lemoyne Von Schlichten shook his head We just got a call from Rodolfo MacKinnon He took a couple of prisoners and made them talk The whole party that were at Orgzild s palace were massacred Some of them were lucky enough to get killed fighting The geeks took Eric and Hendrik alive rolled them in a puddle of thermoconcentrate fuel and set fire to them When we can spare the contragravity we re going to drop something on the Kee geek embassy over in town Well that was what I wanted to call you about contragravity He told M zangwe about King Kankad s offer His crowd ought to be coming in in a couple of hours What can you scrape up to send to Kankad s Town to airlift Kragans in Well we have three hundred and fifty foot gun cutters one ninety mm gun apiece The Elmoran the Gaucho and the Bushranger But they re not much as transports and we need them here pretty badly Then we have five fertilizer and charcoal scows and a lot of heavy transport lorries and two one eighty foot pickup boats How about the Piet Joubert von Schlichten asked She was due in Konkrook from the east about thirteen hundred today wasn t she M zangwe swore She got in all right But the geeks boarded her at the dock within twenty minutes after things started They tried to lift out with her and the Channel Battery shot her down into Konkrook Channel off the Fifty Sixth Street docks Well you couldn t let the geeks have her to use against us What do you hear from the other ships Procyon s at Grank we haven t had any reports of any kind from there which doesn t look so good The Northern Lights is at Grank too The Oom Paul Kruger should have been at Bwork in the east when the gun went off And the Jan Smuts and the Christiaan De Wett were both at Keegark we can assume Orgzild has both of them All right I m sending Aldebaran to Kankad s to pick up more reenforcements for you We can use them And with Aldebaran we ought to be able to take the offensive against the city by this time tomorrow Anything else Not at the moment I ll see about getting Aldebaran sent off now Leaving the booth he heard above the clatter of communications machines and hubbub of voices Jules Keaveney arguing contentiously Evidently Colonel Cheng Li s efforts to drag the Resident out of his despondency had been an excessive success But it s crazy Not just here everywhere on Uller Keaveney was saying How did they do it They have no telecast equipment You have me stopped Jules Mordkovitz was replying I know a lot of rich geeks have receiving sets but no sending sets The pattern that had been tantalizing von Schlichten took visible shape in his mind For a moment he shelved the matter of the Aldebaran They didn t need sending equipment Barney he said They used ours What do you mean Keaveney challenged Look what happened Sid Harrington was poisoned in Konkrook The news of course was sent out at once as the geeks knew it would be to every residency and trading station on Uller and that was the signal they d agreed upon probably months in advance All they had to do was have that geek servant put poison in Harrington s whiskey and we did the rest Well what was our intelligence doing sleeping Keaveney demanded angrily No they were writing reports for your civil administration blokes to stuff in the wastebasket and being called mailed fist and rattling saber alarmists for their pains He turned away from Keaveney Barney where s Dirk Prinsloo Aboard his ship He hitched a ride to the airport with Jarman when he was here picking up air crews Call him Tell him to take the Aldebaran to Kankad s Town at once as soon as he arrives there which ought to be about eleven hundred he s to pick up all the Kragans he can pack aboard and take them to Konkrook From then on he ll be under Them M zangwe s orders To Konkrook Keaveney fairly howled Are you nuts Don t you think we need reenforcements here too Yes I do I m going to try to get them von Schlichten told him Now pipe down and get out of people s way He crossed the room to where two Kragans a male sergeant and the ubiquitous girl in the orange sweater were struggling to get a big circular TV screen up then turned to look at the situation map A girl tech sergeant was keeping Paula Quinton and missus Jules Keaveney informed Start pushing geeks out of the Fifth Zirk Cavalry barracks the sergeant was saying The one at the north end and the one next to it they re both on fire now She tossed a slip into the wastebasket beside her and glanced at the next slip And more pink pills back of the barracks and stables and move them a little to the northwest Kragans as skirmishers to intercept geeks trying to slip away from the cavalry barracks Though why we want to do that I don t know missus Keaveney said pushing out a handful of pink pills with her billiard bridge Let them go and good riddance I never did like this bridge of silver for a fleeing enemy idea Paula Quinton said evicting token mutineers from the two northern barracks There s usually two way traffic on bridges Kill them here and we won t have to worry about keeping them out Of course it was easy to be bloodthirsty about pink pills and white pills Once on a three months reaction drive voyage from Yggdrasill to Loki he had taught a couple of professors of extraterrestrial zoology to play kriegspiel and before the end of the trip he was being horrified by the callous disregard they showed for casualties But little Paula had the right idea dead enemies don t hit back A young Kragan with his lower left arm in a sling and a daub of antiseptic plaster over the back of his head came up and gave him a radioprint slip Guido Karamessinis the Resident Agent at Grank had reported at last The city he said was quiet but King Yoorkerk s troops had seized the Company airport and docks taken the Procyon and the Northern Lights and put guards aboard them and were surrounding the Residency He wanted to know what to do Von Schlichten managed to get him on the screen after a while It looks as though Yoorkerk s trying to play both sides at once he told the Grank Resident If the rebellion s put down he ll come forward as your friend and protector if we re wiped out elsewhere he ll yell Znidd suddabit and swamp you Don t antagonize him we can t afford to fight this war on any more fronts than we are now We ll try to do something to get you unfrozen before long He called Krink again A girl with red gold hair and a dusting of freckles across her nose answered How are you making out he asked So far fine general We re in complete control of the Company area and all our native troops not just the Kragans are with us Jonkvank s pushed the mutineers out of his palace and we re keeping open a couple of streets between there and here We air lifted all our Kragans and half the Sixth N U N I to the Palace and we have the Zirks patrolling the streets on saurback Now we have our lorries and troop carriers out picking up elements of Jonkvank s loyal troops outside town Who s doing the rioting then She named three of Jonkvank s regiments And the city hoodlums and priests from the temples of one sect that followed Rakkeed and Skilkan fifth columnists mister Shapiro can give you the details Shall I call him Never mind He s probably busy he s not as easy on the eyes as you are and you re doing all right How long do you think it d take with the equipment you have to airlift all of Jonkvank s loyal troops into the city Not before this time tomorrow All right Are you in radio communication with Jonkvank now Full telecast audio visual the girl replied Just a minute general He put in his geek speaker The screen exploded into multi colored light then cleared Within a few minutes a saurian Ulleran face was looking out of it at him a harsh lined elderly face with an old scar quartz crusted along one side Your Majesty von Schlichten greeted him Jonkvank pronounced something intended to correspond to von Schlichten s name We have image met under sad circumstances general he said Sad for both of us King Jonkvank we must help one another I am told that your soldiers in Krink have risen against you and that your loyal troops are far from the city Yes That was the work of my War Minister Hurkkurk who was in the pay of King Firkked of Skilk may Jeels devour him alive I have Hurkkurk s head here somewhere if you want to see it but that will not bring my loyal soldiers to Krink any sooner Dead traitors heads do not interest me King Jonkvank von Schlichten replied in what he estimated that the Krinkan king would interpret as a tone of cold blooded cruelty There are too many traitors heads still on traitors shoulders What regiments are loyal to you and where are they now Jonkvank began naming regiments and locating them all at minor provincial towns at least a hundred miles from Krink Hurkkurk did his work well I m afraid you killed him too mercifully von Schlichten said Well I m sending the Northern Star to Krink She can only bring in one regiment at a trip the way they re scattered which one do you want first Jonkvank s mouth until now compressed grimly parted in a gleaming smile He made an exclamation of pleasure which sounded rather like a boy running along a picket fence with a stick Good general Good he cried The first should be the regiment Murderers at Furnk they all have rifles like your soldiers Have them brought to the Great Square at the Palace here And then the regiment Fear Makers at Jeelznidd and the regiment Corpse Reapers at Let that go until the Murderers are in von Schlichten advised They re at Furnk you say I ll send the Northern Star there directly Oh good general I will not soon forget this And as soon as the work is finished here I will send soldiers to help you at Skilk There shall be a great pile of the heads of those who had part in this wickedness both here and there Good Now if you will pardon me I ll go to give the necessary orders As he left the booth he saw Hideyoshi O Leary in front of the situation map and hailed him Harry and Hassan are getting the car re ammoed they dropped me off here Want to come up with us and see the show No I want you to go to Krink as soon as Harry brings the car here again He told O Leary what he intended doing You ll probably have to go around ahead of the Star and alert these regiments And as soon as things stabilize at Krink prod Jonkvank into airlifting troops here You re authorized in my name to promise Jonkvank that he can assume political control at Skilk after we ve stuffed Firkked s head in the dustbin Jules Keaveney who always seemed to be where he wasn t wanted heard that and fairly screamed General von Schlichten That is a political decision You have no authority to make promises like that that is a matter for the Governor General at least Well as of now and until a successor to Sid Harrington can be sent here from Terra I m Governor General von Schlichten told him mentally thanking Keaveney for reminding him of the necessity for such a step Captain Malavez You will send out an all station telecast immediately Military Commander in Chief Carlos von Schlichten being informed of the deaths of both Governor General Harrington and Lieutenant Governor Blount assumes the duties of Governor General as of one today He turned to Keaveney Does that satisfy you he asked No it doesn t You have no authority to assume a civil position of any sort let alone the very highest position Von Schlichten unbuttoned his holster and took out his authority letting Keaveney look into the muzzle of it Here it is he said If you re wise don t make me appeal to it Keaveney shrugged I can t argue with that he said But I don t fancy the Uller Company is going to be impressed by it The Uller Company von Schlichten replied is six and a half parsecs away It takes a ship six months to get from here to Terra and another six months to get back A radio message takes a little over twenty one years each way He holstered the pistol again You were bitching about how we needed reenforcements a while ago Well here s where we have to reverse Clausewitz and use politics as an extension by other means of war That brings up another question general one of Keaveney s subordinates said Can we hold out long enough for help to get here from Terra By the time help could reach us from Terra von Schlichten replied we ll either have this revolt crushed or there won t be a live Terran left on Uller He felt a brief sadistic pleasure as he watched Keaveney s face sag in horror What do you think we ll live on for a year he asked On this planet there s not more than a three months supply of any sort of food a human can eat And the ships that ll be coming in until word of our plight can get to Terra won t bring enough to keep us going We need the farms and livestock and the animal tissue culture plant at Konkrook and the farms at Krink and on the plateau back of Skilk and we need peace and native labor to work them Nobody seemed to have anything to say after that for a while Then Keaveney suggested that the next ship was due in from Niflheim in three months and that it could be used to evacuate all the Terrans on Uller And I ll personally shoot any able bodied Terran who tries to board that ship von Schlichten promised Get this through your heads all of you We are going to break this rebellion and we are going to hold Uller for the Company and the Terran Federation He looked around him Now get back to work all of you he told the group that had formed around him and Keaveney Miss Quinton you just heard me order my adjutant Colonel O Leary on detached duty to Krink I want you to take over for him You ll have rank and authority as colonel for the duration of this war She was thunderstruck But I know absolutely nothing about military matters There must be a hundred people here who are better qualified than I am There are and they all have jobs and I d have to find replacements for them and replacements for the replacements You won t leave any vacancy to be filled And you ll learn fast enough He went over to the situation map again and looked at the arrangement of pink and white pills First of all I want you to call Jarman at the military airport and have an airjeep and driver sent around here for me I m going up and have a look around Barney keep the show going while I m out and tell Colonel Quinton what it s all about IX Don t Push Them Anywhere Put Them Back in the Bottle He looked at his watch and stood for a moment pumping the stale air and tobacco smoke of the telecast station out of his lungs as the light airjeep let down into the street Oh one fifteen two hours and a half since the mutiny at the native troops barracks had broken out The Company reservation was still ablaze with lights and over the roof of the hospital and dispensary and test lab he could see the glare of the burning barracks There was more fire glare to the south in the direction of the mine equipment park and the mine labor camp and from that direction the bulk of the firing was to be heard The driver a young lieutenant who seemed to be of predominantly Malayan and Polynesian blood slid back the duraglass canopy for him to climb in then snapped it into place when he had strapped himself into his seat Can you handle the armament sir he asked Von Schlichten nodded approvingly Not a very flattering question but the boy was right to make sure before they started out I ve done it once or twice he understated Let s go I want a look at what s going on down at the equipment park and the labor camp first They lifted up the driver turning the nose of the airjeep in the direction of the flames and explosions and magnesium lights to the south and tapping his booster button gently The vehicle shot forward and came floating in over the scene of the fighting The situation map at the improvised headquarters had shown a mixture of pink and white pills in the mine equipment park something was going to have to be done about the lag in correcting it for the area was entirely in the hands of loyal Company troops and the mob of laborers and mutinous soldiers had been pushed back into the temporary camp where the workers had been gathered to await transportation to the Arctic As he feared the rioting workers many of whom were trained to handle contragravity equipment had managed to lift up a number of dump trucks and powershovels and bulldozers intending to use them as improvised airtanks but Jarman s combat cars had gotten on the job promptly and all of these had been shot down and were lying in wreckage mostly among the rows of parked mining equipment From the labor camp a surprising volume of fire was being directed against the attack which had already started from the retaken equipment park This was just another evidence of the failure of Intelligence and the Constabulary and consequently of himself to anticipate the brewing storm There was of course practically no chance of keeping Ullerans from having native weapons swords knives even bows and air rifles and a certain number of Volund made trade quality automatic pistols could be expected but most of the fire was coming from military rifles and now and then he could see the furnace like backflash of a recoilless rifle or a bazooka or the steady flicker of a machine gun Even if a few of these weapons had been brought from the barracks by retreating Tenth Infantry or Fifth Cavalry mutineers there were still too many Hovering above the fighting aloof from it he saw six long troop carriers land and disgorge Kragan Rifles who had been released by the liquidation of resistance at the native troops barracks A little later two airtanks floated in and then two more going off contragravity and lumbering on treads to fire their ninety mm rifles At the same time combat cars swooped in banging away with their lighter auto cannon and launching rockets The titanium prefab huts set up to house the laborers and intended to be taken north with them for their stay on the polar desert were simply wiped away Among the wreckage resistance was being blown out like the lights of a candelabrum Push the white pills out girls he thought Don t push them anywhere put them back in the bottle This year there wouldn t be any mining done at the North Pole next year the stockholders ll be bitching about their dividend checks And a lot of new machine operators are going to have to be trained for next year s mining If there is any mining next year He took up the hand phone and called HQ Von Schlichten what s the wavelength of the officer in command at the equipment park A voice at the telecast station furnished it he punched it out Von Schlichten right overhead That you Major Falkenberg Nice going major how are your casualties Not too bad Twenty or thirty Kragans and loyal Skilkans and eight Terrans killed about as many wounded Pretty good considering what you re running into Get many of your Kragans mounted on those hipposaurs About a hundred a lot of saurs got shot while we were leading them out from the stables Well I can see geeks streaming away from the labor camp out the south end going in the direction of the river Use what cavalry you have on them and what contragravity you can spare I ll drop a few flares to show their position and direction Anticipating him the driver turned the airjeep and started toward the dry Hoork River Von Schlichten nodded approval and told him to release flares when over the fugitives Right Falkenberg replied I ll get on it at once general And start moving that mine equipment up into the Company area Some of it we can put into the air the rest we can use to build barricades None of it do we want the geeks getting hold of and the equipment park s outside our practical perimeter I ll send people to help you move it No need to do that sir I have about a hundred and fifty loyal North Ullerans foremen technicians overseers who can handle it All right Use your own judgment Put the stuff back of the native troops barracks and between the power plant and the Company office buildings and anywhere else you can The lieutenant nudged him and pushed a couple of buttons on the dashboard Here go the flares now Immediately a couple of airjeeps pounced in to strafe the fleeing enemy Somebody must have already been issuing orders on another wavelength a number of Kragans riding hipposaurs were galloping into the light of the flares Now let s have a look at the native barracks and the maintenance yards he said And then we ll make a circuit around the Reservation about two or three miles out I m not happy about where Firkked s army is The driver looked at him I ve been worrying about that too sir he said I can t understand why he hasn t jumped us already I know it takes time to get one of these geek armies on the road but He s hoping our native troops and the mine laborers will be able to wipe us out themselves von Schlichten said For the timidity and stupidity of our enemies Allah make us truly thankful amen It s something no commander should depend on but be glad when it happens If Firkked had had a couple of regiments on hand outside the reservation to jump us as soon as the Tenth and the Zirks mutinied he could have swamped us in twenty minutes and we ll all have had our throats cut by now There was nothing going on in the area between the native barracks and the mountains except some sporadic firing as small patrols of Kragans clashed with clumps of fleeing mutineers All the barracks even those of the Rifles were burning the red and yellow danger lights around the power plant and the water works and the explosives magazines were still on Most of the floodlights were still on and there was still some fighting around the maintenance yard It looked as though the survivors of the Tenth N U N I were in a few small pockets which were being squeezed out There was nothing at all going on north of the Reservation the countryside by day a checkerboard of walled fields and small villages was dark except for a dim light here and there where the occupants of some farmhouse had been awakened by the noise of battle The airjeep dropped lower and the driver slid open the window beside him von Schlichten could hear the grunts and snorts and squawks of farm animals similarly aroused Then two miles east of the Reservation he caught a new sound the flowing riverlike murmur of something vast on the move Hear that lieutenant he asked Head for it at about a thousand feet When we re directly above it let go some flares Yes sir The younger man had lowered his voice to a whisper That s geek headed for the Reservation Maybe Firkked s army von Schlichten thought aloud Or maybe a city mob Not quite noisy enough for a mob is it sir A tired mob von Schlichten told him They d start out on a run yelling Znidd Suddabit By the time they got across the bridges to this side of the river they d be winded They d stop for a blow and then they d settle down to steady slogging to save their wind Sometimes a mob like that s worse than a fresh mob They get stubborn they act more deliberately The noises were growing clearer louder He picked up the phone and punched the wavelength of the military airport Von Schlichten my compliments to Colonel Jarman Tell him there s a geek mob or possibly Firkked s regulars on the main highway from Skilk two miles east of the Reservation Get some combat contragravity over here at once We ll light them up for you And tell Colonel Jarman to start flying patrols up and down along the Hoork River this may not be the only gang that s coming out to see us The sounds were directly below now the scuffing of horny soled feet on the dirt road the clink and rattle of slung weapons the clicking and squeeking of Ulleran voices The lieutenant said Here go the flares sir Von Schlichten shut his eyes then opened them slowly The driver upon releasing the flares had nosed up banked turned and was coming in again down the road toward the advancing column Von Schlichten peered into his all armament sight his foot on the machine gun pedal and his fingers on the rocket buttons The highway below was jammed with geeks and they were all stopped dead and staring upward as though hypnotized by the lights A second later they had recovered and were shooting not at the airjeep but at the four globes of blazing magnesium Then he had the close packed mass of non humanity in his sights he tramped the pedal and began punching buttons He still had four rockets left by the time the mob was behind him All right let s take another pass at them Same direction The driver put the airjeep into a quick loop and came out of it in front of the mob who now had their backs turned and were staring in the direction in which they had last seen the vehicle Again von Schlichten plowed them with rockets and harrowed them with his guns Some of the Skilkans were trying to get over the high fences on either side of the road really stockades of petrified tree trunks Others were firing and this time they were shooting at the airjeep It took one hit from a heavy shellosaur rifle and immediately the driver banked and turned away from the road Dammit why did you do that von Schlichten demanded lifting his foot from the gun pedal Are you afraid of the kind of popguns those geeks are using I am not afraid to risk my vehicle or myself sir the lieutenant replied with the extreme formality of a very junior officer chewing out a very senior one I am however afraid to risk my passenger Generals are not expendable sir neither are they issued for use as clay pigeons He was right of course Von Schlichten admitted it I m too old to play cowboy like this he said Back to the Reservation telecast station Looking back over his shoulder he saw eight or ten more flares alight and the ground flashes of exploding shells and rockets the air above the road was sparkling with gun flames Jarman must have had some contragravity ready to be sent off on the instant While he had been out somebody had gotten a TV pickup mounted on a contragravity lifter and run up to two thousand feet on the end of a steel tough tensilon mooring line The big circular screen was lit showing the whole Company Reservation with the surrounding countryside foreshortened by perspective to the distant lights of Skilk The map had been taken up from the floor and a big terrain board had been brought in from the Chief Engineer s office and set up in its place In front of the screen Paula Quinton Barney Mordkovitz Colonel Cheng Li and conspicuously silent Jules Keaveney sat drinking coffee and munching sandwiches Half a dozen Terrans of both sexes were working furiously to get the markers which replaced the pink and white pills placed on the board and one of Captain Inez Malavez s non coms with a headset was getting combat reports directly from the switchboard Everything was clicking like well oiled machinery On the TV screen the Residency area was ablaze with light and so were the ship docks the airport and spaceport the shops and the maintenance yard On the terrain board the latter was now marked as completely in Company hands The ruins of the native troops barracks were still burning and there was a twinkle of orange red here and there among the ruins of the labor camp Much of the equipment for the polar mines had already been shifted into defensible ground The rest of the circle was dark except for the distant lights of Skilk where the nuclear power plant was apparently still functioning in native hands Then without warning a spot of white light blazed into being southeast of the Company area and southwest of Skilk followed by another and another Instantly von Schlichten glanced up at the row of smaller screens and on one of them saw the view as picked up by a patrolling airjeep The army of King Firkked of Skilk had finally put in its appearance coming in two columns one southward from Skilk and the other northward along the west bank of the dry river The former had crossed over and joined the latter about three miles south of the Reservation The scene in the screen was similar to the one he had himself witnessed through his armament sight The Skilkan regulars had been marching in formation some on the road and some along parallel lanes and paths They had the look of trained and disciplined troops but they had made the same mistake as the rabble that had been shot up on the north side of the Reservation Unused to attack from the air they had all halted in place and were gaping open mouthed their opal teeth gleaming in the white flare light However before the aircar had passed over them the lead company of one regiment armed with Terran rifles had begun firing In the big screen it could be seen that Colonel Jarman had thrown most of his available contragravity at them including the combat cars that had already started to form the second wave of the attack on the mob to the north Other flares bloomed in the darkness and the fiery trails of rockets curved downward to end in yellow flashes on the ground The airjeep with the pickup circled back the troops on the road and in the adjoining fields had broken The former were caught between the fences which made Ulleran roads such death traps when under air attack The latter had dispersed and were running away individually and by squads at first it looked like a panic but he could see officers signaling to the larger groups of fugitives to open out apparently directing the flight By this time there were ten or twelve combat cars and about twenty airjeeps at work In the moving view from the pickup jeep he saw what looked like a ninety mm rocket land in the middle of a company that was still trying to defend itself with small arms fire on the road wiping out about half of them Make the most of it boys Barney Mordkovitz his mouth full of sandwich was saying Heave it to them you won t get another chance like that at those buggers Why not Colonel Paula Quinton wanted to know Her military education was progressing but it still had a few gaps to fill in The next time they re air struck they won t stay bunched Mordkovitz replied A lot of them didn t stay bunched this time if you noticed And they ll keep out from between the fences In the large screen a quick succession of gun flashes leaped up from the direction of the Hoork River and shells began bursting over the scene of the attack The screen tuned to the pickup on the airjeep went dead in the big screen there was a twinkling of falling fire Almost at once thirty or forty rocket trails converged on the gun position and for a moment explosions burned like a bonfire They had a seventy five mm at the rear of the column somebody called from the big switchboard Lieutenant Kalanang s jeep was hit Lieutenant Vermaas is cutting in his pickup on the same wavelength The small screen lighted again In the big screen a cluster of magnesium lights appeared above where the Skilkan gun had been in the small screen there was a stubbled grain field pocked with craters and the bodies of fifteen or twenty natives all rather badly mangled An overturned and apparently destroyed seventy five mm gun lay on its side Five or six fairly large fires had broken out by this time around the point of attack Von Schlichten nodded approvingly I was wondering how long it d take somebody to think of that he said Granaries and forage stacks on some of these farms They ll burn for half an hour at least He looked at his watch And by that time it ll be daylight As far as we know that was the only seventy five mm gun Firkked had Colonel Cheng Li said He has at least six possibly ten forty mm s It s a wonder we haven t seen anything of them Well there s no way of being sure Jules Keaveney said but I have an idea they re all at or around the Palace Firkked knows about how much contragravity we have He s probably wondering why we aren t bombing him now He doesn t know we ve sold the Palace to King Jonkvank for an army von Schlichten said And that reminds me how much contragravity could Firkked scrape together for an attack on us I ve been expecting a geek Luftwaffe over here at any moment Colonel Cheng Li studied the smoking tip of his cigarette for a moment Well Firkked owns personally three ten passenger aircars a thing like a troop carrier that he transports some of his courtiers around in four airjeeps armed with a pair of fifteen mm machine guns apiece and two big lorries There are possibly two hundred vehicles of all types in Skilk and the country around but some of them are in the hands of natives friendly to us and or hostile to Firkked I can get the exact figures from the Constabulary office at Company House That s close enough von Schlichten told him And there ll be oodles of thermoconcentrate fuel and blasting explosives Colonel Quinton suppose you call Ed Wallingsby the Chief Engineer right away have him commissioned colonel Tell him to get to work making this place secure against air attack tell him to consult with Colonel Jarman Tell him to get those geeks Leavitt has penned in the repair dock at the airport and use them to dig slit trenches and fill sandbags and so on He can use Kragan limited duty wounded to guard them mister Keaveney you ll begin setting up something in the way of an ARP organization You ll have to get along on what nobody else wants You will also consult with Colonel Jarman and with Colonel Wallingsby Better get started on it now Just think of everything around here that could go wrong in case of an air attack and try to do something about it in advance X The Geek Luftwaffe and the Kragan Airlift At two hundred forty five an attack developed on the northwestern corner of the Reservation in the direction of the explosives magazines It turned out to be relatively trivial Remnants of the mob that had been broken up by air attack on the road had gotten together and were making rushes in small bands keeping well spread out Beating them off took considerable ammunition but it was accomplished with negligible casualties to the defenders They finally stopped coming around daylight In the meantime Themistocles M zangwe called from Konkrook appearing in the screen with his left arm in a freshly white sling What the hell have you been doing to yourself von Schlichten wanted to know Crossbow bolt about half an hour ago A couple of inches lower and acting Brigadier General Colbert d have been talking to you now instead of me Lucky it didn t have a nitro capsule on the end How are you making out Have Kankad s people started coming in yet Oh yes about six hundred of them have gotten in already in the damnedest collection of vehicles you ever saw Kankad must be using every scrap of contragravity he has it s a regular airborne Dunkirk in reverse Kankad sent word that he s coming here in person as soon as he has things organized at his place And the geeks here have scraped together an air force of their own farm lorries aircars that sort of thing and they re using them to bomb us here and at the mainland farm mostly with nitroglycerine We ve shot down about twenty of them but they re still coming They tried a boat attack across the Channel that s how I got this We ve been doing some bombing ourselves we made a down payment for Eric Blount and Hendrik Lemoyne Took a fifty ton tank off a fuel lorry fitted it with a detonator filled it with thermoconcentrate and ferried it over on the Elmoran and dumped it on the Keegarkan Embassy It must have landed in the middle of the central court in about fifteen seconds flames were coming out every window in the place His face became less jovial We had something pretty bad happen here too he said That Konkrook Fencibles rabble of Prince Jaizerd s mutinied along with the others they got into the hospital and butchered everybody in the place patients and staff The Kragans got there too late to save anybody but they wiped out the Fencibles Jaizerd himself was the only one they took alive and he didn t stay that way very long How are you making out with your Civil Administration crowd M zangwe grimaced I haven t had to put any of them under actual arrest so far but we ve had to keep Buhrmann away from the communications equipment by force He wanted to call you up and chew you out for not evacuating everybody in the north to Konkrook Is he crazy No just scared He says you re going to get everybody on Uller massacred by detail when you could save Konkrook by bringing them all here You tell him I m going to hold this planet not just one city Tell him I have a sense of my duty to the Company and its stockholders if he hasn t put it in those terms and he may understand you Yes I ll try that out on Meyerstein too He s in a hell of a state about the losses the Banking Cartel are taking on this deal Well I ll call you when there s anything new By three hundred thirty it was daylight the attacks against the northwest corner of the perimeter stopped entirely Wallingsby had the three hundred odd Skilkan laborers at work he had gathered up all the tarpaulin he could find and had the two sewing machines in the tentmaker s shop running on sandbags Jules Keaveney to von Schlichten s agreeable surprise had taken hold of his ARP assignment and was doing an efficient job in organizing for fire fighting damage control and first aid Colonel Jarman had his airjeeps and combat cars working in ever widening circles over the countryside shooting up everything in sight that even looked like contragravity equipment Some of these patrols had to be recalled around ten thirty when sporadic nuisance sniping began from the side of the mountain to the west And along with everything else Paula Quinton managed along with her other work to get a complete digest prepared of the situation elsewhere in the Terran occupied parts of the planet The situation at Konkrook was brightening steadily The second wave of Kankad s improvised airlift reenforced by contragravity from Konkrook had come in there were now close to two thousand fresh Kragans on Gongonk Island and the mainland farms Kankad himself with them The Aldebaran had reached Kankad s Town and was loading another thousand Kragans There was nothing more from Keegark A message from Colonel MacKinnon had come in at dawn to the effect that the geeks had penetrated his last defenses and that he was about to blow up the Residency thereafter Keegark went off the air By seven hundred thirty the Northern Star had landed the regiment Murderers armed with first quality Terran infantry rifles and a few machine guns and bazookas at the Palace at Krink and by eight hundred forty five she had returned with another regiment the Jeel Feeders The three lane street connecting the Palace and the Residency had been widened to six and then to eight Guido Karamessinis at Grank was still at uneasy peace with King Yoorkerk who was still undecided whether the rebels or the Company were going to be the eventual victors and afraid to take any irrevocable step in either direction Eight men and four women the survivors of a trading station on the eastern shore of Takkad Sea reached Konkrook in a lorry another trading station on the south shore reported by telecast that the natives there had refused to rise against them and had crucified five of Rakkeed s disciples who had come among them preaching znidd suddabit At eleven hundred Paula Quinton and Barney Mordkovitz virtually ordered him to get some sleep He went to his quarters at Company House downed a spaceship captain s size drink of honey rum and slept until sixteen hundred As he dressed and shaved he could hear through the open window the slow sputter of small arms fire punctuated by the occasional whump whump whump of forty mm auto cannon or the hammering of a machine gun Returning to his command post at the telecast station the terrain board showed that the perimeter of defense had been pushed out in a bulge at the northwest corner the TV screen pictured a crude breast work of petrified tree trunks sandbags mining machinery packing cases and odds and ends upon which Wallingsby s native laborers were working under guard while a skirmish line of Kragans had been thrown out another four or five hundred yards and were exchanging pot shots with Skilkans on the gullied hillside Where s Colonel Quinton he asked She ought to be taking a turn in the sack now She s taking one Major Falkenberg who had commanded the action at the native troops barracks and the labor camp the night before told him General Mordkovitz chased her off to bed a couple of hours ago called me in to take her place and then went out to replace me Colonel Guilliford s in the hospital got hit about thirteen hundred They re afraid he s going to lose a leg That s a bloody shame He pointed to the northwest corner of the perimeter on the screen Whose idea was that he asked It s a good one I ought to have thought of it myself Your new adjutant Falkenberg grinned She asked somebody what those big domes up there were When they told her there were ten thousand tons of thermoconcentrate five thousand tons of blasting explosives and five tons of plutonium under them she damned near fainted and then she ordered that right away More reports came in The entire garrison of the small Residency at Kwurk the most northern of the eastern shore Free Cities had arrived at Kankad s Town in two hundred foot contragravity scows and five aircars Two of the aircars arrived half an hour behind the rest of the refugee flotilla having turned off at Keegark to pay their respects to King Orgzild They reported the Keegark Residency in ruins its central buildings vanished in a huge crater the Jan Smuts and the Christiaan De Wett were still in the Company docks both apparently damaged by the blast which had destroyed the Residency One of the aircars had rocketed and machine gunned some Keegarkans who appeared to be trying to repair them the other blew up King Orgzild s nitroglycerine plant Von Schlichten called Konkrook and ordered a bombing mission against Keegark organized to make sure the two ships stayed out of service The Northern Star was still bringing loyal troops into Krink King Jonkvank whom von Schlichten called was highly elated We are killing traitors wherever we find them he exulted The city is yellow with their blood their heads are piled everywhere How is it with you at Skilk We have killed many also von Schlichten boasted And tonight we will kill more we are preparing bombs of great destruction which we will rain down upon Skilk until there is not one stone left upon another or one infant of a day s age left alive Jonkvank reacted as he was intended to Oh no general don t do all that he exclaimed You promised me that I should have Skilk on the word of a Terran Are you going to give me a city of ruins and corpses Ruins are no good to anybody and I am not a Jeel to eat corpses Von Schlichten shrugged When you are strong you can flog your enemies with a whip when you are weak all you can do is kill them If I had five thousand more troops here Oh I will send troops as soon as I can Jonkvank hastened to promise All my best regiments the Murderers the Jeel Feeders the Corpse Reapers the Devastators the Fear Makers But now that we have stopped this sinful rebellion here I can t take chances that it will break out again as soon as I strip the city of troops Von Schlichten nodded Jonkvank s argument made sense he would have taken a similar position himself Well get as many as you can over here as soon as possible he said We ll try to do as little damage to Skilk as we can but At eighteen thirty Paula joined him for her breakfast while he sat in front of the big screen eating his dinner There had been light ground action along the southern end of the perimeter King Firkked s regulars reenforced by Zirk tribesmen and levies of townspeople all of whom seemed to have firearms were filtering in through the ruins of the labor camp and the wreckage of the equipment park and there was renewed sniping from the mountainside The long afternoon of the northern autumn dragged on finally at twenty two hundred the sun set and it was not fully dark for another hour For some time there was an ominous quiet and then at thirty the enemy began attacking in force driving herds of livestock lumbering six legged brutes bred by the North Ullerans for food to test the defenses for electrified wire and land mines Most of these were shot down or blown up but a few got as far as the wire which by now had been strung and electrified completely around the perimeter Behind them came parties of Skilkan regulars with long handled insulated cutters a couple of cuts were made in the wire and a section of it went dead The line at this point had been rather thinly held the defenders immediately called for air support and Jarman ordered fifteen of his remaining twenty airjeeps and five combat cars into the fight No sooner were they committed than the radar on the commercial airport control tower picked up air vehicles approaching from the north and the air raid sirens began howling and the searchlights went on As a protection from the sudden fury of the summer and winter gales the buildings were all low thick walled and provided with steel doors and window shutters which were electrically operated and centrally controlled These slammed shut in every occupied building The contragravity which had been sent to support the ground defense at the south side of the Reservation turned to meet this new threat and everything else available including the four heavy airtanks lifted up Meanwhile guns began firing from the ground and from rooftops There had been four aircars ordinary passenger vehicles equipped with machine guns on improvised mounts and ten big lorries converted into bombers in the attack All the lorries and all but one of the makeshift fighter escort were shot down but not before explosive and thermoconcentrate bombs were dumped all over the place One lorry emptied its load of thermoconcentrate bombs on the control building at the airport starting a raging fire and putting the radar out of commission A repair shop at the ordnance depot was set on fire and a quantity of small arms and machine gun ammunition piled outside for transportation to the outer defenses blew up An explosive bomb landed on the roof of the building between Company House and the telecast station blowing a hole in the roof and demolishing the upper floor And another load of thermoconcentrate missing the power plant set fire to the dry grass between it and the ruins of the native troops barracks Before the air attack had been broken up the soldiers of King Firkked and their irregular supporters were swarming through the dead section of wire They had four or five big farm tractors nuclear powered but unequipped with contragravity generators which they were using like ground tanks of the First Century This attack penetrated to the middle of the Reservation before it was stopped and the attackers either killed or driven out for the first time since daybreak the red and yellow lights came on around the power plant As soon as the combined air and ground attack was beaten off von Schlichten ordered all his available contragravity up flying patrols around the Reservation and retaliatory bombing missions against Skilk and began bombarding the city with his ninety mm guns A number of fires broke out and at about two hundred a huge expanding globe of orange red flame soared up from the city There goes Firkked s thermoconcentrate stock he said to Paula who was standing beside him in front of the screen Half an hour later he discovered that he had been overly optimistic Much of the enemy s supply of Terran thermoconcentrate had been destroyed but enough remained to pelt the Reservation and the Company buildings with incendiaries when a second and more severe air attack developed consisting of forty or fifty makeshift lorry bombers and fifteen aircars The previous attack von Schlichten had viewed in the screen at the telecast station it was his questionable good fortune to observe the second one directly having been out inspecting the defenses around the ordnance depot at the time Like the first the second air attack was beaten off or more exactly down Most of the enemy contragravity was destroyed at least two dozen vehicles crashed inside the Reservation As in the first instance there was a simultaneous ground attack from the southern side with a demonstration attack at the north end For a while von Schlichten found himself fighting hand to hand first with his pistol and then when his ammunition was gone with a picked up rifle and bayonet It was full daylight before the last of the attackers was either killed or driven out Five minutes later while he was reloading his pistol clips with salvaged cartridges the Northern Star came bulking over the mountains from the west XI Of Princedoms Which Have Been Won by Conquest Holstering his pistol he raced for the telecast station to receive a call from a Colonel Khalid ib n Talal a Zanzibar Arab aboard the approaching ship I ve one of Jonkvank s regiments the Jeel Feeders armed with Terran nine mm rifles and a few bazookas I have a company of our Zirks with their mounts and a battalion of the Sixth N U N I I also have four ninety mm guns Terran manned he reported What s the situation general and where do you want me to land Von Schlichten described the situation succinctly in an ancient and unprintable military cliche Try landing south of the Reservation a little west of the ruins of the labor camp he advised The bulk of Firkked s army is in that section and I want them run out as soon as possible We ll give you all the contragravity and fire support we can The Northern Star let down slowly firing her guns and dropping bombs as she descended rifle fire spurted from all her lower deck portholes There was cheering human and Ulleran from inside the battered defense perimeter combat cars airjeeps and improvised bombers lifted out to strafe the Skilkans on the ground and the four airtanks moved out to take position and open fire with their ninety mm s helping to flush King Firkked s regulars and auxiliaries out of the gullies and ruins and drive them south along the mountain away from where the ship would land and also away from the city of Skilk The Northern Star set down quickly and troops and artillery began to be unloaded joining in the fighting It was five hundred miles to Krink three hours after lifting out the Northern Star was back again with two more of King Jonkvank s infantry regiments and by thirteen hundred when the fourth load arrived from Krink the fighting was entirely on the eastern bank of the dry Hoork River This last contingent of reenforcements was landed in the eastern suburbs of Skilk and began fighting their way into the city from the rear It was evident however that the pacification of Skilk would not be accomplished as rapidly as von Schlichten wished street fighting against a determined enemy is notoriously slow work and he decided to risk the Northern Star in an attack against the Palace itself and over the objections of Paula Quinton Jules Keaveney and Barney Mordkovitz to lead the attack in person Inside the city he found that the Zirk cavalry from Krink had thrust up one of the broader streets to within a thousand yards of the Palace and supported by infantry contragravity and a couple of airtanks were pounding and hacking at a mass of Skilkans whose uniform lack of costume prevented distinguishing between soldiery and townsfolk Very few of these he observed seemed to be using firearms with his glasses he could see them shooting with long northern air rifles and a few Takkad Sea crossbows Either weapon would shoot clear through a Terran or half way through an Ulleran at fifty yards but at over two hundred they were almost harmless There were a few fires still burning from the bombardment of the night before Ulleran and particularly North Ulleran cities did not burn well and the blaze which had consumed the bulk of Firkked s stock of thermoconcentrate fuel had long ago burned out leaving an area of six or eight blocks blackened and lifeless The ship let down while the six combat cars which had accompanied her buzzed the Palace roof strafing it to keep it clear and the Kragans aboard fired with their rifles She came to rest on seven eighths weight reduction and even before the gangplanks were run out the Kragans were dropping to the flat roof running to stairhead penthouses and tossing grenades into them The taking of the Palace was a gruesome business Knowing exactly how much mercy they would have shown had they been storming the Residency Firkked s soldiers and courtiers fought desperately and had to be exterminated floor by floor room by room hallway by hallway There was some attempt at escape from the ground floor as von Schlichten and his Kragans fought their way down from above but the Northern Star and her escort of combat cars and airjeeps bombed and machine gunned and rocketed the fugitives from above and the loyal Zirk cavalry bursting through the mob came up shooting and lancing By this time an aircar fitted with a sound amplifier was circling overhead while a loyal native officer of the Sixth N U N I shouted offers of quarter and orders to the troops to spare any who surrendered Driving down from above von Schlichten and his Kragans slithered over floors increasingly greasy with yellow Ulleran blood He had picked up a broadsword at the foot of the first stairway down a little later he tossed it aside in favor of another better balanced and with a better guard There was a furious battle at the doorways of the throne room finally climbing over the bodies of their own dead and the enemy s they were inside Here there was no question of quarter whatever at least as long as Firkked lived North Ulleran nobles did not surrender under the eyes of their king and North Ulleran kings did not surrender their thrones alive There was also a tradition of which von Schlichten was mindful that a king must only be killed by his conqueror in personal combat with steel With a wedge of Kragan bayonets around him and the picked up broadsword in his hand he fought his way to the throne where Firkked waited a sword in one of his upper hands his Spear of State in the other and a dagger in each lower hand With his left hand von Schlichten detached the bayonet from the rifle of one of his followers and went forward trying not to think of the absurdity of a man of the Sixth Century A E the representative of a civilized Chartered Company dueling to the death with swords with a barbarian king for a throne he had promised to another barbarian or of what could happen on Uller if he allowed this four armed monstrosity to kill him It was not as bad as it looked however The ornate Spear of State in spite of its long cruel looking blade was not an especially good combat weapon at least for one hand and Firkked seemed confused by the very abundance of his armament After a few slashes and jabs von Schlichten knocked the unwieldy thing from his opponent s hand This raised a fearful ululation from the Skilkan nobility who had stopped fighting to watch the duel evidently it was the very worst sort of a bad omen Firkked seemingly relieved to be disencumbered of the thing caught his sword in both hands and aimed a roundhouse swing at von Schlichten s head von Schlichten dodged crippled one of Firkked s lower hands with a quick slash and lunged at the royal belly Firkked used his remaining dagger to parry backed a step closer to his throne and took another swing with his sword which von Schlichten parried on the bayonet in his left hand Then backing he slashed at the inside of Firkked s leg with the thousand year old coup de Jarnac Firkked unable to support the weight of his dense tissued body on one leg stumbled von Schlichten ran him neatly through the breast with his sword and through the throat with the bayonet There was silence in the throne room for an instant and then with a horrible collective shriek the Skilkans threw down their weapons One of von Schlichten s Kragans slung his rifle and picked up the Spear of State with all four hands taking his post ceremoniously behind the victor A couple of others dragged the body of Firkked to the edge of the dais and one of them drew his leaf shaped short sword and beheaded it At mid afternoon von Schlichten was on the roof of the Palace holding the Spear of State with Firkked s head impaled on the point while a Terran technician aimed an audio visual recorder This he said with the geek speaker in his mouth is King Firkked s Spear of State and here upon it is King Firkked s head Two days ago Firkked was at peace with the Company and Firkked was King in Skilk If he had not dared raise his feeble hand against the might of the Uller Company he would still be alive and his Spear would still be borne behind him So must all those who rise against the Company perish Cut The camera stopped A Kragan came forward and took the Spear of State with its grisly burden carrying it to a nearby wall and leaning it up like a piece of stage property no longer required for this scene but needed for the next Von Schlichten took out his geek speaker wiped and pouched it and took his cigarette case from his pocket Well this is the limit Paula Quinton who had come up during the filming of the scene exploded I thought you had to kill him yourself in order to encourage your soldiers I didn t think you wanted to make a movie of it to show your friends I m through you can find yourself a new adjutant Von Schlichten tapped the cigarette on the gold and platinum case and stared at her through his monocle You can t resign he told her Resignations of officers are not being accepted until the end of hostilities In any case I shouldn t care to have you go you re the best adjutant Hideyoshi O Leary not excepted I ever had Sit down colonel He lit the cigarette Your politico military education still needs a little filling in At Grank we have two ships One is the Northern Lights sister ship of the Northern Star The other is the cruiser Procyon the only real warship on Uller with a main battery of four two hundred mm guns How King Yoorkerk was able to get control of those ships I don t know but there will be a board of inquiry and maybe a couple of courts martial when things get stabilized to a point where we can afford such luxuries As it is we need those ships desperately and as soon as he gets in I m sending Hideyoshi O Leary to Grank with the Northern Star and a load of Kragan Rifles to pry them loose The audio visual of which this is the last scene is going to be one of the crowbars he s going to use Oh I get it Her eyes widened with pleasure at having finally caught on she accepted the cigarette and the light von Schlichten offered Good old nervenkrieg Yes A little idea I adapted from my Nazi ancestors of four hundred and fifty years ago Hideyoshi s going to treat King Yoorkerk to a movie show Want to bet he won t loosen up and release Procyon and Northern Lights and unblockade the Grank Residency after he sees that shot of Firkked s head leering at him off the point of that overgrown asagai As I said that s only the last scene too I ve been having scenes shot all through this fight some of them are really horrifying But why did you have to fight Firkked yourself she asked You took an awful chance with two hands to his four Not so awful remember what I told you about the physical limitations of Ullerans But I had to kill him myself with a sword according to local custom that makes me King of Skilk Why your Majesty She rose and curtsied mockingly But I thought you were going to make Jonkvank King of Skilk He shook his head Just Viceroy he corrected I m handing the Spear of State down to him not up to him he ll reign as my vassal and consequently as vassal of the Company and before long he won t be much more at Krink either That ll take a little longer there ll have to be military missions and economic missions and trade agreements and all the rest of it first but he s on the way to becoming a puppet prince Half an hour later a large and excessively ornate air launch specially built at the Konkrook shipyards for King Jonkvank was sighted coming over the mountain from the east An escort of combat cars was sent to meet it and a battalion of Kragans and the survivors of Firkked s court were drawn up on the Palace roof His Majesty Jonkvank King of Krink the former herald of King Firkked s court now herald to King Carlos von Schlichten shouted banging on a brass shield with the flat of his sword as Jonkvank descended from his launch attended by a group of his nobles and his Spear of State with Hideyoshi O Leary and Francis N Shapiro shepherding them As the guests advanced across the roof the herald banged again on his shield His Majesty Carlos von Schlichten which came out more or less as Karlok vonk Zlikdenk King by right of combat of Skilk Von Schlichten advanced to meet his fellow monarch his own Spear of State with Firkked s head still grinning from it two paces behind him Jonkvank stopped his face contorted with saurian rage What is this he demanded You told me that I could be King of Skilk is this how a Terran keeps his word A Terran s word is always good Jonkvank von Schlichten replied omitting the titles as was proper in one sovereign addressing another My word was that you should reign in Skilk and my word stands But these things must be done decently according to custom and law I killed Firkked in single combat Had I not done so the Spear of Skilk would have been left lying for any of the young of Firkked to pick up Is that not the law Jonkvank nodded grudgingly It is the law he admitted Good Now since I killed Firkked in lawful manner his Spear is mine and what is mine I can give as I please I now give you the Spear of Skilk to carry in my name as I promised The Kragan who was carrying the ceremonial weapon tossed the head of Firkked from the point another Kragan kicked it aside and advanced to wipe the spear blade with a rag Von Schlichten took the Spear and gave it to Jonkvank This is not good one of the Skilkan nobles protested He had a better right than any of the others to protest he had a few hours before ridden in at the head of a company of his retainers to swear loyalty to the Company That you should rule over us yes You killed Firkked in single combat and you are the soldier of the Company which is mighty as all here have seen But that this foreigner be given the Spear of Skilk that is not good Some of the others emboldened by his example were jabbering agreement Listen all of you von Schlichten shouted Here is no question of Krink ruling over Skilk Does it matter who holds the Spear of Skilk when he does so in my name And King Jonkvank will be no foreigner He will come and live among you and later he will travel back and forth between Krink and Skilk and he will leave the Spear of Krink in Krink and the Spear of Skilk in Skilk and in Skilk he will be a Skilkan That seemed to satisfy everybody except Jonkvank and he had wit enough not to make an issue of it He even had the Spear of Krink carried back aboard his launch out of sight and when he accompanied von Schlichten an hour later to see Hideyoshi O Leary off for Grank he had the Spear of Skilk carried behind him When he was alone with von Schlichten in the room that had been King Firkked s bedchamber however he exploded What is all this foolishness which you promised these people in my name and which I must now carry out That I am to leave the Spear of Skilk in Skilk and the Spear of Krink in Krink and come here to live You wish to hold Skilk von Schlichten asked I intend to hold Skilk To begin with there shall be a great killing here A very great killing of all those who advised that fool of a Firkked to start this business of those who gave shelter to the false prophet Rakkeed when he was here of the faithless priests who gave ear to his abominable heresies and allowed him to spew out his blasphemies in the temples of those who sent spies to Krink to corrupt and pervert my soldiers and nobles of those who All that is as it should be von Schlichten agreed Except that it must be done quickly and all at once before the memories of these crimes fade from the minds of the people And great care must be taken to kill only those who can be proven to be guilty of something thus it will be said that the justice of King Jonkvank is terrible to evildoers but a protection and a shield to those who keep the peace and obey the laws Thus you will gain the name of being a wise and just king And when the priests are to be killed it should be done under the direction of those other priests who were faithful to the gods and whom King Firkked drove out of their temples and it must be done in the name of the gods Thus will you be esteemed a pious and not an impious king As to why you must be a Skilkan in Skilk you heard the words of Flurknurk and how the others agreed with him It must not be allowed to seem that the city has come under foreign rule And you must not change the laws unless the people petition you to do so nor must you increase the taxes and you must not confiscate the estates of those who are put to death for the death of parents is always forgiven before the loss of patrimonies And you should select certain Skilkan nobles and become the father of their young and above all you must leave none of the young of Firkked alive to raise rebellion against you later Jonkvank nodded deeply impressed By the gods Karlok vonk Zlikdenk this is wisdom Now it is to be seen why the likes of Firkked cannot prevail against you or against the Company as long as you are the Company s upper sword arm Honesty tempted von Schlichten for a moment to disclaim originality for the principles he had just enunciated even at the price of trying to pronounce the name of Niccolo Machiavelli with a geek speaker On second thought however considerations of policy restrained him If Jonkvank ever heard of The Prince nothing would satisfy him short of an Ulleran translation and von Schlichten would have been just about as happy over an Ulleran translation of a complete set of Bethe cycle bomb specifications XII The Shadow of Niflheim The sun slid lower and lower toward the horizon behind them as the aircar bulleted south along the broad valley and dry bed of the Hoork River nearing the zone of equal day and night Hassan Bogdanoff drove while Harry Quong finished his lunch then changed places to begin his own Von Schlichten got two bottles of beer from the refrigerated section of the lunch hamper and opened one for Paula Quinton and one for himself What are we going to do with these geeks she was using the nasty and derogatory word unconsciously and by custom now after this is all over We can t just tell them Jolly well played nice game wasn t it and go back to where we were Wednesday evening No we can t There s going to have to be a Terran seizure of political power in every part of this planet that we occupy and as soon as we re consolidated around and north of Takkad Sea we re going to have to move in elsewhere he replied Keegark Konkrook and the Free Cities of course will be relatively easy They re in arms against us now and we can take them over by force We had to make that deal with Jonkvank or rather I did so that will be a slower process but we ll get it done in time If I know that pair as well as I think I do Jonkvank and Yoorkerk will give us plenty of pretexts before long Then we can start giving them government by law instead of by royal decree and real courts of justice put an end to the head payment system and to these arbitrary mass arrests and tax delinquency imprisonments that are nothing but slave raids by the geek princes on their own people And gradually abolish serfdom In a couple of centuries this planet will be fit to admit to the Federation like Odin and Freya Well won t that depend a lot on whom the Company sends here to take Harrington s place Unless I m much mistaken the Company will confirm me he replied Administration on Uller is going to be a military matter for a long time to come and even the Banking Cartel and the mercantile interests in the Company are going to realize that and see the necessity for taking political control The Federation Government owns a bigger interest in the Company than the public realizes too they ve always favored it And just to make sure I m sending Hid O Leary to Terra on the next ship to make a full report on the situation You think it ll be cleared up by then The City of Montevideo is due in from Niflheim in a little under three months It ll have to be cleared up by then We can t keep this war going more than a month at the present rate Police action and mopping up yes full scale war no Ammunition she asked He looked at her in pleased surprise Your education has been progressing at that he said You know a lot of professional officers even up to field rank in the combat branches seem to think that ammo comes down miraculously from Heaven in contragravity lorries every time they pray into a radio for it It doesn t it has to be produced as fast as it s expended and we haven t been doing that So we ll have to lick these geeks before it runs out because we can t lick them with gunbutts and bayonets Well how about nuclear weapons Paula asked I hate to suggest it I know what they did on Mimir and Fenris and Midgard and what they did on Terra during the First Century But it may be our only chance He finished his beer and shoved the bottle into the waste receiver then got out his cigarettes I d hate to have to make a decision like that Paula he told her The military use of nuclear energy is the last well the next to last thing I d want to see on Uller Fortunately or unfortunately it s a decision I won t have to make There isn t a single nuclear bomb on the planet The Company s always refused to allow them to be manufactured or stockpiled here I don t think there d be any criticism of your making them now general And there s certainly plenty of plutonium You could make A bombs at least There isn t anybody here who even knows how to make one Most of our nuclear engineers could work one up in about three months when we d either not need one or not be alive doctor Gomes who came in on the Pretoria two weeks ago can make them she contradicted He built at least a dozen of them on Niflheim to use in activating volcanoes and bringing ore bearing lava to the surface Von Schlichten s hand bringing his lighter to the tip of his cigarette paused for a second Then he completed the operation snapped it shut and put it away When did all this happen She took time out for mental arithmetic even a spaceship officer had to do that when a question of interstellar time relations arose About three fifty days ago Galactic Standard They d put off the first shot six bombs before I got in from Terra I saw the second shot a day or so before I left Niflheim on the Canberra doctor Gomes had to stay over till the Pretoria to put off the third shot Why Did you run into a geek named Gorkrink while you were on Nif he asked her And what sort of work was he doing Gorkrink I don t seem to remember Oh yes He was helping doctor Murillo the seismologist His year was up after the second shot he came to Uller on the Canberra doctor Murillo was sorry to lose him He understood Lingua Terra perfectly doctor Murillo could talk to him the way you do with Kankad without using a geek speaker Well but what sort of work Helping set and fire the A bombs Oh Good Lord You can say that again and deal in Allah Shiva and Kali von Schlichten told her Especially Kali Harry See if you can get some more speed out of this can I want to get to Konkrook while it s still there It was full dark when Konkrook came in view beyond the East Konk Mountains a lurid smear on the underside of the clouds and at Gongonk Island and at the Company farms to the south a couple of bunches of searchlights fingering about in the sky When von Schlichten turned on the outside sound pickup he could hear the distant tom tomming of heavy guns and the crash of shells and bombs Keeping the car high enough to be above the trajectories of incoming shells Harry Quong circled over the city while Hassan Bogdanoff talked to Gongonk Island on the radio The city was in a bad way There were seventy five to a hundred big fires going and a new one started in a rising ball of thermoconcentrate flame while they watched The three gun cutters Elmoran Gaucho and Bushranger and about fifty big freight lorries converted to bombers were shuttling back and forth between the island and the city The Royal Palace was on fire from end to end and the entire waterfront and industrial district were in flames Combat cars and airjeeps were diving in to shell and rocket and machine gun streets and buildings He saw six big bomber lorries move in dignified procession to unload one after the other on a row of buildings along what the Terrans called South Tenth Street and on the roofs of buildings a block away red and blue flares were burning and he could see figures both human and Ulleran setting up mortars and machine guns Landing on the top stage of Company House on the island they were met by a Terran whom von Schlichten had seen a few days ago bossing native labor at the spaceport but who was now wearing a major s insignia He greeted von Schlichten with a salute which he must have learned from some movie about the ancient French Foreign Legion Von Schlichten seriously returned it in kind Everybody s down in the Governor General s office sir he said Your office that is King Kankad s here with us too He accompanied them to the elevator then turned to a telephone when von Schlichten and Paula reached the office everybody was crowded at the door to greet them Themistocles M zangwe his arm in a sling Hans Meyerstein the Johannesburg lawyer who seemed to have even more Bantu blood than the brigadier general Morton Buhrmann the Commercial Superintendent Laviola the Fiscal Secretary a dozen or so other officers and civil administrators There was a hubbub of greetings and he was pleased to detect as much real warmth from the civil administration crowd as from the officers Well I m glad to be back with you he replied generally And let me present Colonel Paula Quinton my new adjutant Hid O Leary s on duty in the north Them this was a perfectly splendid piece of work here you can take this not only as a personal congratulation but as a sort of unit citation for the whole crowd You ve all behaved simply above praise He turned to King Kankad who was wearing a pair of automatics in shoulder holsters for his upper hands and another pair in cross body belt holsters for his lower And what I ve said for anybody else goes double for you Kankad he added clapping the Kragan on the shoulder All he did was save the lot of us M zangwe said We were hanging on by our fingernails here till his people started coming in And then after you sent the Aldebaran Where is the Aldebaran by the way I didn t see her when I came in Based on Kankad s flying bombardment against Keegark and keeping an eye out for those ships Prinsloo caught the De Wett in the docks there and smashed her but the Jan Smuts got away and we haven t been able to locate the Oom Paul Kruger either They re probably both on the Eastern Shore gathering up reenforcements for Orgzild M zangwe said Our ability to move troops rapidly is what s kept us on top this long and Orgzild s had plenty of time to realize it von Schlichten said When we get Procyon down here I m going to send her out with a screen of light scout vehicles to find those ships and get rid of them How s Hid been making out at Grank by the way I didn t have my car radio on coming down That touched off another hubbub Haven t you heard general Oh my God this is simply out of this continuum Well tell him somebody No get Hid on the screen it s his story Somebody busied himself at the switchboard The rest of them sat down at the long conference table Laviola and Meyerstein and Buhrmann were especially obsequious in seating von Schlichten in Sid Harrington s old chair and in getting a chair for Paula Quinton After a while the jumbled colors on the big screen resolved themselves into an image of Hideyoshi O Leary grinning like a pussy cat beside an empty goldfish bowl Well what happened von Schlichten asked after they had exchanged greetings How did Yoorkerk like the movies And did you get the Procyon and the Northern Lights loose Yoorkerk was deeply impressed O Leary replied His story is that he is and always was the true and ever loving friend of the Company he acted to prevent quote certain disloyal elements unquote from harming the people and property of the Company Procyon s on the way to Konkrook I m holding Northern Lights here and Northern Star at Skilk where do you want them sent Leave Northern Star at Skilk for the time being Tell the Company s great and good friend King Yoorkerk that the Company expects him to contribute some soldiers for the campaign here and against Keegark when that starts be sure you get the best armed and best trained regiments he has and get them down here as soon as possible Don t send any of your Kragans or Karamessinis troops here though hold them in Grank till we make sure of the quality of Yoorkerk s friendship Well general I think we can be pretty sure now You see he turned Rakkeed the Prophet over to me What Von Schlichten felt his monocle starting to slip and took a firmer grip on it Who Pay me Them he didn t drop it Hideyoshi O Leary said Why Rakkeed the Prophet Yoorkerk was holding our ships and our people in case we lost he was also holding Rakkeed at the Palace in case we won Of course Rakkeed thought he was an honored guest right up till Yoorkerk s guards dragged him in and turned him over to us That geek von Schlichten said is too smart for his own good Some of these days he s going to play both ends against the middle and both ends ll fold in on him and smash him A suspicion occurred to him You sure this is Rakkeed It would be just like Yoorkerk to try to sell us a ringer O Leary shook his head solemnly I thought of that right away This is the real article Karamessinis Constabulary and Intelligence officers certified him for me What do you want me to do send him down to Konkrook Von Schlichten shook his head Get the priests of the locally venerated gods to put him on trial for blasphemy heresy impersonating a prophet practicing witchcraft without a license or any other ecclesiastical crimes you or they can think of Then after he s been given a scrupulously fair trial have the soldiers of King Yoorkerk behead him and stick his head up over a big sign in all native languages Rakkeed the False Prophet And have audio visuals made of the whole business trial and execution and be sure that the priests and Yoorkerk s officers are in the foreground and our people stay out of the pictures Soap and towels for General Pontius von Pilate Paula Quinton called out That s an idea I was wondering what to give Yoorkerk as a testimonial present Hideyoshi O Leary said A nice thirty piece silver set Quite appropriate von Schlichten approved Well you did a first class job I want you back with us as soon as possible incidentally you re now a brigadier general but not till the situation at Grank Krink Skilk is stabilized And eventually you ll probably have to set up permanent headquarters in the north After Hideyoshi O Leary had thanked him and signed off and the screen was dark again he turned to the others Well gentlemen I don t think we need worry too much about the north for the next few days How long do you estimate this operation against Konkrook s going to take to complete pacification Them How complete is complete pacification general Themistocles M zangwe wanted to know If you mean to the end of organized resistance by larger than squad size groups I d say three days give or take twelve hours Of course there ll be small groups holding out for a couple of weeks particularly in the farming country and back in the forest We can forget them that s minor tactics stuff We ll need to keep some kind of an occupation force here for some time they can deal with that We ll have to get to work on Keegark as soon as possible after we ve reduced Keegark we ll be able to reorganize for a campaign against the Free Cities on the Eastern Shore Begging your pardon general but reduce is a mild word for what we ought to do to Keegark Hans Meyerstein said We ought to raze that city as flat as a football field and then play football on it with King Orgzild s head Any special reason von Schlichten asked In addition to the Blount Lemoyne massacre that is I should say so general Themistocles M zangwe backed Meyerstein up Bob you tell him Colonel Robert Grinell the Intelligence officer got up and took the cigar out of his mouth He was short and round bodied and bald headed but he was old Terran Federation Regular Army Well general we ve been finding out quite a bit about the genesis of this business lately he said From up north it probably looked like an all Rakkeed show that s how it was supposed to look But the whole thing was hatched at Keegark by King Orgzild We ve managed to capture a few prominent Konkrookans he named half a dozen who ve been made to talk and a number of others have come in voluntarily and furnished information Orgzild conceived the scheme in the beginning Rakkeed was just the messenger boy My face gets the color of the Company trademark every time I think that the whole thing was planned for over a year right under our noses even to the signal that was to touch the whole thing off The poisoning of Sid Harrington and our announcement of his death von Schlichten asked You figured that out yourself sir Well that was it Grinell went on to elaborate while von Schlichten tried to keep the impatience out of his face Beside him Paula Quinton was fidgeting too she was thinking as he was of what King Orgzild and Prince Gorkrink were doing now And I know positively that the order for the poisoning of Sid Harrington came from the Keegarkan Embassy here and was passed down through Gurgurk and Keeluk to this geek here who actually put the poison in the whiskey Yes I agree that Keegark should be wiped out and I d like to have an immediate estimate on the time it ll take to build a nuclear bomb to do the job One of the old fashioned plutonium fission A bombs will do quite well Everybody turned quickly There was a momentary silence and then Colonel Evan Colbert of the Fourth Kragan Rifles the senior officer under Themistocles M zangwe found his voice If that s an order general we ll get it done But I d like to remind you first of the Company policy on nuclear weapons on this planet I m aware of that policy I m also aware of the reason for it We ve been compelled because of the lack of natural fuel on Uller to set up nuclear power reactors and furnish large quantities of plutonium to the geeks to fuel them The Company doesn t want the natives here learning of the possibility of using nuclear energy for destructive purposes Well gentlemen that s a dead issue They ve learned it thanks to our people on Niflheim and unless my estimate is entirely wrong King Orgzild already has at least one First Century Nagasaki type plutonium bomb I am inclined to believe that he had at least one such bomb probably more at the time when orders were sent to his embassy here for the poisoning of Governor General Harrington With that he selected a cigarette from his case offered it to Paula and snapped his lighter She had hers lit and he was puffing on his own when the others finally realized what he had told them That s impossible somebody down the table shouted as though that would make it so Another one of the civil administration crowd almost exactly repeated Jules Keaveney s words at Skilk What the hell was Intelligence doing sleeping General von Schlichten Colonel Grinell took oblique cognizance of the question you ve just made by implication a most grave charge against my department If you re not mistaken in what you ve just said I deserve to be court martialed I couldn t bring charges against you colonel if it were a court martial matter I d belong in the dock with you von Schlichten told him It seems though that a piece of vital information was possessed by those who were unable to evaluate it and until this afternoon I was ignorant of its existence Colonel Quinton suppose you repeat what you told me on the way down from Skilk Well general don t you think we ought to have doctor Gomes do that Paula asked After all he constructed those bombs on Niflheim and it ll be he who ll have to build ours That s right He looked around Where s doctor Lourenco Gomes the nuclear engineer who came in on the Pretoria two weeks ago Send out for him and get him in here at once There was another awkward silence Then Kent Pickering the chief of the Gongonk Island power plant cleared his throat Why general didn t you know doctor Gomes is dead He was killed during the first half hour of the uprising XIII A Bag of Tricks We Don t Have He flinched inwardly and tightened his eye muscles on the edge of the monocle to keep from flinching physically as well trying to freeze out of his face the consternation he felt That s bad Kent he said Very bad I d been counting heavily on doctor Gomes to design a bomb of our own Well general if you please That was Air Commodore Leslie Hargreaves You say you suspect that King Orgzild has developed a nuclear bomb If that s true it s a horrible danger to all of us But I find it hard to believe that the Keegarkans could have done so with their resources and at their technological level Now if it had been the Kragans that would have been different but Paula you d better carry on and explain what you told me and add anything else you can think of that might be relevant Is that sound recorder turned on Then turn it on somebody we want this taped Paula rose and began talking I suppose you all understand what conditions are on Niflheim and how these Ulleran native workers are employed however I d better begin by explaining the purpose for which these nuclear bombs were designed and used He smiled she realized that he needed time to think and she was stalling to provide it He drew a pencil and pad toward him and began doodling in a bored manner deliberately closing his mind to what she was saying There were two assumptions he considered first that King Orgzild already possessed a nuclear bomb which he could use when he chose and second that in the absence of doctor Gomes such a bomb could only be produced on Gongonk Island after lengthy experimental work If both of these assumptions were true he had just heard the death sentence of every Terran on Uller The first he did not for a moment doubt The reasons for making it were too good He dismissed it from further consideration and concentrated on the second what s known as a Nagasaki type bomb the first type of plutonium bomb developed Paula was saying Really it s a technological antique but it was good enough for the purpose and doctor Gomes could build it with locally available materials That was the crux of it The plutonium bomb from a military standpoint was as obsolete as the flintlock musket had been at the time of the Second World War He reviewed quickly the history of weapons development since the beginning of the Atomic Era The emphasis since the end of the Second World War had all been on nuclear weapons and rocket missiles There had been the H bomb itself obsolescent and the Bethe cyle bomb and the subneutron bomb and the omega ray bomb and the nega matter bomb and then the end of civilization in the Northern Hemisphere and the rise of the new civilization in South America and South Africa and Australia Today the small arms and artillery his troops were using were merely slight refinements on the weapons of the First Century and all the modern nuclear weapons used by the Terran Federation were produced at the Space Navy base on Mars by a small force of experts whose skills were almost as closed to the general scientific and technical world as the secrets of a medieval guild The old A bomb was an historical curiosity and there was nobody on Uller who had more than a layman s knowledge of the intricate technology of modern nuclear weapons There were plenty of good nuclear power engineers on Gongonk Island but how long would it take them to design and build a plutonium bomb also has a good understanding of Lingua Terra Paula was saying He and doctor Murillo conversed bilingually just as I ve heard General von Schlichten and King Kankad talking to one another I haven t any idea whether or not Gorkrink could read Lingua Terra or if so what papers or plans he might have seen Just a minute Paula he said Colonel Grinell what does your branch have on this Gorkrink He s the son of King Orgzild and the daughter of Prince Jurnkonk Grinell said We knew he d signed on for Nif two years ago but the story we got was that he d fallen out of favor at court and had been exiled I can see now that that was planted to mislead us As to whether or not he can read Lingua Terra my belief is that he can We know that he can understand it when spoken He could have learned to read at one of those schools Mohammed Ferriera set up ten or fifteen years ago And doctor Gomes and doctor Murillo and doctor Livesey left papers and plans lying around all over the place Paula added If he went to Niflheim as a spy he could have copied almost anything Well there you have it von Schlichten said When Gorkrink found out that plutonium can be used for bombs he began gathering all the information he could And as soon as he got home he turned it all over to Pappy Orgzild That still doesn t mean that the Kee geeks were able to do anything with it Air Commodore Hargreaves argued I think it does von Schlichten differed As soon as Orgzild would hear about the possibility of making a plutonium bomb he d set up an A bomb project and don t think of it in terms of the old First Century Manhattan Project There would be no problem of producing fissionables we ve been scattering refined plutonium over this planet like confetti Well an A bomb s a pretty complicated piece of mechanism even if you have the plans for it Kent Pickering said As I recall there have to be several subcritical masses of plutonium or U two hundred thirty five or whatever blown together by shaped charges of explosive all of which have to be fired simultaneously That would mean a lot of electrical fittings that I can t see these geeks making by hand I can Paula said Have you ever seen the work these native jewelers do And didn t you tell me about a clockwork thing they have at the university here to show the apparent movements of the sun That s right von Schlichten said And what they couldn t make they could have bought from us we ve sold them a lot of electrical equipment All right they could have built an A bomb Buhrmann said But did they We assume they tried to Gorkrink got back from Nif on the Canberra three months ago von Schlichten said If Orgzild decided to build an A bomb he wouldn t give the signal for this uprising until he either had one or knew he couldn t make one and he wouldn t give up trying in only three months Therefore I think we can assume that he succeeded and had succeeded at the time he sent Gorkrink here to get that four tons of plutonium we let him have and incidentally to tell Ghroghrank to pass the word to have Sid Harrington poisoned according to plan Then why didn t he just use it on us at the start of the uprising Meyerstein wanted to know Why should he Getting rid of us is only the first step in Orgzild s plan Grinell said Back as far as geek history goes the Kings of Keegark have been trying to conquer Konkrook and the Free Cities and make themselves masters of the whole Takkad Sea area Let Konkrook wipe us out and then he can move in his troops and take Konkrook Or if we beat off the geeks here as we seem to be doing he can bomb us out and then move in on Konkrook I think that as long as we re fighting here he ll wait The more damage we do to Konkrook the easier it ll be for him Then we d better start dragging our feet on the Konkrook front Laviola said And get busy trying to build a bomb of our own Von Schlichten looked up at the big screen on which the battle of Konkrook was being projected from an overhead pickup I ll agree on the second half of it von Schlichten said And we ll also have to set up some kind of security patrol system against bombers from Keegark And as soon as Procyon gets here we ll have to send her out to hunt down and destroy those two Boer class freighters the Jan Smuts and the Kruger And we ll have to arrange for protection of Kankad s Town that s sure to be another of Orgzild s high priority targets As to the action against Konkrook I ll rely on your advice Them Can we delay the fall of the city for any length of time M zangwe shook his head When we divert contragravity to security patrol work the ground action ll slow up a little of course But the geeks are about knocked out now The hell with it then I doubt if we d be able to buy much time from Orgzild by delaying victory in the city and we ll probably need the troops as workers over here He turned to Pickering doctor Pickering what sort of a crew can you scrape together to design a bomb for us he asked Well there s Martirano and Sternberg and Howard Fu Chung and Piet van Reenen and He nodded to himself I can get six or eight of them in here in about twenty minutes I ll have a project set up and working in a couple of hours There has to be somebody qualified on duty at the plant all the time of course but All right call them in I want the bomb finished by yesterday afternoon And everybody with you and you yourself had better revert to civilian status This isn t something you can do by the numbers and I don t want anybody who doesn t know what it s all about pulling rank on your outfit Go ahead call in your gang and let me know what you ll be able to do as soon as possible He turned to Hargreaves Les you ll have charge of flying the security patrols and doing anything else you can to keep Orgzild from bombing us before we can bomb him You ll have priority on everything second only to Pickering Hargreaves nodded As you say general we ll have to protect Kankad s as well as this place It s about five hundred miles from here to Kankad s and eight fifty miles from Kankad s to Keegark He stopped talking to von Schlichten and began muttering to himself running over the names of ships and the speeds and pay load capacities of airboats and distances In about five minutes he would have a programme worked out in the meantime von Schlichten could only be patient and contain himself He looked along the table and caught sight of a thin faced saturnine looking man in a green shirt with a colonel s three concentric circles marked on the shoulders in silver paint Emmett Pearson the communications chief Emmett he said those orbiters you have strung around this planet two thousand miles out for telecast rebroadcast stations How much of a crew could be put on one of them Pearson laughed Crew of what general White mice or trained cockroaches There isn t room inside one of those things for anything bigger to move around Well I know they re automatic but how do you service them From the outside They re only ten feet through by about twenty in length with a fifteen foot ball at either end and everything s in sections which can be taken out Our maintenance gang goes up in a thing like a small spaceship and either works on the outside in spacesuits or puts in a new section and brings the unserviceable one down here to the shops Ah and what sort of a thing is this small spaceship now A thing like a pair of fifty ton lorries with airlocks between and connected at the middle airtight of course and pressurized and insulated like a spaceship One side s living quarters for a six man crew sometimes the gang s out for as long as a week at a time and the other side s a workshop That sounded interesting With contragravity of course terms like escape velocity and mass ratio were of purely antiquarian interest How long he asked Pearson would it take to fit that vehicle with a full set of detection instruments radar infrared and ultra violet vision electron telescope heat and radiation detectors the whole works and spot it about a hundred to a hundred and fifty miles above Keegark That I couldn t say general Emmett Pearson replied It d have to be a shipyard job and a lot of that stuff s clear outside my department Ask Air Commodore Hargreaves Les he called out Wake up Les Just a second general Hargreaves scribbled frantically on his pad Now he said raising his head What is it sir Emmett here has a junior grade spaceship that he uses to service those orbital telecast relay stations of his He ll tell you what it s like I want it fitted with every sort of detection device that can be crammed into or onto it and spotted above Keegark It should of course be high enough to cover not only the Keegark area but Konkrook Kankad s and the lower Hoork and Konk river valleys Yes I get it Hargreaves snatched up a phone punched out a combination and began talking rapidly into it in a low voice After a while he hung up All right mister Pearson Colonel Pearson I mean Have your space buggy sent around to the shipyard My boys ll fix it up He made a note on another piece of paper If we live through this I m going to have a couple of supra atmosphere ships in service on this planet Now general I have a tentative setup We re going to need the Elmoran for patrol work south and east of Konkrook and the Gaucho and Bushranger to the north and northeast based on Kankad s We ll keep the Aldebaran at Kankad s and use her for emergencies And we ll have patrols of light contragravity like this He handed a map with red pencil and blue pencil markings along to von Schlichten Red are Kankad based blue are Konkrook based That looks all right von Schlichten said There s another thing though We want scout vehicles to cover the Keegark area with radiation detectors These geeks are quite well aware of radiation danger from fissionables but they re accustomed to the ordinary industrial power reactors which are either very lightly shielded or unshielded on top We want to find out where Orgzild s bomb plant is Yes general as soon as we can get radiation detectors sent out to Kankad s we ll have a couple of fast aircars fitted with them for that job We have detectors at our laboratory and reaction plant Kankad said And my people can make more as soon as you want them He thought for a moment Perhaps I should go to the town now I could be of more use there than here Kent Pickering who had been talking with his experts at a table apart returned We ve set up a programme general he said It s going to be a lot harder than I d anticipated None of us seem to know exactly what we have to do in building one of those things You see the uranium or plutonium fission bomb s been obsolete for over four hundred years It was a classified secret matter long after its obsolescence because it hadn t been rendered any the less deadly by being superseded there was that A bomb that the Christian Anarchist Party put together at Buenos Aires in three hundred seventy eight A E for instance And then after it was declassified it had been so far superseded that it was of only antiquarian interest the textbooks dealt with it only in general terms The principles of course are part of basic nuclear science the secret of the A bomb was just a bag of engineering tricks that we don t have and which we will have to rediscover Design of tampers design of the chemical explosive charges to bring subcritical masses together case design detonating mechanism things like that The complete data on even the old Hiroshima and Nagasaki types is still in existence of course You can get it at places like the University of Montevideo Library or Jan Smuts Memorial Library at Cape Town But we don t have it here We re detailing a couple of junior technicians to make a search of the library here on Gongonk Island but we re not optimistic We just can t afford to pass up any chance even when it approaches zero probability Von Schlichten nodded That s about what I d expected he said I suppose Gomes got his data out of one of the dustier storage stacks at Jan Smuts or Montevideo in the first place Well I still want that bomb finished by yesterday afternoon but since that s impractical you ll have to take a little but as little as possible longer What are we going to do about publicity on this Howlett the personnel man asked We don t want this getting out in garbled form though how it could be made worse by garbling I couldn t guess and having the troops watching the sky over their shoulders and going into a panic as soon as they saw something they didn t understand No we don t I ve seen a couple of troop panics von Schlichten said There can t be anything much worse than a panic I think the Terrans ought to be told the worst Hargreaves said And told that our only hope is to get a bomb of our own built and dropped first As to the Kragans What do you think King Kankad Tell them that we are building a bomb to destroy Keegark that we are running short of ammunition and that it is our only hope of finishing the war before the ammunition is gone Kankad said Tell them something of what sort of a bomb it is But do not tell them that King Orgzild already has such a bomb Old Kankad who made me out of himself told me about how our people fled in panic from the weapons of the Terrans when your people and mine were still enemies This thing is to the weapons they faced then as those weapons were to the old Kragans spears and bows And when the geeks from Grank come here tell them that we are winning and that if they fight well they can share the loot of Konkrook and Keegark Von Schlichten looked up at the big screen Already Themistocles M zangwe had ordered the Channel Battery to reduce fire the big guns were firing singly in thirty second interval salvos There was less bombing too contragravity was being drawn out of the battle Well we all have things to do he said and I think we ve discussed everything there is to discuss Anybody think of anything we ve forgotten Then we re adjourned He and Paula Quinton took the elevator to the roof and sat side by side silently watching the conflagration that was raging across the channel and the nearer flashes of the big guns along the island s city side Wednesday night I thought we were all cooked Paula told him Cleaning up the north in two days seemed like an impossibility too Maybe you ll do it again If I pull this one out of the fire I won t be a general I ll be a magician he said Pickering ll be a magician I mean he s the boy who ll save our bacon if it s saveable He looked somberly across the flame reflecting water Let s not kid ourselves we re just kicking and biting at the guards on the way up the gallows steps Well why stop till the trap s sprung she asked What ll happen to these people on this planet after we re atomized That I don t want to think about Kankad s Town will get the second bomb Orgzild won t dare leave the Kragans after he s wiped us out Yoorkerk and Jonkvank in the north will turn on Keaveney and Shapiro and Karamessinis and Hid O Leary and wipe them out And when the next ship gets in here and they find out what happened they ll send the Federation Space Navy and this planet ll get it worse than Fenris did They ll blast anything that has four arms and a face like a lizard Half a dozen aircars lifted suddenly from the airport and streaked away to the northeast As they went past in the light of the burning city he could see that at least three of them had multiple rocket launchers on top In a matter of seconds a gun cutter raced after them and a second which had been over Konkrook jettisoned a bomb and turned away to follow Maybe that s it Paula said Well if it is we won t be any better off anywhere else than here he told her Let s stay and watch After what seemed like a long time however a twinkle of lights showed over the East Konk Mountains They weren t the flashes of explosions some were magnesium flares and some were the lights of a ship That s Procyon from Grank he said Everybody gets a good mark for this detection stations interceptors gun cutters If that had been it there d have been a good chance of stopping it He felt better than he had since Pickering had told him that Lourenco Gomes was dead It s a good thing Gorkrink didn t pick up any dope on guided missiles while he was at it As long as they have to deliver it with contragravity we have a chance They rose from the balustrade where they had been sitting and for the first time he discovered that he had had his left arm over her shoulder and that she had had her right hand resting on the point of his right hip just above his pistol He picked up the folder of papers she had been carrying and put her into the elevator ahead of him and it was only when they parted on the living quarters level that he recalled having followed the older protocol of gallantry rather than the precedence of military rank XIV The Reviewers Panned Hell Out of It He woke with a guilty start and looked up at the clock on the ceiling it was nine hundred forty five Kicking himself free of the covers he slid his feet to the floor and sprinted for the bathroom While he was fussing to get the shower adjusted to the right temperature he bludgeoned his conscience by telling himself that a wide awake general is more good than a half asleep general that there was nothing he could do but hope that Hargreaves s patrols would keep the bomb away from Konkrook until Pickering s brain trust came up with one of their own and that the fact that the commander in chief was making sack time would be much better for morale than the spectacle of him running around in circles He shaved carefully a stubble of beard on his chin might betray the fact that he was worried Then he dressed put his monocle in his eye and called the headquarters that had been set up in Sid Harrington s now his office A girl at the switchboard appeared on his screen and gave place to Paula Quinton who had been up for the past two hours The Northern Lights got in about three hours ago general she told him She had four of King Yoorkerk s infantry regiments aboard the Seventh Glorious and Terrible the Fourth Firm in Adversity the Second Strength of the Throne and the Twelfth Forever Admirable They re the sorriest looking rabble I ever saw but Hideyoshi says they re the best Yoorkerk has and they all have Terran style rifles General M zangwe broke them into battalions and put a battalion in with each of the Kragan regiments I think they re more afraid of the Kragans than they are of the rebels He nodded That was probably the best way to employ them within the existing situation The trouble was Them M zangwe was incurably tactical minded Put those geeks of Yoorkerk s in with the Kragans and they d be most useful in conquering Konkrook but the trouble was that after associating with Kragans they might develop into reasonably good troops themselves to the undesired improvement of King Yoorkerk s army On the other hand maybe not Keep them in Company service long enough and they might want to forget about Yoorkerk and stay there How s the situation over in town he asked Well it s slowing up since we began pulling contragravity out she told him but the geeks are breaking up rapidly Oh there was something funny about that hassle last evening when the Procyon came in Two contragravity vehicles an aircar and an air lorry that went out to meet the ship are unaccounted for You mean two of our vehicles are missing She shook her head frowning in perplexity Well no All the vehicles that answered that unidentified aircraft alert returned but there were these two that went out that we haven t any record of Colonel Grinell is investigating but he can t find out anything Tell him not to waste any more time he said Those two were probably geeks from Konkrook You know that s how the von Schlichten family got out of Germany in the Year Three flew a bomber to Spain The Konkrook war criminals are getting out before the Army of Occupation moves in Well the posts at the old Kragan castles report some contragravity and parties riding saurs moving west from the city she told him There are a lot of refugees on the roads And combat reports from Konkrook agree that resistance is getting weaker every hour And the supra atmosphere observation craft they re beginning to call her the Sky Spy is up a hundred and fifty miles over Keegark We have radar and vision screens and telemetered radiation and other detectors here tuned to her They re installing a similar set on the Northern Lights at the shipyard By the way Air Commodore Hargreaves wants to know if he can take a pair of one hundred fifty five mm rifles from the Channel Battery and mount them on the Lights Yes of course he can have anything he wants as long as it isn t urgently needed for the bomb project Sky Spy reports normal contragravity traffic between Keegark and the farming villages around aircars lorries a few scows but nothing suspicious No trace of either of the Boer class ships Kankad s people are building receiving sets to install on the Procyon and the Aldebaran and another set for Kankad s Town Pickering and his people are still working but they all look pretty frustrated They have Major Thornton at the ammunition plant doing experimental work on chemical explosive charges to bring the subcritical masses together and hold them together till an explosion can be produced they re using most of the skilled electrical and electronics people to work up a detonating device That s why Kankad s people are doing most of the detection device work Hargreaves is fitting a lot of small craft combat cars and civilian aircars with radar sets to use for patrolling That sounds good von Schlichten said I ll be around and see how things are after I ve had some breakfast He had breakfast at the main cafeteria four floors down there wasn t as much laughing and talking as usual but the crowd there seemed in good spirits He spent some time at headquarters watching Keegark by TV and radar So far nothing had been done about direct reconnaissance over Keegark with radiation detectors but Hargreaves reported that a couple of privately owned aircars were being fitted for the job He made a flying inspection trip around the island and visited the farms south of the city on the mainland and finally made a sweep in the command car over the city itself Reconnaissance in person was an archaic and unprogressive procedure and it was a good way to get generals killed but one could see a lot of things that would be missed on TV He let down several times in areas that had already been taken and talked to company and platoon officers For one thing King Yoorkerk s flamboyantly named regiments weren t quite as bad as Paula had thought She d been spoiled by the Kragans in her appreciation of other native troops They had good standard quality Volund made arms they were brave and capable and they had been just enough insulted by being integrated into Kragan regiments to try to make a good showing By noon resistance in the city was beginning to cave in Surrender flags were appearing on one after another of the Konkrookan rebel strong points and at fourteen thirty after he had returned to the Island a delegation headed by the Konkrookan equivalent of Lord Mayor and composed largely of prominent merchants came across the channel under a flag of truce to surrender the city s Spear of State with abject apologies for not having Gurgurk s head on the point of it Gurgurk they reported had fled to Keegark by air the night before which explained the incident of the unaccountable aircar and lorry The Channel Battery stopped firing and with the exception of an occasional spatter of small arms fire the city fell silent At sixteen hundred von Schlichten visited the headquarters Pickering had set up in the office building at the power plant As he stepped off the lift on the third floor a girl running down the hall with her arms full of papers in folders collided with him the load of papers flew in all directions He stooped to help her pick them up Oh general Isn t it wonderful she cried I just can t believe it Isn t what wonderful he asked Oh don t you know They ve got it Huh They have He gathered up the last of the big envelopes and gave them to her When Just half an hour ago And to think those books were around here all the time and Oh I ve got to run She disappeared into the lift Inside the office one of Pickering s engineers was sitting on the middle of his spinal column a stenograph phone in one hand and a book in the other Once in a while he would say something into the mouthpiece of the phone Two other nuclear engineers had similar books spread out on a desk in front of them they were making notes and looking up references in the Nuclear Engineers Handbook and making calculations with their sliderules There was a huddle around the drafting boards where two more such books were in use Well what s happened he demanded catching Pickering by the arm as he rushed from one group to another Ha We have it Pickering cried Everything we need Look He had another of the books under his arm He held it out to von Schlichten and von Schlichten suddenly felt sicker than he had ever felt since at the age of fourteen he had gotten drunk for the first time He had seen men crack up under intolerable strain before but this was the first time he had seen a whole roomful of men blow their tops in the same manner The book was a novel a jumbo size historical novel of some seven or eight hundred pages Its dust jacket bore a slightly more than bust length picture of a young lady with crimson hair and green eyes and jade earrings and a plunging not to say power diving neckline that left her affiliation with the class of Mammalia in no doubt whatever In the background a mushroom topped smoke column rose and away from it something intended to be a four motor propeller driven bomber of the First Century was racing madly The title he saw was Dire Dawn and the author was one Hildegarde Hernandez Well it has a picture of an A bomb explosion on it he agreed It has more than that it has the whole business Case specifications tampers charge design detonating device everything Why the end papers even have diagrams copies of the original Nagasaki bomb drawings Look Von Schlichten looked He had no more than the average intelligent layman s knowledge of nuclear physics enough to recharge or repair a conversion unit but the drawings looked authentic enough They seemed to be copies of ancient blueprints lettered in First Century English with Lingua Terra translations added and marked TOP SECRET and U S ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS and MANHATTAN ENGINEERING DISTRICT And look at this Pickering opened at a marked page and showed it to him And this He opened where another slip of paper had been inserted Everything we want to know practically I don t get this He wasn t sick anymore just bewildered I read some reviews of this thing All the reviewers panned hell out of it World War II Through a Bedroom Keyhole Henty in Black Lace Panties that sort of thing Yeh yeh sure Pickering agreed But this Hernandez had illusions of being a great serious historical novelist see She won t try to write a book till she s put in years of research actually about six months research by a herd of librarians and college juniors and other such literary coolies and she boasts that she never yet has been caught in an error of historical background detail Well this opus is about the old Manhattan Project The heroine is a sort of super Mata Hari who is alternately and sometimes simultaneously in the pay of the Nazis the Soviets the Vatican Chiang Kai Shek the Japanese Emperor and the Jewish International Bankers and she sleeps with everybody but Joe Stalin and Mao Tse tung and of course she is in on every step of the A bomb project She even manages to stow away on the Enola Gay with the help of a general she s spent fifty incandescent pages seducing In order to tool up for this production job La Hernandez did her researching just where Lourenco Gomes probably did his University of Montevideo Library She even had access to the photostats of the old U S data that General Lanningham brought to South America after the debacle in the United States in A E one hundred fourteen Those end papers are part of the Lanningham stuff As far as we ve been able to check mathematically everything is strictly authentic and practical We ll have to run a few more tests on the chemical explosive charges we don t have any data on the exact strength of the explosives they used then and the tampers and detonating device will need to be tested a little But in about half an hour we ought to be able to start drawing plans for the case and as soon as they re finished we ll rush them to the shipyard foundries for casting Von Schlichten handed the book back to Pickering and sighed deeply And I thought everybody here had gone off his rocker he said We will erect on the ruins of Keegark a hundred foot statue of Senorita Hildegarde Hernandez How did you get onto this Pickering pointed to a young man with dull brick colored hair who was punching out some kind of a problem on a small computing machine Piet van Reenen over there he has a girl friend whose taste runs to this sort of literary bubble gum She told him it was all in a book she d just read and showed him We descended in force on the bookshop and grabbed every copy in stock We are now running a sort of gaseous diffusion process to separate the nuclear physics from the pornography I must say Hildegarde has her biological data very well in hand too I ll bet she d have fun writing a novel about these geeks von Schlichten said Well how soon do you think you can have a bomb ready for us Casting the cases is going to slow us down the most Pickering said But even with that we ought to have one ready in three days at the most By two weeks we ll be turning them out on an assembly line I hope we don t need more than one But you d better produce at least half a dozen And have some practice bombs made up out of concrete or anything as long as they re the right weight and airfoil and have some way of releasing smoke Get them done as soon as you have your case designed We want to be able to make a couple of practice drops There was no use he thought of raising hopes which might prove premature He told Paula Quinton of course and Themistocles M zangwe and by telecast on sealed beam King Kankad and Air Commodore Hargreaves Beyond that there was nothing to do but wait and hope that Hargreaves could keep Orgzild s bombers away from Gongonk Island and Kankad s Town and that Hildegarde Hernandez had been playing fair with her public He visited the city where a few pockets of diehard resistance were being liquidated and where everybody who had not been too deeply and publicly involved in the znidd suddabit conspiracy was now coming forward and claiming to have been a lifelong friend of the Terrans and the Company Von Schlichten returned to Gongonk Island debating with himself whether to declare a general amnesty or to set up a dozen guillotines in the city and run them around the clock for a week There were cogent arguments for and against either procedure By twenty one hundred the last organized resistance had been wiped out and curfew had been imposed and peace of a sort restored There was still the threat from Keegark but it was looking less ominous now than it had the evening before Von Schlichten and Paula were having dinner in the Broadway Room confident that there was nothing left to do that they could do anything about when the extension phone that had been plugged in at their table rang Colonel Quinton here Paula identified herself into it and listened for a moment There has When Well where did it come from I see And the direction Anything else Apparently there was nothing else She hung up and turned to von Schlichten The Sky Spy just detected a ship lifting out from Keegark presumed one of the Boer class freighters either the Jan Smuts or the Oom Paul Kruger It was first picked up on contragravity at about a hundred feet rising vertically from near the Palace The supposition is the geeks had her camouflaged since the time Commander Prinsloo first bombarded Keegark with the Aldebaran That was about twenty minutes ago at last report she s fifty miles north of Keegark headed up the Hoork River Von Schlichten started thinking aloud That could be a feint to draw our ships north after her and leave the approach to Konkrook or Kankad s open but that would be presuming that they know about the Sky Spy and I doubt that though not enough to take chances on They know we have ground and ship radar and they may think they can slip down the Konk Valley either undetected or mistaken for one of our ships from North Uller He picked up the phone Get me through on telecast to Air Commodore Hargreaves aboard the Procyon he said I ll take it in the office I ll be up directly He rose Finish your dinner and have the rest of mine sent up he told Paula Leaving the elevator he rushed into the big headquarters room just as contact was established with the Procyon on station over the northwestern corner of Takkad Sea between Kankad s Town and Keegark The Aldebaran he knew was west of Keegark the Northern Lights now fitted with a pair of one hundred fifty five mm guns in addition to her ninety s had just arrived at Kankad s He had the Aldebaran sent north along the crest of the mountain range between the Hoork and Konk river valleys where she could cover both with her own radar and other detection devices and exchange information with the Sky Spy and the Gaucho sent in what looked like the right course to intercept the Boer class freighter from Keegark The Northern Lights also with screens tuned to the Sky Spy was sent to take over the Aldebaran s regular station Finally he called Skilk and had the Northern Star sent south down the Hoork Valley After that there was nothing to do but wait and watch the screens Paula Quinton put in an appearance shortly after he had finished calling Skilk pushing a cocktail wagon on which their interrupted dinners had been placed They finished eating and drank coffee and smoked Most of the rest of his staff who were not busy on the bomb project or at the shipyards or with the occupation of Konkrook drifted in they all sat and stared from one to another of the screens which told in radar patterns and direct vision and telescopic vision and heat and radiation detection the story of what was going on to the northeast of them Keegark was dark on the vision screen evidently King Orgzild had invented the blackout too Not that it did him any good the radar screen showed the city clearly and it was just as clear on the radiation and heat screens The Keegarkan ship was completely blacked out but the radiations from her engines and the distinctive radiation pattern of her contragravity field showed clearly and there was a speck that marked her position on the radar screen The same position was marked with a pin point of light on the vision screen some device on the Sky Spy synchronized with the detectors kept it focused there The Company ships and contragravity vehicles all were carrying topside lights visible only from above which flashed alternate red and blue to identify them Time crawled slowly around the clock face on the wall the sixty five second minutes of Uller dragging like hours The spots that marked the enemy ship and her hunters crawled too seen from the hundred and fifty mile altitude of the Sky Spy even the six hundred mile speed of the Gaucho was barely visible They drank coffee till the stuff revolted them they smoked until their throats and mouths were dry they watched the screens until they thought that they would see them in their dreams forever Then the Gaucho reported radar contact with the Keegarkan ship which had begun to turn in a hairpin shaped course and was coming south down the Konk Valley After that the Gaucho began reporting directly and her topside identification light went out doused our lights we re down in the valley altitude about a thousand feet We re trying to get a glimpse of her against the sky a voice came in We re cutting in our forward TV pickup The voice repeated several times the wavelength and somebody got an auxiliary screen tuned in There was nothing visible on it but the darkness of the valley the star jeweled sky and the loom of the East Konk Mountains We still can t see her but we ought to any moment radar shows her well above the mountains Ah there she is she just obscured Beta Hydrae V she s moving toward that big constellation to the east of it the one they call Finnegan s Goat Now she ll be right in the center of the screen we re going straight for her We re going to try to slow her down till the Aldebaran can get here The enemy ship was vaguely visible now becoming clearer in the starlight She was a Boer class freighter all right Probably the Jan Smuts the Oom Paul Kruger had last been reported at Bwork and there was little chance that she had slipped into Keegark since the uprising had started For all anybody knew she could have been destroyed in the fighting before the Bwork Residency fell All right we have her spotted we re going to open up on her the voice from the Gaucho announced She has two ninety s to our one we ll try to disable them first The vision screen lit with the indirect glare of the gun flash and the image in it jiggled violently as the ship shook to the recoil then steadied again with the enemy ship visible in the middle of it growing larger and larger as the Gaucho rushed toward her The gun fired again and again flooding the screen with momentary yellow light and disturbing the image as the recoil shook the gun cutter The enemy ship began firing in reply the shots were all wide misses Apparently the geek guncrew didn t know how to synchronize the radar sights and were ignorant of the correct setting for the proximity fuses The Gaucho s searchlights came on bathing her quarry in light It was the Jan Smuts the name and the figurehead bust of the old soldier philosopher were plainly visible Her forward gun had been knocked out and she was trying to swing about to get a field of fire for her stern gun We re going to give her a rocket salvo the voice said Watch this now The rockets leaped forward from the topside racks four and four and four and four at half second intervals The first four hit the Smuts amidships and low exploding with a flare that grew before it could die away as the second four landed Nobody ever saw the third and fourth four land The Jan Smuts vanished in a blaze of light that blinded everybody in the room when they could see again after some thirty seconds the screen was dark In the direct vision screen from the Sky Spy the whole countryside of the Konk Valley five hundred miles north of Konkrook was lighted The heat and radiation detectors were going insane And in the shifting confusion on the radar screen there was no trace either of the Jan Smuts or the Gaucho Well the geeks did have an A bomb Themistocles M zangwe said at length I d been trying to kid myself that we were just preparing against a million to one chance I wonder how many more they have Paula find out who was in command of the Gaucho he d be a junior grade lieutenant Fix up orders promoting him to navy captain as of now It s probably the only thing we can do for him anymore And promotions of the same order for everybody else aboard that cutter Authority Carlos von Schlichten acting Governor General He picked up a phone Get me Commander Prinsloo on Aldebaran He ordered Prinsloo to launch airboats and make a search cautioned him to be careful of radiation but to take no chances on any of the Gaucho s complement being still alive and in need of help While that was going on the Sky Spy reported another ship coming over her horizon to the east from the direction of Bwork That would be the Oom Paul Kruger Hargreaves had already learned of the advent of the second freighter He was unwilling to take the Procyon off her station until the Aldebaran returned from the Konk Valley In this von Schlichten concurred Somebody suggested that a drink would be in order They had just watched the all but certain death of three Terran officers fifteen Terran airmen and ten Kragans but they had all been living in too close companionship with death in the past three days or was it three centuries to be too deeply affected And they had also watched at least for a day or so the removal of the threat that had hung over their heads And they had seen proof that they had a defense against King Orgzild s bombs They were still mixing cocktails when Pickering phoned in Some good news general from Operation Hildegarde We ought to have at least one bomb ready to drop by fifteen hundred tomorrow four or five more by next midnight he said We don t need to have cases cast We got our dimensions decided and we find that there are a lot of big empty liquid oxygen flasks or tanks rather at the spaceport that ll accommodate everything fissionables explosive charges tampers detonator and all Well go ahead with it Make up a few of them as many as you can between now and twenty four hundred Sunday He thought for a moment Don t waste time on those practice bombs I mentioned We ll make a practice drop with a live bomb And don t throw away the design for the cast case We may need that later on XV A Place in my Heart for Hildegarde The company fleet hung off Keegark at fifteen thousand feet in a belt of calm air just below the seesawing currents from the warming Antarctic and the cooling deserts of the Arctic There was the Procyon from the bridge of which von Schlichten watched the movements of the other ships and airboats and the distant horizon The Aldebaran was ten miles off to the west her metal sheathing glinting in the red light of the evening sun There was the Northern Star down from Skilk a smaller and more distant twinkle of reflected light to the north of Aldebaran The Northern Lights was off to the east and between her and Procyon was a fifth ship turning the arm mounted binoculars around he could just make out on her bow the figurehead bust of a man in an ancient tophat and a fringe of chin beard She was the Oom Paul Kruger captured by the Procyon after a chase across the mountains northeast of Keegark the day before And remote from the other ships to the south a tiny speck of blue gray almost invisible against the sky and a smaller twinkle of reflected sunlight a garbage scow unflatteringly but somewhat aptly rechristened Hildegarde Hernandez which had been altered as a bomb carrier and the gun cutter Elmoran With the glasses he could see a bulky cylinder being handled off the scow and loaded onto the improvised bomb catapult on the Elmoran s stern Shortly thereafter the gun cutter broke loose from the tender and began to approach the fleet General I must protest against your doing this Air Commodore Hargreaves said There s simply no sense in it That bomb can be dropped without your personal supervision aboard sir and you re endangering yourself unnecessarily That infernal machine hasn t been tested or anything it might even let go on the catapult when you try to drop it And we simply can t afford to lose you now No what would become of us if you go out there and blow yourself up with that contraption Buhrmann supported him My God I thought Don Quixote was a Spaniard instead of a German Argentino von Schlichten corrected And don t try to sell me that Irreplaceable Man line either Them M zangwe can replace me Hid O Leary can replace him Barney Mordkovitz can replace him and so on down to where you make a second lieutenant out of some sergeant We ve been all over this last evening Admitted we can t take time for a long string of test shots and admitted we have to use an untested weapon I m not sending men out under those circumstances and staying here on this ship and watch them blow themselves up If that bomb s our only hope it s got to be dropped right and I m not going to take a chance on having it dropped by a crew who think they ve been sent out on a suicide mission What happened to the Gaucho when she blew the Smuts up is too fresh in everybody s mind But if I who ordered the mission accompany it they ll know I have some confidence that they ll come back alive Well I m coming along too general Kent Pickering spoke up I made the damned thing and I ought to be along when it s dropped on the principle that a restaurant proprietor ought to be seen eating his own food once in a while I still don t see why we couldn t have made at least one test shot first Hans Meyerstein the Banking Cartel man objected Well I ll tell you why Paula Quinton spoke up There s a good chance that the geeks don t know we have a bomb of our own They may believe that it was something invented on Niflheim for mining purposes and that we haven t realized its military application There s more than a good chance that the loss of the Jan Smuts has temporarily demoralized them Personally I believe that both King Orgzild and Prince Gorkrink were aboard her when she blew up That s something we ll never know positively of course That ship and everything and everybody in her were simply vaporized and the particles are registering on our geigers now But I m as sure as I am of anything about these geeks that one or both of them accompanied her Paula knows what she s talking about King Kankad jabbered in the Takkad Sea language which they all understood Just like Von saying that he has to go on our cutter to encourage the crew They always insist that their kings and generals go into battle particularly if something important is to be done They think the gods get angry if they don t And we have to hit them now von Schlichten said They still have a couple of bombs left We haven t been able to locate them with detectors but those geeks Kankad s men caught on that commando raid last night say that there were at least three of them made We can t take a chance that some fanatic may load one into an aircar and make a kamikaze raid on Gongonk Island The Elmoran ran alongside with her Masai warrior figurehead and the black cylinder on her catapult aft Somebody had painted on the bomb DIRE DAWN by Hildegarde Hernandez Compliments of the author to H M King Orgzild of Keegark A canvas entubed gangway was run out to connect the ship with the cutter Von Schlichten and Kent Pickering went down the ladder from the bridge the others accompanying them As he stepped into the gangway Paula Quinton fell in behind him Where do you think you re going he demanded Along with you she replied I m your adjutant I believe You definitely are not going along Personally I don t believe there s any danger but I m not having you run any unnecessary risks Von I don t know much about the way Terrans think except about fighting and about making things Kankad told him And I don t know anything at all about the kind of Terrans who have young But I believe this is something important to Paula Let her go with you because if you go alone and don t come back I don t think she will ever be happy again He looked at Kankad curiously wondering as he had so often before just what went on inside that lizard skull Then he looked at Paula and after a moment he nodded All right colonel objection withdrawn he said Aboard the Elmoran they gave the bomb a last minute inspection and checked the catapult and the bomb sight and then went up on the bridge Ready for the bombing mission sir the skipper a Lieutenant j g Morrison asked Ready if you are lieutenant Carry on we re just passengers Thank you sir We d thought of going in over the city at about five thousand for a target check turning when we re half way back to the mountains and coming back for our bombing run at fifteen thousand Is that all right sir Von Schlichten nodded You re the skipper lieutenant You d better make sure though that as soon as the bomb off signal is flashed your engineer hits his auxiliary rocket propulsion button We want to be about fifteen miles from where that thing goes off The lieutenant j g muttered something that sounded unmilitarily like You ain t foolin brother No I m not von Schlichten agreed I saw the Jan Smuts on the TV screen The Elmoran pointed her bow and the long blade of the figurehead warrior s spear toward Keegark The city grew out of the ground mist a particolored blur at the delta of the dry Hoork River and then a color splashed triangle between the river and the bay and the hills on the landward side and then it took shape cross ruled with streets and granulated with buildings As they came in von Schlichten who had approached it from the air many times before could distinguish the landmarks the site of King Orgzild s nitroglycerin plant now a crater surrounded by a quarter mile radius of ruins the Residency another crater since Rodolfo MacKinnon had blown it up under him the smashed Christiaan De Wett at the Company docks King Orgzild s Palace fire stained and with a hole blown in one corner by the Aldebaran s bombs Then they were past the city and over open country I wish we had some idea where the rest of those bombs are stored sir Lieutenant Morrison said We don t seem to have gotten anything significant when we flew reconnaissance with the radiation detectors No about all that was picked up was the main power plant and the radiation escape from there was normal Pickering agreed The bombs themselves wouldn t be detectable except to the extent that say a nuclear conversion engine for an airboat would be They probably have them underground somewhere well shielded Those prisoners Kankad s commandos dragged in only knew that they were in the city somewhere von Schlichten considered How about midway between the Palace and the Residency for our ground zero lieutenant That looks like the center of the city The cutter turned and started back having risen another ten thousand feet Morrison passed the word to the bombardier The city with the sea beyond it now came rushing at them and von Schlichten standing at the front of the bridge discovered that he had his arm around Paula s waist and was holding her a little more closely than was military He made no attempt to release her however There s nothing to worry about really he was assuring her Pickering s boys built this thing according to the best principles of engineering and the stuff they got out of that big economy size shilling shocker all checked mathematically The red light on the bridge flashed and the intercom shouted Bomb off He forced Paula down on the bridge deck and crouched beside her Cover your eyes he warned You remember what the flash was like in the screen when the Jan Smuts blew up And we didn t get the worst of it the pickup on the Gaucho was knocked out too soon He kept on lecturing her about gamma rays and ultra violet rays and X rays and cosmic rays trying to keep making some sort of intelligent sounds while they clung together and waited and with the other half of his mind trying not to think of everything that could go wrong with that jerry built improvisation they had just dumped onto Keegark If it didn t blow and the geeks found it they d know that another one would be along shortly and An invisible hand caught the gun cutter and hurled her end over end sending von Schlichten and Paula sprawling at full length on the deck still clinging to one another There was a blast of almost palpable sound and a sensation of heat that penetrated even the airtight superstructure of the Elmoran An instant later there was another and another similar shock Two more bombs had gone off behind them in Keegark that meant that they had found King Orgzild s remaining nuclear armament There were shattering sounds of breaking glass and heavy thumps that told of structural damage to the cutter and hoarse shouts and lurid cursing as Morrison and his airmen struggled with the controls The cutter began losing altitude but she was back on a reasonably even keel Von Schlichten rose helping Paula to her feet and found that they had been kissing one another passionately They were still in each other s arms when the pitching and rolling of the cutter ceased and somebody tapped him on the shoulder He came out of the embrace and looked around It was Lieutenant j g Morrison What the devil lieutenant he demanded Sorry to interrupt sir but we re starting back to Procyon And here you ll want this I suppose He held out a glass disc I never expected to see it but at that it took three A bombs to blow you loose from your monocle Oh that Von Schlichten took his trademark and set it in his eye I didn t lose it he lied I just jettisoned it Don t you know lieutenant that no gentleman ever wears a monocle while he s kissing a lady He looked around They were at about eight hundred to a thousand feet above the water with a stiff following wind away from the explosion area The ninety mm gun forward must have been knocked loose and carried away it was gone and so was the TV pickup and the radar Something probably the gun had slammed against the front of the bridge the metal skeleton was bent in and the armor glass had been knocked out The cutter was vibrating properly so the contragravity field had not been disturbed and her jets were firing It was the second and third bombs that did the damage sir Morrison was saying We d have gone through the effects of our own bomb with nothing more than a bad shaking of course on contragravity we re weightless relative to the air mass but she was built to stand the winds in the high latitudes But the two geek bombs caught us off balance You don t need to apologize lieutenant You and your crew behaved splendidly lieutenant commander best traditions and all that sort of thing It was a pleasure commander hope to be aboard with you again captain They found Kent Pickering at the rear of the bridge and joined him looking astern Even von Schlichten who had seen H bombs and Bethe cycle bombs was impressed Keegark was completely obliterated under an outward rolling cloud of smoke and dust that spread out for five miles at the bottom of the towering column There had been a hundred and fifty thousand people in that city even if their faces were the faces of lizards and they had four arms and quartz speckled skins What fraction of them were now alive he could not guess He had to remind himself that they were the people who had burned Eric Blount and Hendrik Lemoyne alive that two of the three bombs that had contributed to that column of boiling smoke had been made in Keegark by Keegarkans and that with a few causal factors altered he was seeing what would have happened to Konkrook Perhaps every Terran felt a superstitious dread of nuclear energy turned to the purposes of war small wonder after what they had done on their own world For one thing he thought grimly the next geek who picks up the idea of soaking a Terran in thermoconcentrate and setting fire to him will drop it again like a hot potato And the next geek potentate who tries to organize an anti Terran conspiracy or the next crazy caravan driver who preached znidd suddabit will be lynched on the spot But this must be the last nuclear bomb used on Uller Drunkard s morning after resolution he told himself contemptuously The next time it will come easier and easier still the time after that After you drop the first bomb there is no turning back any more than there had been after Hiroshima four hundred and fifty odd years ago Why he had even been considering just where against the mountains back of Bwork he would drop a demonstration bomb as a prelude to a surrender demand You either went on to the inevitable catastrophe or you realized in time that nuclear armament and nationalism cannot exist together on the same planet and it is easier to banish a habit of thought than a piece of knowledge Uller was not ready for membership in the Terran Federation then its people must bow to the Terran Pax The Kragans would help as proconsuls administrators now instead of mercenaries And there must be manned orbital stations and the Residencies must be moved outside the cities away from possible blast areas And Sid Harrington s idea of encouraging the natives to own their own contragravity ships must be shelved for a long time to come Maybe in a century or so Kankad had a good idea at that a most meritorious idea He was sold on it already and he doubted if it would take much salesmanship with Paula either Already she was clinging to his arm with obvious possessiveness Maybe their grandchildren and the Kankad of that time would see Uller a civilized member of the Federation They paused as the gun cutter nuzzled up to the Procyon and the canvas entubed gangway was run out and made fast looking back at the fearful thing that had sprouted from where Keegark had been You know Paula was saying echoing his earlier thought but for that female pornographer that would have been Konkrook He nodded Yes I hope you won t mind but there will always be a place in my heart for Hildegarde Then they turned their backs upon the abomination of Keegark s desolation and went up the gangway together looking very little like a general and his adjutant With a broadsword in his hand von Schlichten fought his way toward the throne There Firkked waited a sword in one of his upper hands his Spear of State in the other and a dagger in each lower hand Von Schlichten fought on trying not to think of the absurdity of a man of the Sixth Century A E the representative of a civilized Chartered Company dueling to the death with a barbarian king for a throne he had promised to another barbarian or of what could happen on Uller if he allowed this four armed monstrosity to kill him Ace Science Fiction Books by H Beam

ULLER UPRISING ZNIDD SUDDABIT So the Ulleran challenge begins with the rantings of a prophet and a seemingly incidental street riot Only when a dose of poison lands in the governor general s whiskey does it become clear that the geeks have had it up to their double lidded eyeballs with the imperialist Terran Federation s Chartered Uller Company Then overnight war is everywhere How it will end is in the merely two Terran hands of the new governor general a man shrewd enough to know that it is easier to banish a habit of thought than a piece of knowledge The problem is the particular piece of
