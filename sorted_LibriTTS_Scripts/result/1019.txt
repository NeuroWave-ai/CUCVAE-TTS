ve quench d my lamp I struck it in that start Which every limb convulsed I heard it fall The crash blent with my sleep I saw depart Its light even as I woke on yonder wall Over against my bed there shone a gleam Strange faint and mingling also with my dream It sank and I am wrapt in utter gloom How far is night advanced and when will day Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom And fill this void with warm creative ray Would I could sleep again till clear and red Morning shall on the mountain tops be spread I d call my women but to break their sleep Because my own is broken were unjust They ve wrought all day and well earn d slumbers steep Their labours in forgetfulness I trust Let me my feverish watch with patience bear Thankful that none with me its sufferings share Yet oh for light one ray would tranquillize My nerves my pulses more than effort can I ll draw my curtain and consult the skies These trembling stars at dead of night look wan Wild restless strange yet cannot be more drear Than this my couch shared by a nameless fear All black one great cloud drawn from east to west Conceals the heavens but there are lights below Torches burn in Jerusalem and cast On yonder stony mount a lurid glow I see men station d there and gleaming spears A sound too from afar invades my ears Dull measured strokes of axe and hammer ring From street to street not loud but through the night Distinctly heard and some strange spectral thing Is now uprear d and fix d against the light Of the pale lamps defined upon that sky It stands up like a column straight and high I see it all I know the dusky sign A cross on Calvary which Jews uprear While Romans watch and when the dawn shall shine Pilate to judge the victim will appear Pass sentence yield Him up to crucify And on that cross the spotless Christ must die Dreams then are true for thus my vision ran Surely some oracle has been with me The gods have chosen me to reveal their plan To warn an unjust judge of destiny I slumbering heard and saw awake I know Christ s coming death and Pilate s life of woe I do not weep for Pilate who could prove Regret for him whose cold and crushing sway No prayer can soften no appeal can move Who tramples hearts as others trample clay Yet with a faltering an uncertain tread That might stir up reprisal in the dead Forced to sit by his side and see his deeds Forced to behold that visage hour by hour In whose gaunt lines the abhorrent gazer reads A triple lust of gold and blood and power A soul whom motives fierce yet abject urge Rome s servile slave and Judah s tyrant scourge How can I love or mourn or pity him I who so long my fetter d hands have wrung I who for grief have wept my eyesight dim Because while life for me was bright and young He robb d my youth he quench d my life s fair ray He crush d my mind and did my freedom slay And at this hour although I be his wife He has no more of tenderness from me Than any other wretch of guilty life Less for I know his household privacy I see him as he is without a screen And by the gods my soul abhors his mien Has he not sought my presence dyed in blood Innocent righteous blood shed shamelessly And have I not his red salute withstood Ay when as erst he plunged all Galilee In dark bereavement in affliction sore Mingling their very offerings with their gore Then came he in his eyes a serpent smile Upon his lips some false endearing word And through the streets of Salem clang d the while His slaughtering hacking sacrilegious sword And I to see a man cause men such woe Trembled with ire I did not fear to show And now the envious Jewish priests have brought Jesus whom they in mock ry call their king To have by this grim power their vengeance wrought By this mean reptile innocence to sting Oh could I but the purposed doom avert And shield the blameless head from cruel hurt Accessible is Pilate s heart to fear Omens will shake his soul like autumn leaf Could he this night s appalling vision hear This just man s bonds were loosed his life were safe Unless that bitter priesthood should prevail And make even terror to their malice quail Yet if I tell the dream but let me pause What dream Erewhile the characters were clear Graved on my brain at once some unknown cause Has dimm d and razed the thoughts which now appear Like a vague remnant of some by past scene Not what will be but what long since has been I suffer d many things I heard foretold A dreadful doom for Pilate lingering woes In far barbarian climes where mountains cold Built up a solitude of trackless snows There he and grisly wolves prowl d side by side There he lived famish d there methought he died But not of hunger nor by malady I saw the snow around him stain d with gore I said I had no tears for such as he And lo my cheek is wet mine eyes run o er I weep for mortal suffering mortal guilt I weep the impious deed the blood self spilt More I recall not yet the vision spread Into a world remote an age to come And still the illumined name of Jesus shed A light a clearness through the unfolding gloom And still I saw that sign which now I see That cross on yonder brow of Calvary What is this Hebrew Christ to me unknown His lineage doctrine mission yet how clear Is God like goodness in his actions shown How straight and stainless is his life s career The ray of Deity that rests on him In my eyes makes Olympian glory dim The world advances Greek or Roman rite Suffices not the inquiring mind to stay The searching soul demands a purer light To guide it on its upward onward way Ashamed of sculptured gods Religion turns To where the unseen Jehovah s altar burns Our faith is rotten all our rites defiled Our temples sullied and methinks this man With his new ordinance so wise and mild Is come even as He says the chaff to fan And sever from the wheat but will his faith Survive the terrors of to morrow s death I feel a firmer trust a higher hope Rise in my soul it dawns with dawning day Lo on the Temple s roof on Moriah s slope Appears at length that clear and crimson ray Which I so wished for when shut in by night Oh opening skies I hail I bless pour light Part clouds and shadows Glorious Sun appear Part mental gloom Come insight from on high Dusk dawn in heaven still strives with daylight clear The longing soul doth still uncertain sigh Oh to behold the truth that sun divine How doth my bosom pant my spirit pine This day Time travails with a mighty birth This day Truth stoops from heaven and visits earth Ere night descends I shall more surely know What guide to follow in what path to go I wait in hope I wait in solemn fear The oracle of God the sole true God to hear MEMENTOS

2288-139949-0007	train-other-500	I climb the stair reluctantly Some shape that should be well in heaven Or ill elsewhere will pass by me I fear to see the very faces Familiar thirty years ago Even in the old accustomed places

2288-139949-0010	train-other-500	in her time It seemed to me a pleasant room For then no cloud of grief or crime Had cursed it with a settled gloom
7679-276767-0011	train-other-500	For then no cloud of grief or crime Had cursed it with a settled gloom I had not seen death s image laid In shroud and sheet on yonder bed Before she married she was blest Blest in her youth
2288-139949-0011	train-other-500	In shroud and sheet on yonder bed Before she married she was blest Blest in her youth blest in her worth Her mind was calm its sunny rest Shone in her eyes more clear than mirth

2288-139949-0012	train-other-500	And when attired in rich array Light lustrous hair about her brow She yonder sat a kind of day Lit up what seems so gloomy now These grim oak walls
7679-276767-0013	train-other-500	a kind of day Lit up what seems so gloomy now These grim oak walls even then were grim That old carved chair was then antique
2288-139949-0013	train-other-500	even then were grim That old carved chair was then antique But what around looked dusk and dim Served as a foil to her fresh cheek Her neck and arms of hue so fair

7679-276767-0020	train-other-500	I ve seen that by her daughter worn For ere she died a child was born A child that ne er its mother knew That lone and almost friendless grew
7679-276767-0021	train-other-500	For ever when its step drew nigh Averted was the father s eye And then a life impure and wild Made him a stranger to his child Absorbed in vice he little cared On what she did or how she fared
7679-276767-0022	train-other-500	The love withheld she never sought She grew uncherished learnt untaught To her the inward life of thought Full soon was open laid
2288-139949-0019	train-other-500	She grew uncherished learnt untaught To her the inward life of thought Full soon was open laid I know not if her friendlessness Did sometimes on her spirit press But plaint she never made
7679-276767-0023	train-other-500	I know not if her friendlessness Did sometimes on her spirit press But plaint she never made The book shelves were her darling treasure She rarely seemed the time to measure While she could read alone
2288-139949-0020	train-other-500	The book shelves were her darling treasure She rarely seemed the time to measure While she could read alone And she too loved the twilight wood And often in her mother s mood Away to yonder hill would hie
7679-276767-0024	train-other-500	And she too loved the twilight wood And often in her mother s mood Away to yonder hill would hie Like her to watch the setting sun Or see the stars born one by one Out of the darkening sky
2288-139949-0021	train-other-500	Like her to watch the setting sun Or see the stars born one by one Out of the darkening sky Nor would she leave that hill till night Trembled from pole to pole with light Even then upon her homeward way
7679-276767-0025	train-other-500	Nor would she leave that hill till night Trembled from pole to pole with light Even then upon her homeward way Long long her wandering steps delayed
2288-139949-0022	train-other-500	Long long her wandering steps delayed To quit the sombre forest shade Through which her eerie pathway lay You ask if she had beauty s grace I know not
7679-276767-0026	train-other-500	To quit the sombre forest shade Through which her eerie pathway lay You ask if she had beauty s grace I know not but a nobler face My eyes have seldom seen
2288-139949-0023	train-other-500	A keen and fine intelligence And better still the truest sense Were in her speaking mien But bloom or lustre was there none Only at moments fitful shone
7679-276767-0027	train-other-500	A keen and fine intelligence And better still the truest sense Were in her speaking mien But bloom or lustre was there none Only at moments fitful shone An ardour in her eye
7679-276767-0028	train-other-500	That kindled on her cheek a flush Warm as a red sky s passing blush And quick with energy Her speech too was not common speech No wish to shine or aim to teach Was in her words displayed

2288-139949-0025	train-other-500	Her fervid soul transfused Into the hearts of those who heard And transient strength and ardour stirred In minds to strength unused Yet in gay crowd or festal glare Grave and retiring was her air

7679-276767-0031	train-other-500	Twas seldom save with me alone That fire of feeling freely shone She loved not awe s nor wonder s gaze Nor even exaggerated praise
2288-139949-0027	train-other-500	nor wonder s gaze Nor even exaggerated praise Nor even notice if too keen The curious gazer searched her mien Nature s own green expanse revealed The world the pleasures she could prize
7679-276767-0032	train-other-500	Nor even notice if too keen The curious gazer searched her mien Nature s own green expanse revealed The world the pleasures she could prize On free hill side in sunny field
2288-139949-0028	train-other-500	On free hill side in sunny field In quiet spots by woods concealed
7679-276767-0033	train-other-500	In quiet spots by woods concealed Grew wild and fresh her chosen joys Yet Nature s feelings deeply lay In that endowed and youthful frame Shrined in her heart and hid from day
2288-139949-0029	train-other-500	Yet Nature s feelings deeply lay In that endowed and youthful frame Shrined in her heart and hid from day They burned unseen with silent flame In youth s first search for mental light
7679-276767-0034	train-other-500	They burned unseen with silent flame In youth s first search for mental light She lived but to reflect and learn But soon her mind s maturer might For stronger task did pant and yearn
none	none	 And stronger task did fate assign Task that a giant s strength might strain To suffer long and ne er repine 
2288-139949-0030	train-other-500	Be calm in frenzy smile at pain Pale with the secret war of feeling Sustained with courage mute yet high The wounds at which she bled revealing Only by altered cheek and eye
7679-276767-0035	train-other-500	Sustained with courage mute yet high The wounds at which she bled revealing Only by altered cheek and eye She bore in silence
2288-139949-0031	train-other-500	She bore in silence but when passion Surged in her soul with ceaseless foam The storm at last brought desolation And drove her exiled from her home And silent still she straight assembled
7679-276767-0036	train-other-500	The storm at last brought desolation And drove her exiled from her home And silent still she straight assembled The wrecks of strength her soul retained
2288-139949-0032	train-other-500	The wrecks of strength her soul retained For though the wasted body trembled The unconquered mind to quail disdained She crossed the sea now lone she wanders
7679-276767-0037	train-other-500	For though the wasted body trembled The unconquered mind to quail disdained She crossed the sea now lone she wanders By Seine s or Rhine s or Arno s flow
7679-276767-0038	train-other-500	Fain would I know if distance renders Relief or comfort to her woe Fain would I know if henceforth ever These eyes shall read in hers again That light of love which faded never
2288-139949-0033	train-other-500	Though dimmed so long with secret pain She will return but cold and altered Like all whose hopes too soon depart Like all on whom have beat unsheltered
7679-276767-0039	train-other-500	Though dimmed so long with secret pain She will return but cold and altered Like all whose hopes too soon depart Like all on whom have beat unsheltered
2288-139949-0034	train-other-500	The bitter blasts that blight the heart No more shall I behold her lying Calm on a pillow smoothed by me No more that spirit worn with sighing
7679-276767-0040	train-other-500	The bitter blasts that blight the heart No more shall I behold her lying Calm on a pillow smoothed by me No more that spirit worn with sighing Will know the rest of infancy
2288-139949-0035	train-other-500	Will know the rest of infancy If still the paths of lore she follow Twill be with tired and goaded will She ll only toil the aching hollow The joyless blank of life to fill

none	none	 Come let us strive to rally mirth Where glows a clear and tranquil hearth In some more cheerful room THE WIFE S WILL Sit still a word a breath may break As light airs stir a sleeping lake The glassy calm that soothes my woes The sweet the deep the full repose O leave me not for ever be Thus more than life itself to me Yes close beside thee let me kneel Give me thy hand that I may feel The friend so true so tried so dear My heart s own chosen indeed is near And check me not this hour divine Belongs to me is fully mine Tis thy own hearth thou sitt saint beside After long absence wandering wide Tis thy own wife reads in thine eyes A promise clear of stormless skies For faith and true love light the rays Which shine responsive to her gaze Ay well that single tear may fall Ten thousand might mine eyes recall Which from their lids ran blinding fast In hours of grief yet scarcely past Well mayst thou speak of love to me For oh most truly I love thee Yet smile for we are happy now Whence then that sadness on thy brow What sayst thou We muse once again Ere long be severed by the main I knew not this I deemed no more Thy step would err from Britain s shore Duty commands Tis true tis just Thy slightest word I wholly trust Nor by request nor faintest sigh Would I to turn thy purpose try But William hear my solemn vow Hear and confirm with thee I go Distance and suffering didst thou say Danger by night and toil by day Oh idle words and vain are these Hear me I cross with thee the seas Such risk as thou must meet and dare I thy true wife will duly share Passive at home I will not pine Thy toils thy perils shall be mine Grant this and be hereafter paid By a warm heart s devoted aid Tis granted with that yielding kiss Entered my soul unmingled bliss Thanks William thanks thy love has joy Pure undefiled with base alloy Tis not a passion false and blind Inspires enchains absorbs my mind Worthy I feel art thou to be Loved with my perfect energy This evening now shall sweetly flow Lit by our clear fire s happy glow And parting s peace embittering fear Is warned our hearts to come not near For fate admits my soul s decree In bliss or bale to go with thee THE WOOD But two miles more and then we rest Well there is still an hour of day And long the brightness of the West Will light us on our devious way Sit then awhile here in this wood So total is the solitude We safely may delay These massive roots afford a seat Which seems for weary travellers made There rest The air is soft and sweet In this sequestered forest glade And there are scents of flowers around The evening dew draws from the ground How soothingly they spread Yes I was tired but not at heart No that beats full of sweet content For now I have my natural part Of action with adventure blent Cast forth on the wide world with thee And all my once waste energy To weighty purpose bent Yet sayst thou spies around us roam Our aims are termed conspiracy Haply no more our English home An anchorage for us may be That there is risk our mutual blood May redden in some lonely wood The knife of treachery Sayst thou that where we lodge each night In each lone farm or lonelier hall Of Norman Peer ere morning light Suspicion must as duly fall As day returns such vigilance Presides and watches over France Such rigour governs all I fear not William dost thou fear So that the knife does not divide It may be ever hovering near I could not tremble at thy side And strenuous love like mine for thee Is buckler strong gainst treachery And turns its stab aside I am resolved that thou shalt learn To trust my strength as I trust thine I am resolved our souls shall burn With equal steady mingling shine Part of the field is conquered now Our lives in the same channel flow Along the self same line And while no groaning storm is heard Thou seem saint content it should be so But soon as comes a warning word Of danger straight thine anxious brow Bends over me a mournful shade As doubting if my powers are made To ford the floods of woe Know then it is my spirit swells And drinks with eager joy the air Of freedom where at last it dwells Chartered a common task to share With thee and then it stirs alert And pants to learn what menaced hurt Demands for thee its care Remember I have crossed the deep And stood with thee on deck to gaze On waves that rose in threatening heap While stagnant lay a heavy haze Dimly confusing sea with sky And baffling even the pilot s eye Intent to thread the maze Of rocks on Bretagne s dangerous coast And find a way to steer our band To the one point obscure which lost Flung us as victims on the strand All elsewhere gleamed the Gallic sword And not a wherry could be moored Along the guarded land I feared not then I fear not now The interest of each stirring scene Wakes a new sense a welcome glow In every nerve and bounding vein Alike on turbid Channel sea Or in still wood of Normandy I feel as born again The rain descended that wild morn When anchoring in the cove at last Our band all weary and forlorn Ashore like wave worn sailors cast Sought for a sheltering roof in vain And scarce could scanty food obtain To break their morning fast Thou didst thy crust with me divide Thou didst thy cloak around me fold And sitting silent by thy side I ate the bread in peace untold Given kindly from thy hand twas sweet As costly fare or princely treat On royal plate of gold Sharp blew the sleet upon my face And rising wild the gusty wind Drove on those thundering waves apace Our crew so late had left behind But spite of frozen shower and storm So close to thee my heart beat warm And tranquil slept my mind So now nor foot sore nor opprest With walking all this August day I taste a heaven in this brief rest This gipsy halt beside the way England s wild flowers are fair to view Like balm is England s summer dew Like gold her sunset ray But the white violets growing here Are sweeter than I yet have seen And ne er did dew so pure and clear Distil on forest mosses green As now called forth by summer heat Perfumes our cool and fresh retreat These fragrant limes between That sunset Look beneath the boughs Over the copse beyond the hills How soft yet deep and warm it glows And heaven with rich suffusion fills With hues where still the opal s tint Its gleam of prisoned fire is blent Where flame through azure thrills Depart we now for fast will fade That solemn splendour of decline And deep must be the after shade As stars alone to night will shine No moon is destined pale to gaze On such a day s vast Phoenix blaze A day in fires decayed There hand in hand we tread again The mazes of this varying wood And soon amid a cultured plain Girt in with fertile solitude We shall our resting place descry Marked by one roof tree towering high Above a farmstead rude Refreshed erelong with rustic fare We ll seek a couch of dreamless ease Courage will guard thy heart from fear And Love give mine divinest peace To morrow brings more dangerous toil And through its conflict and turmoil We ll pass as God shall please The preceding composition refers doubtless to the scenes acted in France during the last year of the Consulate FRANCES She will not sleep for fear of dreams But rising quits her restless bed And walks where some beclouded beams Of moonlight through the hall are shed Obedient to the goad of grief

none	none	 full many a mile GILBERT I THE GARDEN Above the city hung the moon Right o er a plot of ground Where flowers and orchard trees were fenced With lofty walls around Twas Gilbert s garden there to night Awhile he walked alone And tired with sedentary toil Mused where the moonlight shone This garden in a city heart Lay still as houseless wild Though many windowed mansion fronts Were round it closely piled But thick their walls and those within Lived lives by noise unstirred Like wafting of an angel s wing Time s flight by them was heard Some soft piano notes alone Were sweet as faintly given Where ladies doubtless cheered the hearth With song that winter even The city s many mingled sounds Rose like the hum of ocean They rather lulled the heart than roused Its pulse to faster motion Gilbert has paced the single walk An hour yet is not weary And though it be a winter night He feels nor cold nor dreary The prime of life is in his veins And sends his blood fast flowing And Fancy s fervour warms the thoughts Now in his bosom glowing Those thoughts recur to early love Or what he love would name Though haply Gilbert s secret deeds Might other title claim Such theme not oft his mind absorbs He to the world clings fast And too much for the present lives To linger o er the past But now the evening s deep repose Has glided to his soul That moonlight falls on Memory And shows her fading scroll One name appears in every line The gentle rays shine o er And still he smiles and still repeats That one name Elinor There is no sorrow in his smile No kindness in his tone The triumph of a selfish heart Speaks coldly there alone He says She loved me more than life And truly it was sweet To see so fair a woman kneel In bondage at my feet There was a sort of quiet bliss To be so deeply loved To gaze on trembling eagerness And sit myself unmoved And when it pleased my pride to grant At last some rare caress To feel the fever of that hand My fingers deigned to press Twas sweet to see her strive to hide What every glance revealed Endowed the while with despot might Her destiny to wield I knew myself no perfect man Nor as she deemed divine I knew that I was glorious but By her reflected shine Her youth her native energy Her powers new born and fresh Twas these with Godhead sanctified My sensual frame of flesh Yet like a god did I descend At last to meet her love And like a god I then withdrew To my own heaven above And never more could she invoke My presence to her sphere No prayer no plaint no cry of hers Could win my awful ear I knew her blinded constancy Would ne er my deeds betray And calm in conscience whole in heart I went my tranquil way Yet sometimes I still feel a wish The fond and flattering pain Of passion s anguish to create In her young breast again Bright was the lustre of her eyes When they caught fire from mine If I had power this very hour Again I d light their shine But where she is or how she lives I have no clue to know I ve heard she long my absence pined And left her home in woe But busied then in gathering gold As I am busied now I could not turn from such pursuit To weep a broken vow Nor could I give to fatal risk The fame I ever prized Even now I fear that precious fame Is too much compromised An inward trouble dims his eye Some riddle he would solve Some method to unloose a knot His anxious thoughts revolve He pensive leans against a tree A leafy evergreen The boughs the moonlight intercept And hide him like a screen He starts the tree shakes with his tremor Yet nothing near him pass d He hurries up the garden alley In strangely sudden haste With shaking hand he lifts the latchet Steps o er the threshold stone The heavy door slips from his fingers It shuts and he is gone What touched transfixed appalled his soul A nervous thought no more Twill sink like stone in placid pool And calm close smoothly o er II THE PARLOUR Warm is the parlour atmosphere Serene the lamp s soft light The vivid embers red and clear Proclaim a frosty night Books varied on the table lie Three children o er them bend And all with curious eager eye The turning leaf attend Picture and tale alternately Their simple hearts delight And interest deep and tempered glee Illume their aspects bright The parents from their fireside place Behold that pleasant scene And joy is on the mother s face Pride in the father s mien As Gilbert sees his blooming wife Beholds his children fair No thought has he of transient strife Or past though piercing fear The voice of happy infancy Lisps sweetly in his ear His wife with pleased and peaceful eye Sits kindly smiling near The fire glows on her silken dress And shows its ample grace And warmly tints each hazel tress Curled soft around her face The beauty that in youth he wooed Is beauty still unfaded The brow of ever placid mood No churlish grief has shaded Prosperity in Gilbert s home Abides the guest of years There Want or Discord never come And seldom Toil or Tears The carpets bear the peaceful print Of comfort s velvet tread And golden gleams from plenty sent In every nook are shed The very silken spaniel seems Of quiet ease to tell As near its mistress feet it dreams Sunk in a cushion s swell And smiles seem native to the eyes Of those sweet children three They have but looked on tranquil skies And know not misery Alas that Misery should come In such an hour as this Why could she not so calm a home A little longer miss But she is now within the door Her steps advancing glide Her sullen shade has crossed the floor She stands at Gilbert s side She lays her hand upon his heart It bounds with agony His fireside chair shakes with the start That shook the garden tree His wife towards the children looks She does not mark his mien The children bending o er their books His terror have not seen In his own home by his own hearth He sits in solitude And circled round with light and mirth Cold horror chills his blood His mind would hold with desperate clutch The scene that round him lies No changed as by some wizard s touch The present prospect flies A tumult vague a viewless strife His futile struggles crush Twixt him and his an unknown life And unknown feelings rush He sees but scarce can language paint The tissue fancy weaves For words oft give but echo faint Of thoughts the mind conceives Noise tumult strange and darkness dim Efface both light and quiet No shape is in those shadows grim No voice in that wild riot Sustain d and strong a wondrous blast Above and round him blows A greenish gloom dense overcast Each moment denser grows He nothing knows nor clearly sees Resistance checks his breath The high impetuous ceaseless breeze Blows on him cold as death And still the undulating gloom Mocks sight with formless motion Was such sensation Jonah s doom Gulphed in the depths of ocean Streaking the air the nameless vision Fast driven deep sounding flows Oh whence its source and what its mission How will its terrors close Long sweeping rushing vast and void The universe it swallows And still the dark devouring tide A typhoon tempest follows More slow it rolls its furious race Sinks to its solemn gliding The stunning roar the wind s wild chase To stillness are subsiding And slowly borne along a form The shapeless chaos varies Poised in the eddy to the storm Before the eye it tarries A woman drowned sunk in the deep On a long wave reclining The circling waters crystal sweep Like glass her shape enshrining Her pale dead face to Gilbert turned Seems as in sleep reposing A feeble light now first discerned The features well disclosing No effort from the haunted air The ghastly scene could banish That hovering wave arrested there Rolled throbbed but did not vanish If Gilbert upward turned his gaze He saw the ocean shadow If he looked down the endless seas Lay green as summer meadow And straight before the pale corpse lay Upborne by air or billow So near he could have touched the spray That churned around its pillow The hollow anguish of the face Had moved a fiend to sorrow Not death s fixed calm could rase the trace Of suffering s deep worn furrow All moved a strong returning blast The mass of waters raising Bore wave and passive carcase past While Gilbert yet was gazing Deep in her isle conceiving womb It seemed the ocean thundered And soon by realms of rushing gloom Were seer and phantom sundered Then swept some timbers from a wreck On following surges riding Then sea weed in the turbid rack Uptorn went slowly gliding The horrid shade by slow degrees A beam of light defeated And then the roar of raving seas Fast far and faint retreated And all was gone gone like a mist Corse billows tempest wreck Three children close to Gilbert prest And clung around his neck Good night good night the prattlers said And kissed their father s cheek Twas now the hour their quiet bed And placid rest to seek The mother with her offspring goes To hear their evening prayer She nought of Gilbert s vision knows And nought of his despair Yet pitying God abridge the time Of anguish now his fate Though haply great has been his crime Thy mercy too is great Gilbert at length uplifts his head Bent for some moments low And there is neither grief nor dread Upon his subtle brow For well can he his feelings task And well his looks command His features well his heart can mask With smiles and smoothness bland Gilbert has reasoned with his mind He says twas all a dream He strives his inward sight to blind Against truth s inward beam He pitied not that shadowy thing When it was flesh and blood Nor now can pity s balmy spring Refresh his arid mood And if that dream has spoken truth Thus musingly he says If Elinor be dead in sooth Such chance the shock repays A net was woven round my feet I scarce could further go Ere shame had forced a fast retreat Dishonour brought me low Conceal her then deep silent sea Give her a secret grave She sleeps in peace and I am free No longer terror s slave And homage still from all the world Shall greet my spotless name Since surges break and waves are curled Above its threatened shame III THE WELCOME HOME Above the city hangs the moon Some clouds are boding rain Gilbert erewhile on journey gone To night comes home again Ten years have passed above his head Each year has brought him gain His prosperous life has smoothly sped Without or tear or stain Tis somewhat late the city clocks Twelve deep vibrations toll As Gilbert at the portal knocks Which is his journey s goal The street is still and desolate The moon hid by a cloud Gilbert impatient will not wait His second knock peals loud The clocks are hushed there s not a light In any window nigh And not a single planet bright Looks from the clouded sky The air is raw the rain descends A bitter north wind blows His cloak the traveller scarce defends Will not the door unclose He knocks the third time and the last His summons now they hear Within a footstep hurrying fast Is heard approaching near The bolt is drawn the clanking chain Falls to the floor of stone And Gilbert to his heart will strain His wife and children soon The hand that lifts the latchet holds A candle to his sight And Gilbert on the step beholds A woman clad in white Lo water from her dripping dress Runs on the streaming floor From every dark and clinging tress The drops incessant pour There s none but her to welcome him She holds the candle high And motionless in form and limb Stands cold and silent nigh There s sand and sea weed on her robe Her hollow eyes are blind No pulse in such a frame can throb No life is there defined Gilbert turned ashy white but still His lips vouchsafed no cry He spurred his strength and master will To pass the figure by But moving slow it faced him straight It would not flinch nor quail Then first did Gilbert s strength abate His stony firmness quail He sank upon his knees and prayed The shape stood rigid there He called aloud for human aid No human aid was near An accent strange did thus repeat Heaven s stern but just decree The measure thou to her didst mete To thee shall measured be Gilbert sprang from his bended knees By the pale spectre pushed And wild as one whom demons seize Up the hall staircase rushed Entered his chamber near the bed Sheathed steel and fire arms hung Impelled by maniac purpose dread He chose those stores among Across his throat a keen edged knife With vigorous hand he drew The wound was wide his outraged life Rushed rash and redly through And thus died by a shameful death A wise and worldly man Who never drew but selfish breath Since first his life began LIFE Life believe is not a dream So dark as sages say Oft a little morning rain Foretells a pleasant day Sometimes there are clouds of gloom But these are transient all If the shower will make the roses bloom O why lament its fall Rapidly merrily Life s sunny hours flit by Gratefully cheerily Enjoy them as they fly What though Death at times steps in And calls our Best away What though sorrow seems to win O er hope a heavy sway Yet Hope again elastic springs Unconquered though she fell Still buoyant are her golden wings Still strong to bear us well Manfully fearlessly The day of trial bear For gloriously victoriously Can courage quell despair THE LETTER What is she writing Watch her now How fast her fingers move How eagerly her youthful brow Is bent in thought above Her long curls drooping shade the light She puts them quick aside Nor knows that band of crystals bright Her hasty touch untied It slips adown her silken dress Falls glittering at her feet Unmarked it falls for she no less Pursues her labour sweet The very loveliest hour that shines Is in that deep blue sky The golden sun of June declines It has not caught her eye The cheerful lawn and unclosed gate The white road far away In vain for her light footsteps wait She comes not forth to day There is an open door of glass Close by that lady s chair From thence to slopes of messy grass Descends a marble stair Tall plants of bright and spicy bloom Around the threshold grow Their leaves and blossoms shade the room From that sun s deepening glow Why does she not a moment glance Between the clustering flowers And mark in heaven the radiant dance Of evening s rosy hours O look again Still fixed her eye Unsmiling earnest still And fast her pen and fingers fly Urged by her eager will Her soul is in th absorbing task To whom then doth she write Nay watch her still more closely ask Her own eyes serious light Where do they turn as now her pen Hangs o er th unfinished line Whence fell the tearful gleam that then Did in their dark spheres shine The summer parlour looks so dark When from that sky you turn And from th expanse of that green park You scarce may aught discern Yet o er the piles of porcelain rare O er flower stand couch and vase Sloped as if leaning on the air One picture meets the gaze Tis there she turns you may not see Distinct what form defines The clouded mass of mystery Yon broad gold frame confines But look again inured to shade Your eyes now faintly trace A stalwart form a massive head A firm determined face Black Spanish locks a sunburnt cheek A brow high broad and white Where every furrow seems to speak Of mind and moral might Is that her god I cannot tell Her eye a moment met Th impending picture then it fell Darkened and dimmed and wet A moment more her task is done And sealed the letter lies And now towards the setting sun She turns her tearful eyes Those tears flow over wonder not For by the inscription see In what a strange and distant spot Her heart of hearts must be Three seas and many a league of land That letter must pass o er Ere read by him to whose loved hand Tis sent from England s shore Remote colonial wilds detain Her husband loved though stern She mid that smiling English scene Weeps for his wished return REGRET Long ago I wished to leave The house where I was born Long ago I used to grieve My home seemed so forlorn In other years its silent rooms Were filled with haunting fears Now their very memory comes O ercharged with tender tears Life and marriage I have known Things once deemed so bright Now how utterly is flown Every ray of light Mid the unknown sea of life I no blest isle have found At last through all its wild wave s strife My bark is homeward bound Farewell dark and rolling deep Farewell foreign shore Open in unclouded sweep Thou glorious realm before Yet though I had safely pass d That weary vexed main One loved voice through surge and blast Could call me back again Though the soul s bright morning rose O er Paradise for me William even from Heaven s repose I d turn invoked by thee Storm nor surge should e er arrest My soul exalting then All my heaven was once thy breast Would it were mine again PRESENTIMENT Sister you ve sat there all the day Come to the hearth awhile The wind so wildly sweeps away The clouds so darkly pile That open book has lain unread For hours upon your knee You ve never smiled nor turned your head What can you sister see Come hither Jane look down the field How dense a mist creeps on The path the hedge are both concealed Ev n the white gate is gone No landscape through the fog I trace No hill with pastures green All featureless is Nature s face All masked in clouds her mien Scarce is the rustle of a leaf Heard in our garden now The year grows old its days wax brief The tresses leave its brow The rain drives fast before the wind The sky is blank and grey O Jane what sadness fills the mind On such a dreary day You think too much my sister dear You sit too long alone What though November days be drear Full soon will they be gone I ve swept the hearth and placed your chair Come Emma sit by me Our own fireside is never drear Though late and wintry wane the year Though rough the night may be The peaceful glow of our fireside Imparts no peace to me My thoughts would rather wander wide Than rest dear Jane with thee I m on a distant journey bound And if about my heart Too closely kindred ties were bound Twould break when forced to part Soon will November days be o er Well have you spoken Jane My own forebodings tell me more For me I know by presage sure They ll ne er return again Ere long nor sun nor storm to me Will bring or joy or gloom They reach not that Eternity Which soon will be my home Eight months are gone the summer sun Sets in a glorious sky A quiet field all green and lone Receives its rosy dye Jane sits upon a shaded stile Alone she sits there now Her head rests on her hand the while And thought o ercasts her brow She s thinking of one winter s day A few short months ago Then Emma s bier was borne away O er wastes of frozen snow She s thinking how that drifted snow Dissolved in spring s first gleam And how her sister s memory now Fades even as fades a dream The snow will whiten earth again But Emma comes no more She left mid winter s sleet and rain This world for Heaven s far shore On Beulah s hills she wanders now On Eden s tranquil plain To her shall Jane hereafter go She ne er shall come to Jane THE TEACHER S MONOLOGUE The room is quiet thoughts alone People its mute tranquillity The yoke put off the long task done I am as it is bliss to be Still and untroubled Now I see For the first time how soft the day O er waveless water stirless tree Silent and sunny wings its way Now as I watch that distant hill So faint so blue so far removed Sweet dreams of home my heart may fill That home where I am known and loved It lies beyond yon azure brow Parts me from all Earth holds for me And morn and eve my yearnings flow Thitherward tending changelessly My happiest hours aye all the time I love to keep in memory Lapsed among moors ere life s first prime Decayed to dark anxiety Sometimes I think a narrow heart Makes me thus mourn those far away And keeps my love so far apart From friends and friendships of to day Sometimes I think tis but a dream I treasure up so jealously All the sweet thoughts I live on seem To vanish into vacancy And then this strange coarse world around Seems all that s palpable and true And every sight and every sound Combines my spirit to subdue To aching grief so void and lone Is Life and Earth so worse than vain The hopes that in my own heart sown And cherished by such sun and rain As Joy and transient Sorrow shed Have ripened to a harvest there Alas methinks I hear it said Thy golden sheaves are empty air All fades away my very home I think will soon be desolate I hear at times a warning come Of bitter partings at its gate And if I should return and see The hearth fire quenched the vacant chair And hear it whispered mournfully That farewells have been spoken there What shall I do and whither turn Where look for peace When cease to mourn Tis not the air I wished to play The strain I wished to sing My wilful spirit slipped away And struck another string I neither wanted smile nor tear Bright joy nor bitter woe But just a song that sweet and clear Though haply sad might flow A quiet song to solace me When sleep refused to come A strain to chase despondency When sorrowful for home In vain I try I cannot sing All feels so cold and dead No wild distress no gushing spring Of tears in anguish shed But all the impatient gloom of one Who waits a distant day When some great task of suffering done Repose shall toil repay For youth departs and pleasure flies And life consumes away And youth s rejoicing ardour dies Beneath this drear delay And Patience weary with her yoke Is yielding to despair And Health s elastic spring is broke Beneath the strain of care Life will be gone ere I have lived Where now is Life s first prime I ve worked and studied longed and grieved Through all that rosy time To toil to think to long to grieve Is such my future fate The morn was dreary must the eve Be also desolate Well such a life at least makes Death A welcome wished for friend Then aid me Reason Patience Faith To suffer to the end PASSION Some have won a wild delight By daring wilder sorrow Could I gain thy love to night I d hazard death to morrow Could the battle struggle earn One kind glance from thine eye How this withering heart would burn The heady fight to try Welcome nights of broken sleep And days of carnage cold Could I deem that thou wouldst weep To hear my perils told Tell me if with wandering bands I roam full far away Wilt thou to those distant lands In spirit ever stray Wild long a trumpet sounds afar Bid me bid me go Where Seik and Briton meet in war On Indian Sutlej s flow Blood has dyed the Sutlej s waves With scarlet stain I know Indus borders yawn with graves Yet command me go Though rank and high the holocaust Of nations steams to heaven Glad I d join the death doomed host Were but the mandate given Passion s strength should nerve my arm Its ardour stir my life Till human force to that dread charm Should yield and sink in wild alarm Like trees to tempest strife If hot from war I seek thy love Darest thou turn aside Darest thou then my fire reprove By scorn and maddening pride No my will shall yet control Thy will so high and free And love shall tame that haughty soul Yes tenderest love for me I ll read my triumph in thine eyes Behold and prove the change Then leave perchance my noble prize Once more in arms to range I d die when all the foam is up The bright wine sparkling high Nor wait till in the exhausted cup Life s dull dregs only lie Then Love thus crowned with sweet reward Hope blest with fulness large I d mount the saddle draw the sword And perish in the charge PREFERENCE Not in scorn do I reprove thee Not in pride thy vows I waive But believe I could not love thee Wert thou prince and I a slave These then are thine oaths of passion This thy tenderness for me Judged even by thine own confession Thou art steeped in perfidy Having vanquished thou wouldst leave me Thus I read thee long ago Therefore dared I not deceive thee Even with friendship s gentle show Therefore with impassive coldness Have I ever met thy gaze Though full oft with daring boldness Thou thine eyes to mine didst raise Why that smile Thou now art deeming This my coldness all untrue But a mask of frozen seeming Hiding secret fires from view Touch my hand thou self deceiver Nay be calm for I am so Does it burn Does my lip quiver Has mine eye a troubled glow Canst thou call a moment s colour To my forehead to my cheek Canst thou tinge their tranquil pallor With one flattering feverish streak Am I marble What no woman Could so calm before thee stand Nothing living sentient human Could so coldly take thy hand Yes a sister might a mother My good will is sisterly Dream not then I strive to smother Fires that inly burn for thee Rave not rage not wrath is fruitless Fury cannot change my mind I but deem the feeling rootless Which so whirls in passion s wind Can I love Oh deeply truly Warmly fondly but not thee And my love is answered duly With an equal energy Wouldst thou see thy rival Hasten Draw that curtain soft aside Look where yon thick branches chasten Noon with shades of eventide In that glade where foliage blending Forms a green arch overhead Sits thy rival thoughtful bending O er a stand with papers spread Motionless his fingers plying That untired unresting pen Time and tide unnoticed flying There he sits the first of men Man of conscience man of reason Stern perchance but ever just Foe to falsehood wrong and treason Honour s shield and virtue s trust Worker thinker firm defender Of Heaven s truth man s liberty Soul of iron proof to slander Rock where founders tyranny Fame he seeks not but full surely She will seek him in his home This I know and wait securely For the atoning hour to come To that man my faith is given Therefore soldier cease to sue While God reigns in earth and heaven I to him will still be true EVENING SOLACE The human heart has hidden treasures In secret kept in silence sealed The thoughts the hopes the dreams the pleasures Whose charms were broken if revealed And days may pass in gay confusion And nights in rosy riot fly While lost in Fame s or Wealth s illusion The memory of the Past may die But there are hours of lonely musing Such as in evening silence come When soft as birds their pinions closing The heart s best feelings gather home Then in our souls there seems to languish A tender grief that is not woe And thoughts that once wrung groans of anguish Now cause but some mild tears to flow And feelings once as strong as passions Float softly back a faded dream Our own sharp griefs and wild sensations The tale of others sufferings seem Oh when the heart is freshly bleeding How longs it for that time to be When through the mist of years receding Its woes but live in reverie And it can dwell on moonlight glimmer On evening shade and loneliness And while the sky grows dim and dimmer Feel no untold and strange distress Only a deeper impulse given By lonely hour and darkened room To solemn thoughts that soar to heaven Seeking a life and world to come STANZAS If thou be in a lonely place If one hour s calm be thine As Evening bends her placid face O er this sweet day s decline If all the earth and all the heaven Now look serene to thee As o er them shuts the summer even One moment think of me Pause in the lane returning home Tis dusk it will be still Pause near the elm a sacred gloom Its breezeless boughs will fill Look at that soft and golden light High in the unclouded sky Watch the last bird s belated flight As it flits silent by Hark for a sound upon the wind A step a voice a sigh If all be still then yield thy mind Unchecked to memory If thy love were like mine how blest That twilight hour would seem When back from the regretted Past Returned our early dream If thy love were like mine how wild Thy longings even to pain For sunset soft and moonlight mild To bring that hour again But oft when in thine arms I lay I ve seen thy dark eyes shine And deeply felt their changeful ray Spoke other love than mine My love is almost anguish now It beats so strong and true Twere rapture could I deem that thou Such anguish ever knew I have been but thy transient flower Thou wert my god divine Till checked by death s congealing power This heart must throb for thine And well my dying hour were blest If life s expiring breath Should pass as thy lips gently prest My forehead cold in death And sound my sleep would be and sweet Beneath the churchyard tree If sometimes in thy heart should beat One pulse still true to me PARTING There s no use in weeping Though we are condemned to part There s such a thing as keeping A remembrance in one s heart There s such a thing as dwelling On the thought ourselves have nursed And with scorn and courage telling The world to do its worst We ll not let its follies grieve us We ll just take them as they come And then every day will leave us A merry laugh for home When we ve left each friend and brother When we re parted wide and far We will think of one another As even better than we are Every glorious sight above us Every pleasant sight beneath We ll connect with those that love us Whom we truly love till death In the evening when we re sitting By the fire perchance alone Then shall heart with warm heart meeting Give responsive tone for tone We can burst the bonds which chain us Which cold human hands have wrought And where none shall dare restrain us We can meet again in thought So there s no use in weeping Bear a cheerful spirit still Never doubt that Fate is keeping Future good for present ill APOSTASY This last denial of my faith Thou solemn Priest hast heard And though upon my bed of death I call not back a word Point not to thy Madonna Priest Thy sightless saint of stone She cannot from this burning breast Wring one repentant moan Thou say saint that when a sinless child I duly bent the knee And prayed to what in marble smiled Cold lifeless mute on me I did But listen Children spring Full soon to riper youth And for Love s vow and Wedlock s ring I sold my early truth Twas not a grey bare head like thine Bent o er me when I said That land and God and Faith are mine For which thy fathers bled I see thee not my eyes are dim But well I hear thee say O daughter cease to think of him Who led thy soul astray Between you lies both space and time Let leagues and years prevail To turn thee from the path of crime Back to the Church s pale And did I need that thou shouldst tell What mighty barriers rise To part me from that dungeon cell Where my loved Walter lies And did I need that thou shouldst taunt My dying hour at last By bidding this worn spirit pant No more for what is past Priest MUST I cease to think of him How hollow rings that word Can time can tears can distance dim The memory of my lord I said before I saw not thee Because an hour agone Over my eyeballs heavily The lids fell down like stone But still my spirit s inward sight Beholds his image beam As fixed as clear as burning bright As some red planet s gleam Talk not of thy Last Sacrament Tell not thy beads for me Both rite and prayer are vainly spent As dews upon the sea Speak not one word of Heaven above Rave not of Hell s alarms Give me but back my Walter s love Restore me to his arms Then will the bliss of Heaven be won Then will Hell shrink away As I have seen night s terrors shun The conquering steps of day Tis my religion thus to love My creed thus fixed to be Not Death shall shake nor Priestcraft break My rock like constancy Now go for at the door there waits Another stranger guest He calls I come my pulse scarce beats My heart fails in my breast Again that voice how far away How dreary sounds that tone And I methinks am gone astray In trackless wastes and lone I fain would rest a little while Where can I find a stay Till dawn upon the hills shall smile And show some trodden way I come I come in haste she said Twas Walter s voice I heard Then up she sprang but fell back dead His name her latest word WINTER STORES We take from life one little share And say that this shall be A space redeemed from toil and care From tears and sadness free And haply Death unstrings his bow And Sorrow stands apart And for a little while we know The sunshine of the heart Existence seems a summer eve Warm soft and full of peace Our free unfettered feelings give The soul its full release A moment then it takes the power To call up thoughts that throw Around that charmed and hallowed hour This life s divinest glow But Time though viewlessly it flies And slowly will not stay Alike through clear and clouded skies It cleaves its silent way Alike the bitter cup of grief Alike the draught of bliss Its progress leaves but moment brief For baffled lips to kiss The sparkling draught is dried away The hour of rest is gone And urgent voices round us say Ho lingerer hasten on And has the soul then only gained From this brief time of ease A moment s rest when overstrained One hurried glimpse of peace No while the sun shone kindly o er us And flowers bloomed round our feet While many a bud of joy before us Unclosed its petals sweet An unseen work within was plying Like honey seeking bee From flower to flower unwearied flying Laboured one faculty Thoughtful for Winter s future sorrow Its gloom and scarcity Prescient to day of want to morrow Toiled quiet Memory Tis she that from each transient pleasure Extracts a lasting good Tis she that finds in summer treasure To serve for winter s food And when Youth s summer day is vanished And Age brings Winter s stress Her stores with hoarded sweets replenished Life s evening hours will bless THE MISSIONARY Plough vessel plough the British main Seek the free ocean s wider plain Leave English scenes and English skies Unbind dissever English ties Bear me to climes remote and strange Where altered life fast following change Hot action never ceasing toil Shall stir turn dig the spirit s soil Fresh roots shall plant fresh seed shall sow Till a new garden there shall grow Cleared of the weeds that fill it now Mere human love mere selfish yearning Which cherished would arrest me yet I grasp the plough there s no returning Let me then struggle to forget But England s shores are yet in view And England s skies of tender blue Are arched above her guardian sea I cannot yet Remembrance flee I must again then firmly face That task of anguish to retrace Wedded to home I home forsake Fearful of change I changes make Too fond of ease I plunge in toil Lover of calm I seek turmoil Nature and hostile Destiny Stir in my heart a conflict wild And long and fierce the war will be Ere duty both has reconciled What other tie yet holds me fast To the divorced abandoned past Smouldering on my heart s altar lies The fire of some great sacrifice Not yet half quenched The sacred steel But lately struck my carnal will My life long hope first joy and last What I loved well and clung to fast What I wished wildly to retain What I renounced with soul felt pain What when I saw it axe struck perish Left me no joy on earth to cherish A man bereft yet sternly now I do confirm that Jephtha vow Shall I retract or fear or flee Did Christ when rose the fatal tree Before him on Mount Calvary Twas a long fight hard fought but won And what I did was justly done Yet Helen from thy love I turned When my heart most for thy heart burned I dared thy tears I dared thy scorn Easier the death pang had been borne Helen thou mightst not go with me I could not dared not stay for thee I heard afar in bonds complain The savage from beyond the main And that wild sound rose o er the cry Wrung out by passion s agony And even when with the bitterest tear I ever shed mine eyes were dim Still with the spirit s vision clear I saw Hell s empire vast and grim Spread on each Indian river s shore Each realm of Asia covering o er There the weak trampled by the strong Live but to suffer hopeless die There pagan priests whose creed is Wrong Extortion Lust and Cruelty Crush our lost race and brimming fill The bitter cup of human ill And I who have the healing creed The faith benign of Mary s Son Shall I behold my brother s need And selfishly to aid him shun I who upon my mother s knees In childhood read Christ s written word Received his legacy of peace His holy rule of action heard I in whose heart the sacred sense Of Jesus love was early felt Of his pure full benevolence His pitying tenderness for guilt His shepherd care for wandering sheep For all weak sorrowing trembling things His mercy vast his passion deep Of anguish for man s sufferings I schooled from childhood in such lore Dared I draw back or hesitate When called to heal the sickness sore Of those far off and desolate Dark in the realm and shades of Death Nations and tribes and empires lie But even to them the light of Faith Is breaking on their sombre sky And be it mine to bid them raise Their drooped heads to the kindling scene And know and hail the sunrise blaze Which heralds Christ the Nazarene I know how Hell the veil will spread Over their brows and filmy eyes And earthward crush the lifted head That would look up and seek the skies I know what war the fiend will wage Against that soldier of the Cross Who comes to dare his demon rage And work his kingdom shame and loss Yes hard and terrible the toil Of him who steps on foreign soil Resolved to plant the gospel vine Where tyrants rule and slaves repine Eager to lift Religion s light Where thickest shades of mental night Screen the false god and fiendish rite Reckless that missionary blood Shed in wild wilderness and wood Has left upon the unblest air The man s deep moan the martyr s prayer I know my lot I only ask Power to fulfil the glorious task Willing the spirit may the flesh Strength for the day receive afresh May burning sun or deadly wind Prevail not o er an earnest mind May torments strange or direst death Nor trample truth nor baffle faith Though such blood drops should fall from me As fell in old Gethsemane Welcome the anguish so it gave More strength to work more skill to save And oh if brief must be my time If hostile hand or fatal clime Cut short my course still o er my grave Lord may thy harvest whitening wave So I the culture may begin Let others thrust the sickle in If but the seed will faster grow May my blood water what I sow What have I ever trembling stood And feared to give to God that blood What has the coward love of life Made me shrink from the righteous strife Have human passions human fears Severed me from those Pioneers Whose task is to march first and trace Paths for the progress of our race It has been so but grant me Lord Now to stand steadfast by Thy word Protected by salvation s helm Shielded by faith with truth begirt To smile when trials seek to whelm And stand mid testing fires unhurt Hurling hell s strongest bulwarks down Even when the last pang thrills my breast When death bestows the martyr s crown And calls me into Jesus rest Then for my ultimate reward Then for the world rejoicing word The voice from Father Spirit Son Servant of God well hast thou done POEMS BY ELLIS BELL FAITH AND DESPONDENCY The winter wind is loud and wild Come close to me my darling child Forsake thy books and mateless play And while the night is gathering gray We ll talk its pensive hours away Ierne round our sheltered hall November s gusts unheeded call Not one faint breath can enter here Enough to wave my daughter s hair And I am glad to watch the blaze Glance from her eyes with mimic rays To feel her cheek so softly pressed In happy quiet on my breast But yet even this tranquillity Brings bitter restless thoughts to me And in the red fire s cheerful glow I think of deep glens blocked with snow I dream of moor and misty hill Where evening closes dark and chill For lone among the mountains cold Lie those that I have loved of old And my heart aches in hopeless pain Exhausted with repinings vain That I shall greet them ne er again Father in early infancy When you were far beyond the sea Such thoughts were tyrants over me I often sat for hours together Through the long nights of angry weather Raised on my pillow to descry The dim moon struggling in the sky Or with strained ear to catch the shock Of rock with wave and wave with rock So would I fearful vigil keep And all for listening never sleep But this world s life has much to dread Not so my Father with the dead Oh not for them should we despair The grave is drear but they are not there Their dust is mingled with the sod Their happy souls are gone to God You told me this and yet you sigh And murmur that your friends must die Ah my dear father tell me why For if your former words were true How useless would such sorrow be As wise to mourn the seed which grew Unnoticed on its parent tree Because it fell in fertile earth And sprang up to a glorious birth Struck deep its root and lifted high Its green boughs in the breezy sky But I ll not fear I will not weep For those whose bodies rest in sleep I know there is a blessed shore Opening its ports for me and mine And gazing Time s wide waters o er I weary for that land divine Where we were born where you and I Shall meet our dearest when we die From suffering and corruption free Restored into the Deity Well hast thou spoken sweet trustful child And wiser than thy sire And worldly tempests raging wild Shall strengthen thy desire Thy fervent hope through storm and foam Through wind and ocean s roar To reach at last the eternal home The steadfast changeless shore STARS Ah why because the dazzling sun Restored our Earth to joy Have you departed every one And left a desert sky All through the night your glorious eyes Were gazing down in mine And with a full heart s thankful sighs I blessed that watch divine I was at peace and drank your beams As they were life to me And revelled in my changeful dreams Like petrel on the sea Thought followed thought star followed star Through boundless regions on While one sweet influence near and far Thrilled through and proved us one Why did the morning dawn to break So great so pure a spell And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek Where your cool radiance fell Blood red he rose and arrow straight His fierce beams struck my brow The soul of nature sprang elate But mine sank sad and low My lids closed down yet through their veil I saw him blazing still And steep in gold the misty dale And flash upon the hill I turned me to the pillow then To call back night and see Your worlds of solemn light again Throb with my heart and me It would not do the pillow glowed And glowed both roof and floor And birds sang loudly in the wood And fresh winds shook the door The curtains waved the wakened flies Were murmuring round my room Imprisoned there till I should rise And give them leave to roam Oh stars and dreams and gentle night Oh night and stars return And hide me from the hostile light That does not warm but burn That drains the blood of suffering men Drinks tears instead of dew Let me sleep through his blinding reign And only wake with you THE PHILOSOPHER Enough of thought philosopher Too long hast thou been dreaming Unlightened in this chamber drear While summer s sun is beaming Space sweeping soul what sad refrain Concludes thy musings once again Oh for the time when I shall sleep Without identity And never care how rain may steep Or snow may cover me No promised heaven these wild desires Could all or half fulfil No threatened hell with quenchless fires Subdue this quenchless will So said I and still say the same Still to my death will say Three gods within this little frame Are warring night and day Heaven could not hold them all and yet They all are held in me And must be mine till I forget My present entity Oh for the time when in my breast Their struggles will be o er Oh for the day when I shall rest And never suffer more I saw a spirit standing man Where thou dost stand an hour ago And round his feet three rivers ran Of equal depth and equal flow A golden stream and one like blood And one like sapphire seemed to be But where they joined their triple flood It tumbled in an inky sea The spirit sent his dazzling gaze Down through that ocean s gloomy night Then kindling all with sudden blaze The glad deep sparkled wide and bright White as the sun far far more fair Than its divided sources were And even for that spirit seer I ve watched and sought my life time long Sought him in heaven hell earth and air An endless search and always wrong Had I but seen his glorious eye ONCE light the clouds that wilder me I ne er had raised this coward cry To cease to think and cease to be I ne er had called oblivion blest Nor stretching eager hands to death Implored to change for senseless rest This sentient soul this living breath Oh let me die that power and will Their cruel strife may close And conquered good and conquering ill Be lost in one repose REMEMBRANCE Cold in the earth and the deep snow piled above thee Far far removed cold in the dreary grave Have I forgot my only Love to love thee Severed at last by Time s all severing wave Now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover Over the mountains on that northern shore Resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover Thy noble heart for ever ever more Cold in the earth and fifteen wild Decembers From those brown hills have melted into spring Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers After such years of change and suffering Sweet Love of youth forgive if I forget thee While the world s tide is bearing me along Other desires and other hopes beset me Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong No later light has lightened up my heaven No second morn has ever shone for me All my life s bliss from thy dear life was given All my life s bliss is in the grave with thee But when the days of golden dreams had perished And even Despair was powerless to destroy Then did I learn how existence could be cherished Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy Then did I check the tears of useless passion Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten Down to that tomb already more than mine And even yet I dare not let it languish Dare not indulge in memory s rapturous pain Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish How could I seek the empty world again A DEATH SCENE O day he cannot die When thou so fair art shining O Sun in such a glorious sky So tranquilly declining He cannot leave thee now While fresh west winds are blowing And all around his youthful brow Thy cheerful light is glowing Edward awake awake The golden evening gleams Warm and bright on Arden s lake Arouse thee from thy dreams Beside thee on my knee My dearest friend I pray That thou to cross the eternal sea Wouldst yet one hour delay I hear its billows roar I see them foaming high But no glimpse of a further shore Has blest my straining eye Believe not what they urge Of Eden isles beyond Turn back from that tempestuous surge To thy own native land It is not death but pain That struggles in thy breast Nay rally Edward rouse again I cannot let thee rest One long look that sore reproved me For the woe I could not bear One mute look of suffering moved me To repent my useless prayer And with sudden check the heaving Of distraction passed away Not a sign of further grieving Stirred my soul that awful day Paled at length the sweet sun setting Sunk to peace the twilight breeze Summer dews fell softly wetting Glen and glade and silent trees Then his eyes began to weary Weighed beneath a mortal sleep And their orbs grew strangely dreary Clouded even as they would weep But they wept not but they changed not Never moved and never closed Troubled still and still they ranged not Wandered not nor yet reposed So I knew that he was dying Stooped and raised his languid head Felt no breath and heard no sighing So I knew that he was dead SONG The linnet in the rocky dells The moor lark in the air The bee among the heather bells That hide my lady fair The wild deer browse above her breast The wild birds raise their brood And they her smiles of love caressed Have left her solitude I ween that when the grave s dark wall Did first her form retain They thought their hearts could ne er recall The light of joy again They thought the tide of grief would flow Unchecked through future years But where is all their anguish now And where are all their tears Well let them fight for honour s breath Or pleasure s shade pursue The dweller in the land of death Is changed and careless too And if their eyes should watch and weep Till sorrow s source were dry She would not in her tranquil sleep Return a single sigh Blow west wind by the lonely mound And murmur summer streams There is no need of other sound To soothe my lady s dreams ANTICIPATION How beautiful the earth is still To thee how full of happiness How little fraught with real ill Or unreal phantoms of distress How spring can bring thee glory yet And summer win thee to forget December s sullen time Why dost thou hold the treasure fast Of youth s delight when youth is past And thou art near thy prime When those who were thy own compeers Equals in fortune and in years Have seen their morning melt in tears To clouded smileless day Blest had they died untried and young Before their hearts went wandering wrong Poor slaves subdued by passions strong A weak and helpless prey Because I hoped while they enjoyed And by fulfilment hope destroyed As children hope with trustful breast I waited bliss and cherished rest A thoughtful spirit taught me soon That we must long till life be done That every phase of earthly joy Must always fade and always cloy This I foresaw and would not chase The fleeting treacheries But with firm foot and tranquil face Held backward from that tempting race Gazed o er the sands the waves efface To the enduring seas There cast my anchor of desire Deep in unknown eternity Nor ever let my spirit tire With looking for WHAT IS TO BE It is hope s spell that glorifies Like youth to my maturer eyes All Nature s million mysteries The fearful and the fair Hope soothes me in the griefs I know She lulls my pain for others woe And makes me strong to undergo What I am born to bear Glad comforter will I not brave Unawed the darkness of the grave Nay smile to hear Death s billows rave Sustained my guide by thee The more unjust seems present fate The more my spirit swells elate Strong in thy strength to anticipate Rewarding destiny THE PRISONER A FRAGMENT In the dungeon crypts idly did I stray Reckless of the lives wasting there away Draw the ponderous bars open Warder stern He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn Our guests are darkly lodged I whisper d gazing through The vault whose grated eye showed heaven more gray than blue This was when glad Spring laughed in awaking pride Ay darkly lodged enough returned my sullen guide Then God forgive my youth forgive my careless tongue I scoffed as the chill chains on the damp flagstones rung Confined in triple walls art thou so much to fear That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here The captive raised her face it was as soft and mild As sculptured marble saint or slumbering unwean d child It was so soft and mild it was so sweet and fair Pain could not trace a line nor grief a shadow there The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow I have been struck she said and I am suffering now Yet these are little worth your bolts and irons strong And were they forged in steel they could not hold me long Hoarse laughed the jailor grim Shall I be won to hear Dost think fond dreaming wretch that I shall grant thy prayer Or better still wilt melt my master s heart with groans Ah sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones My master s voice is low his aspect bland and kind But hard as hardest flint the soul that lurks behind And I am rough and rude yet not more rough to see Than is the hidden ghost that has its home in me About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn My friend she gently said you have not heard me mourn When you my kindred s lives MY lost life can restore Then may I weep and sue but never friend before Still let my tyrants know I am not doomed to wear Year after year in gloom and desolate despair A messenger of Hope comes every night to me And offers for short life eternal liberty He comes with western winds with evening s wandering airs With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars Winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire And visions rise and change that kill me with desire Desire for nothing known in my maturer years When Joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears When if my spirit s sky was full of flashes warm I knew not whence they came from sun or thunder storm But first a hush of peace a soundless calm descends The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends Mute music soothes my breast unuttered harmony That I could never dream till Earth was lost to me Then dawns the Invisible the Unseen its truth reveals My outward sense is gone my inward essence feels Its wings are almost free its home its harbour found Measuring the gulph it stoops and dares the final bound Oh I dreadful is the check intense the agony When the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see When the pulse begins to throb the brain to think again The soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain Yet I would lose no sting would wish no torture less The more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless And robed in fires of hell or bright with heavenly shine If it but herald death the vision is divine She ceased to speak and we unanswering turned to go We had no further power to work the captive woe Her cheek her gleaming eye declared that man had given A sentence unapproved and overruled by Heaven HOPE Hope Was but a timid friend She sat without the grated den Watching how my fate would tend Even as selfish hearted men She was cruel in her fear Through the bars one dreary day I looked out to see her there And she turned her face away Like a false guard false watch keeping Still in strife she whispered peace She would sing while I was weeping If I listened she would cease False she was and unrelenting When my last joys strewed the ground Even Sorrow saw repenting Those sad relics scattered round Hope whose whisper would have given Balm to all my frenzied pain Stretched her wings and soared to heaven Went and ne er returned again A DAY DREAM On a sunny brae alone I lay One summer afternoon It was the marriage time of May With her young lover June From her mother s heart seemed loath to part That queen of bridal charms But her father smiled on the fairest child He ever held in his arms The trees did wave their plumy crests The glad birds carolled clear And I of all the wedding guests Was only sullen there There was not one but wished to shun My aspect void of cheer The very gray rocks looking on Asked What do you here And I could utter no reply In sooth I did not know Why I had brought a clouded eye To greet the general glow So resting on a heathy bank I took my heart to me And we together sadly sank Into a reverie We thought When winter comes again Where will these bright things be All vanished like a vision vain An unreal mockery The birds that now so blithely sing Through deserts frozen dry Poor spectres of the perished spring In famished troops will fly And why should we be glad at all The leaf is hardly green Before a token of its fall Is on the surface seen Now whether it were really so I never could be sure But as in fit of peevish woe I stretched me on the moor A thousand thousand gleaming fires Seemed kindling in the air A thousand thousand silvery lyres Resounded far and near Methought the very breath I breathed Was full of sparks divine And all my heather couch was wreathed By that celestial shine And while the wide earth echoing rung To that strange minstrelsy The little glittering spirits sung Or seemed to sing to me O mortal mortal let them die Let time and tears destroy That we may overflow the sky With universal joy Let grief distract the sufferer s breast And night obscure his way They hasten him to endless rest And everlasting day To thee the world is like a tomb A desert s naked shore To us in unimagined bloom It brightens more and more And could we lift the veil and give One brief glimpse to thine eye Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live BECAUSE they live to die The music ceased the noonday dream Like dream of night withdrew But Fancy still will sometimes deem Her fond creation true TO IMAGINATION When weary with the long day s care And earthly change from pain to pain And lost and ready to despair Thy kind voice calls me back again Oh my true friend I am not lone While then canst speak with such a tone So hopeless is the world without The world within I doubly prize Thy world where guile and hate and doubt And cold suspicion never rise Where thou and I and Liberty Have undisputed sovereignty What matters it that all around Danger and guilt and darkness lie If but within our bosom s bound We hold a bright untroubled sky Warm with ten thousand mingled rays Of suns that know no winter days Reason indeed may oft complain For Nature s sad reality And tell the suffering heart how vain Its cherished dreams must always be And Truth may rudely trample down The flowers of Fancy newly blown But thou art ever there to bring The hovering vision back and breathe New glories o er the blighted spring And call a lovelier Life from Death And whisper with a voice divine Of real worlds as bright as thine I trust not to thy phantom bliss Yet still in evening s quiet hour With never failing thankfulness I welcome thee Benignant Power Sure solacer of human cares And sweeter hope when hope despairs HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES How clear she shines How quietly I lie beneath her guardian light While heaven and earth are whispering me To morrow wake but dream to night Yes Fancy come my Fairy love These throbbing temples softly kiss And bend my lonely couch above And bring me rest and bring me bliss The world is going dark world adieu Grim world conceal thee till the day The heart thou canst not all subdue Must still resist if thou delay Thy love I will not will not share Thy hatred only wakes a smile Thy griefs may wound thy wrongs may tear But oh thy lies shall ne er beguile While gazing on the stars that glow Above me in that stormless sea I long to hope that all the woe Creation knows is held in thee And this shall be my dream to night I ll think the heaven of glorious spheres Is rolling on its course of light In endless bliss through endless years I ll think there s not one world above Far as these straining eyes can see Where Wisdom ever laughed at Love Or Virtue crouched to Infamy Where writhing neath the strokes of Fate The mangled wretch was forced to smile To match his patience gainst her hate His heart rebellious all the while Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong And helpless Reason warn in vain And Truth is weak and Treachery strong And Joy the surest path to Pain And Peace the lethargy of Grief And Hope a phantom of the soul And life a labour void and brief And Death the despot of the whole SYMPATHY There should be no despair for you While nightly stars are burning While evening pours its silent dew And sunshine gilds the morning There should be no despair though tears May flow down like a river Are not the best beloved of years Around your heart for ever They weep you weep it must be so Winds sigh as you are sighing And winter sheds its grief in snow Where Autumn s leaves are lying Yet these revive and from their fate Your fate cannot be parted Then journey on if not elate Still NEVER broken hearted PLEAD FOR ME Oh thy bright eyes must answer now When Reason with a scornful brow Is mocking at my overthrow Oh thy sweet tongue must plead for me And tell why I have chosen thee Stern Reason is to judgment come Arrayed in all her forms of gloom Wilt thou my advocate be dumb No radiant angel speak and say Why I did cast the world away Why I have persevered to shun The common paths that others run And on a strange road journeyed on Heedless alike of wealth and power Of glory s wreath and pleasure s flower These once indeed seemed Beings Divine And they perchance heard vows of mine And saw my offerings on their shrine But careless gifts are seldom prized And MINE were worthily despised So with a ready heart I swore To seek their altar stone no more And gave my spirit to adore Thee ever present phantom thing My slave my comrade and my king A slave because I rule thee still Incline thee to my changeful will And make thy influence good or ill A comrade for by day and night Thou art my intimate delight My darling pain that wounds and sears And wrings a blessing out from tears By deadening me to earthly cares And yet a king though Prudence well Have taught thy subject to rebel And am I wrong to worship where Faith cannot doubt nor hope despair Since my own soul can grant my prayer Speak God of visions plead for me And tell why I have chosen thee SELF INTEROGATION The evening passes fast away Tis almost time to rest What thoughts has left the vanished day What feelings in thy breast The vanished day It leaves a sense Of labour hardly done Of little gained with vast expense A sense of grief alone Time stands before the door of Death Upbraiding bitterly And Conscience with exhaustless breath Pours black reproach on me And though I ve said that Conscience lies And Time should Fate condemn Still sad Repentance clouds my eyes And makes me yield to them Then art thou glad to seek repose Art glad to leave the sea And anchor all thy weary woes In calm Eternity Nothing regrets to see thee go Not one voice sobs farewell And where thy heart has suffered so Canst thou desire to dwell Alas the countless links are strong That bind us to our clay The loving spirit lingers long And would not pass away And rest is sweet when laurelled fame Will crown the soldier s crest But a brave heart with a tarnished name Would rather fight than rest Well thou hast fought for many a year Hast fought thy whole life through Hast humbled Falsehood trampled Fear What is there left to do Tis true this arm has hotly striven Has dared what few would dare Much have I done and freely given But little learnt to bear Look on the grave where thou must sleep Thy last and strongest foe It is endurance not to weep If that repose seem woe The long war closing in defeat Defeat serenely borne Thy midnight rest may still be sweet And break in glorious morn DEATH Death that struck when I was most confiding In my certain faith of joy to be Strike again Time s withered branch dividing From the fresh root of Eternity Leaves upon Time s branch were growing brightly Full of sap and full of silver dew Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew Sorrow passed and plucked the golden blossom Guilt stripped off the foliage in its pride But within its parent s kindly bosom Flowed for ever Life s restoring tide Little mourned I for the parted gladness For the vacant nest and silent song Hope was there and laughed me out of sadness Whispering Winter will not linger long And behold with tenfold increase blessing Spring adorned the beauty burdened spray Wind and rain and fervent heat caressing Lavished glory on that second May High it rose no winged grief could sweep it Sin was scared to distance with its shine Love and its own life had power to keep it From all wrong from every blight but thine Cruel Death The young leaves droop and languish Evening s gentle air may still restore No the morning sunshine mocks my anguish Time for me must never blossom more Strike it down that other boughs may flourish Where that perished sapling used to be Thus at least its mouldering corpse will nourish That from which it sprung Eternity STANZAS TO Well some may hate and some may scorn And some may quite forget thy name But my sad heart must ever mourn Thy ruined hopes thy blighted fame Twas thus I thought an hour ago Even weeping o er that wretch s woe One word turned back my gushing tears And lit my altered eye with sneers Then Bless the friendly dust I said That hides thy unlamented head Vain as thou wert and weak as vain The slave of Falsehood Pride and Pain My heart has nought akin to thine Thy soul is powerless over mine But these were thoughts that vanished too Unwise unholy and untrue Do I despise the timid deer Because his limbs are fleet with fear Or would I mock the wolf s death howl Because his form is gaunt and foul Or hear with joy the leveret s cry Because it cannot bravely die No Then above his memory Let Pity s heart as tender be Say Earth lie lightly on that breast And kind Heaven grant that spirit rest HONOUR S MARTYR The moon is full this winter night The stars are clear though few And every window glistens bright With leaves of frozen dew The sweet moon through your lattice gleams And lights your room like day And there you pass in happy dreams The peaceful hours away While I with effort hardly quelling The anguish in my breast Wander about the silent dwelling And cannot think of rest The old clock in the gloomy hall Ticks on from hour to hour And every time its measured call Seems lingering slow and slower And oh how slow that keen eyed star Has tracked the chilly gray What watching yet how very far The morning lies away Without your chamber door I stand Love are you slumbering still My cold heart underneath my hand Has almost ceased to thrill Bleak bleak the east wind sobs and sighs And drowns the turret bell Whose sad note undistinguished dies Unheard like my farewell To morrow Scorn will blight my name And Hate will trample me Will load me with a coward s shame A traitor s perjury False friends will launch their covert sneers True friends will wish me dead And I shall cause the bitterest tears That you have ever shed The dark deeds of my outlawed race Will then like virtues shine And men will pardon their disgrace Beside the guilt of mine For who forgives the accursed crime Of dastard treachery Rebellion in its chosen time May Freedom s champion be Revenge may stain a righteous sword It may be just to slay But traitor traitor from THAT word All true breasts shrink away Oh I would give my heart to death To keep my honour fair Yet I ll not give my inward faith My honour s NAME to spare Not even to keep your priceless love Dare I Beloved deceive This treason should the future prove Then only then believe I know the path I ought to go I follow fearlessly Inquiring not what deeper woe Stern duty stores for me So foes pursue and cold allies Mistrust me every one Let me be false in others eyes If faithful in my own STANZAS I ll not weep that thou art going to leave me There s nothing lovely here And doubly will the dark world grieve me While thy heart suffers there I ll not weep because the summer s glory Must always end in gloom And follow out the happiest story It closes with a tomb And I am weary of the anguish Increasing winters bear Weary to watch the spirit languish Through years of dead despair So if a tear when thou art dying Should haply fall from me It is but that my soul is sighing To go and rest with thee MY COMFORTER Well hast thou spoken and yet not taught A feeling strange or new Thou hast but roused a latent thought A cloud closed beam of sunshine brought To gleam in open view Deep down concealed within my soul That light lies hid from men Yet glows unquenched though shadows roll Its gentle ray cannot control About the sullen den Was I not vexed in these gloomy ways To walk alone so long Around me wretches uttering praise Or howling o er their hopeless days And each with Frenzy s tongue A brotherhood of misery Their smiles as sad as sighs Whose madness daily maddened me Distorting into agony The bliss before my eyes So stood I in Heaven s glorious sun And in the glare of Hell My spirit drank a mingled tone Of seraph s song and demon s moan What my soul bore my soul alone Within itself may tell Like a soft air above a sea Tossed by the tempest s stir A thaw wind melting quietly The snow drift on some wintry lea No what sweet thing resembles thee My thoughtful Comforter And yet a little longer speak Calm this resentful mood And while the savage heart grows meek For other token do not seek But let the tear upon my cheek Evince my gratitude THE OLD STOIC Riches I hold in light esteem And Love I laugh to scorn And lust of fame was but a dream That vanished with the morn And if I pray the only prayer That moves my lips for me Is Leave the heart that now I bear And give me liberty Yes as my swift days near their goal Tis all that I implore In life and death a chainless soul With courage to endure POEMS BY ACTON BELL A REMINISCENCE Yes thou art gone and never more Thy sunny smile shall gladden me But I may pass the old church door And pace the floor that covers thee May stand upon the cold damp stone And think that frozen lies below The lightest heart that I have known The kindest I shall ever know Yet though I cannot see thee more Tis still a comfort to have seen And though thy transient life is o er Tis sweet to think that thou hast been To think a soul so near divine Within a form so angel fair United to a heart like thine Has gladdened once our humble sphere THE ARBOUR I ll rest me in this sheltered bower And look upon the clear blue sky That smiles upon me through the trees Which stand so thick clustering by And view their green and glossy leaves All glistening in the sunshine fair And list the rustling of their boughs So softly whispering through the air And while my ear drinks in the sound My winged soul shall fly away Reviewing lone departed years As one mild beaming autumn day And soaring on to future scenes Like hills and woods and valleys green All basking in the summer s sun But distant still and dimly seen Oh list tis summer s very breath That gently shakes the rustling trees But look the snow is on the ground How can I think of scenes like these Tis but the FROST that clears the air And gives the sky that lovely blue They re smiling in a WINTER S sun Those evergreens of sombre hue And winter s chill is on my heart How can I dream of future bliss How can my spirit soar away Confined by such a chain as this HOME How brightly glistening in the sun The woodland ivy plays While yonder beeches from their barks Reflect his silver rays That sun surveys a lovely scene From softly smiling skies And wildly through unnumbered trees The wind of winter sighs Now loud it thunders o er my head And now in distance dies But give me back my barren hills Where colder breezes rise Where scarce the scattered stunted trees Can yield an answering swell But where a wilderness of heath Returns the sound as well For yonder garden fair and wide With groves of evergreen Long winding walks and borders trim And velvet lawns between Restore to me that little spot With gray walls compassed round Where knotted grass neglected lies And weeds usurp the ground Though all around this mansion high Invites the foot to roam And though its halls are fair within Oh give me back my HOME VANITAS VANITATUM OMNIA VANITAS In all we do and hear and see Is restless Toil and Vanity While yet the rolling earth abides Men come and go like ocean tides And ere one generation dies Another in its place shall rise THAT sinking soon into the grave Others succeed like wave on wave And as they rise they pass away The sun arises every day And hastening onward to the West He nightly sinks but not to rest Returning to the eastern skies Again to light us he must rise And still the restless wind comes forth Now blowing keenly from the North Now from the South the East the West For ever changing ne er at rest The fountains gushing from the hills Supply the ever running rills The thirsty rivers drink their store And bear it rolling to the shore But still the ocean craves for more Tis endless labour everywhere Sound cannot satisfy the ear Light cannot fill the craving eye Nor riches half our wants supply Pleasure but doubles future pain And joy brings sorrow in her train Laughter is mad and reckless mirth What does she in this weary earth Should Wealth or Fame our Life employ Death comes our labour to destroy To snatch the untasted cup away For which we toiled so many a day What then remains for wretched man To use life s comforts while he can Enjoy the blessings Heaven bestows Assist his friends forgive his foes Trust God and keep His statutes still Upright and firm through good and ill Thankful for all that God has given Fixing his firmest hopes on Heaven Knowing that earthly joys decay But hoping through the darkest day THE PENITENT I mourn with thee and yet rejoice That thou shouldst sorrow so With angel choirs I join my voice To bless the sinner s woe Though friends and kindred turn away And laugh thy grief to scorn I hear the great Redeemer say Blessed are ye that mourn Hold on thy course nor deem it strange That earthly cords are riven Man may lament the wondrous change But there is joy in heaven MUSIC ON CHRISTMAS MORNING Music I love but never strain Could kindle raptures so divine So grief assuage so conquer pain And rouse this pensive heart of mine As that we hear on Christmas morn Upon the wintry breezes borne Though Darkness still her empire keep And hours must pass ere morning break From troubled dreams or slumbers deep That music KINDLY bids us wake It calls us with an angel s voice To wake and worship and rejoice To greet with joy the glorious morn Which angels welcomed long ago When our redeeming Lord was born To bring the light of Heaven below The Powers of Darkness to dispel And rescue Earth from Death and Hell While listening to that sacred strain My raptured spirit soars on high I seem to hear those songs again Resounding through the open sky That kindled such divine delight In those who watched their flocks by night With them I celebrate His birth Glory to God in highest Heaven Good will to men and peace on earth To us a Saviour king is given Our God is come to claim His own And Satan s power is overthrown A sinless God for sinful men Descends to suffer and to bleed Hell MUST renounce its empire then The price is paid the world is freed And Satan s self must now confess That Christ has earned a RIGHT to bless Now holy Peace may smile from heaven And heavenly Truth from earth shall spring The captive s galling bonds are riven For our Redeemer is our king And He that gave his blood for men Will lead us home to God again STANZAS Oh weep not love each tear that springs In those dear eyes of thine To me a keener suffering brings Than if they flowed from mine And do not droop however drear The fate awaiting thee For MY sake combat pain and care And cherish life for me I do not fear thy love will fail Thy faith is true I know But oh my love thy strength is frail For such a life of woe Were t not for this I well could trace Though banished long from thee Life s rugged path and boldly face The storms that threaten me Fear not for me I ve steeled my mind Sorrow and strife to greet Joy with my love I leave behind Care with my friends I meet A mother s sad reproachful eye A father s scowling brow But he may frown and she may sigh I will not break my vow I love my mother I revere My sire but fear not me Believe that Death alone can tear This faithful heart from thee IF THIS BE ALL O God if this indeed be all That Life can show to me If on my aching brow may fall No freshening dew from Thee If with no brighter light than this The lamp of hope may glow And I may only dream of bliss And wake to weary woe If friendship s solace must decay When other joys are gone And love must keep so far away While I go wandering on Wandering and toiling without gain The slave of others will With constant care and frequent pain Despised forgotten still Grieving to look on vice and sin Yet powerless to quell The silent current from within The outward torrent s swell While all the good I would impart The feelings I would share Are driven backward to my heart And turned to wormwood there If clouds must EVER keep from sight The glories of the Sun And I must suffer Winter s blight Ere Summer is begun If Life must be so full of care Then call me soon to thee Or give me strength enough to bear My load of misery MEMORY Brightly the sun of summer shone Green fields and waving woods upon And soft winds wandered by Above a sky of purest blue Around bright flowers of loveliest hue Allured the gazer s eye But what were all these charms to me When one sweet breath of memory Came gently wafting by I closed my eyes against the day And called my willing soul away From earth and air and sky That I might simply fancy there One little flower a primrose fair Just opening into sight As in the days of infancy An opening primrose seemed to me A source of strange delight Sweet Memory ever smile on me Nature s chief beauties spring from thee Oh still thy tribute bring Still make the golden crocus shine Among the flowers the most divine The glory of the spring Still in the wallflower s fragrance dwell And hover round the slight bluebell My childhood s darling flower Smile on the little daisy still The buttercup s bright goblet fill With all thy former power For ever hang thy dreamy spell Round mountain star and heather bell And do not pass away From sparkling frost or wreathed snow And whisper when the wild winds blow Or rippling waters play Is childhood then so all divine Or Memory is the glory thine That haloes thus the past Not ALL divine its pangs of grief Although perchance their stay be brief Are bitter while they last Nor is the glory all thine own For on our earliest joys alone That holy light is cast With such a ray no spell of thine Can make our later pleasures shine Though long ago they passed TO COWPER Sweet are thy strains celestial Bard And oft in childhood s years I ve read them o er and o er again With floods of silent tears The language of my inmost heart I traced in every line MY sins MY sorrows hopes and fears Were there and only mine All for myself the sigh would swell The tear of anguish start I little knew what wilder woe Had filled the Poet s heart I did not know the nights of gloom The days of misery The long long years of dark despair That crushed and tortured thee But they are gone from earth at length Thy gentle soul is pass d And in the bosom of its God Has found its home at last It must be so if God is love And answers fervent prayer Then surely thou shalt dwell on high And I may meet thee there Is He the source of every good The spring of purity Then in thine hours of deepest woe Thy God was still with thee How else when every hope was fled Couldst thou so fondly cling To holy things and help men And how so sweetly sing Of things that God alone could teach And whence that purity That hatred of all sinful ways That gentle charity Are THESE the symptoms of a heart Of heavenly grace bereft For ever banished from its God To Satan s fury left Yet should thy darkest fears be true If Heaven be so severe That such a soul as thine is lost Oh how shall I appear THE DOUBTER S PRAYER Eternal Power of earth and air Unseen yet seen in all around Remote but dwelling everywhere Though silent heard in every sound If e er thine ear in mercy bent When wretched mortals cried to Thee And if indeed Thy Son was sent To save lost sinners such as me Then hear me now while kneeling here I lift to thee my heart and eye And all my soul ascends in prayer OH GIVE ME GIVE ME FAITH I cry Without some glimmering in my heart I could not raise this fervent prayer But oh a stronger light impart And in Thy mercy fix it there While Faith is with me I am blest It turns my darkest night to day But while I clasp it to my breast I often feel it slide away Then cold and dark my spirit sinks To see my light of life depart And every fiend of Hell methinks Enjoys the anguish of my heart What shall I do if all my love My hopes my toil are cast away And if there be no God above To hear and bless me when I pray If this be vain delusion all If death be an eternal sleep And none can hear my secret call Or see the silent tears I weep Oh help me God For thou alone Canst my distracted soul relieve Forsake it not it is thine own Though weak yet longing to believe Oh drive these cruel doubts away And make me know that Thou art God A faith that shines by night and day Will lighten every earthly load If I believe that Jesus died And waking rose to reign above Then surely Sorrow Sin and Pride Must yield to Peace and Hope and Love And all the blessed words He said Will strength and holy joy impart A shield of safety o er my head A spring of comfort in my heart A WORD TO THE ELECT You may rejoice to think YOURSELVES secure You may be grateful for the gift divine That grace unsought which made your black hearts pure And fits your earth born souls in Heaven to shine But is it sweet to look around and view Thousands excluded from that happiness Which they deserved at least as much as you Their faults not greater nor their virtues less And wherefore should you love your God the more Because to you alone his smiles are given Because He chose to pass the MANY o er And only bring the favoured FEW to Heaven And wherefore should your hearts more grateful prove Because for ALL the Saviour did not die Is yours the God of justice and of love And are your bosoms warm with charity Say does your heart expand to all mankind And would you ever to your neighbour do The weak the strong the enlightened and the blind As you would have your neighbour do to you And when you looking on your fellow men Behold them doomed to endless misery How can you talk of joy and rapture then May God withhold such cruel joy from me That none deserve eternal bliss I know Unmerited the grace in mercy given But none shall sink to everlasting woe That have not well deserved the wrath of Heaven And oh there lives within my heart A hope long nursed by me And should its cheering ray depart How dark my soul would be That as in Adam all have died In Christ shall all men live And ever round his throne abide Eternal praise to give That even the wicked shall at last Be fitted for the skies And when their dreadful doom is past To life and light arise I ask not how remote the day Nor what the sinners woe Before their dross is purged away Enough for me to know That when the clip of wrath is drained The metal purified They ll cling to what they once disdained And live by Him that died PAST DAYS Tis strange to think there WAS a time When mirth was not an empty name When laughter really cheered the heart And frequent smiles unbidden came And tears of grief would only flow In sympathy for others woe When speech expressed the inward thought And heart to kindred heart was bare And summer days were far too short For all the pleasures crowded there And silence solitude and rest Now welcome to the weary breast Were all unprized uncourted then And all the joy one spirit showed The other deeply felt again And friendship like a river flowed Constant and strong its silent course For nought withstood its gentle force When night the holy time of peace Was dreaded as the parting hour When speech and mirth at once must cease And silence must resume her power Though ever free from pains and woes She only brought us calm repose And when the blessed dawn again Brought daylight to the blushing skies We woke and not RELUCTANT then To joyless LABOUR did we rise But full of hope and glad and gay We welcomed the returning day THE CONSOLATION Though bleak these woods and damp the ground With fallen leaves so thickly strown And cold the wind that wanders round With wild and melancholy moan There IS a friendly roof I know Might shield me from the wintry blast There is a fire whose ruddy glow Will cheer me for my wanderings past And so though still where er I go Cold stranger glances meet my eye Though when my spirit sinks in woe Unheeded swells the unbidden sigh Though solitude endured too long Bids youthful joys too soon decay Makes mirth a stranger to my tongue And overclouds my noon of day When kindly thoughts that would have way Flow back discouraged to my breast I know there is though far away A home where heart and soul may rest Warm hands are there that clasped in mine The warmer heart will not belie While mirth and truth and friendship shine In smiling lip and earnest eye The ice that gathers round my heart May there be thawed and sweetly then The joys of youth that now depart Will come to cheer my soul again Though far I roam that thought shall be My hope my comfort everywhere While such a home remains to me My heart shall never know despair LINES COMPOSED IN A WOOD ON A WINDY DAY My soul is awakened my spirit is soaring And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze For above and around me the wild wind is roaring Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing The bare trees are tossing their branches on high The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing And hear the wild roar of their thunder to day VIEWS OF LIFE When sinks my heart in hopeless gloom And life can show no joy for me And I behold a yawning tomb Where bowers and palaces should be In vain you talk of morbid dreams In vain you gaily smiling say That what to me so dreary seems The healthy mind deems bright and gay I too have smiled and thought like you But madly smiled and falsely deemed TRUTH led me to the present view I m waking now twas THEN I dreamed I lately saw a sunset sky And stood enraptured to behold Its varied hues of glorious dye First fleecy clouds of shining gold These blushing took a rosy hue Beneath them shone a flood of green Nor less divine the glorious blue That smiled above them and between I cannot name each lovely shade I cannot say how bright they shone But one by one I saw them fade And what remained when they were gone Dull clouds remained of sombre hue And when their borrowed charm was o er The azure sky had faded too That smiled so softly bright before So gilded by the glow of youth Our varied life looks fair and gay And so remains the naked truth When that false light is past away Why blame ye then my keener sight That clearly sees a world of woes Through all the haze of golden light That flattering Falsehood round it throws When the young mother smiles above The first born darling of her heart Her bosom glows with earnest love While tears of silent transport start Fond dreamer little does she know The anxious toil the suffering The blasted hopes the burning woe The object of her joy will bring Her blinded eyes behold not now What soon or late must be his doom The anguish that will cloud his brow The bed of death the dreary tomb As little know the youthful pair In mutual love supremely blest What weariness and cold despair Ere long will seize the aching breast And even should Love and Faith remain The greatest blessings life can show Amid adversity and pain To shine throughout with cheering glow They do not see how cruel Death Comes on their loving hearts to part One feels not now the gasping breath The rending of the earth bound heart The soul s and body s agony Ere she may sink to her repose The sad survivor cannot see The grave above his darling close Nor how despairing and alone He then must wear his life away And linger feebly toiling on And fainting sink into decay Oh Youth may listen patiently While sad Experience tells her tale But Doubt sits smiling in his eye For ardent Hope will still prevail He hears how feeble Pleasure dies By guilt destroyed and pain and woe He turns to Hope and she replies Believe it not it is not so Oh heed her not Experience says For thus she whispered once to me She told me in my youthful days How glorious manhood s prime would be When in the time of early Spring Too chill the winds that o er me pass d She said each coming day would bring a fairer heaven a gentler blast And when the sun too seldom beamed The sky o ercast too darkly frowned The soaking rain too constant streamed And mists too dreary gathered round She told me Summer s glorious ray Would chase those vapours all away And scatter glories round With sweetest music fill the trees Load with rich scent the gentle breeze And strew with flowers the ground But when beneath that scorching ray I languished weary through the day While birds refused to sing Verdure decayed from field and tree And panting Nature mourned with me The freshness of the Spring Wait but a little while she said Till Summer s burning days are fled And Autumn shall restore With golden riches of her own And Summer s glories mellowed down The freshness you deplore And long I waited but in vain That freshness never came again Though Summer passed away Though Autumn s mists hung cold and chill And drooping nature languished still And sank into decay Till wintry blasts foreboding blew Through leafless trees and then I knew That Hope was all a dream But thus fond youth she cheated me And she will prove as false to thee Though sweet her words may seem Stern prophet Cease thy bodings dire Thou canst not quench the ardent fire That warms the breast of youth Oh let it cheer him while it may And gently gently die away Chilled by the damps of truth Tell him that earth is not our rest Its joys are empty frail at best And point beyond the sky But gleams of light may reach us here And hope the ROUGHEST path can cheer Then do not bid it fly Though hope may promise joys that still Unkindly time will ne er fulfil Or if they come at all We never find them unalloyed Hurtful perchance or soon destroyed They vanish or they pall Yet hope ITSELF a brightness throws O er all our labours and our woes While dark foreboding Care A thousand ills will oft portend That Providence may ne er intend The trembling heart to bear Or if they come it oft appears Our woes are lighter than our fears And far more bravely borne Then let us not enhance our doom But e en in midnight s blackest gloom Expect the rising morn Because the road is rough and long Shall we despise the skylark s song That cheers the wanderer s way Or trample down with reckless feet The smiling flowerets bright and sweet Because they soon decay Pass pleasant scenes unnoticed by Because the next is bleak and drear Or not enjoy a smiling sky Because a tempest may be near No while we journey on our way We ll smile on every lovely thing And ever as they pass away To memory and hope we ll cling And though that awful river flows Before us when the journey s past Perchance of all the pilgrim s woes Most dreadful shrink not tis the last Though icy cold and dark and deep Beyond it smiles that blessed shore Where none shall suffer none shall weep And bliss shall reign for evermore APPEAL Oh I am very weary Though tears no longer flow My eyes are tired of weeping My heart is sick of woe My life is very lonely My days pass heavily I m weary of repining Wilt thou not come to me Oh didst thou know my longings For thee from day to day My hopes so often blighted Thou wouldst not thus delay THE STUDENT S SERENADE I have slept upon my couch But my spirit did not rest For the labours of the day Yet my weary soul opprest And before my dreaming eyes Still the learned volumes lay And I could not close their leaves And I could not turn away But I oped my eyes at last And I heard a muffled sound Twas the night breeze come to say That the snow was on the ground Then I knew that there was rest On the mountain s bosom free So I left my fevered couch And I flew to waken thee I have flown to waken thee For if thou wilt not arise Then my soul can drink no peace From these holy moonlight skies And this waste of virgin snow To my sight will not be fair Unless thou wilt smiling come Love to wander with me there Then awake Maria wake For if thou couldst only know How the quiet moonlight sleeps On this wilderness of snow And the groves of ancient trees In their snowy garb arrayed Till they stretch into the gloom Of the distant valley s shade I know thou wouldst rejoice To inhale this bracing air Thou wouldst break thy sweetest sleep To behold a scene so fair O er these wintry wilds ALONE Thou wouldst joy to wander free And it will not please thee less Though that bliss be shared with me THE CAPTIVE DOVE Poor restless dove I pity thee And when I hear thy plaintive moan I mourn for thy captivity And in thy woes forget mine own To see thee stand prepared to fly And flap those useless wings of thine And gaze into the distant sky Would melt a harder heart than mine In vain in vain Thou canst not rise Thy prison roof confines thee there Its slender wires delude thine eyes And quench thy longings with despair Oh thou wert made to wander free In sunny mead and shady grove And far beyond the rolling sea In distant climes at will to rove Yet hadst thou but one gentle mate Thy little drooping heart to cheer And share with thee thy captive state Thou couldst be happy even there Yes even there if listening by One faithful dear companion stood While gazing on her full bright eye Thou mightst forget thy native wood But thou poor solitary dove Must make unheard thy joyless moan The heart that Nature formed to love Must pine neglected and alone SELF CONGRATULATION Ellen you were thoughtless once Of beauty or of grace Simple and homely in attire Careless of form and face Then whence this change and wherefore now So often smoothe your hair And wherefore deck your youthful form With such unwearied care Tell us and cease to tire our ears With that familiar strain Why will you play those simple tunes So often o er again Indeed dear friends I can but say That childhood s thoughts are gone Each year its own new feelings brings And years move swiftly on And for these little simple airs I love to play them o er So much I dare not promise now To play them never more I answered and it was enough They turned them to depart They could not read my secret thoughts Nor see my throbbing heart I ve noticed many a youthful form Upon whose changeful face The inmost workings of the soul The gazer well might trace The speaking eye the changing lip The ready blushing cheek The smiling or beclouded brow Their different feelings speak But thank God you might gaze on mine For hours and never know The secret changes of my soul From joy to keenest woe Last night as we sat round the fire Conversing merrily We heard without approaching steps Of one well known to me There was no trembling in my voice No blush upon my cheek No lustrous sparkle in my eyes Of hope or joy to speak But oh my spirit burned within My heart beat full and fast He came not nigh he went away And then my joy was past And yet my comrades marked it not My voice was still the same They saw me smile and o er my face No signs of sadness came They little knew my hidden thoughts And they will NEVER know The aching anguish of my heart The bitter burning woe FLUCTUATIONS What though the Sun had left my sky To save me from despair The blessed Moon arose on high And shone serenely there I watched her with a tearful gaze Rise slowly o er the hill While through the dim horizon s haze Her light gleamed faint and chill I thought such wan and lifeless beams Could ne er my heart repay For the bright sun s most transient gleams That cheered me through the day But as above that mist s control She rose and brighter shone I felt her light upon my soul But now that light is gone Thick vapours snatched her from my sight And I was darkling left All in the cold and gloomy night Of light and hope bereft Until methought a little star Shone forth with trembling ray To cheer me with its light afar But that too passed away Anon an earthly meteor blazed The gloomy darkness through I smiled yet trembled while I gazed But that soon vanished too And darker drearier fell the night Upon my spirit then But what is that faint struggling light Is it the Moon again Kind Heaven increase that silvery gleam And bid these clouds depart And let her soft celestial beam Restore my fainting heart SELECTIONS FROM THE LITERARY REMAINS OF ELLIS AND ACTON BELL By Currer Bell SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL It would not have been difficult to compile a volume out of the papers left by my sisters had I in making the selection dismissed from my consideration the scruples and the wishes of those whose written thoughts these papers held But this was impossible an influence stronger than could be exercised by any motive of expediency necessarily regulated the selection I have then culled from the mass only a little poem here and there The whole makes but a tiny nosegay and the colour and perfume of the flowers are not such as fit them for festal uses It has been already said that my sisters wrote much in childhood and girlhood Usually it seems a sort of injustice to expose in print the crude thoughts of the unripe mind the rude efforts of the unpractised hand yet I venture to give three little poems of my sister Emily s written in her sixteenth year because they illustrate a point in her character At that period she was sent to school Her previous life with the exception of a single half year had been passed in the absolute retirement of a village parsonage amongst the hills bordering Yorkshire and Lancashire The scenery of these hills is not grand it is not romantic it is scarcely striking Long low moors dark with heath shut in little valleys where a stream waters here and there a fringe of stunted copse Mills and scattered cottages chase romance from these valleys it is only higher up deep in amongst the ridges of the moors that Imagination can find rest for the sole of her foot and even if she finds it there she must be a solitude loving raven no gentle dove If she demand beauty to inspire her she must bring it inborn these moors are too stern to yield any product so delicate The eye of the gazer must ITSELF brim with a purple light intense enough to perpetuate the brief flower flush of August on the heather or the rare sunset smile of June out of his heart must well the freshness that in latter spring and early summer brightens the bracken nurtures the moss and cherishes the starry flowers that spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the moor sheep Unless that light and freshness are innate and self sustained the drear prospect of a Yorkshire moor will be found as barren of poetic as of agricultural interest where the love of wild nature is strong the locality will perhaps be clung to with the more passionate constancy because from the hill lover s self comes half its charm My sister Emily loved the moors Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her out of a sullen hollow in a livid hill side her mind could make an Eden She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights and not the least and best loved was liberty Liberty was the breath of Emily s nostrils without it she perished The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless very secluded but unrestricted and inartificial mode of life to one of disciplined routine though under the kindliest auspices was what she failed in enduring Her nature proved here too strong for her fortitude Every morning when she woke the vision of home and the moors rushed on her and darkened and saddened the day that lay before her Nobody knew what ailed her but me I knew only too well In this struggle her health was quickly broken her white face attenuated form and failing strength threatened rapid decline I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home and with this conviction obtained her recall She had only been three months at school and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on After the age of twenty having meantime studied alone with diligence and perseverance she went with me to an establishment on the Continent the same suffering and conflict ensued heightened by the strong recoil of her upright heretic and English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system Once more she seemed sinking but this time she rallied through the mere force of resolution with inward remorse and shame she looked back on her former failure and resolved to conquer in this second ordeal She did conquer but the victory cost her dear She was never happy till she carried her hard won knowledge back to the remote English village the old parsonage house and desolate Yorkshire hills A very few years more and she looked her last on those hills and breathed her last in that house and under the aisle of that obscure village church found her last lowly resting place Merciful was the decree that spared her when she was a stranger in a strange land and guarded her dying bed with kindred love and congenial constancy The following pieces were composed at twilight in the school room when the leisure of the evening play hour brought back in full tide the thoughts of home I A LITTLE while a little while The weary task is put away And I can sing and I can smile Alike while I have holiday Where wilt thou go my harassed heart What thought what scene invites thee now What spot or near or far apart Has rest for thee my weary brow There is a spot mid barren hills Where winter howls and driving rain But if the dreary tempest chills There is a light that warms again The house is old the trees are bare Moonless above bends twilight s dome But what on earth is half so dear So longed for as the hearth of home The mute bird sitting on the stone The dank moss dripping from the wall The thorn trees gaunt the walks o ergrown I love them how I love them all Still as I mused the naked room The alien firelight died away And from the midst of cheerless gloom I passed to bright unclouded day A little and a lone green lane That opened on a common wide A distant dreamy dim blue chain Of mountains circling every side A heaven so clear an earth so calm So sweet so soft so hushed an air And deepening still the dream like charm Wild moor sheep feeding everywhere THAT was the scene I knew it well I knew the turfy pathway s sweep That winding o er each billowy swell Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep Could I have lingered but an hour It well had paid a week of toil But Truth has banished Fancy s power Restraint and heavy task recoil Even as I stood with raptured eye Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear My hour of rest had fleeted by And back came labour bondage care II THE BLUEBELL The Bluebell is the sweetest flower That waves in summer air Its blossoms have the mightiest power To soothe my spirit s care There is a spell in purple heath Too wildly sadly dear The violet has a fragrant breath But fragrance will not cheer The trees are bare the sun is cold And seldom seldom seen The heavens have lost their zone of gold And earth her robe of green And ice upon the glancing stream Has cast its sombre shade And distant hills and valleys seem In frozen mist arrayed The Bluebell cannot charm me now The heath has lost its bloom The violets in the glen below They yield no sweet perfume But though I mourn the sweet Bluebell Tis better far away I know how fast my tears would swell To see it smile to day For oh when chill the sunbeams fall Adown that dreary sky And gild yon dank and darkened wall With transient brilliancy How do I weep how do I pine For the time of flowers to come And turn me from that fading shine To mourn the fields of home III Loud without the wind was roaring Through th autumnal sky Drenching wet the cold rain pouring Spoke of winter nigh All too like that dreary eve Did my exiled spirit grieve Grieved at first but grieved not long Sweet how softly sweet it came Wild words of an ancient song Undefined without a name It was spring and the skylark was singing Those words they awakened a spell They unlocked a deep fountain whose springing Nor absence nor distance can quell In the gloom of a cloudy November They uttered the music of May They kindled the perishing ember Into fervour that could not decay Awaken o er all my dear moorland West wind in thy glory and pride Oh call me from valley and lowland To walk by the hill torrent s side It is swelled with the first snowy weather The rocks they are icy and hoar And sullenly waves the long heather And the fern leaves are sunny no more There are no yellow stars on the mountain The bluebells have long died away From the brink of the moss bedded fountain From the side of the wintry brae But lovelier than corn fields all waving In emerald and vermeil and gold Are the heights where the north wind is raving And the crags where I wandered of old It was morning the bright sun was beaming How sweetly it brought back to me The time when nor labour nor dreaming Broke the sleep of the happy and free But blithely we rose as the dawn heaven Was melting to amber and blue And swift were the wings to our feet given As we traversed the meadows of dew For the moors For the moors where the short grass Like velvet beneath us should lie For the moors For the moors where each high pass Rose sunny against the clear sky For the moors where the linnet was trilling Its song on the old granite stone Where the lark the wild sky lark was filling Every breast with delight like its own What language can utter the feeling Which rose when in exile afar On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling I saw the brown heath growing there It was scattered and stunted and told me That soon even that would be gone It whispered The grim walls enfold me I have bloomed in my last summer s sun But not the loved music whose waking Makes the soul of the Swiss die away Has a spell more adored and heartbreaking Than for me in that blighted heath lay The spirit which bent neath its power How it longed how it burned to be free If I could have wept in that hour Those tears had been heaven to me Well well the sad minutes are moving Though loaded with trouble and pain And some time the loved and the loving Shall meet on the mountains again The following little piece has no title but in it the Genius of a solitary region seems to address his wandering and wayward votary and to recall within his influence the proud mind which rebelled at times even against what it most loved Shall earth no more inspire thee Thou lonely dreamer now Since passion may not fire thee Shall nature cease to bow Thy mind is ever moving In regions dark to thee Recall its useless roving Come back and dwell with me I know my mountain breezes Enchant and soothe thee still I know my sunshine pleases Despite thy wayward will When day with evening blending Sinks from the summer sky I ve seen thy spirit bending In fond idolatry I ve watched thee every hour I know my mighty sway I know my magic power To drive thy griefs away Few hearts to mortals given On earth so wildly pine Yet few would ask a heaven More like this earth than thine Then let my winds caress thee Thy comrade let me be Since nought beside can bless thee Return and dwell with me Here again is the same mind in converse with a like abstraction The Night Wind breathing through an open window has visited an ear which discerned language in its whispers THE NIGHT WIND In summer s mellow midnight A cloudless moon shone through Our open parlour window And rose trees wet with dew I sat in silent musing The soft wind waved my hair It told me heaven was glorious And sleeping earth was fair I needed not its breathing To bring such thoughts to me But still it whispered lowly How dark the woods will be The thick leaves in my murmur Are rustling like a dream And all their myriad voices Instinct with spirit seem I said Go gentle singer Thy wooing voice is kind But do not think its music Has power to reach my mind Play with the scented flower The young tree s supple bough And leave my human feelings In their own course to flow The wanderer would not heed me Its kiss grew warmer still O come it sighed so sweetly I ll win thee gainst thy will Were we not friends from childhood Have I not loved thee long As long as thou the solemn night Whose silence wakes my song And when thy heart is resting Beneath the church aisle stone I shall have time for mourning And THOU for being alone In these stanzas a louder gale has roused the sleeper on her pillow the wakened soul struggles to blend with the storm by which it is swayed Ay there it is it wakes to night Deep feelings I thought dead Strong in the blast quick gathering light The heart s flame kindles red Now I can tell by thine altered cheek And by thine eyes full gaze And by the words thou scarce dost speak How wildly fancy plays Yes I could swear that glorious wind Has swept the world aside Has dashed its memory from thy mind Like foam bells from the tide And thou art now a spirit pouring Thy presence into all The thunder of the tempest s roaring The whisper of its fall An universal influence From thine own influence free A principle of life intense Lost to mortality Thus truly when that breast is cold Thy prisoned soul shall rise The dungeon mingle with the mould The captive with the skies Nature s deep being thine shall hold Her spirit all thy spirit fold Her breath absorb thy sighs Mortal though soon life s tale is told Who once lives never dies LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP Love is like the wild rose briar Friendship like the holly tree The holly is dark when the rose briar blooms But which will bloom most constantly The wild rose briar is sweet in spring Its summer blossoms scent the air Yet wait till winter comes again And who will call the wild briar fair Then scorn the silly rose wreath now And deck thee with the holly s sheen That when December blights thy brow He still may leave thy garland green THE ELDER S REBUKE Listen When your hair like mine Takes a tint of silver gray When your eyes with dimmer shine Watch life s bubbles float away When you young man have borne like me The weary weight of sixty three Then shall penance sore be paid For those hours so wildly squandered And the words that now fall dead On your ear be deeply pondered Pondered and approved at last But their virtue will be past Glorious is the prize of Duty Though she be a serious power Treacherous all the lures of Beauty Thorny bud and poisonous flower Mirth is but a mad beguiling Of the golden gifted time Love a demon meteor wiling Heedless feet to gulfs of crime Those who follow earthly pleasure Heavenly knowledge will not lead Wisdom hides from them her treasure Virtue bids them evil speed Vainly may their hearts repenting Seek for aid in future years Wisdom scorned knows no relenting Virtue is not won by fears Thus spake the ice blooded elder gray The young man scoffed as he turned away Turned to the call of a sweet lute s measure Waked by the lightsome touch of pleasure Had he ne er met a gentler teacher Woe had been wrought by that pitiless preacher THE WANDERER FROM THE FOLD How few of all the hearts that loved Are grieving for thee now And why should mine to night be moved With such a sense of woe Too often thus when left alone Where none my thoughts can see Comes back a word a passing tone From thy strange history Sometimes I seem to see thee rise A glorious child again All virtues beaming from thine eyes That ever honoured men Courage and truth a generous breast Where sinless sunshine lay A being whose very presence blest Like gladsome summer day O fairly spread thy early sail And fresh and pure and free Was the first impulse of the gale Which urged life s wave for thee Why did the pilot too confiding Dream o er that ocean s foam And trust in Pleasure s careless guiding To bring his vessel home For well he knew what dangers frowned What mists would gather dim What rocks and shelves and sands lay round Between his port and him The very brightness of the sun The splendour of the main The wind which bore him wildly on Should not have warned in vain An anxious gazer from the shore I marked the whitening wave And wept above thy fate the more Because I could not save It recks not now when all is over But yet my heart will be A mourner still though friend and lover Have both forgotten thee WARNING AND REPLY In the earth the earth thou shalt be laid A grey stone standing over thee Black mould beneath thee spread And black mould to cover thee Well there is rest there So fast come thy prophecy The time when my sunny hair Shall with grass roots entwined be But cold cold is that resting place Shut out from joy and liberty And all who loved thy living face Will shrink from it shudderingly Not so HERE the world is chill And sworn friends fall from me But THERE they will own me still And prize my memory Farewell then all that love All that deep sympathy Sleep on Heaven laughs above Earth never misses thee Turf sod and tombstone drear Part human company One heart breaks only here But that heart was worthy thee LAST WORDS I knew not twas so dire a crime To say the word Adieu But this shall be the only time My lips or heart shall sue That wild hill side the winter morn The gnarled and ancient tree If in your breast they waken scorn Shall wake the same in me I can forget black eyes and brows And lips of falsest charm If you forget the sacred vows Those faithless lips could form If hard commands can tame your love Or strongest walls can hold I would not wish to grieve above A thing so false and cold And there are bosoms bound to mine With links both tried and strong And there are eyes whose lightning shine Has warmed and blest me long Those eyes shall make my only day Shall set my spirit free And chase the foolish thoughts away That mourn your memory THE LADY TO HER GUITAR For him who struck thy foreign string I ween this heart has ceased to care Then why dost thou such feelings bring To my sad spirit old Guitar It is as if the warm sunlight In some deep glen should lingering stay When clouds of storm or shades of night Have wrapt the parent orb away It is as if the glassy brook Should image still its willows fair Though years ago the woodman s stroke Laid low in dust their Dryad hair Even so Guitar thy magic tone Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh Hath bid the ancient torrent moan Although its very source is dry THE TWO CHILDREN Heavy hangs the rain drop From the burdened spray Heavy broods the damp mist On uplands far away Heavy looms the dull sky Heavy rolls the sea And heavy throbs the young heart Beneath that lonely tree Never has a blue streak Cleft the clouds since morn Never has his grim fate Smiled since he was born Frowning on the infant Shadowing childhood s joy Guardian angel knows not That melancholy boy Day is passing swiftly Its sad and sombre prime Boyhood sad is merging In sadder manhood s time All the flowers are praying For sun before they close And he prays too unconscious That sunless human rose Blossom that the west wind Has never wooed to blow Scentless are thy petals Thy dew is cold as snow Soul where kindred kindness No early promise woke Barren is thy beauty As weed upon a rock Wither soul and blossom You both were vainly given Earth reserves no blessing For the unblest of heaven Child of delight with sun bright hair And sea blue sea deep eyes Spirit of bliss What brings thee here Beneath these sullen skies Thou shouldst live in eternal spring Where endless day is never dim Why Seraph has thine erring wing Wafted thee down to weep with him Ah not from heaven am I descended Nor do I come to mingle tears But sweet is day though with shadows blended And though clouded sweet are youthful years I the image of light and gladness Saw and pitied that mournful boy And I vowed if need were to share his sadness And give to him my sunny joy Heavy and dark the night is closing Heavy and dark may its biding be Better for all from grief reposing And better for all who watch like me Watch in love by a fevered pillow Cooling the fever with pity s balm Safe as the petrel on tossing billow Safe in mine own soul s golden calm Guardian angel he lacks no longer Evil fortune he need not fear Fate is strong but love is stronger And MY love is truer than angel care THE VISIONARY Silent is the house all are laid asleep One alone looks out o er the snow wreaths deep Watching every cloud dreading every breeze That whirls the wildering drift and bends the groaning trees Cheerful is the hearth soft the matted floor Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door The little lamp burns straight its rays shoot strong and far I trim it well to be the wanderer s guiding star Frown my haughty sire chide my angry dame Set your slaves to spy threaten me with shame But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow What I love shall come like visitant of air Safe in secret power from lurking human snare What loves me no word of mine shall e er betray Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay Burn then little lamp glimmer straight and clear Hush a rustling wing stirs methinks the air He for whom I wait thus ever comes to me Strange Power I trust thy might trust thou my constancy ENCOURAGEMENT I do not weep I would not weep Our mother needs no tears Dry thine eyes too tis vain to keep This causeless grief for years What though her brow be changed and cold Her sweet eyes closed for ever What though the stone the darksome mould Our mortal bodies sever What though her hand smooth ne er again Those silken locks of thine Nor through long hours of future pain Her kind face o er thee shine Remember still she is not dead She sees us sister now Laid where her angel spirit fled Mid heath and frozen snow And from that world of heavenly light Will she not always bend To guide us in our lifetime s night And guard us to the end Thou knowest she will and thou mayst mourn That WE are left below But not that she can ne er return To share our earthly woe STANZAS Often rebuked yet always back returning To those first feelings that were born with me And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning For idle dreams of things which cannot be To day I will seek not the shadowy region Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear And visions rising legion after legion Bring the unreal world too strangely near I ll walk but not in old heroic traces And not in paths of high morality And not among the half distinguished faces The clouded forms of long past history I ll walk where my own nature would be leading It vexes me to choose another guide Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side What have those lonely mountains worth revealing More glory and more grief than I can tell The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell The following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote No coward soul is mine No trembler in the world s storm troubled sphere I see Heaven s glories shine And faith shines equal arming me from fear O God within my breast Almighty ever present Deity Life that in me has rest As I undying Life have power in thee Vain are the thousand creeds That move men s hearts unutterably vain Worthless as withered weeds Or idlest froth amid the boundless main To waken doubt in one Holding so fast by thine infinity So surely anchored on The stedfast rock of immortality With wide embracing love Thy spirit animates eternal years Pervades and broods above Changes sustains dissolves creates and rears Though earth and man were gone And suns and universes ceased to be And Thou were left alone Every existence would exist in Thee There is not room for Death Nor atom that his might could render void Thou THOU art Being and Breath And what THOU art may never be destroyed SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ACTON BELL In looking over my sister Anne s papers I find mournful evidence that religious feeling had been to her but too much like what it was to Cowper I mean of course in a far milder form Without rendering her a prey to those horrors that defy concealment it subdued her mood and bearing to a perpetual pensiveness the pillar of a cloud glided constantly before her eyes she ever waited at the foot of a secret Sinai listening in her heart to the voice of a trumpet sounding long and waxing louder Some perhaps would rejoice over these tokens of sincere though sorrowing piety in a deceased relative I own to me they seem sad as if her whole innocent life had been passed under the martyrdom of an unconfessed physical pain their effect indeed would be too distressing were it not combated by the certain knowledge that in her last moments this tyranny of a too tender conscience was overcome this pomp of terrors broke up and passing away left her dying hour unclouded Her belief in God did not then bring to her dread as of a stern Judge but hope as in a Creator and Saviour and no faltering hope was it but a sure and stedfast conviction on which in the rude passage from Time to Eternity she threw the weight of her human weakness and by which she was enabled to bear what was to be borne patiently serenely victoriously DESPONDENCY I have gone backward in the work The labour has not sped Drowsy and dark my spirit lies Heavy and dull as lead How can I rouse my sinking soul From such a lethargy How can I break these iron chains And set my spirit free There have been times when I have mourned In anguish o er the past And raised my suppliant hands on high While tears fell thick and fast And prayed to have my sins forgiven With such a fervent zeal An earnest grief a strong desire As now I cannot feel And I have felt so full of love So strong in spirit then As if my heart would never cool Or wander back again And yet alas how many times My feet have gone astray How oft have I forgot my God How greatly fallen away My sins increase my love grows cold And Hope within me dies Even Faith itself is wavering now Oh how shall I arise I cannot weep but I can pray Then let me not despair Lord Jesus save me lest I die Christ hear my humble prayer A PRAYER My God oh let me call Thee mine Weak wretched sinner though I be My trembling soul would fain be Thine My feeble faith still clings to Thee Not only for the Past I grieve The Future fills me with dismay Unless Thou hasten to relieve Thy suppliant is a castaway I cannot say my faith is strong I dare not hope my love is great But strength and love to Thee belong Oh do not leave me desolate I know I owe my all to Thee Oh TAKE the heart I cannot give Do Thou my strength my Saviour be And MAKE me to Thy glory live IN MEMORY OF A HAPPY DAY IN FEBRUARY Blessed be Thou for all the joy My soul has felt to day Oh let its memory stay with me And never pass away I was alone for those I loved Were far away from me The sun shone on the withered grass The wind blew fresh and free Was it the smile of early spring That made my bosom glow Twas sweet but neither sun nor wind Could cheer my spirit so Was it some feeling of delight All vague and undefined No twas a rapture deep and strong Expanding in the mind Was it a sanguine view of life And all its transient bliss A hope of bright prosperity Oh no it was not this It was a glimpse of truth divine Unto my spirit given Illumined by a ray of light That shone direct from heaven I felt there was a God on high By whom all things were made I saw His wisdom and His power In all his works displayed But most throughout the moral world I saw his glory shine I saw His wisdom infinite His mercy all divine Deep secrets of His providence In darkness long concealed Unto the vision of my soul Were graciously revealed But while I wondered and adored His Majesty divine I did not tremble at His power I felt that God was mine I knew that my Redeemer lived I did not fear to die Full sure that I should rise again To immortality I longed to view that bliss divine Which eye hath never seen Like Moses I would see His face Without the veil between CONFIDENCE Oppressed with sin and woe A burdened heart I bear Opposed by many a mighty foe But I will not despair With this polluted heart I dare to come to Thee Holy and mighty as Thou art For Thou wilt pardon me I feel that I am weak And prone to every sin But Thou who giv saint to those who seek Wilt give me strength within Far as this earth may be From yonder starry skies Remoter still am I from Thee Yet Thou wilt not despise I need not fear my foes I deed not yield to care I need not sink beneath my woes For Thou wilt answer prayer In my Redeemer s name I give myself to Thee And all unworthy as I am My God will cherish me My sister Anne had to taste the cup of life as it is mixed for the class termed Governesses The following are some of the thoughts that now and then solace a governess LINES WRITTEN FROM HOME Though bleak these woods and damp the ground With fallen leaves so thickly strewn And cold the wind that wanders round With wild and melancholy moan There is a friendly roof I know Might shield me from the wintry blast There is a fire whose ruddy glow Will cheer me for my wanderings past And so though still where er I go Cold stranger glances meet my eye Though when my spirit sinks in woe Unheeded swells the unbidden sigh Though solitude endured too long Bids youthful joys too soon decay Makes mirth a stranger to my tongue And overclouds my noon of day When kindly thoughts that would have way Flow back discouraged to my breast I know there is though far away A home where heart and soul may rest Warm hands are there that clasped in mine The warmer heart will not belie While mirth and truth and friendship shine In smiling lip and earnest eye The ice that gathers round my heart May there be thawed and sweetly then The joys of youth that now depart Will come to cheer my soul again Though far I roam that thought shall be My hope my comfort everywhere While such a home remains to me My heart shall never know despair THE NARROW WAY Believe not those who say The upward path is smooth Lest thou shouldst stumble in the way And faint before the truth It is the only road Unto the realms of joy But he who seeks that blest abode Must all his powers employ Bright hopes and pure delight Upon his course may beam And there amid the sternest heights The sweetest flowerets gleam On all her breezes borne Earth yields no scents like those But he that dares not gasp the thorn Should never crave the rose Arm arm thee for the fight Cast useless loads away Watch through the darkest hours of night Toil through the hottest day Crush pride into the dust Or thou must needs be slack And trample down rebellious lust Or it will hold thee back Seek not thy honour here Waive pleasure and renown The world s dread scoff undaunted bear And face its deadliest frown To labour and to love To pardon and endure To lift thy heart to God above And keep thy conscience pure Be this thy constant aim Thy hope thy chief delight What matter who should whisper blame Or who should scorn or slight What matter if thy God approve And if within thy breast Thou feel the comfort of His love The earnest of His rest DOMESTIC PEACE Why should such gloomy silence reign And why is all the house so drear When neither danger sickness pain Nor death nor want have entered here We are as many as we were That other night when all were gay And full of hope and free from care Yet is there something gone away The moon without as pure and calm Is shining as that night she shone But now to us she brings no balm For something from our hearts is gone Something whose absence leaves a void A cheerless want in every heart Each feels the bliss of all destroyed And mourns the change but each apart The fire is burning in the grate As redly as it used to burn But still the hearth is desolate Till mirth and love and PEACE return Twas PEACE that flowed from heart to heart With looks and smiles that spoke of heaven And gave us language to impart The blissful thoughts itself had given Domestic peace best joy of earth When shall we all thy value learn White angel to our sorrowing hearth Return oh graciously return THE THREE GUIDES First published in FRASER S MAGAZINE Spirit of Earth thy hand is chill I ve felt its icy clasp And shuddering I remember still That stony hearted grasp Thine eye bids love and joy depart Oh turn its gaze from me It presses down my shrinking heart I will not walk with thee Wisdom is mine I ve heard thee say Beneath my searching eye All mist and darkness melt away Phantoms and fables fly Before me truth can stand alone The naked solid truth And man matured by worth will own If I am shunned by youth Firm is my tread and sure though slow My footsteps never slide And he that follows me shall know I am the surest guide Thy boast is vain but were it true That thou couldst safely steer Life s rough and devious pathway through Such guidance I should fear How could I bear to walk for aye With eyes to earthward prone O er trampled weeds and miry clay And sand and flinty stone Never the glorious view to greet Of hill and dale and sky To see that Nature s charms are sweet Or feel that Heaven is nigh If in my heart arose a spring A gush of thought divine At once stagnation thou wouldst bring With that cold touch of thine If glancing up I sought to snatch But one glimpse of the sky My baffled gaze would only catch Thy heartless cold grey eye If to the breezes wandering near I listened eagerly And deemed an angel s tongue to hear That whispered hope to me That heavenly music would be drowned In thy harsh droning voice Nor inward thought nor sight nor sound Might my sad soul rejoice Dull is thine ear unheard by thee The still small voice of Heaven Thine eyes are dim and cannot see The helps that God has given There is a bridge o er every flood Which thou canst not perceive A path through every tangled wood But thou wilt not believe Striving to make thy way by force Toil spent and bramble torn Thou lieutenant fell the tree that checks thy course And burst through brier and thorn And pausing by the river s side Poor reasoner thou wilt deem By casting pebbles in its tide To cross the swelling stream Right through the flinty rock thou lieutenant try Thy toilsome way to bore Regardless of the pathway nigh That would conduct thee o er Not only art thou then unkind And freezing cold to me But unbelieving deaf and blind I will not walk with thee Spirit of Pride thy wings are strong Thine eyes like lightning shine Ecstatic joys to thee belong And powers almost divine But tis a false destructive blaze Within those eyes I see Turn hence their fascinating gaze I will not follow thee Coward and fool thou mayst reply Walk on the common sod Go trace with timid foot and eye The steps by others trod Tis best the beaten path to keep The ancient faith to hold To pasture with thy fellow sheep And lie within the fold Cling to the earth poor grovelling worm Tis not for thee to soar Against the fury of the storm Amid the thunder s roar There s glory in that daring strife Unknown undreamt by thee There s speechless rapture in the life Of those who follow me Yes I have seen thy votaries oft Upheld by thee their guide In strength and courage mount aloft The steepy mountain side I ve seen them stand against the sky And gazing from below Beheld thy lightning in their eye Thy triumph on their brow Oh I have felt what glory then What transport must be theirs So far above their fellow men Above their toils and cares Inhaling Nature s purest breath Her riches round them spread The wide expanse of earth beneath Heaven s glories overhead But I have seen them helpless dash d Down to a bloody grave And still thy ruthless eye has flash d Thy strong hand did not save I ve seen some o er the mountain s brow Sustain d awhile by thee O er rocks of ice and hills of snow Bound fearless wild and free Bold and exultant was their mien While thou didst cheer them on But evening fell and then I ween Their faithless guide was gone Alas how fared thy favourites then Lone helpless weary cold Did ever wanderer find again The path he left of old Where is their glory where the pride That swelled their hearts before Where now the courage that defied The mightiest tempest s roar What shall they do when night grows black When angry storms arise Who now will lead them to the track Thou taught saint them to despise Spirit of Pride it needs not this To make me shun thy wiles Renounce thy triumph and thy bliss Thy honours and thy smiles Bright as thou art and bold and strong That fierce glance wins not me And I abhor thy scoffing tongue I will not follow thee Spirit of Faith be thou my guide O clasp my hand in thine And let me never quit thy side Thy comforts are divine Earth calls thee blind misguided one But who can shew like thee Forgotten things that have been done And things that are to be Secrets conceal d from Nature s ken Who like thee can declare Or who like thee to erring men God s holy will can bear Pride scorns thee for thy lowly mien But who like thee can rise Above this toilsome sordid scene Beyond the holy skies Meek is thine eye and soft thy voice But wondrous is thy might To make the wretched soul rejoice To give the simple light And still to all that seek thy way This magic power is given E en while their footsteps press the clay Their souls ascend to heaven Danger surrounds them pain and woe Their portion here must be But only they that trust thee know What comfort dwells with thee Strength to sustain their drooping pow rs And vigour to defend Thou pole star of my darkest hours Affliction s firmest friend Day does not always mark our way Night s shadows oft appal But lead me and I cannot stray Hold me I shall not fall Sustain me I shall never faint How rough soe er may be My upward road nor moan nor plaint Shall mar my trust in thee Narrow the path by which we go And oft it turns aside From pleasant meads where roses blow And peaceful waters glide Where flowery turf lies green and soft And gentle gales are sweet To where dark mountains frown aloft Hard rocks distress the feet Deserts beyond lie bleak and bare And keen winds round us blow But if thy hand conducts me there The way is right I know I have no wish to turn away My spirit does not quail How can it while I hear thee say Press forward and prevail Even above the tempest s swell I hear thy voice of love Of hope and peace I hear thee tell And that blest home above Through pain and death I can rejoice If but thy strength be mine Earth hath no music like thy voice Life owns no joy like thine Spirit of Faith I ll go with thee Thou if I hold thee fast Wilt guide defend and strengthen me And bear me home at last By thy help all things I can do In thy strength all things bear Teach me for thou art just and true Smile on me thou art fair I have given the last memento of my sister Emily this is the last of my sister Anne I hoped that with the brave and strong My portioned task might lie To toil amid the busy throng With purpose pure and high But God has fixed another part And He has fixed it well I said so with my bleeding heart When first the anguish fell Thou God hast taken our delight Our treasured hope away Thou bid saint us now weep through the night And sorrow through the day These weary hours will not be lost These days of misery These nights of darkness anguish tost Can I but turn to Thee With secret labour to sustain In humble patience every blow To gather fortitude from pain And hope and holiness from woe Thus let me serve Thee from my heart Whate er may be my written fate Whether thus early to depart Or yet a while to wait If Thou shouldst bring me back to life More humbled I should be More wise more strengthened for the strife More apt to lean on Thee Should death be standing at the gate Thus should I keep my vow But Lord whatever be my fate Oh let me serve Thee now These lines written the desk was closed the pen laid aside for ever End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems by AKA Charlotte Emily and Anne Bronte Currer Ellis and
